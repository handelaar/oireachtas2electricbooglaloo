      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the strategy document recently launched by him on the International Financial Services Centre and the role his Department will play in implementing and monitoring the strategy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I launched the Government's strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland on Monday, 1 March. Copies of the strategy have been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The IFSC is now established as a successful and reputable financial centre. More than 6,500 people are employed directly in the centre and in associated back office projects. The creation of a vibrant financial services industry has also helped to reposition Ireland as a centre for knowledge-based industries.</P>
      <P>The IFSC is now facing into a period of change. In particular, the corporation tax agreement with the European Commission will fundamentally change the nature of the IFSC as the preferential tax regime will no longer apply with the introduction of an across the board 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax. The introduction of the euro and advances in technology will also impact on the centre.</P>
      <P>In the light of these factors, it is necessary for the Government to articulate and implement a new vision for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy sets out this vision and an implementation plan based on 19 priorities which include holding a seminar in June to launch the new vision and promoting the docklands as the hub for the longer-term development of the industry in Ireland. The location of back office activity elsewhere will also be facilitated where necessary to maintain competitiveness; the docklands authority will implement a development <Col N="406" /> strategy for accommodation and infrastructure for international financial services in the docklands area; IDA Ireland will implement a revised marketing plan for the promotion of the industry; measures will be taken in response to the education and training needs of IFSC companies; taxation issues affecting the industry will be addressed having regard to EU and domestic constraints; company law will be amended to improve the competitive position of the industry; measures are being introduced to eliminate the inappropriate use of IRNR companies; a proactive approach to ensure Ireland is well placed to capitalise on opportunities for electronic commerce in financial services; and new development opportunities will be pursued.</P>
    <P>The strategy was prepared through the IFSC clearing house group and working groups in my Department. These groups bring together industry representatives with the different Departments and agencies involved. While implementation of individual commitments remains a matter for each responsible Department or agency, a public sector group chaired by my Department has been convened to co-ordinate and monitor progress. The IFSC clearing house group will submit a progress report on implementation of the strategy to the Government at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Are firms in the IFSC experiencing difficulties in recruiting Irish personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have certainly not highlighted that issue to me. In some areas of the economy there are skills shortages. For some years IFSC companies have targeted senior people abroad who are mainly &ndash; though not always &ndash; Irish. Recently when I was in California I saw advertisements from IFSC companies seeking Irish people who live there. I have been in the IFSC at least ten times this year and the companies there have not highlighted any critical position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach assure me that firms located in the IFSC have not been advised informally by the Irish authorities that they should not seek to recruit in Ireland in particular skills categories as this might drive up the salary levels in those specialities to the disadvantage of existing Irish financial institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of that. Private sector companies, particularly in the financial sector, are known to use fairly aggressive marketing tactics, even in bad times, to source employees from competitors. This is not new and is certainly not bad &ndash; it gives people opportunities to advance their careers. Clearly, there are skills shortages in the economy, including in some senior areas, but I do not think the IFSC is having anything other than the normal problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it would be wrong for statutory authorities to advise <Col N="407" /> companies coming to the IFSC that they should recruit in areas other than Ireland, for fear recruiting in Ireland might cause difficulties for existing operators in terms of driving up salary levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong as we have a great number of young people who are still not paid enormous salaries in the financial services sector. We tend to hear about the most senior positions which are highly paid. However, while people are well paid in the financial services sector, in general I do not believe the pay rates are exorbitant and people are always trying to improve themselves. This is the way it should be in a good economy. It would be wrong to tell companies they should not employ Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make inquiries to ensure the scenario I described does not happen, as I have received information to the effect that it has occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will. I glean from what Deputy Bruton has said that he has some information. I would find it extraordinary and unnecessary if Irish agencies were saying what he has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the IFSC requiring that only front office facilities be located in Dublin and that back offices can be located anywhere? What is the basis for the distinction between front and back office employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position is that the compulsion which previously existed will no longer apply, and certainly will not apply when the various arrangements concerning tax rates pertaining to location of services in the docklands are introduced. The strategy report tries to ensure the hub of activity for financial services will be located there.</P>
      <P>There are opportunities for many back office industries to locate elsewhere. The Government, the centre and the agencies are anxious that these should be located anywhere around the country and not in expensive offices. Both I and my Government colleagues, and I am sure everyone in the House agrees that we should, where possible, locate these around the country given the development of technology. That is the thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his initial reply referred to the docklands becoming a hub for the financial services industry and further referred to the Docklands Development Authority, which is the landlord for the IFSC. Is the Taoiseach satisfied the authority is receiving the support it requires from Government Departments and agencies? Is he satisfied with the progress of the authority since it was incorporated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the work of the authority which has excellent expansion plans <Col N="408" /> and which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government supports. I attended a number of meetings with the authority in recent months. It is trying to progress developments as much as possible. It wants to see action, especially for its social housing proposals, and has pressed some agencies to achieve that. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been more involved than have I and has supported the authority's efforts to assist it in achieving its ambitious plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has one representative on the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights. The committee, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, considers all aspects of Ireland's international human rights obligations. It focuses on the implications for domestic policy of the commitments given by the State in ratifying major international human rights instruments. All Departments are invited to be represented on the committee because of the broad scope of human rights. This, together with the importance I accord to keeping up to date on developments in the area, is the reason my Department is represented.</P>
      <P>The inaugural meeting was held on 18 February 1997 and the committee has met on five occasions since, most recently on 16 March last. The committee is concerned with the timely preparation of comprehensive national reports under international instruments already ratified. It also seeks to expedite the necessary legislation for the ratification of additional instruments. The committee is preparing for the examination of Ireland's first report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights before the relevant UN committee in Geneva in May. The committee also plays an important role as a forum for co-ordination and co-operation between Departments on human rights issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the committee asked to give an opinion concerning the draft legislation prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of our obligation under the Good Friday Agreement to implement a human rights commission? If it was asked to give <Col N="409" /> an opinion, did it express a view in respect of Ireland's requirement or on the desirability of incorporating into domestic law the European Convention on Human Rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It discussed and considered the human rights aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. I do not have a draft of the proposals put forward, but it was involved in consideration of the implications and in the work done following it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying the only interdepartmental committee of the Government on human rights was not specifically communicated with or requested to offer a view on domestic legislation regarding human rights? Is the background information that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not bother to contact the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying the opposite, that the committee, which deals with the domestic situation, was contacted and was involved in the human rights implications of the Good Friday Agreement, especially the setting up of human rights commissions in both parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was a review offered in respect of the draft legislation before the committees of this House and did it include a recommendation that the country should incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law, as the UK has done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a report of what the committee said on the legislation, but it had a full input into its preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the problem lie in incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law and in what respects is the convention in conflict with the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been discussed for a considerable time. The legislation being prepared is based on the constitutional position and is the best legislation we can propose at this time. It was considered at length and I hope it is satisfactory. It has also been discussed on the basis of what is happening with the British legislation. I do not, therefore, believe there is a difficulty with our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying there is not an Article in the Constitution which is in conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights and that therefore the convention can be incorporated <i>in toto</i> in domestic law without any contradiction occurring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Deputy Quinn asked why we have proceeded in the manner we have. We have done so because of the advice afforded us. The legislation we have pre<Col N="410" /> pared and before the committees takes account of the constitutional position as advised by the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In what area of the Constitution is there a conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights? What aspect of the convention is in conflict with the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That question requires a detailed reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reasonable question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be reasonable if the Deputy gave me notice of it. In the discussions on the Bill we had taken into account the constitutional position and the advice of the Attorney General. The legislation was drafted on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach not negotiate this as part of the Good Friday Agreement? He has admitted there is a contradiction between the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution. Does he know what it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I negotiated this matter I did not draft the legislation and while I received various submissions on how it should be done, I did not compile the legal report of the Attorney General into the matter, where he spelt out the differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A member of the Taoiseach's Department was on this interdepartmental committee and his Department was central to the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. Does the Taoiseach agree that the Agreement requires us to establish a human rights commission? My party drafted legislation which proposed<i> inter alia</i> that the incorporation into domestic law of the European Convention on Human Rights would be desirable. Notwithstanding that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform chose to refuse to admit this. Was the member of the Taoiseach's Department who was a member of this committee involved at any stage in communicating to him the desirability or otherwise of such an incorporation into domestic legislation? Alternatively did that committee offer an explicit view in the normal process of consultation to the drafting of the heads of the legislation which are now before a committee of this House and did that view include a specific recommendation that the incorporation of the convention should form part of our domestic law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a detailed question to me today on what happened during the drafting of that legislation. Had there been I would have answered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was discussed and proposals were submitted to the committee for its <Col N="411" /> views. It was part of what the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was doing. I do not have with me the report of the committee's views although I saw that report. I also saw the Attorney General's view on what could and could not be accepted. However, I am not prepared to guess on either of those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite surprised the Taoiseach does not have this basic information about a contradiction between a European convention and the Constitution, both of which documents have existed for longer than he has been in politics. Does the contradiction between the convention and the Constitution relate to abortion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of moneys made available from the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust in the 1988 and 1992 periods, approximately £2.65 million <Col N="412" /> was allocated to 24 separate projects, including an allocation of £1.1 million to the RNLI and £1 million towards the restoration of the Shannon Erne Waterway.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the winding up of the trust, a further £1.5 million approximately has been made available to be disbursed under the terms of the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988. Commitments have already been entered into amounting to £343,762. Of this, £150,000 was allocated to the Peace Park at Messines, Belgium; £180,000 to the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool; and £13,762 towards the Irish Peace Bell at Messines. Just over £1.1 million remains for allocation to applicants who responded to advertisements placed by my Department. The closing date for receipt of applications was 15 December 1998.</P>
    <P>An assessment committee, comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance was established to make recommendations to me regarding the disbursement of the funds from the trust. I expect to receive the recommendations of the committee shortly and to be in a position to make an announcement of successful applications soon thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>By what amount does the sum of the value of the applications exceed the amount of the money available, namely £1.1 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the precise figure but it is a substantial. There are more than 175 applications, some of which seek substantial amounts of money. I am afraid the demands exceed considerably the £1.1 million available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What criteria are being used by the Government in making its final decision on the committee's recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria is the same criteria as in earlier periods to make sure that these projects were relevant to the purpose of the fund. The committee was anxious to follow some of the old rules of the trusts, that they would be cross-Border projects, projects relating to peace and education, and community projects which relate to care. There are a number of applications from homes, institutions and organisations where soldiers received health care or treatment, and from facilities which they still use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the title of the trust and the function of the hospital in Leopardstown, would the Taoiseach agree it is eminently qualified to benefit from the proceeds and, therefore, notwithstanding the validity of any other applications or their bona fides, this body is uniquely well placed to draw down funds? Does he think five months is quite a long time for this process of evaluation? When will a decision be made so that the people, who have written not just to him <Col N="413" /> but to others will be in a position to proceed and make their plans?</P>

      <P>Yes, and that will be considered in the criteria. I have avoided involvement with the matter as an assessment committee is dealing with it. It would be impossible for me to deal with the many letters received from and representations made by all the organisations. The reason for the delay, which I accept is a long one, is that the officials concerned are from the Northern Ireland section of my Department and were also involved in the drafting of the Easter legislation. That having been completed, they now hope to deal with this matter as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 23 inclusive, together</P>
      <P>As was outlined in my Dáil statement of 1 April, on the outcome of the Berlin European Council, I met German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder on 19 March on his tour of capitals in advance of his visit to Berlin. This meeting allowed me the opportunity to prioritise Irish objectives for the Chancellor at a crucial stage in the preparations for Berlin. Key among those objectives was maintaining intact the agriculture package as negotiated at the agriculture council in the previous week and the need to ensure a balanced outcome on Structural Funds which would take account of Ireland's situation. We also discussed at that time the recent resignation of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>I attended an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in Brussels on the evening of 14 April. At the meeting, originally scheduled to have an exchange of views with Mr. Romano Prodi who had been nominated at Berlin to be the next President of the European Commission, we also discussed the current situation in Kosovo. Given the nature of the meeting, formal decisions were not taken and written conclusions were not issued.</P>
      <P>The first part of the meeting focused on Kosovo and there was a strong consensus on the Union's approach to the issue. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their determination to pursue the goal of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo. In an important development, the meeting was also attended by the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan. I welcomed the attendance of the Secretary General at the meeting. The involvement of the UN in attempts to reach a settlement has my full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the presence of the UN Secretary General, the meeting concentrated on trying to build on his proposals, bearing in mind the considerations of the Presidency on this subject and the conclusions reached by the General Affairs Council on 8 April. The Heads of State or Government confirmed to the UN Secretary General their support for his initiative of 9 April 1999. This calls for an immediate halt to the use of force; withdrawal of all military and special police forces as well as irregular units; deploy<Col N="416" /> ment of an international security force; and the return of all refugees and displaced persons. We agreed that it is up to the Yugoslav authorities to fully accept these demands to pave the way for a political solution.</P>
    <P>It was agreed to initiate the introduction of these principles into a Resolution of the UN Security Council under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. Importantly, the leaders also recognised the need to engage the Russian Federation in close co-operation in the search for a solution.</P>
    <P>In addition, I was pleased the leaders agreed to convene a conference which will seek to stabilise the South Eastern European Region through economic reconstruction. I took the opportunity to reiterate Ireland's full support for the efforts of the UNHCR in providing humanitarian relief in the region.</P>
    <P>During the second part of the meeting, the leaders met the President designate of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, for a first exchange of views on issues including his proposals for a reform programme for the Commission. I expressed confidence that Mr. Prodi, who is set to take over the role of President at a very challenging time, has the ability with the support of the Heads of State or Government, to reform, modernise and equip the Commission to discharge effectively its vital role in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Mr. Prodi indicated that transparency and accountability in both the administrative and political areas will be the main themes of his proposed plan of reform for the Commission. I was very pleased that a consensus emerged at the meeting that the EU needs a strong Commission. As a small member state, Ireland has relied, and will continue to rely, on equal membership of the Commission college for the adequate protection and promotion of our interests under the treaties.</P>
    <P>As regards any reform package, what we have heard from Mr. Prodi suggests that he will move with all deliberate speed. In a complex entity such as the Commission, it will take time and skill as well as determination to achieve the necessary change, not least because of the need to gain the support and co-operation of staff. The Committee of Independent Experts pointed to the resource dimension of poor Commission performance in certain areas. The resources for the tasks the Council allocates to the Commission must be adequate as well as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Subject to his gaining approval by the European Parliament at its session from 3-7 May, Mr. Prodi will begin, in co-operation with the governments of member states, to prepare the nomination of a new Commission. The governments of the member states will, by common accord with Mr. Prodi, nominate those whom they intend to appoint as members of the Commission. Following the European Parliament elections in June, the newly elected Parliament will give its approval to the President and the nominees for the Commission. A shared understanding was <Col N="417" /> reached between the leaders that it was important a new Commission be put in place as soon as possible after the European Parliament elections. The process will begin at the first session of the newly elected Parliament which is scheduled for 20-23 July. The leaders also believe the new Commission should serve for five and a half years with no &ldquo;interim&rdquo; commissioners and, therefore, the existing commissioners will remain in place until they are replaced by the new Commission.</P>
    <P>I wrote to Mr. Prodi on 24 March, congratulating him on his nomination as President of the Commission. I assured him I was looking forward to working closely with him, initially on the formation of the new Commission, and later on the challenges we must all face together. As I have already indicated, I will seek an early meeting with Mr. Prodi following his ratification by the European Parliament to discuss the nomination and portfolio of the Irish Commissioner. I have not, as yet, written to the outgoing President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer. I intend doing so on the conclusion of his term of office. I have not met with EU Commissioner Flynn since I met him in Brussels on 3 March, but I had a number of telephone conversations with him during the talks in Berlin.</P>
    <P>I held a separate meeting with Prime Minister Blair in Brussels, immediately prior to last Wednesday's meeting, to discuss the latest position on the talks in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to my domestic and international meetings with other leaders, the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Mr. Brian Tobin, began a visit to Ireland last Friday. I met him yesterday and he will depart next Friday. The Governor General of Australia is scheduled to conduct an official visit here at the end of April. I expect Chancellor Schröder will visit Ireland as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the Cologne European Council on 3-4 June, which I will attend. As I outlined earlier, Commission President-designate Prodi may visit in advance of the June Council. The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Jean Chrétien, will pay an official visit here from 13-15 June. I will attend the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 28 and 29 June. My schedule in Rio has not yet been finalised, but I intend to hold a number of bilateral meetings on the margins of the summit. A visit to Mexico and Argentina in conjunction with the summit is also being planned, but no final programme for these essentially trade related visits has yet been agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the decision of NATO to commence bombing Yugoslavia has proven a wise and effective policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision was made by NATO. It is not for me to judge whether it was right or wrong, but NATO authorities still feel it was justified. In our discussions last week it was stated strongly, including by the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that most of the <Col N="418" /> motions and activities which were sought had already received UN sanction last year. He said he could understand, given the failure to move to a position of resolution, that these matters were necessary. From listening to the meetings, reports and my colleagues who are involved in NATO, I personally believe people might not have realised at the commencement that this would be so drawn out. I am not talking here about the fact that it has gone on for 25 or 26 days, but that it will go on for a much longer time. That may not have been reflected on in advance, but I do not know that, not being privy to what went on in the NATO meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I express puzzlement at the fact the leader of the Irish people and a European country has expressed the view that it is not for him to say whether a policy involving the initiation of war in Europe was right or wrong? Surely, the Taoiseach, as the leader of a country which aspires to membership of the Security Council of the United Nations, would at least have a view, one way or the other, on a matter of this importance. Surely, the Taoiseach, as someone who has sat in on successive European Councils and heard the pros and cons of military action in Yugoslavia discussed, would have a view by now on whether the bombing of Yugoslavia was a wise and effective policy. Has he not made up his mind yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As is often the case, Deputy Bruton listened to my first line and then stopped listening. As I said, time will tell whether the strategy put forward will prove effective. My conclusion and that of the UN Secretary General, my colleagues at the European Council who are members of NATO and other EU colleagues is that they had no other option. They sought solutions at Rambouillet and Paris and numerous resolutions last year, but they did not prove to be effective. Some people thought the infrastructural and military resources of Mr. Milosevic would be taken out easily and that a quick resolution would be found. I do not know the extent to which that was planned and thought through because I am not privy to those meetings. I wonder if it was thought out to the extent it should have been, but I will not know that until time moves on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In his first answer to a question about the bombing of Yugoslavia, the first initiation of war by NATO in Europe since NATO was formed 50 years ago, the Taoiseach said it was not for him to say whether it was right or wrong, yet in his second answer he said they had no other option, which infers he believes it was right. Is Irish foreign policy being made up as we go along, in the same way as the Taoiseach is making up his answers, or is there a coherent view on an appropriate response to what is happening in the Balkans? When does he expect the Government will have a coherent view on this <Col N="419" /> subject? It does not have one based on the answers he has given to my questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Several weeks ago I spent an hour talking about this subject but, unfortunately, Deputy Bruton was not here so he does not know our position. Perhaps we should go back three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to go back three weeks because I heard what the Taoiseach said today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have consistently supported a political solution to the problems in Kosovo. We would like to see swift movement back to the process of negotiation and dialogue. I strongly supported Mr. Kofi Annan and UN involvement last week. I made it clear in the House and at the two European Council meetings, where I had an opportunity to speak, that a Russian contribution is indispensable to finding a solution to this matter. I understand that further contacts between Russia and Belgrade are imminent.</P>
      <P>There are a number of important issues. One is to seek Russian involvement, which was called for last week in Brussels and Mr. Kofi Annan emphasised that strongly yesterday when he addressed the UN Council. Yesterday President Clinton and President Yeltsin had their first conversation since the bombing started. I said three weeks ago that America and Russia should not move away from dialogue. Former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has been appointed an envoy which I said last week would help, rather than relying on shuttle diplomacy which might not work. The UN Secretary General will go to Russia shortly and he will also visit Bonn. EU Foreign Ministers will meet at the next meeting of the General Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>From the Government's point of view, the UN Security Council has particular responsibilities in this area. We are always more comfortable and committed working under the UN umbrella. I would like the Security Council to assume those responsibilities. At our meeting last week I said it was the intention of our EU partners who are members of the Security Council to initiate the introduction of the demands of the international community into a resolution to be adopted by the Security Council under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the wholesale slaughter and the horror associated with ethnic cleansing which we witness daily on our television screens, will the Government commit Irish troops to participate in a ground force to prevent any further slaughter if asked by an appropriate international body acting under an international mandate, notwithstanding the risks that such participation could entail for Irish personnel?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree UN troops, with precisely the mandate to which he has just referred, had to stand back and watch the slaughter at Srebenica four or five years ago and that we have all moved beyond that?

      <P>In his original reply some time ago, why did the Taoiseach fudge the question as to whether the Government supported the NATO bombing campaign when on 14 April he signed a declaration by the EU leaders explicitly endorsing NATO's bombing campaign? Does he now accept that 27 days of the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia has been an absolute disaster, especially for those it was supposed to protect, that it has given rise to a huge intensification in the brutality of the so-called ethnic cleansing of one million suffering refugees and the carnage near Prizren where dozens of refugees died at the hands of NATO? The Taoiseach seems to have doubts as to whether the bombing was a miscalculation. Is the Government capable of adopting independent foreign policy as opposed to holding onto the coat tails of the main arms merchants of the world who are organised in NATO?</P>

I reiterate that many of the aspects put forward in Mr. Annan's plan have already received a UN mandate. However, the bombing has not received a mandate because of the veto. As Mr. Annan said, and as I stated previously in the House, in a situation where everything else has been tried, there are times when military action is necessary to achieve a humanitarian solution for people who are suffering. I support that position, although we hope his strenuous efforts over the past week to secure a UN mandate under Chapter VII on this issue will be successful.</P>

Ireland's position is that the use of military force against another state, other than in self-defence, should be authorised preferably by the UN Security Council.

As a result, we will have the services of Madame Cresson as a Commissioner for almost the entirety of her normal term notwithstanding the serious report on her activities by the auditors. The existing Commission will remain in office although it has said it cannot take any decisions on anything of substance for months. There will be a two-headed Commission in office, with President Santer and the President designate Prodi getting in each other's way, with neither really in charge. How can the Taoiseach justify this messing by the European Council in not making a clean break and appointing a new Commission to replace the Commission under Mr. Santer right away, rather than causing this prolonged limbo for the Commission?</P>

      <P>The European Council feels that it would be better if the matter could be dealt with quickly. The President of the Council, Mr. Schröder, has already stated that he thought the matter should be dealt with more swiftly. It was for that reason the European Council moved to appoint Mr. Prodi almost immediately after the resignation of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliament has stated it will consider the second part of the process with Mr. Prodi and, <Col N="423" /> hopefully, appoint him in the first week in May &ndash; as it is entitled to do under the new Amsterdam Treaty arrangements. It then goes into recess for the European elections and returns in the third week in July.</P>
    <P>The European Council would like it to commence its consideration of the new Commission at that stage &ndash; it is the next time it will meet. Some people say that is possible but most say it is unlikely. That leads to a position where the Commissioners will not appear before the Parliament to be questioned under the powers of the Parliament until September.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the European Council can do no more. This was the only procedure agreed in the discussions between the Council and the Parliament.

      <P>As I have advised the House previously, the Government has decided to support the merger and flotation of ACC Bank and TSB. The Government has also decided in principle in favour of an employee share ownership trust on the basis of up to 5 per cent of the shares of the merged bank being available in return for productivity enhancement and flexibility, and a further 9.9 per cent at a cost equivalent to a valuation of ACC Bank's and TSB's existing operations.</P>
    </Speaker>

It is my intention that Mr. Matthew Barrett, chairperson of that board, will be appointed to the board of ACC Bank at its forthcoming AGM and the board of trustees of TSB has also agreed to appoint him to its board. Mr. Harry Lorton, chief executive designate of the new bank and chief executive of TSB, has also been appointed to the board of ACC Bank. I have also decided to appoint Mr. Pádraic O'Connor, who is a member of the non-statutory board, to be the next chairperson of ACC Bank. <Col N="424" /> In addition, I have advertised for advisers to assist me in relation to the merger and flotation process and I expect to be in a position to appoint advisers before the end of May.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that planning between the two banks for establishing a management structure for the merger process is progressing well and internal partnership arrangements are being developed to involve staff and unions fully in the process.</P>
    <P>As Deputies can see, significant steps have been taken to push this merger and flotation process forward. I am aware that issues have arisen between management and ACC Bank unions. I would hope that, with a positive attitude from both sides, these problems can be resolved.</P>

      <P>Issues relating to ongoing negotiations, however, are a matter between the board and management of the individual banks and the individual members.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I did not announce financial envelopes by the end of the first quarter of this year, as I had indicated I would do in my budget speech, was set out in my statement on publication of the end-March Exchequer returns.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the statement, my Department has carried out a considerable amount of work on financial envelopes. I decided to postpone seeking Government decisions on financial envelopes at this time because it became clear, as the detailed work on developing the envelopes was proceeding in my Department, that seeking Government agreement to the envelopes at this time would not be appropriate. The forthcoming negotiations on the national development plan and, subsequently, on the national agreement to succeed Partnership 2000 will almost certainly require revision of financial envelopes decided now.</P>
      <P>I decided, in the circumstances, that the final phase of the multi-annual budgeting system will be introduced with effect from the year 2000. It is my intention that, under this new timetable, financial envelopes will be decided by the Government for the years 2001 and 2002 in first quarter of 2000.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the move to the final phase of multi-annual budgeting being abandoned. The Government is committed to introducing the multi-annual system involving decisions on resource allocation for three years. My decision to defer announcement of the financial envelopes until 2000 was based on purely practical considerations related to the efficient organisation of Government work. It would not have made sense to engage the Government in a time consuming consideration of financial envelopes in the knowledge that decisions made would have to be revised to take account of the national development plan and the national agreement to succeed Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that what he has just told us is a load of nonsense. <Col N="426" /> His Department has been engaged in negotiation with individual Departments for at least a year in relation to financial envelopes. Surely he will agree that the national plan is not a surprise, nor is the renegotiation of Partnership 2000. Is this not, in effect, the end of multi-annual budgeting as far as this Government is concerned? Does it not mean, in effect, gross failure in terms of any introduction of SMI and the end of any serious effort to control public spending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell will not be surprised that I do not agree with any of the suggestions put forward by him. A great deal of time has been spent in the Department of Finance developing this whole process. Before my last budget I gave much consideration to finalising it. That would have involved an exercise in which I could have produced figures but they may not have meant a great deal. I then decided we would revisit the matter in the first quarter of this year with a view to progressing it. For several years we have been engaged in developing the &ldquo;no policy considerations&rdquo; framework and contained in the figures for 2000 and 2001 are the costs on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis. The financial envelopes will effectively decide particular Departments' Estimates for a number of years and that means getting involved in detailed Estimates negotiations. Considering that we will have to finalise the national development plan later this year &ndash; that will take up a great deal of time with individual Departments together with the Department of Finance &ndash; the overall framework will have to be developed further and, in addition, we will have to engage in discussions later this year on the successor to Partnership 2000. We will then be in a position to make a better estimate of the figures. It does not make practical sense to me, as a humble book-keeper, to produce financial envelopes that will be revised in a few months' time and again later in the year. Envelopes on that basis would not have any meaning; it would be a case of making projections and guessing what the outcome will be. That is not the intention behind the financial envelopes. The Department of Finance will negotiate with the relevant Government Department and, within that envelope, will work for the following number of years. Changes will then be made in line with Government policy. To have a meaningful idea of financial envelopes I decided to delay the process for the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response would make perfect sense if he were not also committed to containing Government spending within certain specified cash limits. The Minister has produced indicative figures, to use his own phrase, of what will happen over the next three years. He stated that what remains to be done with those figures is for the undetermined amount, which I understand is approximately £350 million for next year, to be allocated within individual Departments to reach the Government total intended <Col N="427" /> cap of 4 per cent. What is the status now of those indicative figures published on budget day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember that the financial envelopes will not just relate to current spending. The 4 per cent limit imposed relates to net current spending. The financial envelope will also involve current and capital spending. For the reason I have just outlined, therefore, the more pragmatic approach to take is to await further development so that we can put realistic financial envelopes in place. Lest there be any doubt about it, negotiating financial envelopes will not be an easy task, particularly the first group of financial envelopes. Whatever difficulties arise, it is my intention that when the financial envelopes are in place they will remain in place. This will not be just a signing off exercise on behalf of individual Departments which will then change them willy-nilly later in the year. The idea behind financial envelopes is that they will be adhered to, so it is better to take that approach than to adopt a <i>laissez-faire </i>attitude which would not mean very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in terms of the process although I may not agree in terms of the figures. Is it not also fair to say that the Minister's Department has been attempting to negotiate with individual spending Departments in particular for at least a year, and that in the Estimates circular last year the Minister asked Departments to indicate their intended spending for the next three years?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This falls back somewhat on the debate with Deputy McDowell on the previous question. The figures in the last two budgets set out estimates of revenue on one side on the basis that there will not be significant policy changes, and the underlying assumptions are set out in the notes regarding taxation and other matters. That does not prevent the Government from making decisions on taxation in future years. The figures for expenditure are projected forward on a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; basis, and included in that is the limit on the 4 per cent limit current net level. A contingency sum is also set aside for unanticipated developments. It also takes into account what will be the runover from the current tranche of EU funds. When the national development plan is produced the figures for future budgets will reflect the decisions taken by the Government when it decides the plan later this year. As far as expenditure is concerned, the national development plan will be a breakdown between EU, Exchequer and private funding. If additional Exchequer moneys are required when we decide the national development plan, they will be built into the framework for future years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to wait until we produce the national development plan in which we will signal how we intend to fund it. Funding will be from a combination of the three sources I have spoken about. These decisions will be reflected in future budgets. Every year the Government has to make an assumption about what will happen in the coming year. We know the amount of EU funding we will receive. The national development plan will encompass whatever budgetary revisions are made in the coming years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's regionalisation proposal, as originally submitted to EUROSTAT, involved the reclassification of the single NUTS II region of Ireland into two new NUTS II regions, of which one would be based on the existing Border, midlands and west NUTS III regions. The Government's proposals also involved the inclusion of Clare and Kerry in the west NUTS III region. The rationale of the Government's approach was to maximise the area which would qualify for Objective One status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of intensive correspondence and contacts with EUROSTAT it became clear that EUROSTAT would be willing to contemplate a proposal under which Ireland would be reclassified into two new NUTS II regions but only on the basis which would leave the existing NUTS III region unchanged. While Ireland strongly pressed the case for a revision at NUTS level <Col N="430" /> which would allow Clare and Kerry to be included in the new Border, midlands and west NUTS II region, EUROSTAT would not concede on this point.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Government decided that the best interests of the country would be served by agreeing a NUTS II revision based on the existing NUTS III regions. Agreement was reached on this basis guaranteeing that 13 counties would retain Objective One status until 2006. This was reflected in the conclusions to the Berlin European Council.</P>
    <P>As regards the overall share for Ireland, it is estimated that about £470 million was secured by regionalisation over and above what would otherwise have been available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of statements made in the House that a strong case would be made for the inclusion of Kerry and Clare, why did the negotiators succumb so easily to the Commission? How much money will Kerry and Clare lose over the five year period as a result of being excluded from Objective One status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The toughest fight we faced was to get the country reclassified. The Commission's original view was that it did not want Ireland's status changed &ndash; it wanted to keep Ireland as one region which would be classified as a region in transition.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the Government decided to make an application to subregionalise the country. In so doing we went for what we considered the optimum number of counties. The Commission opposed granting subregionalisation to Ireland so this was not possible. It was possible to have 13 counties reclassified but Clare and Kerry had to be dropped despite the best efforts of the negotiators and the Government. The result has been more than satisfactory. In 1998 everyone in Europe was opposed to subregionalising the country. We succeeded in getting 13 counties included in the new classification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot make a calculation on that basis. In one of the final documents submitted by the Commission to the Berlin Council, it estimated that the granting of Ireland's subregionalisation proposal was worth £470 million. When the Government decides on the national development plan in the coming months it will consider the entire country and decide on plans which meet the objectives in all areas. As part of that plan the Government will have to consider the level of EU funding for part of the country and what it will do with those areas which do not qualify for such high levels of EU funding because of the subregionalisation approach.</P>

      <P>The Fitzpatrick report will confirm that Kerry's GDP is at 63 per cent. Was the <Col N="431" /> Department of Finance or the Government aware of this figure before agreeing to the 13 counties? There is an infrastructural deficit in Kerry. It has been stated that Clare and Kerry could lose about £500 million over the five year period. Will the Minister give an assurance that this money will be made up from the public capital programme over the next five years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>The national development plan will address all the issues raised by commentators, including the Deputy, expert reports, the ESRI and other studies. If we are to continue to enjoy economic success the Government is aware that the national development plan will have to be broader and more far sighted than previous plans. The needs of Kerry will be looked as will those of other counties.</P>

      <P>We had a debate before on extracting GDP figures per county. In putting forward its subregionalisation proposals, the Government included Clare and Kerry as part of a region as it was able to qualify on the basis of being below the 75 per cent of EU GDP. However, Clare and Kerry had to be dropped from that proposal to achieve reclassification for the other 13 counties.</P>

      <Quest>the degree to which Ireland's economic situation will be effected by fluctuations in international currencies with particular reference to the pound sterling, the euro and the US dollar; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Ireland is a small open economy, movements in exchange rates are particularly important. The main economic effects of changes in the value of the euro would be on Ireland's international competitiveness and inflation performance. The effects would depend on a number of factors including the size and direction of any change.</P>
      <P>For example, a fall in the value of the euro against a particular currency, other things being equal, would be expected to improve the competitiveness of Irish companies exporting to that country. This could lead to an increase in exports and employment. A lower value for the euro would also increase Irish import prices. This increase would in turn put upward pressures on inflation and offset the potential competitiveness gains accruing to exporters. On the other hand, a rise in the value of the euro would be expected to lead to a reduction in competitiveness and downward pressure on inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> As Minister for Finance, I have not commented in the past on either the Irish pound exchange rate or the euro exchange rate and I do not now propose to make a specific comment on the euro exchange rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the European Central Bank keep in contact with ECOFIN and the euro 11 and has it informed them of the exchange rate policy it is pursuing or is that policy as big a surprise to ECOFIN as it is to many other people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since June last year, there has been at least one euro 11 meeting per month, excluding holiday periods. These meetings usually take place before the normal ECOFIN Council meetings. The president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Duisenberg, attended most of the meetings. He makes general comments on a wide a variety of issues and brings the members up to date.</P>
      <P>There are clear guidelines as to the role of the ECB <i>vis-à-vis</i> the members of the euro 11. Setting the exchange rate policy is a matter for the European Central Bank but the euro 11 group and the ECOFIN Council can make what is termed &ldquo;general orientations&rdquo; in referring to exchange rate matters. We live in a free Europe and Ministers make comments in the presence of the president of the European Central Bank as to how they think policy should proceed. However, the independence of the ECB is enshrined in legislation. It is a matter for the European Central Bank to decide exchange rate policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. He has confirmed that the ECB informs ECOFIN or at least the euro 11 group on what exchange rate policy it is following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but the exchange rate policy it follows is set down in a statute. It is to keep inflation down. That is the remit of the European Central Bank &ndash; it was a matter of debate not only before the bank was established but since its establishment &ndash; much like the former remit of the Irish Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is the bank's remit or mission statement, but it is not its exchange rate policy, which is the issue I wish to pursue.</P>
      <P>Its policy appears to be to allow the market to decide. It seems to be prepared to allow the euro to drift down to a par with the dollar, if not below it. Can the Minister confirm this? To put it more succinctly, will the ECB follow an interventionist policy in the international money market to protect a particular level of value for the euro or is it prepared to allow the market to decide that appropriate value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what the president of the ECB said on this. He said in an interview that the policy would not be one of benign <Col N="433" /> neglect, which is often how the United States refers to its policy. However, deciding exchange rate policy is not a matter for the euro 11 or the ECOFIN Council. The only crossover point is that general orientations can be referred to by the Council. It is a matter solely for the president of the European Central Bank and I can only refer to his remarks in public statements. He does not consult with the euro 11 or ECOFIN as to what policy he will follow. There is a clear dividing line, as there was in this country between the actions of the central bank and the actions of the Council or the Irish Minister for Finance. They are, more or less, the same rules which applied in Ireland in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave in his reply a recitation of conventional economic wisdom with regard to issues such as competitiveness and inflation. I am sure he will agree that the Irish economy for much of the last three or four years has defied conventional economic wisdom&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and it would be helpful if those who assist the Minister in penning these responses would take that into account.</P>
      <P>What effect does the Minister expect the reduction by 0.5 per cent in the interest rate by the ECB to have on the Irish economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish economy has been going through a boom period in recent years. That is reflected in low interest rates, high local demand at home and an exchange rate that is positive for Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland joined EMU on 1 January, it is not subject to exchange rate fluctuations with regard to the states with which it does business which joined EMU. That makes up a large segment of our trade. Irish exporters have been enjoying a great bonanza in recent years because the Irish pound has effectively depreciated against currencies due to the strength of the dollar and sterling. It is as well to point this out at this stage because in future months or years it might go in the other direction.</P>
      <P>We should remind people who are exporting to those markets that they have been having an excellent time for a good few years. In the lead up to monetary union, much fear was expressed that the Irish pound would go in the other direction and that it might eventually have an exchange rate against sterling of, for example, £1.09 or £1.10. It is important to point out these aspects now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about interest rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the recent change in the interest rate from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent by the European Central Bank to have a further major effect on the Irish economy. As the Deputy said, the Irish economy has defied all the laws of economics in recent years in a wide <Col N="434" /> variety of areas. I do not expect the latest change in the interest rate to have a significant effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree that the Irish economy is running contrary to conventional economic wisdom. This boom was predicted by Dr. John Fitzgerald of the ESRI in 1992. However, conventional economists frequently would not believe the evidence before their eyes, in the same way as they do not believe the evidence now about the housing market, traffic chaos and other matters. This boom was entirely predictable and the economy is operating conventionally as an economic region would in a wider economic zone.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, and I agree, that exchange rate policy is entirely a matter for the European Central Bank in the same way as it previously was a matter for the Irish Central Bank when the statutory basis was different. He also said that at euro 11 meetings and ECOFIN meetings, general discussions on the orientation of policy may take place. At future Question Times will the Minister be prepared to answer questions on the discussions about the orientation of policy which take place between the Minister and his colleagues in ECOFIN?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The treaty states that the Council may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to the euro. Since the euro came into operation on 1 January, the Council has not formulated general orientations for the exchange rate value of the euro. There has been considerable debate in recent months on the role of Finance Ministers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Central Bank. The treaty laid down rules on this matter quite clearly. The President of the ECB does not come to the Council and outline a particular exchange rate policy he intends to follow for a six month period; he speaks generally about the economic situation in Europe and throughout the world. That does not prevent ECOFIN or euro 11 Ministers outlining their views on general economic policy in the euro region and the rest of the world or making those views known stridently both within the Council and outside of it. The former German Minister for Finance, Mr. Lafontaine, was not behind the door in outlining his views on interest rates in Europe and we know what happened to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about which to answer questions. I am very forthcoming to the press and to this House on the discussions which take place at ECOFIN and euro 11 meetings. I want to make it clear that the President of the ECB does not come along and tell us what policy he is pursuing.</P>

      <P>Will the Revenue Commissioners defer the application of the new powers until the statement of practice has been received by the tax practitioners? Will the statement be issued on disc as well as on paper? Will the statement of practice reflect the guarantees given by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners when these sections were being debated, that they will be used very sparingly only in serious cases and will not be used at all in the pursuit of little people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In anticipation of the questions posed by Deputy Noonan, these matters have been put to the Revenue Commissioners. I will bring the matter of the disc copy to their attention; I have not been informed that they intend to do that but I am sure they will.</P>
      <P>Detailed instructions to Revenue staff on the implementation of the additional powers are being prepared simultaneously with the statement of practice. These instructions will be supported by further in-service training where appropriate. The Deputy will be aware that it will be possible to obtain the instructions to staff under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The Deputy specifically requested that the additional powers granted to the Revenue Commissioners would not be employed against taxpayers before the new statement of practice has been issued. I am not in a position to give any definite undertakings on this but I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their objective to issue the statement of practice in the near future, certainly before the new powers are used to any significant extent. I have no doubt that if powers have to be used urgently in particular cases, the Revenue Commissioners will act in accordance with the law and the assurance given which will be reflected in the statement of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also requested that these powers would not be used to harass ordinary taxpayers and those with smaller liabilities. As I indicated in the select committee debate on the Finance Act, I granted additional powers to the Revenue Commissioners in the certain knowledge that they would be used responsibly. Pow<Col N="436" /> ers will only be available to authorised officers of an appropriate senior ranking who will be subject to the control of senior management. In regard to the most sensitive power, namely that of access to bank accounts, the specific approval of one of the three Revenue Commissioners will be required. The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners publicly indicated that the new powers would not be focused on smaller cases. The new powers will help to restore confidence in the tax collection system which has been dented by revelations made in the past two years.</P>
    <P>During the Report Stage debate on the Finance Bill, I stated that when the Moriarty tribunal &ndash; which has a remit to consider the adequacy of revenue powers &ndash; has reported, I will consider the evaluation of all revenue powers in light of the new powers and any recommendations or comments Mr. Justice Moriarty may make.</P>

      <P>On 20 October 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector at the earliest date possible. An implementation advisory group was subsequently set up under the chairmanship of Michael McDowell, SC, to progress the necessary work.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to her parliamentary question on 25 February last that, due to its complex and wide-ranging remit and the extensive consultations it is undertaking with interested parties, the group indicated it would not be able to meet the end of February deadline and sought approval for submission of its report to take place in April 1999. That request was acceded to.</P>
      <P>To date I have not received the group's report. However, I expect to receive it before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> This is a particularly active and hard working group. It commenced work on 5 November 1998 and to date has held 17 meetings. The financial services sector is critically important for Ireland's modern economy and it is, therefore, vital that the group be given the time to do a thorough job, regardless of how long it might take. Nevertheless, I am assured the report should be ready by the end of April.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister is well represented on the committee through a senior member of his Department, could the approach being adopted be described as one in which the regulatory authority would subsume the work of the Central Bank? Alternatively, could the regulatory authority, in effect, be the Central Bank with a subsidiary of the bank carrying out those functions which many of us believe are not being adequately dealt with at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Deputy Noonan is not trying to be mischievous in the phrasing of his question. We will await the report of the committee to see what it says. It will be noted that one of terms of reference of the group is to advise the Government on the extent, if any, to which existing regulators, for example, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, would continue to have functions in relation to regulation of the financial services sector and the extent to which any alteration in the <i>status quo</i> would impinge on the non-regulatory functions of the Central Bank. I do not think we will have much longer to wait before receiving the deliberations of the committee. When the report is presented to myself and the Tánaiste it will be brought to the Government for further deliberation and we will have further opportunities for debating some of the ideas put forward by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Minister correctly pointed out that the Government decision was taken six months ago and that the committee is an implementation group. Given this, can I take it the Minister expects to act on foot of the recommendations made by the committee and that in ten days' time we will not be facing the establishment of yet another <i>ad hoc</i> interdepartmental or departmental advisory group to examine the implementation of the report?</P>

      <P>The press release of 20 October stated the Government had agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector at the earliest possible date, and to the immediate establishment of the implementation advisory group to progress the necessary work. Therefore, the decision on the principle of a single regulatory authority has already been taken by the Government. The committee, chaired by Michael McDowell, is an advis<Col N="439" /> ory group to progress the necessary work along the lines of the terms of reference given it at the time. Once the advisory group reports, it will be a matter for the Government to make a decision.</P>

The current committee is an advisory group concerning implementation. There is much debate as to how the single authority will be established, something referred to by Deputy Noonan in his question. I do not wish to anticipate the report of the committee. The Government must make a decision on foot of the report of the advisory group. We should await the report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the 68 women in the North-Western Health Board whose test results were incorrectly reported. I assure them that any services they require will be made available and I am advised that the delay in detecting the error will not compromise them medically. This has been explained to them by the North-Western Health Board and I add my sympathy and assurances to that of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of a problem in the North-Western Health Board was identified as part of the routine quality control process. Two smears categorised as positive were reviewed. The women concerned had smears the previous year which were categorised as negative. These smears were screened by a private laboratory and it was considered an error had been made in its classification. A review of all 2,115 smears the private laboratory had undertaken was carried out and further cases with abnormal cervical cells were discovered. This review was carried out by an <Col N="441" /> independent accredited laboratory in the UK and was not completed until the week before last.</P>
    <P>The main priority for the North-Western Health Board was the health and welfare of the women affected by the situation. The health board considered the most appropriate means of contacting these women was through their general practitioners. An information pack was prepared, but only as an adjunct to the general practitioners' approach. It was arranged with general practitioners that women who needed a repeat smear would be offered this as soon as possible. A taxi service was contracted to transport the slides directly to the laboratory. A fast track service within the laboratory will ensure results are available within the week.</P>
    <P>For those women who need further investigation by colposcopy, the board considered it important that they have a choice as to where and when this would be carried out. Three clinics have been organised, one in Sligo and two in Derry, and some appointments were arranged in Dublin where this was more convenient.</P>
    <P>Telephone support lines were established and staffed by trained nursing and medical staff. More than 90 calls were received during the four days they were in operation. Some women required and received follow-up telephone calls from support staff. Further counselling will be made available for women whose general practitioners request it. In partnership with their GPs, the board will continue to provide ongoing care and support to the women in future.</P>
    <P>The health board has acknowledged the tremendous support given by general practitioners, area medical officers and other board staff to ensure the women involved received the best possible service. The board has also acknowledged the support received from Altnagelvin Hospital and consultants at Holles Street Hospital. The health board will take any and all further steps to support and help those affected.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board had contracted the private laboratory to read the backlog of 2,115 smears on the basis that the laboratory would adhere to accepted clinical practice, which means that after all smears have been read by a cytotechnician, they are reviewed by a second cytotechnician. In addition, any abnormal smears above borderline are reviewed by a consultant pathologist. The North-Western Health Board is carrying out its own investigation into what happened and has not ruled out legal action against the laboratory involved. It is clear the laboratory did not live up to its claims to have internal and external quality control systems and independent quality assurance. These are issues being considered by the health board and it will take whatever action is necessary.</P>
    <P>Having satisfied myself the health board responded in a satisfactory way to the women identified as having had an incorrect reading of their smears, it then fell to me to consider what further actions were necessary at national level. My first concern was to identify what other cervi<Col N="442" /> cal cytology work was carried out by Claymon Laboratories. No other health board sent cervical smear tests to the private laboratory concerned. A voluntary hospital in the North-Eastern Health Board area, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, now in the ownership of the health board, and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, both used the private laboratory in 1997 to report a total of 350 smear tests. I have instructed Beaumont Hospital to carry out a recheck on the 200 smears reported on by the private laboratory which will be completed this week. It is not aware of any problem. Likewise the 150 smear tests from the North-Eastern Health Board are being rechecked by a UK laboratory and this will be completed this week. If any discrepancies emerge in the course of these rechecks, immediate action will be taken by the North-Eastern Health Board and Beaumont.</P>
    <P>I have also requested that the laboratory provide my Department with a list of any other private clients who might have used its services for cervical screening. The laboratory has advised it may not disclose the names of its private clients until they are advised that their names will be given to the Department of Health and Children. The laboratory has confirmed it is in contact with its private clients on this matter. I hope to get this information in the next few days and I will then initiate any action I think appropriate and necessary. Where other clients used this laboratory, a review of the cervical smear test results will be required, as will appropriate action to follow up any missed abnormalities.</P>
    <P>The next step was to identify the individuals who carried out the screening for Claymon Laboratories. The cervical smear tests were examined and reported on by professionals in Dublin and Cork. The Bon Secours Hospital in Cork has confirmed its involvement on behalf of Claymon Laboratories. In Dublin, St. Vincent's Hospital has assured me it did not carry out work for the private laboratory. Such work was done in a private capacity by hospital staff. Preliminary screening was not carried out at the hospital but at home. The staff concerned also had attachments with St. Vincent's, Elm Park; Mount Carmel, St. Michael's, Dún Laoghaire; and the Bon Secours Hospital, Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>While I am not aware of any problems in these hospitals, given what happened in the North-Western Health Board, to allay public concerns and as a precautionary measure, I have asked the hospitals concerned in Dublin and Cork where the professionals were employed to review their cervical cytology work in these hospitals and to let me have an early report on the matter. This review is to cover the period 1994 to 1998 and involves approximately 5,000 smears.</P>
    <P>I do not want this issue to be hyped up out of all proportion. It is important to keep it in perspective. I do not want to see the confidence of women in cervical cytology undermined. Neither do I want to undermine the confidence of staff working in cervical cytology. I am aware of how <Col N="443" /> difficult cervical screening is. It is subjective and completely dependent on the human eye. The screener has to review slides with some 50,000 cells and abnormalities can be missed. Professionals do not agree on borderline or mild abnormalities and some professionals tend to over-report these. Given the experience in the North-Western Health Board, these reviews are necessary to deal with any doubts, to allay the fears of women and to maintain confidence in cervical screening. The problem identified relates to a period in 1997 and to a small number of individuals and is being dealt with in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>I regret the concern this issue is causing women. It is essential they understand that the purpose of screening is not to detect cancer but to identify changes in the cells of the cervix which can be treated before a cancer develops. The likelihood of a negative result is about 93 per cent. As with any screening tests, there is a chance that some abnormalities may not be detected. In addition, it takes some ten to 15 years for cervical cancer to develop. That is why cervical smears are recommended at minimum intervals of five years. A single smear is not a guarantee of being free from cancer or its precursors, nor does an abnormal smear result mean a woman has cancer.</P>
    <P>Cervical screening is one of the few areas of the health services where the technology for automation is not yet available. Clinical trials are taking place and I hope automated screening which has been tried and tested will become a reality in the next few years. This will enable us to improve accuracy, quality and throughput in our laboratories. Over 170,000 smear tests were examined in 1998 in our laboratories, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the results apart from the ones at issue here.</P>
    <P>A further concern which had to be addressed was what other work Claymon Laboratory carried out for the health services. My Department has obtained the details and has written to all the hospitals and health boards involved asking them to take steps to satisfy themselves the results were satisfactory and to inform the Department of the position.</P>
    <P>Having satisfied myself that everything possible was being done with screening services, I then turned my attention to the national cervical screening programme. I am committed to the development of this programme for women aged 25 to 60 years of age. The introduction of an organised screening programme is a formidable task and must be done properly. It must be well managed, have high uptake levels, be fully computerised, and include comprehensive quality control as an integral part of the programme at every level. For these reasons it was considered that the screening programme should be introduced on a phased basis to identify and resolve any difficulties which might arise.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board area was chosen for phase one. A sum of £300,000 was <Col N="444" /> made available in 1998 to the Mid-Western Health Board for the recruitment of additional staff who will be responsible for the development, introduction, management and evaluation of the project. The population register is being developed. The software system has been selected and the paperwork is being developed. Subject to a satisfactory outcome of negotiations with the IMO it is envisaged that the pilot screening programme will be launched early next year.</P>
    <P>The aim of phase one is to develop a cervical screening programme which runs successfully in the mid-west and which can then be implemented throughout the rest of the country. Following the evaluation of the first phase in the mid-west the programme will then be rolled out to the rest of the country. While I am determined that the national programme will be introduced at the earliest possible date, it can only be done when management, quality control and other appropriate issues have been addressed and put in place. I have also instructed senior officials from my Department to meet with senior staff from the Mid-Western Health Board to ensure that the pilot programme commences as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The current waiting period for reporting cervical smear test results in the North-Western Health Board is four to six weeks. It is important to remember that the use of the private laboratory took place in 1997 when many laboratories had backlogs in reporting cervical smear test results. Since then about £2 million has been invested in cervical cytology to improve the laboratory service and for the recruitment of three consultants, 15 cytotechnicians and four clerical or laboratory aids. In addition, arrangements were made with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to process some 20,000 smear tests. The waiting period for results in laboratories is one to seven weeks. Any smear test marked urgent is, of course, examined immediately.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in recruiting trained cytotechnicians. Laboratory technicians are not attracted to working in cervical cytology. In any case where they are recruited it takes up to two years before they are fully proficient in screening and can work unsupervised. While overall the capacity of our laboratories would appear to be sufficient for an organised programme along the lines recommended in the report of my Department's cervical screening committee, the problem is that opportunistic screening is taking place more frequently than the recommended five yearly interval.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the laboratories are used effectively and efficiently for the women for whom cervical cytology is indicated, particularly in the preparation and integration of the current opportunistic screening into the proposed forthcoming national screening programme. It important to repeat here that the recommended interval for cervical screening is five years. Laboratories and smear takers should be advising a five yearly screening interval where routine repeat cytology is indicated if laboratories are to <Col N="445" /> operate efficiently and effectively and errors avoided.</P>
    <P>The report of my Department's cervical screening committee, which was issued in 1997, contains many recommendations on quality assurance regarding the introduction of a national screening programme. The report recommended that each laboratory should have written guidelines for all aspects of the cytopathology service, including quality control, from the time of receipt of the specimen to the discharge of the report. The report also recommended double screening of all abnormal smears, proportional re-screening of normal smears or 30 second screening of all smears and selected re-screening.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 the Irish Association for Clinical Cytology, the IACC, has also developed guidelines and these have been circulated to all laboratories. I have met with the chairman of the expert advisory committee on cervical screening, whose terms of reference include advising my Department on the piloting of the programme and on best practice, including quality assurance and new technologies. A sub-group of the expert committee has almost completed its work on quality assurance. I have requested that this work be finalised this week. This will provide the standard for quality assurance in all areas of cervical screening and its implementation will commence immediately.</P>
    <P>Laboratories are staffed by qualified personnel and ultimate responsibility for the quality of the work lies with the consultant pathologist. Quality control procedures currently in place include primary screening by trained cytotechnicians, rapid re-screening of all smears by another cytotechnician and double screening of abnormal screens. I wish to emphasise again that the problem which has been identified relates to a period in 1997 and to a small number of individuals. I also wish to reassure women who are currently using the cervical screening service that they have no need to be worried.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general issues of quality assurance in pathology, each sub-speciality operates to its own professional standards and guidelines. For example, in cytology, as already indicated, the Irish Association of Clinical Cytology has produced guidelines for cytology testing which would be available to all pathology laboratories. Quality assurance arrangements are in place in pathology laboratories, designed to monitor and evaluate the operational procedures and outcomes in relation to each laboratory.</P>
    <P>In common with other EU member states, Ireland is currently developing a formal laboratory accreditation scheme in consultation with the relevant professional interests. These are clinical pathologists, medical laboratory technicians and biochemists and they are represented by a joint working group comprised of representatives of the Faculty of Pathology RCPI, the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science and the Association of Clinical Biochemists. The objective of these <Col N="446" /> discussions is to develop and implement a formal accreditation system for pathology laboratories.</P>
    <P>On 9 March last my Department proposed a number of accreditation models to the joint working group and a response is awaited. My Department is anxious to conclude these discussions and has asked the joint working group to respond to the proposals as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is he aware that the notification made available to the women concerned was not satisfactory in that some were not notified prior to notification to the media, even though the North-Western Health Board was aware of concerns and problems since last January? Will he introduce some form of regulation nationally to ensure this never happens again?</P>
      <P>Will the further screening and medical intervention be made freely available to the women involved? Will the laboratory in question have a financial penalty imposed upon it? With regard to accreditation, to which the Minister adverted, can he advise us when there will be a national accreditation scheme in the country?</P>

      <P>Following the review conducted by the North-Western Health Board, the quality assurance review and the pro-active approach of the board it advised that all 2,115 smears should be re-tested by an independent laboratory in Scotland. I am sorry to hear the Deputy indicate that information may have become public prior to people being advised personally because the purpose of awaiting the outcome of these procedures was to enable the board to deal with matters as it would have wished, which would have been for GPs to notify the persons concerned. I would be pleased to have the details of any specific cases in which this occurred of which the Deputy is aware and to make inquiries into how it could have happened. The board was anxious from the time the results came back to do everything to ensure that people were notified in the way it had planned. I am not aware how this could have arisen in any other instance.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board is taking advice on action that might be taken against the laboratory concerned or against anyone involved in this matter. I have indicated that based on the facts available to me &ndash; I am bringing the Dáil up to date on the matter &ndash; it would appear that the internal and external quality assurance criteria for which the board contracted were not adhered to in this case. In view of this, it must take advice on the matter because the contract was between the board and the laboratory concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the accreditation system and the accreditation of private laboratories generally, we have made a submission to the joint working group since 9 March setting out some accreditation models which we believe the group would work to and agree upon. We have asked the group to make an immediate response to this to enable us to proceed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> On the question of the quality assurance, professional bodies have set out the guidelines on opportunistic screening and these are available to the laboratories.

Those would be the responses to the questions which have been raised.</P>

Would he acknowledge that the report of the cervical screening committee of the Department of Health and Children recommended that comprehensive quality control must be an integral part of a cervical screening programme at every level? Why did it take this particular health scandal to motivate the Minister to meet the chairman of the expert advisory committee and only in the past week or so to request that standards for quality assurance be furnished to him? Will he acknowledge that it is more than two years since that report was published and that by now we should have in place national quality assurance controls and systems and guidelines to apply to laboratories to ensure the accuracy of test results? Will he acknowledge that if other EU countries have been able to put in place an accreditation system for laboratories, we should also have in place such a system? Will he assure the House that no woman who has had a smear test in the past 12 months need have any worries or doubts about the accuracy of the results furnished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the final question first, the Deputy will be aware that there are quality assurance criteria involved in the present smear testing programme. It was as a result of the exercise of that quality assurance by the North-Western Health Board in Sligo General Hospital that this issue was investigated. This issue arose because of the proactive quality assurance measures which are already in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were working, we would not have had this difficulty in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the assurance the Deputy is seeking for people who have had tests &ndash; let us remember that there were 170,000 tests in 1998 &ndash; there is no evidence to suggest that tests, other than the ones which have come before us in respect of this matter, will be disputed in any way because there are internal qual<Col N="448" /> ity assurance controls in all of the laboratories. That is how this issue came up in the first place. It is important to make that point.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that women are beneficiaries of the health service. That is why we introduced these developments in the first place. The review in 1997 to which the Deputy referred is the blueprint for the introduction of a national cervical screening programme. As has been said and as the Deputy stated in alluding to the recommendation, quality control must be an integral part of this service before we get it up and running. We do not want to repeat some of what happened in other jurisdictions where confidence was undermined in those programmes because of the number of inaccurate tests which arose as a result of not dealing with those matters before introducing the national screening programme. The expert working committee is conscious of that and has been making preparations as a result of moneys which it has only received in 1998 &ndash; it did not receive money to proceed in 1997. The money is for the training of staff; to provide a population register for women between 25 and 60 who are sexually active &ndash; the target group for the screening programme &ndash; and the need to have a proper computerised call back service. I understand the committee has been looking at models in New Zealand and Australia and it saw one in New South Wales which it believes would probably be best suited to Irish circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to suggest that the expert working group has been sitting on its hands in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's view. I ask him to let me address the issue. We have just begun to introduce a breast screening programme in two health board areas which we will evaluate and progress to other health board areas as we introduce a national breast screening programme. It was the plan of the previous Administration, with which I agreed, that we begin phase one of the cervical screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board region on the basis of the necessary preparatory work being conducted. That is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>On the need for accreditation and quality control, in addition to preparing for a national cervical screening programme the expert working group is at an advanced stage of bringing forward protocols to deal with that issue generally and hopes to have it finalised this week. Therefore, it is not as a result of this unfortunate incident having occurred in the past fortnight that suddenly this work is coming to finality. It is as a result of a process which has correctly taken time because of the membership of that board wanting to make sure they get everything right before they introduce the national screening programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> The purpose of any national screening programme is not to undermine confidence. We have <Col N="449" /> identified the size of the problem in the North-Western Health Board where 68 wrong indications were given out of 2,115,and that has been dealt with. There are 350 further smear tests to be conducted in relation to what Claymon Laboratories did at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and at Beaumont Hospital. Having identified the people who did that work on its behalf on an agency basis outside public hospital facilities, we are now making sure that whatever work was done by that personnel in the system will be checked. The reason I am going back over a five year period is that is the period which the experts say is the period for routine screenings. As a precautionary measure, we are having the absolute maximum investigation which is prudent in the circumstances to meet the proper concern of this House about this matter while re-emphasising that confidence may be given to the screening programme generally in view of the quality assurance issues, which are dealt with on a daily basis and which highlighted this problem in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the 68 women who have been recalled for further checks, has it been identified yet whether the problems with their test results derived from the work done in the Bon Secours Hospital or the work done by the medical and technical staff attached to St. Vincent's Hospital who apparently did this work at home? Would the Minister agree it is an outrageous scandal that such testing was undertaken in the home or homes of one or more individuals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract which was drawn up between the North-Western Health Board and Claymon Laboratories referred to quality assurance criteria, normally available in the North-Western Health Board laboratories being made available by Claymon Laboratories. Otherwise the North-Western Health Board would not have in good faith subcontracted that work, which was a backlog of work which had arisen because of a lack of investment in cervical screening up to 1997. There has been a £2 million investment in it since. I outlined where that money has been spent in general terms on improved staff and expertise so that we are not in a similar situation now, and it is important to make that point.</P>
      <P>If there was a breach of contract &ndash; on the face of it there appears to have been a serious breach of contract &ndash; that is a matter on which the North-Western Health Board must take appropriate advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that because we do not have a national cervical cancer screening programme at present women's lives are being lost; it is a kind of screening which is immensely effective; and it is vital that it is put in place on a national basis if we are to protect women from cervical cancer? Does he also accept that, in this instance, the laboratory had international accreditation and this factor needs to be <Col N="450" /> considered by the Department? I accept the Minister does not want these events to undermine women's confidence in the screening programme. However, does he accept their confidence has been seriously undermined and that he must do more than simply review what has happened in the past, which is the essence of his reply? He must put the implementation of a national cervical screening programme on fast track, in line with the commitment given by his Department that this programme would be fully functioning this year. There is grave concern among those operating in the service about the lack of staffing and a lack of training for the staff required. Will the Minister outline how he is meeting that requirement?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on one of the gravest aspects of this series of events? Irish women between 25 and 60 years old, who are sexually active and are entitled to a service they can trust, have in the past week seen a service that in part at least has the hallmarks of a cottage industry. The idea of people setting up a laboratory of sorts in their kitchen or living room to assess smear tests is extraordinary. Does the Minister consider this domestic style of laboratory acceptable? Is he aware of whether it is extensive, whether it exists at all or whether it has been removed? If the system exists, who is partaking and at what standard? Does he approve of this kind of scientific analysis of something which is so vital to women's lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question that the methodology used in the screening of some of these smear tests is in any way acceptable. The manner in which these tests were conducted is not part of the system. The Deputy said that in some way this is a cottage industry; I ask her to accept this is not a typical situation as regards the screening of smear tests. We have been contacted by cytotechnicians and people in this field who are anxious that their professionalism is upheld. This is not recommended or accepted by anyone in the health service as an acceptable method of doing this work.</P>
      <P>That is clearly not the case as there is a requirement for cytotechnicians to view a test and for a second cytotechnician to look at it again. In the instance of a borderline case, it is necessary for a consultant pathologist to sign off on it. That clearly did not apply in this situation. For that reason we are taking every possible step to ensure the work which may have been done by any member of staff as a result of this will be dealt with comprehensively over a five year period as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a national cervical screening programme is online. It was not the objective of the committee to introduce a programme in 1999; the pilot was to have begun by 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board was supposed to do that. There was no prospect of a cervical screening programme prior to providing some resources. There was an absence of resources until recently as regards the staffing of existing laboratories and the need to fund phase 1 of a national cervical screening programme.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McManus that a national cervical screening programme would benefit the public health of women generally. One of the main problems with the opportunistic screening programme is that I, along with many in the health sector, am not satisfied that those who should be screened are being screened. Many women are being screened more than once within the five year period while others are not being screened at all. The purpose of moving from an opportunistic screening programme, as is the case at present, to a national screening programme would be to ensure a wider public health benefit. Whether it is in relation to breast or cervical screening, these are the benefits to the female population.</P>
      <P>It is important that when we introduce a national cervical screening programme, the present arrangements where women are tested more frequently than the five yearly interval will have to be dealt with by laboratories because it militates against the effective introduction of a national screening programme to test all of the women in the target group identified as requiring testing.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy McManus's contention that we are simply reviewing the matter as a result of this issue. As I said to Deputy Shatter, we have been proactive in this area, both as regards the introduction of phase 1 of the screening programme, which we hope will happen early next year and sooner if we can manage it, and the issue of accreditation. It is more than a month since we provided models to the joint working group to agree an accreditation model with those working in the sector concerned. Far from being complacent, we are anxious to deal with the matter generally, first as regards the accreditation of laboratories and second as regards moving ahead with phase 1 of the national screening programme as a matter of urgency, for which we have provided funds. As regards the specific issues which have arisen and the wider implications generally, we are comprehensively reviewing whatever needs to be reviewed so that public confidence in the system can be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister aware that Sligo General Hospital had handed the task of clearing a backlog of tests to a private company? If he was so aware, and it is inconceivable that he was not, what measures, if any, did he take to ensure the Dublin based private company had quality control standards similar to those in operation at Sligo General Hospital? It is unacceptable that so soon after the appalling and sometimes fatal mistakes made in blood transfusion that almost 70 women have had the harrowing experience of being told the results of tests conducted 18 months ago and initially reported as normal are abnormal.</P>
      <P>In his investigation, the Minister must reconcile the conflicting claims of the North-Western Health Board and the private Dublin based laboratory. On one hand, the North-Western Health Board stipulated that the Dublin based laboratory should use quality control standards similar to its own. On the other hand, the company has stated that it does not carry out smear tests and, therefore, it had to send a sample for examination by outside experts. Is such a confused approach acceptable in such a vital area for women? </P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Republic of Ireland 80 women die every year from cervical cancer? Comprehensive screening programmes have been introduced in England and most other EU countries over the past 11 years for the very basic reason that international evidence has conclusively shown that screening significantly reduces the incidence of cervical cancer. Is the Minister aware that screening is voluntary in this country at present? It is up to women to present themselves for screening but when they do they get less than a satisfactory response, in light of what has happened with private laboratories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered some of those questions. I explained the difference between opportunistic screening, which is the present system, and the benefits of bringing forward a national cervical screening programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The backlog arose because of the lack of resources being provided at that time for the laboratories to deal with the amount of work coming <Col N="453" /> through. This Administration has provided investment to deal with that backlog. We now have a far more satisfactory situation in relation to waiting times than was the case two and a half years ago. I know the Deputy was not a Member of the House at that time but he was probably a card carrying member.</P>
    <P>Any dispute which exists between the North-Western Health Board and Claymon Laboratories may have to be resolved in a forum outside this House. However, based on the facts presented to me and the North-Western Health Board's position on this matter, it appears that there was a breach of contract and it is taking advice accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that cervical smear testing should be a central element in the country's health programme for women? There is a great danger that the fiasco which occurred in the North-Western Health Board area will undermine national confidence in the integrity of these tests, which would make matters even worse. What steps does the Minister propose to take to assure women of the integrity of future tests and that they will be given proper and accurate results?</P>
      <P>The Minister may have already admitted this, but the backlog of 2,000 cases is a result of inadequate resourcing in Sligo where they have the facilities to do this in credited laboratories. Can the Minister guarantee that all future tests will be carried out in credited laboratories with the highest quality control certification and that accurate test results will be delivered to those who have taken them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy it was unfortunate that the only option available to the North-Western Health Board in 1997 was to have this work done by contract because the then Administration had not provided adequate resources for the health board to do it. Since then, we have provided resources to ensure the North-Western Health Board does not have to again face the prospect of having to contract out 25 per cent of its smear testing because of lack of resources in its laboratories to deal with the backlog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the waiting time in the North-Western Health Board is now between four and six weeks. We are dealing with a qualitatively different situation than that of two years ago; which one would expect, given the investment in laboratories and the recruitment of staff. However, there have been difficulties in recruiting staff because of the type of work involved, which is manual and will not be automated for another few years. Hospital and health board management have had problems in training up staff and in retaining them once they have been trained. That issue has been, and is being, addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> While this is a most unfortunate occurrence and I greatly sympathise with the 68 women who must be revisited to allow clarification, I make the point, without reducing the importance of this to individuals, that smear testing does not denote the condition. There is a ten to 15 year period before the condition arises, which is why five yearly intervals are suggested by the national cervical screening committee. All the medical evidence available to me suggests there would not be a different medical outcome for the persons concerned, once the retesting takes place. That is of major consolation. However, errors have take place and we must learn from the failures which occurred. I am anxious to ensure we get a comprehensive review of whatever tests need to be reviewed as a result of the evidence that has emerged in this case and to deal with the issues in the way I described in my address to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's various replies, is he giving an undertaking to this House that quality assurance mechanisms and the new standards that are to apply will have national application within a matter of weeks and, if so, from what date? Will the Minister give that undertaking to the House?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether there is a timeframe for determining the criteria to apply to the accreditation of laboratories? Will he agree that, as it is well over two years since the report addressed these issues, both he and his Department have been extraordinarily slow in implementing these recommendations and recognising the urgent need to so do? Can he give an assurance that, as a consequence of the events we have learned of in recent days, there will be a greater sense of urgency from the Department of Health and Children and the Minister about the need to ensure the accuracy of all results and to ensure proper quality control assurance mechanisms are in place, in the interests of women who rely on cervical screening as a life saving mechanism and so that they can obtain treatment in good time where it is required?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm to the Deputy, as I set out in my up to date report to the House on this, that the expert working group is finalising the protocols for quality assurance issues in laboratories in these matters. That has been the result of a great deal of deliberation on its part. I understand one more meeting should result in the finalisation of those issues. I will then immediately seek to have those recommendations and protocols implemented as a matter of urgency, as a result of what we have seen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current review will allow us to ensure that what happened here will not be repeated. Contracting work may not be a problem in itself, but <Col N="455" /> the manner in which this was subcontracted and dealt with is not acceptable and should not have occurred. We will have to ensure that there is every necessary mechanism in the system to prevent it recurring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that he will publish all the findings of his review, including the letters he sent to the two hospitals? I am sure he would agree that his giving full and frank information would help to restore public confidence. However, I am also concerned that some of the statements he has made in the House may not stand up in terms of contractual obligations. While I am sure they were said in good faith, I am concerned that there may be binding contractual arrangements in regard to subcontracting which could be applied against the particular laboratory.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House when the national cervical cancer screening programme will be fully implemented across the country? I am not talking about pilot schemes but about a proper national programme which was outlined in the national cancer strategy published by his Department. When does he intend the national programme to be fully operational?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards publication, my job is to bring all the facts to the House either at the request of Deputies or on my own behalf. As regards correspondence with the hospitals, that matter will be dealt with between the Department and the hospitals. The Deputy can rest assured that all relevant facts in relation to this matter and the review of the 350 smear tests currently in the two voluntary hospitals and, as a result of my instruction to the hospitals, the wider review of the staff who handled these smear tests will be in the public domain as it is in the public interest to do so. The Deputy should have no fears about me discharging my duties in that regard.</P>
      <P>As regards a target date for setting up the programme nationally, it is my intention to proceed with phase one of the national cervical screening programme as a matter of urgency based on the advice of the expert committee. In the same way as we have seen the benefits of starting the breast screening programme in recent weeks, the committee is the best way to proceed and to take the medical advice accordingly. The chairman is aware from my discussions with him that we are anxious to move on this as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come here today, Sir, to perform a very difficult duty for which there is no precedent in this State.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that on 1 April I provided the House with the information in my possession at that time concerning the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of DPP v. Sheedy which came before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 12 November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to repeat the details I provided on that occasion but, in summary, I informed the House that rumours had been circulating about the circumstances leading up to the relisting of this case which suggested the possibility that there had been some form of impropriety involved; I became aware of these rumours, for the first time, when I received a phone call from the Attorney General, while I <Col N="462" /> was on European Union business in Berlin on the evening of 10 February last; I decided that an immediate inquiry should be established, as a result of which the Attorney General contacted the Chief Justice who initiated inquiries; I instructed that the Garda authorities should be contacted and that official level inquiries into what happened should be commenced immediately by my Department; finally I said that I personally had no hand, act or part in the relisting of the Sheedy case.</P>
    <P>The report of the Chief Justice was completed and presented to the Attorney General on 14 April. I received it from the Attorney General that afternoon and presented it to the Government at its meeting on Friday last, 16 April.</P>
    <P>At its meeting, the Government decided, among other things, to make the report available immediately to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. It decided also that letters should be addressed in the following terms to Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly:</P>
    <P>The Government decided at its meeting this morning to forward the report of the Chief Justice to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to advise you that the Government will consider, at its meeting next Tuesday, proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, pursuant to Article 35.4.1º, for your removal, on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report, amount to misbehaviour within the meaning of the said provision of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the meantime both judges have tendered their resignations from office. There are severance terms which I shall disclose to the House in the course of my statement. The Government is prepared to accept those terms and I will be commending them to the House.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, a Cheann Comhairle, again with Government agreement, I transmitted the report on the inquiry carried out by my Depatment, which was finalised yesterday evening, to the Joint Committee already referred to. I will comment further on this report later in my statement. At this point, however, I wish to inform the House that the Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, to whom the report was supplied yesterday evening, has tendered his resignation with effect from today. There are severance terms in his case which I shall disclose and commend to the House in the course of my statement.</P>
    <P>Before we say anything about those whose involvement in this tragic case has been the subject of widespread public attention in recent weeks, we should first remind ourselves that the primary victims in all that has taken place were the late Mrs. Anne Ryan, Mr. John Ryan and their family. Their pain has been greater than any <Col N="463" /> other. Mr. Ryan and his young family have suffered a loss which can never be reversed. It is not in the least surprising that the circumstances leading to the release of the man who was convicted of the traffic offences which caused Mrs. Ryan's death would have caused the family concern and distress. It is not in the least surprising either that it has given rise to great public disquiet.</P>
    <P>The duty I must perform today is a difficult one. I have known Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty for many years. The three men whose careers have now ended are known to many Deputies. They are men whose professionalism over many years has been respected. Moreover, in the opinion of the Chief Justice, the actions of one judge damaged the administration of justice. In the other case, the judge's actions compromised the administration of justice. The actions of the County Registrar fell well short of expected standards. These are serious charges. The Government had to act and it has done so.</P>
    <P>Before I outline the severance terms, I wish to offer some observations about the approach we should adopt in conducting this debate. We must not allow extraneous or unworthy considerations to cloud our judgment. We have heard suggestions in recent days to the effect that politicians and others have been under scrutiny and subject to criticism by the Judiciary over the years and that it is now the turn of the politicians to have their say. Considerations of this kind have no place in this debate. If we allowed such considerations to come into play, it would amount not only to an injustice but would sully our standing as public representatives.</P>
    <P>It has been in the best tradition of the Judiciary since the foundation of the State to proceed fairly and objectively. They have served the State well in doing so. When it comes to our turn to consider the cases we are discussing today, we are duty and conscience bound to maintain the same high standards.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the severance terms to which, as I said, the Government has signalled its agreement. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, now aged 61, has nine years service as a judge of the Supreme Court. The pension and gratuity to which he would be entitled at about age 67, based on his existing service, would be on pension just over £26,000 and on gratuity just over £79,000. Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, now aged 50, has almost seven years service as a judge of the Circuit Court and five months as a judge of the High Court. The pension and gratuity to which he would be entitled at age 65, based on his existing service, would be on pension just over £17,000 and on gratuity just over £51,000. Mr. Michael Quinlan, now aged 45, has over seven years service as County Registrar. The pension and gratuity to which he would be entitled at age 65, based on his existing service, would be on pension just over £11,500 and on gratuity just over £34,700. I emphasise that these sums are entitlements and it is estab<Col N="464" /> lished that they are not entitlements which stand forfeited by virtue of what has taken place.</P>
    <P>The Government has considered the question of severance payments in all three cases carefully. It has taken account of the fact that all three men have tendered their resignations, which was the right and honourable course for them to take and, in the case of the two judges, avoided the need for a procedure in the House which would have been without precedent. The impeachment procedure had the potential to cause the most serious damage to maintaining the greatly important doctrine of the separation of powers in this jurisdiction. There is no suggestion that any of the three were motivated by any prospect of achieving personal gain or reward.</P>
    <P>The Government has concluded that pensions should be payable in each case, commencing now, but, having regard to this, that no gratuities should be paid. The pensions to which the Government is prepared to agree are in the case of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, £40,000 per annum; in the case of Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, £30,000 per annum, and in the in case of Mr. Michael Quinlan, £15,000 per annum. These pensions would fall to be adjusted, in the normal manner, in line with those of other retired judges and County Registrars.</P>
    <P>In assessing the merits of making these payments, Deputies may wish to know what the loss of office has meant in financial terms to each of the men concerned. It is not easy to be precise, but assuming the two judges had retired at age 70 &ndash; the maximum retirement age for Mr. Justice O'Flaherty is 72 and for Mr. Justice Kelly it is 70 &ndash; and the County Registrar at age 65 &ndash; the maximum retirement age is 70 &ndash; the loss in gross earnings at current levels up to retirement would have been in the case of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty of the order of £0.5 million; in the case of Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly of the order of £1.1 million and in the case of Mr. Michael Quinlan of the order of £0.8 million.</P>
    <P>There would also be an additional loss, subsequent to retirement, by virtue of the fact that their pension payments would be much lower than they would be otherwise. While it can be said that the loss of office may open up the prospect of alternative careers and earnings from other sources, it is nevertheless the case that the financial losses arising from their resignations are substantial. I commend the pension payments I have outlined to the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the final part of the report prepared by my Department, which is entitled &ldquo;Avoiding a Repetition&rdquo;. This contains a number of far reaching recommendations for change, the fundamental purpose of which is to restore confidence in the judicial system which many people will consider to have been damaged by recent events. The recommendations deal with issues such as the performance of duties by court staff; judicial conduct and ethics; the review of sentences and the establishment of a parole board; the method of appointment of County Registrars; <Col N="465" /> the method of listing of court cases; the assignment of cases to particular judges; court rules; plea negotiations and the formal transfer of responsibility for the administration of the courts service to the new courts board.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss these recommendations in detail today and I believe that Deputies will require time to study them. The report has been referred this afternoon to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights for detailed consideration. My officials and I will be available to assist the committee in its consideration of the report. I understand that in its preliminary examination earlier today committee members expressed the view that the recommendations were far reaching. However, my preliminary reaction is that they are far reaching, comprehensive and positive.</P>
    <P>At its meeting today the Government considered them and agreed that it will discuss them again shortly to ensure that all necessary measures are identified and taken to prevent this ever happening again. I will listen to what Deputies have to say about the recommendations or any other recommendations they may wish to advance.</P>
    <P>As a doctrine the separation of powers has tended to focus exclusively on its application to judicial independence. Perhaps this is because such discussion that has taken place has been in court precincts. Other principles related to that doctrine are mentioned rarely but deserve some reference in this debate. I refer to the supremacy of the Constitution and the role and responsibilities of the Government and Oireachtas as servants of the Constitution and the people. As we learn at times like this, in the words of James Madison one of the fathers of the US Constitution, &ldquo;We must perceive that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the concept of independence in the discharge of the respective functions stands compromised but is simply a recognition of the reality that each of the powers of the State overlaps to some degree with the other powers. This is why the Government appoints judges and the Legislature can make laws that bind them and can remove them from office for stated misbehaviour. It does not mean, however, that in the discharge of their purely judicial task of interpreting and applying the law in individual cases, either the Government or anyone else can intervene.</P>
    <P>This is the system of checks and balances which preserve our liberties and we should be profoundly grateful that they are in place whatever the frequency with which they are invoked. The doctrine of separation of powers is in place in our Constitution to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power and to prevent injustice.</P>
    <P>It was not found necessary by the Government to invoke the power of the Oireachtas in relation to the removal of two judges this week but the power was, and is, there if needed. This is one of <Col N="466" /> the benefits of our Constitution which is turning out to be, in the words used to me on one occasion by the late Brian Lenihan, &ldquo;a rather robust document&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have been extraordinarily well served by our courts system.</P>
    <P>Down the years our judges and court staff at all levels have given great service to the nation. That tradition of service is reflected well in the judicial oath taken by all judges:</P>
    <P>In the presence of Almighty God, I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and power execute the office of Judge without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man, and I will uphold the Constitution and the laws. May God direct and sustain me.</P>
    <P>That oath has been followed by all judges and is their guiding principle &ndash; as it must be if we are to have the justice system our Constitution envisaged and our people expect.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined that the lessons we have learnt from recent events will be fully taken on board and that confidence in the judicial system, which is vital to the proper functioning of democracy and which has existed since the foundation of the State, will be fully restored.</P>
    <P>I am also determined, as is every Deputy in this House, that in the interests of the public we serve we will not have to go through events like those of recent days again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday the Minister went on radio and television holding up the Sheedy case as proof positive that the constitutional mechanism of checks and balances had worked in this instance. He has again alluded to that today. The reality is that the mechanism did not work. The system did not bring it about. It was chance recognition on the part of a relative of the late Mrs. Anne Ryan that set in train a chain of events and a series of inquiries involving the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions that set the present process in motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the DPP taking the case for judicial review to the High Court that brought the matter to public attention. It was the media publicity surrounding the judicial review in the High Court and the mysterious voluntary return of Sheedy to Mountjoy Prison which gave rise to the obvious questions surrounding the case. It was the raising of this case in this Chamber by Deputy Howlin and by me three weeks ago that gave this case impetus and urgency. It was only at that stage that the Chief Justice was asked to undertake his investigation and to prepare a report. It was not the constitutional system of checks and balances but the fortuitous sighting of the defendant that brought this about. Philip Sheedy was already a free man from 12 November 1998 until 25 March 1999. Had he been living in Mayo, for example, <Col N="467" /> instead of Dublin, in all probability he would never have been seen, he would still be at large and the bizarre circumstances surrounding his release would never have come to public attention.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph in the conclusions of the report of the Chief Justice in respect of the performance of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty says it all:</P>
    <P>I conclude that Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty's intervention was inappropriate and unwise, that it left his motives and action open to misinterpretation and that it was therefore damaging to the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I commend Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty for doing the honourable thing and for resigning. It was the proper course of action. I believe his position was untenable. Once a judge is deemed, by a person holding the status of the office of Chief Justice, to have, by his actions, damaged the administration of justice, it would be impossible for him to continue in office. While Mr. Justice O'Flaherty continued to assert that he had done nothing wrong, it was a view clearly not shared by the Chief Justice. The fundamental principle of the equality of all citizens before the law goes to the very heart of judicial performance and even the appearance of improper interference cannot be countenanced in a democracy.</P>
    <P>On 30 March, when I first raised this issue by way of an Adjournment Debate, I stated in my speech: &ldquo;This is an issue of sufficient gravity that unless a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming, we may have to seek to invoke Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution.&rdquo;. It was not said with any degree of appetite. It was not a prospect that one would particularly relish. However it was put into the Constitution for a specific purpose &ndash; to enable the Oireachtas to remove a judge for &ldquo;stated misbehaviour or incapacity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From the outset of this case coming to my attention, I have questioned the handling of the case by Mr. Justice Kelly. I questioned his right to hear the review of sentence case, the non-notification and non-appearance in court of the DPP's Office or the Garda and the setting aside of three years of the four year sentence.</P>
    <P>While it was obvious that the case had been badly handled, even our worst suspicions could not have prepared us for the damning denunciation by the Chief Justice of the handling of the case by Mr. Justice Kelly. We thank the Chief Justice for the clarity of his language and conclusions.</P>
    <P>The case should not have been heard by Mr. Justice Kelly but should have gone to the Court of Criminal Appeal or have been dealt with by way of judicial review to the High Court. The judge was allegedly concerned about Sheedy's mental condition &ldquo;at the moment&rdquo;. Yet the only two medical reports Mr. Justice Kelly had on file were 35 months and 19 months out date, respectively. &ldquo;I take the view&rdquo;, said the Chief Justice, <Col N="468" />&ldquo;that Judge Kelly should not, in the circumstances, have entered on a review of sentence imposed by one of his colleagues. I conclude, moreover, that having entered on a review, he failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge. In these circumstances, I conclude that Judge Kelly's handling of this matter compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;. Clearly the Oireachtas was left with no option but to invoke Article 35 had Mr. Justice Kelly not belatedly resigned from office.</P>
    <P>We do not know why Mr. Justice Kelly did what he did. Why did he suggest originally to Judge Matthews that it was a case that merited a suspended sentence when his judicial track record was one of tough sentencing? Why did Mr. Justice Kelly hear the case on 12 November 1998 knowing, as he must have done, that he was not empowered to do so? Why did he pretend to the court that there was an up-to-date psychological report when clearly this was not so? Why did Mr. Justice Kelly request that counsel for the defence, some time after the court case, obtain an up-to-date psychological/psychiatric report with a view to having this added to his file? Why was the case jumped from number 19 on the list to number 1? Why did the judge not query the fact that the DPP and the Garda were not in court? Why did the judge, as is evident from the court transcript, effectively take over the running of the case, concluding it in approximately 90 seconds? What particular interest had Mr. Justice Kelly in the Sheedy case to compel him to go to such extraordinary extremes and to depart so seriously from precedent and established procedure?  </P>
    <P>In my contribution in the Dáil on this issue on 1 April last, I pointed to the central issues surrounding this controversy when I dwelt on and asked questions about the wrongful listing of the case before Mr. Justice Kelly on 12 November. This is the central focus of the report which has just come to hand and which was the subject of inquiries by officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The appendices to the report of the Chief Justice point up major conflicts and contradictions in the versions of the various officials involved. What is acknowledged is that the case was listed by Mr. Brendan O'Donnell of the Circuit Court office, acting on the instructions of Mr. Michael Quinlan, County Registrar. What has not been resolved are the serious allegations made by Mr. Brian McGreary, Law Clerk in the Chief State Solicitor's office, in the memorandum for file dated 9 February 1999 and listed under Annex 12. The allegations contained in the memorandum are extremely serious and should be investigated further.</P>
    <P>When Opposition spokesman on Justice, the Minister repeatedly pointed out to his predecessor in this House that the Minister for Justice is responsible for the administration of the courts. The copy of the letter of 6 April 1998 from the Chief State Solicitor to the Attorney General is intriguing in many ways &ndash; this is an annex to the report of the Chief Justice. We are now in the <Col N="469" /> middle of a major judicial and constitutional controversy. One would expect, as should be the norm, that there would be meticulous attention to detail, yet the letter from the Chief State Solicitor is wrongly dated; it should be 6 April 1999, not 6 April 1998. On the first page of the letter the date for the review of sentence is given as 12 November 1998 but on the second page it is given as 20 November. The letter goes on to state: &ldquo;I have been unable to establish whether or not it was listed out of sequence&rdquo;. That is extraordinary. This case did not happen in the dim and distant past but a mere five months ago. Surely there are records of the way the cases were listed and how they were called. Were these records sought? Were they checked? The Chief State Solicitor's letter goes on to state: &ldquo;Mr. Browne was unaware that the review of the case was vacated&rdquo;. How could that be the position? Surely the fact that the right of sentence review had been vacated in November 1997 would be clearly indicated on the file.</P>
    <P>Another incredible aspect of this matter is the description in the Chief State Solicitor's letter of what actually happened in the court on 12 November 1998. The letter states: &ldquo;This Office had assigned Ms Eileen Creedon, Senior Assistant Solicitor (who had that week taken over as Section Head of the Criminal Trials Section of the Office) and Mr. Stephen Browne, Legal Clerk, to appear in Court 24 on 12th November 1998&rdquo;. The letter goes on to state: </P>
    <P>Ms Creedon was called out of court to answer the telephone. While Ms Creedon was absent at the telephone, item number 19 (the Sheedy case) was called by Judge Kelly.</P>
    <P>One accepts that Mr. Browne did not have the right of audience in court but why did Mr. Browne not immediately fetch Ms Creedon so that the State's interests would be represented in court? We are told in the Chief State Solicitor's letter that Mr. Browne's recollection of the matter being vacated is &ldquo;quite hazy&rdquo;, yet in the next sentence we are told that &ldquo;Mr. Browne believed the case would be removed from the list&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is clearly an administrative issue and it is an issue for the Minister. There is incredible slovenliness and inconsistency in the State's handling of this matter. Undoubtedly there were major judicial misdemeanours but there was clear negligence and laxity on the part of the State. That was a major contributory factor to this debacle. Had the Chief State Solicitor's office been up to speed, Mr. Justice Kelly might have been thwarted in his patent mishandling of this case.</P>
    <P>This whole saga is undoubtedly a watershed. A Supreme Court judge and a High Court judge are gone from the Bench. While much has been said and written about the damage done to the central pillar of our Constitution and democracy, it is far better that it be confronted than concealed. The judicial system will be improved, enhanced and <Col N="470" /> invigorated and will be the better for it. Nobody expects infallibility but we are entitled to be assured in respect of standards. We are now into an era of accountability when everybody, no matter at what level, is accountable to somebody.</P>
    <P>The Hamilton report shows clearly that the Judiciary has the capacity to be incisively and piercingly self-critical. In the final paragraph of his report, the Chief Justice states: &ldquo;I must, and do, emphasise that I, as Chief Justice, have no jurisdiction, whether under the provisions of the Constitution or any Act passed by the Oireachtas, to make recommendations arising out of the facts in this case and I do not, for this reason, propose to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some considerable period that when it comes to discipline for judges, there is a glaring anomaly which has not been addressed. It is literally a case of all or nothing. The only procedure for dealing with stated misdemeanour or incapacity is the impeachment process contained in Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution. It has been recommended on more than one occasion that the obvious need for a range of sanctions to deal with situations of varying degrees should be addressed. The constitutional review body, chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker, dealt at length with the issue of judicial independence. It stated: &ldquo;While the Review Group is of the opinion that such &lsquo;disciplinary' provisions short of impeachment as at present applied to the District Court are probably not inconsistent with Article 35.2 or otherwise unconstitutional, lest there be any doubt in the matter, Article 35.2 should be amended to allow for regulation by the Judges themselves of judicial conduct, in accordance with the doctrine on the separation of powers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A possible vehicle could be the board of the Courts Service or a modified version of the board of the Courts Service which, while having somewhat of a legal overload, has nonetheless a nominee of the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the courts, a person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a person who has relevant knowledge of experience in commerce, finance or administration. It is clear this issue can no longer be postponed and will be a central element in restoring public confidence in the judicial process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which we received this afternoon. It follows the same high standard as that set by the report of the Chief Justice; it is delivered in clear, unadorned language. However, I strongly dispute paragraph 1.3 which states, in relation to inquiries carried out into the role of the Chief State Solicitor's office, as follows: &ldquo;It is not a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, nor for his Department, to offer any observations one way or the other on the handling of the case generally by that office&rdquo;. Who will answer in relation to the performance of the Chief State Solicitor if the Minister will not answer? It is my understanding that it was the responsibility of the Chief Justice to inquire into <Col N="471" /> actions involving members of the Judiciary and the clear responsibility of the Minister's Department officials to deal with the actions of officials at any level under the aegis of his Department.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but the Minister's officials were assigned to carry out this investigation and they have not done so in relation to this office. The Minister is clearly shirking his responsibility and we will not permit him to do so.</P>
      <P>The report and its contents clearly are the reason the County Registrar has seen it as his responsibility to resign from office. It is clear that the County Registrar's role in the entire affair was central and influential. The report also acknowledges, however, that there are many questions as to what happened in this case to which we do not have the answers at this time. Essentially this remains the problem. Many questions remain as to the motivation behind the entire handling of this affair from its beginning to its conclusion, and we must continue to pursue these issues. The Department's report contains many worthwhile recommendations in relation to various areas of court administration, including the appointment of senior officials. All of these will have to be considered in due course.</P>
      <P>On a personal level one has to have sympathy with the individuals involved. Ultimately, however, the cold, clinical integrity of the Constitution has to take precedence over personal considerations and the most exacting standards must apply. The course of justice was clearly perverted in this case. It was perverted and undermined by people at a very senior level, judicially and administratively. This must never happen again.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 31 March 1999, when taking the Order of Business I made comments in this House which implied that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, might have had an improper personal involvement with particular reference to the promotion of one of the judges involved in the Sheedy case. I withdraw any inferences made or taken from my comments that the Minister might have known about the Sheedy case before he recommended a person for judicial appointment to the Government. I fully accept the Minister's statement made the next day, 1 April, that the first he knew about this case was on 10 February 1999 when he was informed by <Col N="472" /> the Attorney General. Although the Minister was not present on 31 March to hear my comments I have no hesitation in apologising unequivocally to him for this incorrect inference.</P>
      <P>I would like to turn to the circumstances now facing us as a result of Mr. Justice Hamilton's report and the report we received this afternoon which, unfortunately, I have not had time to read. One issue must remain to the fore during this debate. On 14 March 1996 Anne Ryan was, like many other housewives and mothers, going about her business dealing with her family and her home. By 15 March 1996 she was taken from her faimly in the most appalling circumstances and her husband and children were injured. John Ryan, his children and Anne Ryan's extended family are innocent victims in this saga. Philip Sheedy and his family must also be suffering but Mr. Sheedy was responsible for his actions and had to the face the consequences. There are other victims in this tragic case.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Hamilton's report, which I commend for its thoroughness in obtaining statements from all relevant people, does not answer all the questions that remain about the handling of the Sheedy case. The report we received today may answer some of these questions. On 11 February 1999 the Attorney General was advised by the Minister to speak to the Chief Justice about carrying out an investigation. Why did the Minister not seek to have that report completed more speedily? The Minister has responsibility for ensuring that the investigation into such a grave matter should have been carried out more speedily. If that had been the case, the Opposition would not have had to make so many demands for answers.</P>
      <P>Why did Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, not have more information to give the Dáil on 30 March 1999 &ndash; seven weeks after the commencement of the inquiry? Why did it take the Minister six days to contact the county registrar and a further 55 days to complete the report on the role of his staff? Why did he allow 28 days to elapse before seeking a reply from the Chief State Solicitor's office to a letter dated 3 March 1999? The Minister will recall from his time in Opposition how diligent he was in demanding speedy and immediate answers to any controversy that arose. He is to be criticised for not practising such speed in this inquiry.</P>
      <P>The appendices attached to Mr. Justice Hamilton's report include a number of contradictory statements and unanswered questions. Mr. Justice Hamilton did not make a judgment on a number of these contradictory statements but appears to have drawn certain conclusions from them. Have the Minister or the Government formed an opinion as to who to believe in the various contradictory statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the statement by Mr. Brian McGreary in annex 12 relates to a meeting he had with Mr. Luigi Rea, BL, outside the Law Library on 3 February 1999. The reference is graphic in <Col N="473" /> its detail about the personnel involved in getting Philip Sheedy's case listed. Mr. Rea differs in his recollection of this conversation, but if Mr. McGreary is to be believed we need to know how many people were aware of the involvement of at least two judges in the case, when they knew this and what effect it had on any discussions or decisions that might have been taken as a result of that knowledge?</P>
    <P>There are other questions which I want to raise and I hope the Minister will answer them today. On the one o'clock news former Judge Kelly stated that he had been requested by the Executive to offer his resignation. The Minister read the letter into the record of the House. Is that the full letter? Can the Minister give the exact contents of the letters written to the two judges and were they worded as indicated by Mr. Kelly on the one o'clock news?</P>
    <P>By what authority did the Government ask for the resignation given that it is a matter for the President to appoint judges to the High Court and the Supreme Court? I am not challenging the Minister but I wish to know if he has given the House the full content of the letter sent to the two judges. Former Judge Kelly seemed to give a different interpretation.</P>
    <P>Former Judge Kelly indicated that it was his practice to read the files before making his judgment to suspend the remaining three years of Mr. Sheedy's sentence. Can the Minister tell the House if a request was made to the Chief State Solicitor's office to have the full file available in the court on 12 November? If such a request was made would this not have been an indication to the Chief State Solicitor's office that the case was coming up and that the DPP should have been informed so that a representative could be present?</P>
    <P>If the file was not requested from the Chief State Solicitor's office can the Minister tell us when the file would have been available to the judge before he reached his decision? Did the judge make his decision relying on memory of the file which he had seen at some time in 1997?</P>
    <P>The handling and outcome of this case by some but not all involved has been disastrous from the start. It has undermined people's faith in the judicial system and strengthened the feeling that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. Many people have suffered, some innocently, and more have suffered because of their own actions. It must be a painful and difficult time for the families of the three people at the centre of this controversy who had to face the ultimate sanction for their actions.</P>
    <P>The credibility of the judicial system is paramount in a democracy and the House should make no apology for raising the serious implications of this case so that confidence can be restored and the people can be satisfied that our judicial system is equal to all who seek justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people have suffered significantly as a result of this bizarre and, as yet, <Col N="474" /> not fully explained affair. Careers have been lost, reputations damaged, incomes decreased and families put under stress. However, we must never lose sight of the fact that Anne Ryan's family has suffered the most and endured the greatest loss.</P>
      <P>The events which caused an earthquake in our legal and judicial system have their origins in what would have been a normal domestic outing for many families. A young mother, Anne Ryan, her husband John and their two small children were returning from a family swim in Tallaght. A new car, driven in a reckless manner by a young man with more than the legally permitted level of alcohol in his blood flew across a roundabout and struck the Ryans' car in a manner which a witness likened to a missile.</P>
      <P>The result was a young woman was taken in the prime of her life, a husband seriously injured and deprived, in all probability, of the chance of ever working again. Two young children were robbed of the care and affection of their mother. This family was left to mourn alone with no visits from the great and the good and little media interest in the death.</P>
      <P>The Ryan family had an expectation that the State would see that justice was done and that the person responsible for Anne Ryan's death would be brought to account and dealt with in a fitting manner by our courts system. Nothing could compensate the Ryan family for their loss but they must have drawn some comfort when the court case was completed and the sentence imposed.</P>
      <P>Imagine the additional anguish that must have been caused to John Ryan and his family when they were informed by a third party that the person convicted in connection with Anne Ryan's death was free and back at work within a year of his conviction. John Ryan showed great courage in beginning to ask questions and demand explanations as to how this happened. Had he not done so we would never have learned of the extraordinary events outlined in the report of Mr. Justice Hamilton published last week. There are no checks and balances which would have exposed the sequence of events had Mr. Ryan and his family not been so diligent.</P>
      <P>The resignations of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Kelly were inevitable given the damning conclusions of the Chief Justice's report. It was difficult to see how Mr. Justice O'Flaherty could continue to sit on the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, with the Chief Justice who had concluded that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's actions &ldquo;were damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo;. Similarly, it was impossible to see how Mr. Justice Kelly could possibly continue in office given the conclusion that &ldquo;he failed to conduct the [Sheedy] case in a manner befitting a judge&rdquo; and that his actions &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks to Mr. Justice Hamilton's report we now know the basic sequence of events. We know the how, the when and the where. However, we still do not know the why. I do not believe the <Col N="475" /> matter can be considered closed until we know why those involved acted in the manner they did and it is incumbent on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government to come up with clear and practical proposals as to how that knowledge can be obtained. It is not acceptable to close the book on these events, accept that three distinguished public servants have ended their careers and simply move on to new business. The public wants answers to the outstanding questions, particularly with regard to why those centrally involved in this case took the actions they did.</P>
    <P>The departmental report which Members received earlier today states in paragraph 1.5:</P>
    <P>We have been able to reach certain conclusions, however, in relation to the central issues we examined and we believe that one of these is so serious that an immediate Report must be made, even if it is the case that the Report, taken as a whole, leaves questions unanswered that will, no doubt, be raised in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the authors of the report, the senior officials in the Department, regard this as an interim report that had to be made on the basis of the seriousness of the central contentions involved and that there are further serious and significant questions yet to be answered.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice made it clear that in drawing his conclusions he was relying on uncontested facts. However, there are many contested issues and disputed versions of events contained in the appendices to his report. These, also, require full explanation. Indeed, the extent to which distinguished judges, lawyers and court officials disagree on such basic issues as whether meetings took place and who said what to whom is quite astonishing. There are also legitimate questions to be answered by the Minister about the delay in acting when these matters were brought to his attention and about a certain tardiness in bringing the knowledge he had to the attention of the Dáil, which is his constitutional duty. The role of the Minister is clear. He is elected by the Members of this House, is accountable to it and he is required to bring information to the House when it is sought by the Members.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about compassion in this case. Where was the Minister's compassion when, on 15 February, my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, wrote to him setting out the essence of the case and requesting that</P>
    <P>you would direct whomsoever is appropriate in your Department to let me know on behalf of the Ryan family what is the official position in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. John Ryan telephoned Deputy Rabbitte's office on Friday, 12 February, and faxed a copy of his, Mr. Ryan's, letter of 11 February to Deputy Rabbitte. The Deputy met Mr. Ryan on Monday, <Col N="476" /> 15 February, after which he communicated that same day with the Minister. The Minister's office sent the usual perfunctory acknowledgement on 17 February promising that &ldquo;a further letter will be addressed to you in this matter in the near future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Despite reminders, the Minister did not respond and eventually, on 12 March, Deputy Rabbitte contacted the Office of the Chief State Solicitor directly. In stark contrast to the response received from the Minister and his office, the Chief State Solicitor was most helpful. Having spoken to Deputy Rabbitte on the telephone, he then wrote to Deputy Rabbitte on 19 March, a letter which Deputy Rabbitte passed on to Mr. Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The content of the letter was enlightening in light of the facts we now know. The letter was a comfort for the Ryans. They would be waiting for comfort if they expected it to be provided by the Minister or his office.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General contacted the Minister about the case on 10 February. Mr. Ryan wrote to the Minister on 11 February and Deputy Rabbitte wrote to the Minister on 15 February. The very least that can be said is that no urgency attached to the Minister's inquiries until the matter became the focus of media, public and political attention.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of why, when the matter was raised on the Adjournment by myself and Deputy Jim Higgins on 30 March, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was sent to House to deliver a script that contained nothing more than a restatement of the basic sequence of events and contained no information that was not already in the public domain. His response was flimsy and inadequate and, in light of the information that was in the possession of the Department and the Minister, a contempt for this House and the Deputies who sought information, as was their right. Two days later, the Minister made a statement to the Dáil which contained quite a lot of information, much of which, it was clear, had been available to the Department at the time the Minister of State made his statement.</P>
      <P>The Minister is constitutionally responsible to this House. He has no right to drip feed information to it. If he could not be present on 30 March, as was understandable, the Minister of State representing him should have outlined the full facts as were known and as were requested by Opposition Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the failure of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to deal with the matter as promptly as he could have, particularly when it was drawn to his attention by Deputy Rabbitte, and the failure to provide available information to the Dáil when the Minister of State replied to the Adjournment Debate on 30 March simply added to the climate of suspicion and doubt surrounding the affair at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The Minister spoke earlier about the role of this House and the Ceann Comhairle, opening the debate, spoke about the restrictions which applied to Members. We have allowed many restrictions to be established by convention which circumscribe how Members deal with matters. It is time the House stopped allowing itself to be constantly circumscribed. Members of the House have constitutional duties to perform on behalf of the people who elect us and we are accountable for them. The role of the Oireachtas should be extended and expanded in the democratic interest, not further circumscribed and restricted.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary is a key pillar of our democratic system. It has generally served the country well and, as a group, has acted in a courageous and independent manner on many occasions. Many basic civil rights have been won through courageous decisions taken by the Judiciary, not by the determination of the Oireachtas. The resignations of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Kelly have averted further damage to this important institution but it would be a mistake to bury our heads in the sand and to ignore the fact that confidence in the judicial system has been severely dented by the events of recent weeks. Failure to deal with the remaining unanswered questions will further erode public confidence.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary plays an increasingly central role in society. There was a significant increase in the number of High Court and Circuit Court judges appointed by this and the previous Government. High Court judges have been called on to carry out difficult and onerous work in various tribunals of inquiry. Citizens resort to the courts to seek justice or to secure compensation far more frequently now than ten, 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>The principle of the separation of the judicial and Government systems is central to our democracy, as is the crucial independence of the courts. However, the constitutional framework governing the relationship between the Executive and the courts which may have been appropriate in the 1930s may not be adequate in the changed legal environment which operates as we approach the 21st century.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute requirement that there should be no interference by the Government or the Oireachtas in the judicial process. However, it is not satisfactory that there should be no point of appeal when the conduct of a judge is called into question or that there would not be a system for investigating bona fide complaints. It is particularly unacceptable that the only sanction available against a judge is the procedure for impeachment by the Oireachtas set out in Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I want to ask the Minister why the report of the working group on a courts commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and dealing with judicial conduct and ethics, which was submitted to the Government on 28 November last has yet to be published. Its recommendations have taken on an added importance in the light of the current controversy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> We need to look at systems which operate in other jurisdictions, particularly those which share common legal principles with us, and draw upon their experiences. The Canadian procedure which allows the president of each court to exercise a disciplinary function and which provides for an independent committee in respect of the highest court could be a practical and valuable example for us to follow.</P>
    <P>I have accepted from the outset that there was nothing to suggest direct ministerial involvement in any of the events which led to the release of Mr. Sheedy but that does not absolve the Minister of overall responsibility for ensuring that the administration of justice is carried out in a fair way and that the public has confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to today's debate was wholly inadequate. The bulk of his statement was taken up with financial aspects, working out in actuarial terms what the principals involved might have earned had they continued in their present positions. The putative future earnings of any of these gentlemen is of little relevance or consequence. I do not begrudge fair play to anyone. Notwithstanding the conclusions reached by the Chief Justice, it is clearly appropriate that adequate pension provisions should be made for the judges who have resigned. However, I suspect that more than one taxpayer will raise their eyebrows at the fact that if Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly were 65 years of age today, his pension entitlement would be £17,000 per year but that, as a result of mishandling a case, he will receive an immediate pension of £30,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Before concluding his speech, the Minister said that he wanted to make a brief comment on avoiding repetition. Ensuring that there will never be a repetition of this case should have formed the meat and substance of his presentation. The principle that all people, regardless of political or social background, should be treated equally before the courts is one that must be cherished and defended. That is the primary duty of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Oireachtas. Considerable work remains to be done before all the facts of this case are known fully and before public confidence in the administration of justice in this country is restored.</P>

      <P>People who have appeared before the courts of former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Kelly now find themselves on the horns of a dilemma. How many undelivered judgments exist in the case of former Mr. Justice Kelly and former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in his capacity both as a Supreme Court judge and an <i>ex officio </i>member of the High Court? If cases must be reheard, will the Minister give the House an assurance that the costs involved will not be visited on the unfortunate litigants who are the victims of this situation?</P>

      <P>Investigations to date in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicate that two cases which were before Mr. Justice Kelly, involving a civil action and extradition, will need to be reheard. In the case of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, we are not yet certain of the precise number of cases involved. We hope to complete our examination of that matter in the near future. With regard to the costs involved, the Department will consider carefully and sympathetically the costs which arise for litigants whose cases have to be reheard.</P>

      <P>I have three related questions. On the basis that the reports of the Chief Justice and the Department acknowledge that their conclusions are based solely on uncontested facts and given that issues of disputed fact remain, giving rise to widespread public and media speculation on the motives involved, will the Minister indicate the measures he intends to take to resolve the remaining issues? Does he agree the reputation of the judiciary and confidence in the administration of justice will not be fully restored until the public understands what has taken place and the motivation behind it? What is the Minister's interpretation of paragraph 1.5 of the Department's report which I quoted in my contribution? Does the Minister share the view that it is merely an interim report and how does he intend to follow through on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that there are disputed facts &ndash; there can be no question about this. It must be clear to everybody that a tribunal of inquiry is necessary if the disputed facts are to be resolved. Contrary to what Deputies have stated, I submit that far from being lethargic, this inquiry was extremely expeditious and comprehensive on every front. It must be recalled that judicial review proceedings were initiated on 22 February and did not terminate until 25 March. The Chief Justice makes it clear in his report that it would have been wrong for him to proceed with a full-scale inquiry during while these proceedings were pending. This was for a very good reason, namely, that it was quite possible there might be an appeal to him. In the same way the inquiry carried out by my Department was constrained by these proceedings as we clearly did not want to be accused of interfering with wit<Col N="480" /> nesses at any stage. At all times I was obliged to point out that natural justice would have to apply.</P>
      <P>The inquiries have yielded the results which are before the House. Disputed facts would clearly require a further tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>Regarding paragraph 1.5, we have been able to reach conclusions on the central issues we examined. We pointed out that one of these conclusions, namely that which related to the county registrar who has resigned, is extremely serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that one of the principal reasons for the delay in the announcement of the resignations of the two younger people was the negotiation of their pensions with the Government? Will he indicate the basis on which the Government decided on the pensions awarded and the criteria used in settling on the figures agreed, namely, £30,000 per annum for a 50 year old man and £15,000 for a man aged 45 years? Before settling on these figures did the Minister inquire from actuaries the cost to a 50 year old person of buying from a pension fund or a body competent in providing a pension on the open market an index linked pension of £30,000 per annum, given the normal expected life span? In other words, what is the net current value of a pension of £30,000 for a 50 year old person? Will the Minister tell the House the net current value to a 45 year old person of an index linked pension of £15,000 per annum? The Minister has given the net current value of the income lost to the persons concerned. Therefore, perhaps he will tell us the cost of an index linked pension of £30,000 per annum purchased by a person aged 50 years in the private sector.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately at this point it is very difficult for me to answer the latter questions put by Deputy Bruton as further assessment would be required to enable me provide the net values. However, actuarial expertise was called upon in assessing the value of the pensions as they have been declared to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the issue of whether the delays in dealing with the resignations of the two younger men were related to pension entitlements. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, formerly of the Supreme Court, did not seek a pension at any time. He resigned his position without negotiating a pension. Mr. Michael Quinlan, the County Registrar, sent me his letter of resignation this morning and did not seek a pension from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On the contrary, he simply wished me well in the difficult tasks which lay ahead of me in the Department. Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly was very concerned about the two cases I mentioned. It was not an ephemeral or superficial concern &ndash; he was genuinely concerned about the cases. Mr. Justice Kelly raised the issue of a pension with us, and we responded. Irrespective of whether he had done so the Government on balance felt that this was the humane way to proceed. I fully realise <Col N="481" /> that some people will say they should not get pensions.</P>

      <P>Mere days after the handing down by Mr. Justice Kelly of this bizarre decision on 12 November, the Minister brought a recommendation to Cabinet for that judge's appointment to the High Court. Prior to proposing Mr. Justice Kelly for promotion, did the Minister consult any member of the Judiciary on his suitability for promotion? Did he receive representations from members of the Judiciary about the promotion of Mr. Justice Kelly? Did the Minister consult with or receive any advice from the Attorney General as to the suitability of Mr. Justice Kelly for promotion from the Circuit Court to the High Court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises from the Independent Radio and Television Commission's recent refusal to accept an advertisement for broadcast placed by <i>The Irish Catholic</i>, a religious newspaper. The refusal was based on section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, which states:</P>
      <P>No advertisement shall be broadcast which is directed towards any religious or political end or which has any relation to an industrial dispute.</P>
      <P>Times have changed since then and the country has gone through a great deal of turmoil and trauma in relation to certain religious and political events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is an after life &ndash; as the years pass I like to believe that there is &ndash; then it is possible that some of those departed from this House over the years might be eavesdropping on us. If they are, I am sure they can afford a wry smile that we are here to amend legislation which sought the banning of an advertisement for the promotion of <i>The Irish Catholic</i> in Ireland. I think of the many <Col N="488" /> people from constituencies across the country who served here in the past and wonder if any of them would have believed that this could happen.</P>
    <P>We live in an increasingly complex and secular society which continues to work hard to ensure that it is truly inclusive and pluralist. Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Buddhists, agnostics and atheists comprise vital parts of what has been called post-modern millennial Ireland. There are those in the mix of contemporary Irish society who may take grave exception to the views, teachings and doctrines of the Catholic Church. They believe official Church pronouncements are nothing more than that in the most hollow, cynical sense &ndash; at best irrelevant and patronising and at worst self-serving, oppressive cant.</P>
    <P>There are still more who feel quite neutral towards the Catholic Church or any other form of organised religion. They may have been born, raised and educated in their faith, whatever that faith might be, but at this stage in their lives they feel it has nothing to do with them. They may say they are searching for their own individual way, path, form of spirituality or worship.</P>
    <P>Equally, in contemporary Irish society there are those who believe absolutely in strict adherence to the teachings of the Church. They would argue that when one joins the club one agrees to accept and abide by the rules. To their mind, it is quite simple &ndash; either stay or go; one is either in or out.</P>
    <P>However, there is a significant and increasing body of people in Irish society who may have been less than diligent in the past in the regular practise of their religion but who are now returning to it largely because of their children. If asked, they will say that it is one thing to decide for themselves but quite another to decide for their children. They face a future where baptisms, first communions, confirmations, etc., will have to be considered. They come back to the Church with due consideration, often having thought long and hard not only about whether to return, but about how and why.</P>
    <P>They return on what they say are their own terms and with their own carefully formed set of ethics on the traditional thorny moral issues which characterised debate in the past. They are far more concerned with unemployment, fair employment, poverty and social and economic justice issues than they are about condoms, contraception and the other exotica of the ritual moral antagonisms of the not too distant past. They are what are frequently branded &ldquo;<i>à la carte </i>Catholics&rdquo;. One might say, without wishing to offend anybody, that they may well agree with the recent observation that while the Catholic Church is absolute about beliefs and rules, Irish Catholics are more relative about them. Such an observation sums up the complexities and contradictions surrounding the practise of Catholicism in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The rise of the individual and the secular would, if not altogether preclude, make extremely unlikely the acceptance by society of <Col N="489" /> the absolutes which in the past it appeared to accept &ndash; if not entirely without quibble then without declared quibble. If we had such a no quibble policy in the past, we have clearly left it behind. We have swapped it for one which demands accountability, transparency and responsibility in all areas of life, particularly those areas which in the past were considered sacrosanct and, therefore, dangerously above reproach, commonly above question and, in many cases and most regrettably so, above the law itself.</P>
    <P>There are two tribunals investigating politicians and potential political corruption. The banks and financial institutions are under the most intense official and public scrutiny. In the past week we have seen the Judiciary not only become publicly accountable but make a concerted effort to accede to demands to be seen to be publicly accountable. Over the past five years or so the Catholic Church has had to face up to and assume responsibility for a vast body of error, the kind of aberrations, grievous harm and recklessness which, as was said since, make the Bishop Casey story seem like the good old days of the Church in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the time of the late Dr. Noel Browne's mother and child scheme, who would have contemplated that such things would be possible in Irish political, financial, judicial and religious life, let alone believe that in their lifetime such things would come to pass regularly? Who would have contemplated that the views expressed in <i>The Irish Catholic</i> would be publicly commented upon as being those of the minority. I suppose it is a case of man biting dog. The crozier, which was so well and strategically belted in the past, would appear for a time at least to have found an interest in self-mutilation. How the mighty have fallen.</P>
    <P>We live in a society where old ideologies are dying; a society which is precipitating and accommodating vast changes in all facets of life and which is increasingly convinced that religion and spirituality are most definitely not one and the same thing.</P>
    <P>In my constituency and in many other constituencies, we are witnessing a clear rejection of consumerism and its complex entrapment as people abandon the rat race of the cities and the corporate world to opt instead for simpler ways of life. Some years ago it was the Germans and the Dutch who sought a safe haven in remote west Cork, Mayo, Galway, Donegal or Connemara, but today it is our own people who, in their quest for something else, are relocating to rural Ireland. One need only look at the huge success of the rural resettlement scheme and the ever growing lists of people from places such as Ballybrack, Sallynoggin, Dolphin's Barn and Ballymun waiting patiently for the chance to start a new and better life. They are the people searching for that something else. That is a good indicator of the social flux in which we are now. The rising tide and its much vaunted ability to lift all boats is not <Col N="490" /> much use without a boat. People who in the middle of the week are yet again trying to figure out what the family will eat before the next social welfare payment is due could not care less about rising tides. In instances such as this we could be forgiven for thinking that the so-called Celtic tiger has been savaged by its cubs.</P>
    <P>However, there is another side to this story. The increasing pressure of the tiger economy not only drives people to escape but also facilitates it. Rapid advances in telecommunications are radically redefining the notion of work and where and how it is done. People in the remote parts of Ireland are working successfully with clients and corporations all over the world. Thanks to ISDN, broad band and other forms of high speed connectivity, with which the Minister is familiar, are networked efficiently at the flick of a switch, no fuss basis to Dublin, London, New York, New South Wales or Alaska. We are no longer jiving at the crossroads. Thanks to technology we are collaborating and connecting globally at them.</P>
    <P>In this era of accelerated tradition, traditional religious practice may be waning. However, the quest for the spiritual or that something else is as strong as ever. Events such as the annual mind, body and spirit conference at the RDS are packed to capacity every year. Nationally, sales and publication of books on alternative forms of spirituality are at a record high. The continued success of work such as <i>Anam Cara</i> by Fr. John O'Donoghue which is still on the hardback and paperback non-fiction best seller lists demonstrates we are no strangers to mythical or mystical terrain.</P>
    <P>So, when the Independent Radio and Television Commission recently banned a proposed advertisement for <i>The Irish Catholic </i>from local radio, some people may have thought we were on mythical terrain, so mythical as to be considered, in the literal sense, quite fabulous. I do not believe the Independent Radio and Television Commission acted badly in making its decision, the Act is very clear. Despite that, some said that the pendulum had not so much swung as had been pushed so far in the direction of the liberal agenda as to be considered completely farcical. The Independent Radio and Television Commission acted in good faith and interpreted the existing legislation in strict accordance with the wording which we propose to amend.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down by me and Deputy Gay Mitchell takes full account of the complexity of Irish society and would prevent such situations recurring. It allows for an advertisement promoting the sale of bona fide political or religious journals or newspapers with a cover charge, provided the Independent Radio and Television Commission is of the opinion that the journal or newspaper is both bona fide and that the nature of the advertisement is directed at the promotion of the journal or newspaper <i>per se</i> and is not sectarian or directed towards a political end. It offers what we consider to be an equitable, viable and practicable alternative to the current wording, which <Col N="491" /> was recently considered to be open to interpretation.</P>
    <P>One frequently hears <i>Magill,</i> a political magazine, being advertised. If the wording used by <i>The Irish Catholic</i> had been changed slightly, it may have passed Independent Radio and Television Commission scrutiny. The interpretation of the legislation as regards the advertisement for <i>The Irish Catholic</i> resulted in widespread concern for both freedom of the press and freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>Ironically, it is a fitting reflection of the complexity and ambiguity which characterise contemporary Ireland that the <i>Irish Independent, </i>so often lambasted by conservatives as a bastion of the liberal agenda, asserted in its editorial on 19 February last that in <i>The Irish Catholic</i> scenario, freedom is not freedom unless it is freedom for all. It is like Voltaire's famous statement &ldquo;Though I disapprove of what you say I will defend to the death your right to say it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We must have strict and adequate legislation to ban sectarian, deliberately divisive or blatantly politically motivated advertising from our airwaves; I support that. To do anything other than that would be to collude in a propagandist mentality that could unleash the ethically motivated savagery which is relentlessly beamed into the sitting rooms of the country from Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania.</P>
    <P>We must look at the situation closer to home. On this island, great effort and hope is being expended in getting historically divided communities to accommodate the otherness of the other. In an increasingly mediated world it is essential we have legislation which underpins, fosters and upholds absolute impartiality and the sovereignty of the fact and never the sovereignty of the many artfully spun versions or interpretations of that fact.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with family values? I am a family man with a wife and three children. I firmly believe in the family unit and all that implies, I am not an exception. However, there is a backlash against those who have sought to subvert the idea of family ideas to their narrow subjective and often highly political ends. It is important that we as legislators understand and do something about it.</P>
    <P>Reclaiming family values and all that that term implies is, in its very simplest sense, for all those who believe in those values and do so without an agenda. It is too important an issue to become the sole property of any side in national, moral and social debate. It is important to restore balance where necessary and to work to maintain that once it is achieved. When I say I support and believe in family values, I do not align myself with any camp; I am merely stating a fact, not using an interpretation of fact for a particular end because I am what I would describe as a family man.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down by me and Deputy Gay Mitchell squarely faces up to this situation. <Col N="492" /> We are more concerned, as it was described in a different context, with the drama of absolute oppositions than with asserting truths. We in this party believe it is incumbent upon us as elected representatives and legislators to always assert those truths, regardless of how uncomfortable or downright unpopular they may be.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that she look carefully at the current situation. The UK Radio Authority codes governing religious advertising, which I am sure are available to the Minister, set out a range of instances where advertising can take place, including simple announcements, for example, about visits to Lourdes, charity collections or religious music. There is scope to do something about this section of the Act. It should be possible to accept our amendment which will allow bona fide religious and political journals with a cover charge to be advertised, where it is clear to the Independent Radio and Television Commission that they are not geared to a political or sectarian end. In this day and age we are big enough to include this in our legislation. I do not want it to be the case that every half baked religious or political idea is advertised on radio or television; I am talking about bona fide journals or newspapers which are acceptable to the Independent Radio and Television Commission after scrutiny. It would eliminate the fear of churches or religious bodies which want to advertise their particular ethos or philosophy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the situation in as broad a manner as she can. There is a body of opinion that if Archbishop Neary and Bishop Finnegan want to bring a pilgrimage to Lourdes they should be entitled to do so, to advertise it and have it referred to in news items on local radio. If they want to produce a newspaper about that it should be available for sale, with the proceeds to go to the Church or a charity. It should be possible to advertise it on local radio so that people would know it was available and could buy it. That would mean a great deal to such people at a time when they have come under a great deal of pressure for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will realise from the nature of the arguments made by Deputy Kenny and I that we seek to redress an injustice and liberty for religious broadcasting &ndash; not something outside the mainstream but a reasonable and decent approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Radio and Television (Amendment) Bill, 1999, sets out to amend the 1988 Act to ensure that reasonable radio advertising of religious magazines and periodicals can take place.</P>
      <P>Section 1 amends section 10 of the 1988 Act, and is the main provision of the Bill. As Deputy Kenny said, section 1 sets out to create a new section 3A to read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (3) of this section, advertisements which promote, or can reasonably be construed as promoting, the sale, for a cover charge, of bona fide political or religious <Col N="493" /> journals or newspapers, may be broadcast on radio or television, provided the Independent Radio and Television Commission is of the opinion that &ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) the journal or newspaper is a bona fide publication, and</P>
    <P>(b) the nature of the advertisement is directed to the promotion of the journal or newspaper, and is not sectarian or directed towards a political end.</P>
    <P>We are not saying that everyone has an automatic right to advertise any religious or political magazine. The Independent Radio and Television Commission must be of the opinion that it meets the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) in the section.</P>
    <P>The need for such an amendment arises because the Independent Radio and Television Commission interpreted the 1988 Act in such a way as to ban an innocuous advertisement for a respected journal, <i>The Irish Catholic</i>, as Deputy Kenny pointed out. It is most alarming that no Government spokesperson has commented on this issue. Must the <i>Farmers Journal</i> or the <i>Palm Sunday, St. Vincent de Paul Advocate</i> be banned before public representatives take this decision to task?</P>
    <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission said that it was approached by Highland Radio, which sought a ruling as to whether it would be permitted to accept an advertisement for <i>The Irish Catholic</i>. The station was concerned, it appears, that the advertisement in question might not have been permissible under section 10(3) of the 1988 Radio and Television Act. This Act states that &ldquo;no advertisement shall be broadcast which is directed towards any religious or political end or which has any relation to an industrial dispute&rdquo;. Having considered this matter, the Independent Radio and Television Commission informed the station that the advertisement would not be permissible under this section of the 1988 Act.</P>
    <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission's interpretation of the Act and its constitutionality was, the Independent Radio and Television Commission states, challenged in the courts by Mr. Rory Murphy of the Irish Faith Centre. A decision in favour of the Independent Radio and Television Commission was given in the High Court by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in April 1997 and it was subsequently upheld in the Supreme Court in May 1998, according to the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The Independent Radio and Television Commission claims that, in making its decision in the case of <i>The Irish Catholic</i>, it was obliged to have regard to both the statute and the Murphy judgment. The Independent Radio and Television Commission said in a statement that it had no discretion in this matter.</P>
    <P>The following is the content of <i>The Irish Catholic</i> advertisement which gave rise to the decision by the Independent Radio and Television Commission and this Private Members' Bill :</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Male voiceover: <i>The Irish Catholic</i>&ndash; a lively and provocative family newspaper that connects the issues of today with the teachings of the Church.</P>
    <P>Female voiceover: A refreshingly different point of view that entertains as it informs about the things that really matter.</P>
    <P>Male voiceover: If you expect more from a family newspaper than a diet of sex and sensationalism.</P>
    <P>Female voiceover: If you like good writing, often controversial but never dull.</P>
    <P>Female voiceover: .buy <i>The Irish Catholic</i> every Thursday from your local church or shop.</P>
    <P>Male voiceover: <i>The Irish Catholic</i>.</P>
    <P>Female voiceover: A thoroughly good read for the whole family.</P>
    <P>Did any Member of this House, when voting for the 1988 Act, believe that such an innocuous advertisement could be banned in this way? The Fine Gael Private Members' Bill sets out to remove any doubt about the entitlement of publishers to advertise such publications.</P>
    <P>However, it is quite alarming that few public representatives had any comment to make on the decision, despite the libertarian implications of such a ruling. Quite clearly, if the <i>Irish Press</i>&ndash; which I am not including for any party political reasons because it did not occur to me when I was writing this speech which Minister would take this debate &ndash; were still in existence, given its slogan &ldquo;For the glory of God and the honour of Ireland&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Do chum glóire Dé agus ónora na hÉireann&rdquo;, it would probably not be allowed to advertise on radio, given the strict interpretation of section 10 of the 1988 Act.</P>
    <P>Had the periodical concerned been a publication of, say, a minority religious group, I feel certain this matter would have received more prominent attention in this House. I wish to assure the House that I would be equally concerned about a similar ban applying to any similar advertising for any religious journal or magazine of this kind.</P>
    <P>I wish to read the <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial of 19 February 1999, to which Deputy Kenny referred briefly, in full. It read:</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Catholic</i> is, as it boasts, &ldquo;a lively and provocative family newspaper&rdquo;. It is also a publication that strongly asserts minority views.</P>
    <P>To hear it so described would have astonished its founders in the last century &ndash; and the country at large until very recently. Before the liberal agenda gained the ascendancy, its views were those of a majority. In the new climate, it is all the more important that their proponents should have full freedom to express them.</P>
    <P>A pity, therefore, that the Independent Radio and Television Commission has banned a radio advertisement for the newspaper on the grounds that the law forbids the broadcasting of an adver<Col N="495" /> tisement &ldquo;directed towards any religious or political end&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The current issue of <i>The Irish Catholic</i> notes that the legislation is open to wide interpretation. It suggests that, short of a constitutional challenge, the Independent Radio and Television Commission should reconsider its decision. Failing that, the Oireachtas should amend the law.</P>
    <P>It makes further points: the existing legislation is &ldquo;presumably aimed at confrontational or proselytising ads, and press freedom is in question&rdquo;. We have no hesitation in endorsing the latter proposition, and the means of resolving the issue proposed by <i>The Irish Catholic</i>. Freedom is not freedom unless it is freedom for all.</P>
    <P>Bully for the <i>Irish Independent</i> whose editorial says it all. <i>The Irish Catholic</i> editorial of 18 February 1999 states:</P>
    <P>An advertisement by the Irish Faith Centre was banned in 1997 in part because the wording of the advertisement would, according to the judgment of the High Court, have led the listener &ldquo;to at least favourably consider the proposition that Christ is the Son of the living God and that traditional beliefs about Christ are historical facts&rdquo;. In its advertisement, the Irish Catholic makes no direct assertions whatever about the nature of the Catholic Church or the content of the Catholic faith. It is simply an invitation to listeners to buy the paper. It tells them about the Irish Catholic and its contents, no more.</P>
    <P>In recent days Members of this House have expressed concern about certain decisions taken by the courts. Some of these concerns are well grounded. We might also express concern at some of the decisions taken by this House. We are the directly elected House of Parliament in a democracy. As part of the checks and balances in the Constitution, we are meant to uphold the rights of citizens and not leave it to the courts to do so. This Private Members' Bill seeks to redress a grave injustice and a serious intrusion into the democratic rights of citizens to publish, read and advertise periodicals which are neither seditious, alarming or likely to corrupt public morals.</P>
    <P>As we have seen, judges, like politicians, have feet of clay. We are all human. It, therefore, behoves this House not to leave it to the High Court or any other court to guarantee the freedom of conscience and liberty which each citizen should enjoy. It is a clear and primary responsibility of this elected assembly.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is not voted down because it is a Private Members' Bill. It would be a healthy development if this House acknowledged that as part of the checks and balances Members of the Dáil have rights just as members of the Government have different rights. It is our duty to ensure that legislation is properly enacted. This is not the preserve of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the plethora of powers we have given to different institutions outside this <Col N="496" /> House, including the courts, statutory bodies such as the Independent Radio and Television Commission, local development partnership companies, State agencies such as An Bord Pleanála and health boards. Recent developments should be a timely reminder of our need to play a full role as a parliament in protecting the rights of and conferring responsibilities on the citizens of the State. I take this opportunity to congratulate the many journalists who came to the defence of <i>The Irish Catholic</i> and who were true to their profession because there is an important principle at stake.</P>
    <P>Seán Lemass said that a state which measures its success by material things alone has lost its soul. I do not wish to sound 'holier than thou' or to seem to be more than a frail human being, but cultural and religious expression are as important to the future success of this nation as is political or economic development. We, as politicians and as a nation, behave like adolescents when it comes to religious matters. We are rebellious because we have found the freedom we believe we did not enjoy heretofore. However, we must be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water. Religious expression is still an important part of the daily lives of the majority of people of all religious groupings on this island.</P>
    <P>Would it be good if a radio station was dedicated to religious broadcasting with the necessary checks and balances imposed on those responsible for managing such a facility? We have a radio station dedicated to high brow music, for example, and this is a welcome development. Many members of the public, probably the majority, would support the establishment of a station licensed to broadcast religious material only. Why are we not reflecting their wishes in the legislation passed by this House? We have no right to suppress such wishes and it would not be subversive of the State if such a station was licensed to broadcast Christian and non-Christian material. I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Much wrong has been perpetrated by influential people within the church and one reads with pain and anger of some of those abuses. We hope that in righting those abuses the church will approach the matter with a sense of justice and not just a sense of law. I also hope the modern church realises the yearning for it to be part of and to play an important, but not a controlling role in society. I hope a modern church with a full role for women and married persons will develop out of the turmoil and difficulties the church, particularly the Catholic Church, has experienced recently.</P>
    <P>I praise and support the priests, nuns and non-Catholic ministers for their dedication to their beliefs and for the work they do in difficult circumstances and parishes in this city, for example, where we would not choose to work or live if we had the option. Few of them have an income which could be described as a salary or wage. I am talking about priests and nuns who work in the inner city, live in flat complexes and make <Col N="497" /> great sacrifices. They do not get enough encouragement or support. We need them because the State cannot provide the type of services they provide.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed at the increase in the number of suicides, particularly among young males, which is expected to reach 500 this year. I had a brief discussion today with Deputy Neville who is an expert in this area. Part of the reason for this hopelessness, which is more prevalent outside Dublin, is the emphasis we have placed on materialism. We need cultural things like we need bread and we need spiritual things like we need cultural things. We should not be embarrassed to say that and we should not put down those who are trying to encourage others to open their minds to the possibility of such spiritual things in a reasonable and fair way.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Catholic</i> could not be described as an extremist magazine. I confess that I do not buy it every week but I will buy it more frequently now that it has been brought to my attention. I hope the Minister will support this Bill and allow the ban to be lifted. The provisions in this Bill are reasonable. We still allow the Independent Radio and Television Commission to make the decision but our job, as the representatives of the people, is to lay down the conditions. I hope reason and justice will prevail, that this great injustice will be redressed and that liberty for religious broadcasting will be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to amend section 10 (3) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988. The 1988 Act established the Independent Radio and Television Commission and put in place a statutory structure for independent radio and television services. Section 10 (3) of the Act provides that no advertisement shall be broadcast which is directed towards any religious or political end or which has any relation to an industrial dispute. This provision applies to all broadcasters who operate under the aegis of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. There is a similar provision in section 20 (4) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which applies the same prohibition on this type of advertising to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially we are dealing with a provision that is nearly 40 years old. It can be argued that it is timely to reconsider a prohibition such as is contained in these subsections. It can be argued that the blanket ban contained in these provisions is too blunt an instrument to be used in this day and age for what is now a largely well educated society with a sophisticated understanding of the way media, including the very powerful radio and television media, work. It is helpful to our debate that in the recent past the constitutionality of this very provision &ndash; that is, the prohibition on advertising directed towards a religious end &ndash; was tested in the courts during 1997 and 1998. Deputies will bear with me if I quote extensively from the High Court and Supreme Court <Col N="498" /> judgments so that all can better appreciate the problems associated with this legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>In the case in 1997 arising from the decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to instruct a local radio station to stop carrying an advertisement relating to the showing of a video directed towards a religious end, the constitutionality of the provision was challenged on four grounds. These were that the prohibition on advertising directed towards a religious end contravened Article 40.3.1 of the Constitution which confers a right to communicate, Article 40.6.1 which confers &ldquo;the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions&rdquo;, Article 44.2.1 which guarantees freedom of conscience and the free profession and practise of religion to every citizen subject to public order and morality and Article 44.2.3 which prohibits any imposition by the State of any disabilities or the making of any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Geoghegan in his judgment concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that the prohibition of the advertisement was not an attack on freedom of conscience or the free practise of religion. He indicated that if anything the advertisement might be an intrusion into the quiet possession of religious beliefs. He also concluded that it did not appear to him that the refusal of such an advertisement constituted a discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status as prohibited by Article 44.2.3º. In dealing with the contention that the prohibition on advertising towards a religious end was contrary to Article 40 of the Constitution, the justice concluded that:</P>
    <P>It is sufficient in my view if there were good reasons in the public interest for the ban. Irish people with religious beliefs tend to belong to particular churches and that being so religious advertising coming from a different church can be offensive to many people and might be open to the interpretation of proselytising. Religion has been a divisive factor in Northern Ireland and this is something that the Oireachtas may well have taken into account. .. a person listening to commercial radio is for all practical purposes compelled to listen to the advertisements. That being so, it is legitimate for any Oireachtas to have regard to the type of advertisements which might be permitted. The impugned section enjoys the presumption of constitutionality. It is not obvious to me that a restriction on religious advertising is not a reasonable restriction in the interest of the common good on this particular form of exercise on the right to communicate.</P>
    <P>On the argument that the blanket ban was not proportional, Justice Geoghegan said:</P>
    <P>I cannot accept this view. On the legislation as it stands there are very few limitations on the right to advertise and in that sense proportionality has already been taken into account. But at any rate, I do not think that <Col N="499" /> one could subdivide religious advertising. Once a reasonable view can be put forward that religious advertising might be undesirable in the public interest, it would be impossible in practice to devise a wording that might have the effect of permitting certain alleged categories of innocuous religious advertising. It is the fact that the advertisement is directed towards a religious end and not some particular aspect of a religious end which might be potentially offensive to the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us attempts to provide for the very situation which this judgment warns us against. While I believe the Oireachtas is not prevented from considering amendments to and even the repeal of this provision, we must be extremely careful in our approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>The High Court judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court. In May 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court that the prohibition on advertising directed towards a religious end contained in section 10 (3) of the 1988 Act was not unconstitutional. In its judgment, the Supreme Court saw it as important to stress that there are three kinds of advertisements which were totally banned: advertisements which are directed towards any religious end; advertisements which are directed towards any political end and advertisements which have any relation to an industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court was of the view that:</P>
    <P>One can best glean the policy of the Act by looking at the three kinds of prohibited advertisement collectively. One might get a false impression by singling out one kind of banned advertisement and ignoring the others. All three kinds of banned advertisement relate to matters which have proved extremely divisive in Irish society in the past. The Oireachtas was entitled to take the view that citizens would resent advertisements touching on these topics broadcast into their homes and that such advertisements, if permitted, might lead to unrest. Moreover the Oireachtas may well have thought that in relation to matters of such sensitivity, rich men should not be able to buy access to the airwaves to the detriment of their poorer rivals.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court found that the provision amounts to a certain limitation on the applicant's right freely to profess his religion, on his right of free communication and on his right of freedom of expression. It concluded that the real question was whether the limitation imposed upon the various constitutional rights is proportionate to the purpose which the Oireachtas wished to achieve. The court found in that particular case that:</P>
    <P>. . . the limitation placed on the various constitutional rights is minimalist. The applicant has the right to advance his views in speech or by writing or by holding assemblies or by associating with persons of like mind to him<Col N="500" /> self. He has no lesser right than any other citizen to appear on radio or television. The only restriction placed on his activities is that he cannot advance his views by paid advertisement on radio or television.</P>
    <P>It was argued for the applicant in this case that it would have been possible to have had, instead of a blanket ban on religious advertising, a more selective administrative system whereby inoffensive religious advertisements would be permitted and religious advertisements likely to cause offence banned. The Supreme Court in dealing with this argument said:</P>
    <P>No doubt this is true. But the Oireachtas may well have decided that it would be inappropriate to involve agents of the State in deciding which advertisements, in this sensitive area, would be likely to cause offence and which not.</P>
    <P>The court went on to conclude:</P>
    <P>It therefore appears to the court that the ban on religious advertising contained in section 10(3) of the 1988 Act is rationally connected to the objective of the legislation and is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. It does appear to impair the various constitutional rights referred to as little as possible and it does appear that its effects on those rights are proportional to the objective of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Bill, we are considering a proposal by the Opposition to amend a legislative provision that was found to be constitutional as recently as May 1998. We are being asked to amend a provision that was found by the Supreme Court not to be arbitrary or unfair and which impairs our constitutional rights as little as possible. The High Court and the Supreme Court acknowledged the sensitivity of the substance of the existing provisions of the section which the Bill is designed to amend. Anyone who reads these judgments must come to the conclusion that any amendment of the section which would give an agent of the State the power or responsibility of deciding which types of religious advertisements are permissible and which are not must be approached with great care if we are not to create considerable and perhaps insurmountable difficulties for the Independent Radio and Television Commission as suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We know the stimulus for the preparation of the Bill. It arose following the decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to prohibit an advertisement on local radio for the newspaper called <i>The Irish Catholic</i>. We would all agree that an advertisement for a newspaper such as <i>The Irish Catholic</i> is innocuous enough, as Deputy Mitchell said. However, the Independent Radio and Television Commission felt that the advertisement would be caught by the prohibition on religious advertising contained in section 10(3) of the 1988 Act and advised the station concerned not to broadcast the advertisement. I stress that in stating these facts there is <Col N="501" /> no criticism of the Independent Radio and Television Commission's decision or actions in this matter. The commission is charged under section 4(7) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, with ensuring that every radio station operating under the Act complies with the provision of the Act. It is, in the first place, for the commission to interpret the legislation and to act upon this interpretation and the legislation does not provide that it may ignore matters when it might appear that a breach of the legislation is innocuous.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to have as its intention that the Independent Radio and Television Commission should have the scope to determine whether a political or religious newspaper or journal is bona fide. Where the journal or newspaper is bona fide, advertisements promoting the sale, for a cover charge of such publications, will not be prohibited under section 10(3) of the 1988 Act, provided the advertisement is directed to the promotion of the newspaper and is not sectarian or directed towards a political end. If the Bill were to be enacted, the Independent Radio and Television Commission would have a number of decisions to make. It seems to me that these decisions would be whether a particular religious journal or newspaper is bona fide, where the Independent Radio and Television Commission has decided that a publication is bona fide, whether the advertisement promotes the publication and is not sectarian or directed towards a political end.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions in the proposed legislation would place the Independent Radio and Television Commission in the position of having to make a value judgment in distinguishing between publications. In order to come to a decision as to whether a particular publication is a bona fide political or religious journal, the Independent Radio and Television Commission would have to assess the goals of any particular publication and possibly the goals of the religious or political organisation itself. Furthermore, the Independent Radio and Television Commission would have to make an additional value judgment in determining what is or is not sectarian. The Bill provides no guidelines or parameters within which the Independent Radio and Television Commission can make these difficult and sensitive judgments.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for an appeals mechanism even though the Bill would give the Independent Radio and Television Commission the power to discriminate between one newspaper and another without providing any detailed grounds for doing so. As I indicated earlier, the High Court and Supreme Court judgments indicated the practical and administrative difficulties that would have to be overcome if a selective ban on the type of advertisements covered by section 10(3) of the 1988 Act was to be introduced. The Bill does not provide any means for dealing with the concerns expressed in these judgments. It </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> would be foolhardy to progress without ensuring that we are not making matters worse.</P>
    <P>Turning to the policy rather than the detail proposed in the Bill, it is legitimate to consider whether a more selective ban on advertising directed towards a religious end might be developed. However, to make the ban selective, the means selected would have to ensure that any system provided for assessing the suitability of advertisements would be applied within the limits of the Constitution and in a constitutional manner. At the very least, the rights contained in Article 44 of the Constitution would have to be respected and fair proceedings for those aggrieved would have to be provided. Making the ban selective could also be seen as a curtailment of the right to free speech and expression provided by Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution. It might be a wiser course to consider providing the Independent Radio and Television Commission with powers to ban a particular advertisement in relation to religious material if it considers that the advertisement in question offends public order or morality rather than possibly discriminating between different publications.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that advertising directed towards a religious end is a very special category of advertising. Advertising is to some extent regulated in most countries. Television advertising in particular is regulated throughout the European Union through, at a minimum, the Television without Frontiers Directive. That directive recognises the importance which individual member states attach to the regulation of broadcast advertising in that it provides that a member state may impose stricter regulation on broadcasters operating under its jurisdiction than is provided for in the directive.</P>
    <P>The regulation of advertising tends to be based on the general provision that all advertising should be legal, honest, decent and truthful. This is provided for in the codes of standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting services which were drawn up under the provisions of section 4(1) of the Broadcasting Act, 1990. The same basic principle is provided in the Code of Advertising Standards for Ireland drawn up by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland is a self-regulatory body, which was established by the advertising industry in 1981, and deals with advertising in most media including newspapers, posters and cinema as well as broadcasting. Understandably, the code drawn up under the Broadcasting Act, 1990, does not deal with advertising directed towards a religious end as there is a blanket ban on such advertising. On the other hand, the ASAI code specifically excludes advertisements whose principal purpose is to express the advertisers' position on political, religious, industrial relations, social or aesthetic matters or on an issue of public interest or concern from the scope of its code. It is interesting <Col N="503" /> that the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland decided not to apply its standards to these sensitive areas even though there is no statutory bar against it so doing.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult to regulate religious advertising in the same way as advertising for goods and services is regulated. How does one determine if an advertisement directed towards a religious end is truthful? No product or service is being sold. While religious advertisers may hold their beliefs with the utmost conviction, the claims made in such advertisements are matters of belief and are not measurable by any objective standard.</P>
    <P>While I oppose the Bill, I am prepared to look at the policy which it attempts to put in place, that is, a more selective ban on advertising directed towards a religious end. If an appropriate amendment can be developed, I would hope to introduce it on Committee Stage during the passage of the Broadcasting Bill, which I hope to publish in the immediate future, through the Oireachtas. In considering an amendment, I will have to have regard for many of the issues raised in the judgments which I quoted earlier.</P>
    <P>These issues include in particular in relation to matters of such sensitivity, that rich men should not be able to buy access to the airwaves to the detriment of their poorer rivals; the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution conferring a right to communicate and the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions will be clearly respected, and the provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution which guarantee freedom of conscience and the free profession of and practice of religion to every citizen subject to public order and morality and which prohibit any imposition by the State of any disabilities or the making of any discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status will also be respected.</P>
    <P>To achieve these aims it will be necessary to give consideration to devising fair procedures and natural justice measures to ensure that the body charged with regulating such advertisements will uphold and be seen to uphold these rights.</P>
    <P>It may be that if we are to consider relaxing the existing total ban on broadcast advertising directed towards a religious end, we must inevitably consider the removal of the prohibition of the ban in its entirety rather than the introduction of a more selective prohibition. Given the concerns which I have already mentioned, it may be the only safe way to proceed. However such a step cannot be taken lightly. To proceed to a more selective prohibition or to the removal of the prohibition without qualification will need considerable thought and consultation. Broadcasting, both television and radio, is recognised as the most powerful mass communications medium ever developed. Audiences for certain programmes are measured in millions. Radio is a secondary medium in that it can be present while other activities in the workplace, the home or the car are being carried <Col N="504" /> out. Unlike a newspaper or magazine where a page can be turned quickly after a brief scan, a person is compelled to listen to, or at least hear, a radio advertisement if the listener wishes to ensure that her or his enjoyment of the programme is not interrupted. Children and young people are constantly exposed to the images, messages and attitudes which are promulgated on radio and television.</P>
    <P>Parents might quite properly wish to ensure that their children are exposed only to the religious profession of their choosing. It is possible that many such people would find advertising directed towards a religious end offensive simply because of the particular religious organisation which is making the advertisement. While it might be possible to prevent the broadcast of advertising directed towards a religious end during the hours of broadcasting devoted to children's programming, we all know that children and young people watch prime time television and listen to the radio at all hours so such a measure would only offer limited protection. I will not deal here with the alleged problems surrounding various cults and sects that have caused anxiety to families and whose activities could be interpreted as being directed towards a religious end.</P>
    <P>We must proceed very cautiously in this sensitive area. Perhaps in an era of ever increasing numbers of broadcast services becoming available via satellite, which is outside the legislative regime which applies to indigenous broadcasters, the total prohibition on advertising directed towards a religious end is an anachronism. It may be time to rely on our broadcasters not to offend or alienate their audiences through unacceptable advertising in this area. However, any change to the present position must be brought about through careful consideration and consultation with bodies such as the churches, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and broadcasters and the public generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House does not address any of the concerns which I have mentioned. There are no definitions or parameters within which the Independent Radio and Television Commission would exercise the powers which the Bill seeks to confer on it. There are no safeguards or recourse provided for those who are aggrieved by the decisions which the Independent Radio and Television Commission might take if this Bill were enacted. The prohibitions in the Broadcasting Authority Acts relating to RTE are not addressed. While I accept that it is appropriate for the House to consider the policy proposed by Deputies Mitchell and Kenny in the Bill, and I commend them for bringing it forward, we cannot proceed without considerably more thought than is evidenced by the provisions of the Bill. The enactment of the Bill is likely to cause far more problems than it would resolve.</P>
    <P>This is a sensitive issue and I commend the Deputies opposite for giving us an opportunity to discuss it at length. While I understand the laud<Col N="505" /> able motives of the Deputies in publishing this Bill, it is important that further consideration is given to the matter. There will be an opportunity to discuss the whole issue of broadcasting when I publish my broadcasting Bill. I will consider this issue and could be in a position to look at the overall problem in that context. If wording can be found we can easily bring that into the Bill by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo ar an Bhille Raidió agus Teilifíse (Leasú), 1999. Molaim Fine Gael agus an Teachta Kenny as ucht an Bhille seo a chur os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's speech and a number of aspects need clarification. This Bill is before us because of a radio advertisement that <i>The Irish Catholic</i> sought to place with the local radio station in Waterford, the area I represent, and Highland Radio in Donegal. We should look at the text of the proposed advertisement. A male and female spoke alternately. The male stated that <i>The Irish Catholic</i> is a lively and provocative family newspaper that connects the issues of today with the teachings of the church. The female voice stated that it is a refreshingly different point of view that entertains as it informs about the things which really matter. The male voice added that it is for those who expect more from a family newspaper than a diet of sex and sensationalism. The female finished by saying it is for those who think family values are worth preserving. No one could have a problem with that language. This was a commercial exercise by <i>The Irish Catholic</i> to boost circulation. All media outlets seek to do that.</P>
      <P>The over-rigorous interpretation of the legislation by the Independent Radio and Television Commission then arises. The Minister placed emphasis on the use of the words &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; in this amending Bill. The Labour Party does not favour censorship except in limited circumstances. There are, however, ways of dealing with problems which may arise from religious publications, such as the Public Order Act. If citizens or groups are offended they have the right to refer the cause of offence to the Garda or the DPP. If there are religious publications which are inappropriate or offensive, there is a route people can follow. The radio stations and the Independent Radio and Television Commission can exercise judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is crazy to ban an advertisement like this. It should be remembered that local radio stations depend on the revenue from advertising for their existence. The limitation of the advertisements they can take on questionable grounds must be eliminated. That is what the Bill seeks to do. If publications seeking political, religious or other ends contain unacceptable material on racism, sectarianism, etc., they can be referred under the Public Order Act. I do not believe that the censorship of publications in that sense is appropriate to the Independent Radio and Television <Col N="506" /> Commission if the publications are acceptable in general, are seen as bona fide and have not caused any referral under the Public Order Act. If particular publications want to use local radio to extend their markets, that is legitimate commercial practice and it is to be encouraged. From that point of view I totally support the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some areas in the Bill the Labour Party may seek to amend on Committee Stage but that is another day's work. The Bill must first pass this Stage. I welcome the Minister's undertaking to examine this issue when the broadcasting Bill is published but I do not see the logic of voting down this Bill. My colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, introduced the Broadcasting and Other Media (Public Right of Access or Diversity of Ownership) Bill some months ago which sought to address the area of cross-ownership in the electronic and print media, etc. In opposing Deputy Higgins's Bill, the Minister indicated these issues would be considered in the context of the broadcasting Bill but we have been waiting a long time for it. Accepting that Bill&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill to which the Deputy referred concerned sporting events. I am publishing that Bill this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>But part of that related to broadcasting in the context of ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that came under the jurisdiction of another Minister. The part for which I am responsible and in which I showed an interest &ndash; I brought forward a Bill when in Opposition &ndash; was of providing protection under the television without Frontiers Directive to protect certain sporting and cultural events and that Bill will be published this week. I did not mean to interrupt the Deputy but I wanted to provide information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is welcome and I compliment the Minister in that regard but other issues arise, for instance, if ownership of the media stretches too far. A particular philosophy, be it political, economic or whatever, could become the underlying theme in many publications and might have a subliminal brainwashing effect over a period. During the last general election a newspaper headline stated &ldquo;It's payback time&rdquo;. That type of intrusion into the political area requires attention. When I see this type of censorship being implemented on the other side, I wonder if we have our priorities right as regards broadcasting or the media in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE's style of advertising the licence fees is offensive. The underlying approach seems to be to create fear in people and the impression is given that bad people do not pay their television licences. I am not encouraging people not to pay their television licence fee but there are many other areas of more consequence to the public good. It could be said that RTE has a dominant position in that it uses advertising to promote its <Col N="507" /> own ends in obtaining licence fees. As I understand it, none of the licence fee goes to the local radio sector, and that is relevant in the context of this debate.</P>
    <P>Some restrictions should be imposed on newspapers whose radio advertisements, designed to boost circulation on a particular day, intrude on the private life of an individual or which create certain impressions by way of innuendo. That is an area the Minister should address in the broadcasting Bill. Thankfully, it has not been a serious factor in the Irish media but we have seen this type of practice lately. We need to impose standards either by having an ombudsman for the media or a system of relatively quick redress where the media strays from a stated ethical position.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a valid point that as the free market develops, we must ensure that the type of material that can be circulated in this country is suitable. Difficulties will arise if we regulate our indigenous media only to find that foreign media are in violation of that regulation.</P>
    <P>The reference to <i>The Irish Catholic</i> brings us to the concept of pluralism. My view, and that of my party, is that freedom of expression should be as uninhibited as possible except where it intrudes into the areas where the Public Order Act can be brought to bear. There are certain sects of which we may not approve but that does not mean that their freedom of expression should be censored. Decisive action should only be taken to ensure that unacceptable racist or sectarian views are not promulgated.</P>
    <P>There is a need for constant vigilance. Events in the former Yugoslavia bring to mind a comment made by Cardinal Conway in the early days of the Troubles that we should never under-estimate how thin is the veneer of civilisation. These events show how society can return to the worst kind of sectarianism. We also know of awful events in Ireland. I am not seeking to be alarmist but there are lines of thought evident in the UK which echo those of the 1930s over which none of us could stand.</P>
    <P>When in Government, the Labour Party rescinded the order made under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. There was divided opinion as to whether that was a correct decision. However, it helped to create the conditions which led to the peace process. There are times when restrictions are necessary but they are not normally a good idea.</P>
    <P>I visited North Korea as part of a parliamentary delegation. Seeing the totalitarian nature of that society made me value the dissidence allowed in this country. We do not place restrictions on dissident views expressed in an acceptable manner. This Bill addresses an important issue. The Minister has stated her reservations and mentioned the relevant court decisions. However, she should allow the Bill go to Committee Stage and introduce amendments. She should not vote it down without giving the House <Col N="508" /> an opportunity to amend it. If I understood her comments, an amendment to her Bill may not be submitted.</P>
    <P>Debates such as this are useful and it is good that such legislation remains on the Order Paper so that the issue remains live. This gives the Opposition a chance to raise these fundamental issues on the Order of Business. I am not making these comments because my local radio station is affected. Local radio has been an important innovation which has boosted discussion and understanding on a plethora of issues. The standards have been high. This section of the broadcasting network needs all the assistance it can get. We are not serving the public if we introduce legislation which is too restrictive and which denies local radio stations a legitimate source of revenue.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;bona fide publication&rdquo; needs clarification. A publication remains bona fide if it has not been the subject of a successful prosecution under the Public Order Act. People will quickly recognise and object to material which is seriously offensive or which has the potential of unleashing damaging forces on society. The Minister made the valid point that it would place an onerous task on the Independent Radio and Television Commission to ask it to distinguish between publications which are bona fide and those which are not. We must take a pragmatic approach which stipulates that the bona fides of a publication would be accepted if it remains on sale to the public without attracting serious objections. Modern society must move in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that we are unintentionally entering the area of sectarianism. There are religious publications about which I am not happy. They are not on sale to the public but some of this material is circulated to Members of the Oireachtas. I would have serious reservations if this material was available to the public. I am not aware of any recent religious publication on sale to the public which contained offensive, sectarian material. The system will sort out these issues.</P>
    <P>Publications such as <i>The Irish Catholic</i> are entitled to boost their circulation. Many people do not share the Catholic ethos or the views of <i>The Irish Catholic</i>. However, discussion and debate are important to religion and there is a heightened intellectual awareness of these issues. Fundamentalism is the corollary &ndash; it claims that there is one correct way of doing something which everyone must follow.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making too much of the issue of bona fide publications. The advertisements we are discussing are inoffensive. They contain good commercial text and are to be welcomed. We are making too much of this and seeing problems which do not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the closure of Fingal Manufacturing Limited and the devastating time Inishowen has had in recent months.</P>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for their efforts in 1998 to maintain the jobs in Fruit of the Loom. When the situation appeared to get more serious a task force was immediately set up. I also congratulate Michael McLoone, the chairman of the task force, and the people who are working with him. Over recent months they have done substantial work on skills analysis of the people who are losing their jobs, on forward planning and in taking a proactive role in trying to get employment into the area. Their work has already yielded results.</P>
      <P>I also take this opportunity to thank the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister, Deputy Woods, has delivered on his commitments regarding infrastructure and the seminar he held on job creation in Donegal. More boats have been provided but a great deal more work is required in terms of increased infrastructure. There is also a need for the expansion of the fishery school which is giving employment and providing an income for the inhabitants of the Greencastle area. I look forward to an opportunity to debate with the Minister the need for more funding for Queensport Harbour to ensure that job creation measures in the marine sector can be expanded.</P>
      <P>Fruit of the Loom, Donegal Shirts, Jockey and the Fingal factory are going or have gone from an area which already has an unemployment rate of 28 per cent. I wish to express my sympathy to the workers. They ask simple questions. They want to work. At one time they got Government contracts for Army, An Post and Garda shirts but these contracts are no longer forthcoming. A small number of such contracts would have kept 43 people off the dole. Unfortunately, international competition has made it more difficult to secure the contracts.</P>
      <P>The workers cannot understand how it is that, in Dublin, firms are crying out for workers. I regularly receive faxes from Dublin and Galway asking for workers to come to those cities to work. However, Inishowen has one of the best work forces in the country but the work cannot be brought to them.</P>
      <P>Statutory redundancy is a major issue in Inishowen. The half week provision does not compare well with the equivalent provision across the Border and it has left workers, some of whom live on the other side of the Border, with the belief that statutory redundancy should be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work ethos of the people in Inishowen cannot be beaten. Unfortunately, there are no oppor<Col N="510" /> tunities for them in terms of job creation, particularly in Moville where there is only one factory, the Fingal factory. The factory is located two fields from my house and is extremely important for the people of Moville given that it is the only factory there. Similarly, in Buncrana, Fruit of the Loom is one of a few employment options for Buncrana's large population. I take this opportunity to congratulate Clubman Omega on their ability to reopen a new factory. That demonstrates that it is possible to make progress if help is given.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the option of fast tracking industrial development land. Many companies are considering locating in Inishowen. The people have a positive attitude and the area has great access to Belfast and Derry airports and ports. One can get to these cities from Inishowen much quicker than one can cross the city of Dublin. Inishowen has large schools, access to third level education, no traffic chaos, affordable accommodation and a pleasant environment. However, it needs all the support it can get from the various State agencies.</P>
    <P>I seek the Government's full support of any recommendations made by the task force and the Donegal employment initiative. Continued priority must be given to the area until the current situation is reversed. I hope to come before the House this time next year and be in a position to commend the State agencies and the Minister on their success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I share the Deputy's concern at the recent announcement by Fingal Manufacturing Limited, Moville, County Donegal, that it intends to cease operations with the loss of 43 jobs. The proposed closure has been deferred for some weeks as a result of a number of orders which the company recently received.</P>
      <P>I can identify with Deputy Keaveney's difficulty. She and I are probably the only two Deputies in the House who live on peninsulas and I am aware of how difficult it is to attract industry to such areas. However, I have no doubt that the Deputy will succeed through her eloquence and determination.</P>
      <P>Fingal Manufacturing Limited has been operating in Moville since 1948 as a CMT &ndash; cut, make and trim &ndash; manufacturer of shirts and pyjamas. In recent years the company became increasingly dependent on public contracts. In addition to manufacturing CMT orders for a number of clothing companies, it also produced full contracts for Departments and State agencies. During the past couple of years Fingal Manufacturing Limited has been experiencing difficult trading conditions due to the fiercely competitive market conditions in the clothing sector. Following a root and branch evaluation of its position, the company reluctantly decided to wind up its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the announcement by the company, the Tánaiste arranged for the Donegal employment initiative to ensure that the workforce at the Moville factory can avail of the immediate inter<Col N="511" /> vention programme devised for workers made redundant at Fruit of the Loom plants in Donegal. The industrial development agencies, in co-operation with Fingal Manufacturing Limited, will work closely in the marketing of the premises for suitable replacement projects. Enterprise Ireland has alerted a number of clothing companies to the proposed closure with a view to identifying possibilities for relocating some production to the Moville factory. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has been active in promoting indigenous enterprise in Moville and in the county as a whole. It has supported the 7,500 sq. ft. food facility built by Greencastle community at Moville and it is working with the community to secure a project for the facility.</P>
    <P>In a wider context, Enterprise Ireland, under the European Union's RETEX programme, has approved funding for two special projects. The first of these is being supported through the Donegal employment initiative where assistance will be provided towards a programme on innovation stimulation in companies within the clothing and textiles sector. The overall aim of this programme is to develop a plan for each of the businesses involved to improve its future prospects by focusing on the need for a management led approach. In view of the concentration of clothing and textile companies in Donegal, this initiative is very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In another initiative which has recently commenced under the RETEX programme, Enterprise Ireland and Donegal County Council are collaborating in assisting a number of feasibility studies to identify job opportunities in alternative sectors to the clothing sector, that is, food processing, fish processing, information technology and the natural resource sectors. As part of this package, funds are also provided to help finance an incubator call centre project. Enterprise Ireland is also engaged in promoting other initiatives aimed at generating employment in County Donegal. These include seminars, cross-Border co-operation, pilot partnership programmes for technical graduates and so forth.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has also placed the entire Donegal region firmly in focus with its overseas marketing staff by arranging visits to the various locations and familiarising them with the resources and facilities available. Over the past six months, IDA Ireland has been bringing companies on first time site visits to County Donegal and a number of these companies have returned for a second visit. Arising out of these site visits, there are currently four companies involved in ongoing detailed discussions with IDA Ireland in relation to potential new investments. I am hopeful there will be a successful outcome to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The question of training is central to job creation. The Donegal Employment Initiative established a special sub-committee to deal with training and support services. FÁS, which is represented on this committee, has undertaken a series of interviews and completed a skills analysis <Col N="512" /> of the workers being made redundant at Fruit of the Loom and the Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
    <P>The same re-training opportunities will be made available to the Fingal workers. The regional placement officer, together with personnel from the Letterkenny-based training services division, held quality registration interviews with the workforce. Having completed this exercise, FÁS has compiled a skills analysis report which will enable it to arrange training programmes to match the needs of the workers. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I are very hopeful that the priority actions which have been taken in response to the Fingal closure announcement will be successful in finding new job opportunities for Moville. I can identify with Deputy Keaveney whom I am sure will sustain her attack on all Ministers. I happen to be in the line of fire occasionally in regard to jobs in her area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to deal with this very important matter. I visited Donegal recently and agree with the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker about the Inishowen peninsula.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity to visit the National Fisheries Training Centre in Greencastle. The centre was built in 1973 and is doing an excellent job. However, its structure is no longer compatible with the current training requirements of the fishing industry. The training centre has been under BIM control since 1978 and demand for its services has expanded. As a result, extra pressure is being exerted on it to implement the report of the fishing vessels safety review group.</P>
      <P>There is serious overcrowding in the college and facilities are inadequate to cater for the increased numbers in attendance. Plans have been submitted to successive Governments outlining the need for extra classroom space, a common room and library facilities. Most of the existing storeroom facilities are currently being used as classrooms and further storage space is required.</P>
      <P>Up to 80 students attend the centre at any one time. It is vitally important that the expansion, at a projected cost of £750,000, be provided. Fishing has been treated as a Cinderella industry and the funding provided to it has been inadequate. The much needed extension to Greencastle, if approved, would send out a positive signal about the importance of the industry. Previous attempts to obtain funding have been thwarted and a recent application under the INTERREG scheme was rejected. If the Minister of State does not have the necessary funds in his budget, he should approach the Taoiseach for funds from the appropriately named soldiers' and sailors' fund. I look forward to the Minister of State's confirmation that he will provide funding to enable the expansion to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the position in training facilities at the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle and developments in fisheries training in general. Deputy Finucane has raised this matter on many occasions and my colleague, <Col N="513" /> Deputy Keaveney, has also made strong representations on it.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware the Greencastle Centre, which is operated by BIM, provides formal training and education for the fishing and aquaculture industry in Ireland. The centre has established a first class record for the provision of practical fisheries training in line with the highest international standards and is equipped with the most up-to-date electronic, fishing and communications technology. Almost 400 students participate in these training courses annually.</P>
      <P>The demand for fisheries training has increased in recent years as a result of additional safety, quality, health and hygiene requirements and the advent of a technology revolution within the industry in terms of the range and sophistication of above and below deck equipment, wheelhouse electronics and fish farm culture techniques. The implementation of the recommendations of the report of the fishing vessel safety review group imposed a number of additional safety requirements which required to be addressed by BIM in its training syllabus. Training is also a vital complement to the whitefish fleet renewal programme. While the take-up of the incentives for new and modernised vessels has been excellent, we must now ensure that the industry avails of the enhanced training programmes to back up that investment. All these factors have had implications for training delivery.</P>
      <P>In October last year, the Minister announced details of the first ever cross-Border training initiative aimed at the sea fisheries industry in the Border counties. A sum of £200,000 has been made available under the INTERREG II community initiative to fund the joint training programmes which will be delivered by BIM and the UK's Sea Fish Industry Authority in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Group Training Authority. The training will consist of short courses in marine safety, conservation and fishing gear technology, net mending and food hygiene. Up to 150 fishermen, aquaculturalists, fish distributors and processors are expected to participate in this initiative.</P>
      <P>The increased demand for fisheries training, combined with the increased intake of students under the cross-Border initiative, has resulted in a substantial accommodation deficit at the Greencastle centre. BIM has estimated that the existing 1,700 square metres facility needs to be expanded by an additional 650 square metres to address existing overcrowding and to meet additional demand for fisheries training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been undertaken to meet the increased demand for fisheries training generally. First, funding of £500,000 has been provided towards the establishment of a regional fisheries training centre at Castletownbere, County Cork, which was formally opened by the Minister on 12 April. The new centre will be modelled on the existing centre at Greencastle and will offer tuition to international certification standard in seafaring, safety, navigation, electronics, fish farming and other fisheries disciplines. This new training centre will serve the needs of the industry throughout the south-west catchment area. Improved regional and local <Col N="514" /> access to training is a critical part of my objective to enhance safety, quality and competitiveness. The Castletownbere centre, represents, in a very real way, my commitment, and that of BIM to the local provision of high quality service to the catching, aquaculture and processing sector.</P>
    <P>The Castletownbere facility will augment the fisheries training programmes at BIM's fisheries training centre at Greencastle and those provided by the two mobile coastal training units, which play a vital role in bringing safety training to fishermen in our more remote coastal locations. I have seen these units in action in Kilmore Quay, County Wexford.</P>

      <P>I previously indicated that a sum of £900,000 has been made available for Greencastle pier and I have also announced the allocation of moneys to places in County Cork. The Deputies will notice that Wexford has not yet been accommodated.</P>
      <P>The establishment and continued operation of BIM's two coastal training units has been funded. These units were commissioned in direct response to the recommendations of the fishing vessel safety review group. These units, which are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, bring safety training directly to small coastal communities, thus complementing and reducing pressure on the national centre at Greencastle and the Castletownbere facility. The operation of these units enabled more than 300 fishermen and fish farmers to acquire safety and certificate training in their home ports during 1997.</P>
      <P>As the answer I have prepared is quite long, I will make the text available to my colleagues whom I know have tremendous interest in the matter and have mentioned it many times.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Report on the Elderly.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently read in a newspaper an article concerning a report on the elderly and was appalled to find that the Minister and the Department which commissioned the report subsequently left it for 12 months without taking action. Why did the Minister sit on the report for one year? What has he done about the recommendations in the report during that period? As many as 12,000 older people, or 3 per cent, are subject to abuse. Forms of abuse include slapping, threatening, starvation and isolation. Abuse occurs both in the home and in institutions. Older people are unlikely to report abuse out of shame and fear, something which has been proven in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspectoral procedures for publicly run institutions for older people should be introduced as <Col N="515" /> a matter of priority. Private nursing homes are already inspected and it is time public nursing homes and institutions were also inspected.</P>
    <P>Shortage of beds means that lower quality private nursing homes can continue to thrive. A representative working party should be set up immediately in the Department of Health and Children to advise the Minister on the next step to take in tackling the problem. I recommend the establishment of a number of group homes, particularly in towns and villages in the west where marriage rates were low in the 1930s and 1940s and when thousands of people emigrated. Many such people are left in isolation and fear, afraid for their safety. They are being robbed and abused by all sorts of people who come to the west late at night and leave early in the morning. The Minister should examine the possibility of homes for such people in their own villages and towns so that neighbours and friends can visit.</P>
    <P>Abuse is a serious matter. There would be uproar if 12,000 young children were being abused. If 12,000 young adults were abused, the matter would be raised every morning on the Order of Business. What is wrong with a society which will not look after the elderly? The elderly have made a major contribution to the State and should be cared for. They should not have to live in fear or in circumstances where they are abused. The Government and all State agencies should assist them. A person who reaches the age of 70 years, regardless of resources, should have a free medical card and free health care.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan, as Minister, commissioned this report and it is outrageous that it was left on the desk of Deputy Cowen, a senior Minister, for over a year without being published.</P>
    <P>If we were told that 12,000 people were being abused in some Third World country the British, the Americans, our Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government would be telling dictatorships what they should be doing and asking why nothing was being done. What is being done for our elderly people? What recommendations in the report will the Minister accept? We should not be afraid to look after the elderly and we must take steps to ensure that when people reach 70 or 75 years of age they are looked after by the State. I do not think anybody would complain, particularly given the current state of the economy, the money available and the record tax receipts. What is wrong with supporting the people who helped found and build the State? The least these people should have is the opportunity to live in comfort and style and not be afraid.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that 12,000 elderly people can be abused in this era of the Celtic tiger and that we are not protecting the weak in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The report entitled <i>Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People in Ireland: An Exploratory Study</i> was recently published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People. The study was commissioned by the national council following a request from my Department that it investigate the issue of elder abuse and advise on how it should be evaluated and responded to.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations was that a working group should be established to advise on policy, procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. The report suggested that the group might include representatives of older people's representative groups, long-stay institutional care staff, representatives of the private nursing home sector, carers' organisations, hospital care professionals, community care professionals, Departments, health boards, local authorities, An Garda Síochána, legal professionals, voluntary service providers and any other relevant parties.</P>
      <P>In September 1998 my Department requested the national council to arrange for the publication of the report and suggested that an expert group be appointed under the direction of the council to prepare guidelines and advise on appropriate procedures for dealing with the matters raised in the report.</P>
      <P>At the time there were a number of vacancies in the membership of the national council and it was without a chairperson. Because of this, and the importance of the subject, the council decided to defer further action on the matter until it was back to full strength. The new appointments were made at the end of December 1998 and I understand that at a meeting of the council on 10 February 1999 the establishment of an expert group was discussed. Subsequently the matter was considered by a group of council members at a special meeting and certain proposals to progress matters were put to my Department. My Department has arranged to meet the national council on 6 May and I expect the functions and membership of the expert group will be agreed at this meeting.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I regard any type of abuse of an older person in a serious light. What I hope will emerge from this exercise is a clear set of definitions, policies, guidelines and procedures which will lessen the possibility of abuse of an older person, and where there is a suggestion that it might have occurred, agreed mechanisms for a full investigation and any appropriate responses where required.</P>
      <P>I again thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to our attention, assure him that I have the greatest respect for some of the matters he has outlined and that we will progress the issue at full speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is treating the year 2000 problem with the utmost urgency and priority and has been taking steps since 1996 to ensure that information technology systems and other office equipment and plant will not be affected. Each Government Department and office is individually responsible for ensuring that it, and the public bodies under its aegis, achieves year 2000 compliance in good time. Based on a detailed circular and advice note issued by my Department, all Departments / offices have put comprehensive year 2000 programmes in place. In addition, monitoring and reporting processes have been put in place in each Department and office to ensure that these programmes are properly managed and progressed. The Government has set an absolute deadline of 31 July 1999 for achieving compliance on business-critical year 2000 projects.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Government established an Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committee</P>
      <P>to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment and plant in the Civil Service. This committee is chaired by my Department and is made up of four private sector representatives and eight civil servants at principal officer level. My Department also provides a full time secretariat to the committee.</P>
      <P>Since December 1997, the committee has met in full on 15 occasions. In addition, subgroups of the committee have met on eight occasions. The following table sets out the dates of these meetings. The committee has scheduled its next meeting for 6 May 1999. Although the Committee has not scheduled its meetings for the remainder of 1999, it expects to average one meeting per month. It will continue to monitor Departments / offices until March 2000 at the earliest to ensure a smooth transition through the millennium changeover period and through the leap year date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> As regards the contingency sum of £40 million, the position is as set out in my reply on 23 March</P>
    <P>to a similar parliamentary question from Deputy Quinn &ndash; viz. no moneys have yet been expended from the contingency sum nor is it expected that any such expenditure will arise until later in the year when it will be easier to judge the extent to which existing allocations may need to be supplemented. For similar reasons, no such spending has been committed and I would not expect that such commitments would arise until later in the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 72 and 309 together.</P>
      <P>As part of preparations for the National Development Plan, my Department commissioned the ESRI to carry out an assessment of investment priorities for the period 2000-6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report was published on March 20 and copies were placed in the Dáil Library shortly <Col N="519" /> afterwards. The report recommends that the top investment priority should be given to public physical infrastructure, particularly in the area of roads, public transport, sanitary services, social housing and social, cultural and recreational infrastructure. The report also emphasises the importance of investment in human capital to expand the supply of skilled labour. There is a strong emphasis in the report on research and development which is regarded as an important element in expanding the economy's productive</P>
    <P>capacity. A scaling back in public resources devoted to promoting investment in industry, services, tourism , agriculture, and energy and telecommunications is also recommended. The ESRI also notes that a major commitment is required to improving the planning process, including the development of physical planning for major urban areas.</P>
    <P>As regards achieving a better spatial distribution of economic activity, the report recommends a nodal strategy for promoting balanced regional development which would involve investing in a small number of larger urban growth centres which could provide a development focus for their surrounding hinterlands. It also recommends identification for investment purposes of a limited number of smaller nodes to serve the widest possible population.</P>
    <P>The report recommends a reduction in tax reliefs in certain areas, including elimination of mortgage interest relief and the introduction of charges for certain services. The revenue saved in this way is proposed to fund some of the investment proposals.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report represents a significant input into the process of the preparation of the National Development Plan. Other significant inputs have been received by the social partners and I met with the partners earlier this year to discuss their individual priorities over the course of the NDP. Subsequent to the Government's decision to regionalise for the purpose of structural funds, consultants were commissioned to draw up strategy documents for each of the two new regions. These strategy documents are due to be published shortly and will also represent a valuable input into the NDP exercise. The NESC is involved in preparing a long-term strategy document and in this regard, I understand that the ESRI report will act as a contribution to that exercise. I have also invited the Dáil Committee on Finance and the Public Service to make a submission on the plan.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the plan is being co-ordinated in my Department and it will be submitted to the Government as soon as possible. At this stage the Government is hoping to submit the NDP to the European Commission before the end of July. The plan will take account of all views submitted including those of the ESRI. I do not propose to assess the merits or otherwise of specific proposals put forward by the ESRI in advance of Government consideration of the contents of the <Col N="520" /> plan. I can say, however, that I do agree with its emphasis on investment in infrastructure and human capital.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 70, 94 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, my Department forecast an Exchequer surplus of £925 million for 1999 on budget day.</P>
      <P>This target surplus has since been impacted by two factors. Firstly, the actual 1998 outturn for tax was £36 million higher than expected. This additional buoyancy is expected to carry into 1999. Second, a total of £160 million has been received during April by the Exchequer for the Telecom Eireann employee share ownership programme. This had not been included in the budget day arithmetic.</P>
      <P>On 6 April last a detailed briefing was given on the performance of the budget over the first three months of 1999. This reported that current and capital expenditure, non-tax revenue and capital resources were in line with budget day expectations, while there were signs that the underlying prospects for tax receipts were positive. The Exchequer returns showed tax receipts for the first quarter of 1999 were 13.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year, compared to a budget day tax forecast for the year as a whole of a 7.7 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I recognise that this performance is good, Deputies should be aware that this does not as yet reflect the impact the budget day personal tax reliefs or the reduction in corporation tax rates introduced in 1998 &ndash; the main impact of which will not be seen until the end of June. The budget day reductions, totalling over £300 million <Col N="521" /> in 1999, will only begin to be reflected from April onwards and should substantially reduce the rate of increase over the remainder of the year. Taking these considerations into account, it is my view that it would be inappropriate to formally revise forecasts on the basis of only three month's performance. To do so at this stage would raise expectations which may not be met. My Department does not intend to formally revise its forecasts for tax receipts or for the budget surplus on foot of the first quarter data.</P>
    <P>As regards the matter of the use of the Exchequer surplus, my views are on record. Running a surplus now is a continuation of the prudent fiscal policies which have been a key element of our recent economic success.  During this exceptional period of growth it would be inappropriate for Government to spend all the additional resources. We must prepare ourselves to cope with a number of significant challenges such as inevitably slower future economic growth, and a reduction in EU transfers which will increase the burden on the public finances.</P>
    <P>Looking further ahead we should take steps now to position the public finances to cope with longer-term liabilities when growth will be much slower as the current favourable demographic trends unwind and the proportion of older people in our population increases.</P>
    <P>The case for reducing the national debt is also compelling. That will lead to a reduction in debt servicing, costs which will release resources for more productive purposes in future years, including improvement in our public services, continued tax reform and infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the stability and growth pact commits the Government to a budget which is close to balance or in surplus over the full economic cycle. As the Irish economy is now growing at exceptional rates, significant budget surpluses are entirely appropriate and in keeping with the objectives of the pact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 90 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the decision to end duty free sales for intra-Community travellers has been enacted into European law and is scheduled to come into effect on 30 June 1999. Any alteration in this arrangement would require a proposal, in the first instance from the EU Commission, and unanimous agreement at Council. To date, the Commission has confirmed that it will not put forward such a proposal. I refer the Deputies to the Adjournment debate in this House on 11 February 1999 and to a priority question, which I answered on 25 February 1999, which dealt comprehensively with the issue of duty free sales.</P>
      <P>Ireland raised this issue at all levels and at various EU Councils including at the European summits over the years. Other EU member states have done likewise but without success. While I have not raised the matter formally recently with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, I can inform the House that the matter was discussed, at some length, at the ECOFIN meeting on 15 March 1999. There the Council took note of the Commission's communication (COM (1999) 65 final, dated 17 February 1999) and requested the Permanent Representatives Committee to examine its contents and to report back at its next meeting. However the question of duty free was not raised at the Berlin Summit at the end of March 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the Report of the Commission on Nursing on 16 September 1998, the nursing unions referred a number of claims to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. These claims were considered by the Labour Court at hearings held on 25 October and 3 December 1998 and the court issued its recommendations on 9 February 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses who work in specialised areas and hold special qualifications. It pointed out that the pay of staff nurses <Col N="523" /> was addressed in the February 1997 settlement but accepted that there were grounds for improvements in the pay of ward sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the Report of the Commission on Nursing. It recommended that the parties enter into discussions immediately on implementation of that report, with those discussions to be completed by 1 May 1999, at which stage the parties were to report back to the court.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, issued a statement the following day on behalf of the Government which indicated that the Government was prepared to accept the Labour Court recommendations, and that the Health Service Employers Agency had been asked to invite the nursing unions to enter into immediate discussions on the basis recommended by the court.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arose when the direct discussions got under way on 25 February 1999 and the Labour Court decided to appoint a chairman to preside over the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Intensive discussions between the parties have since taken place. Although a certain amount of progress was made in the discussions, agreement was not reached on the pay issues. The chairman of the talks has now reported back to the Labour Court and I understand that the court has arranged to meet the parties again on 29 April 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Multi-annual budgeting is part of the wide ranging changes in public service management being introduced under the strategic management initiative. The aim is to put in place a framework within which the Government can consider and decide its overall budgetary, taxation and expenditure priorities in a medium-term context. Progress towards putting that framework in place was made in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets.</P>
      <P>Profiles for the main budgetary aggregates, setting out the Government's medium-term budget targets, were published with the 1999 budget. Also published as part of the 1999 budget documentation were &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; projections of expenditure by ministerial vote group in 2000 and 2001 together with an indication of the total amount available for allocation above these &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; levels within the overall expenditure envelope specified in the budgetary profiles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in my 1999 Budget Statement that I would be addressing the final phase of the move to multi-annual expenditure budgeting, involving the Government making decisions on the allocation of resources across vote groups, to give fin<Col N="524" /> ancial envelopes for those vote groups, by the end of the first quarter of 1999.</P>
    <P>In my statement on the publication of the end-March 1999 Exchequer returns, I indicated that my Department had carried out a considerable amount of work on developing the financial envelopes. However, I said that I had decided to postpone seeking Government decisions on financial envelopes at this time because it had become clear, as the detailed work on developing the envelopes was proceeding in my Department, that seeking Government agreement to the envelopes at this time would not be appropriate. The forthcoming negotiations on the National Development Plan and, subsequently on the national agreement to succeed Partnership 2000, will almost certainly require revision of financial envelopes decided now.</P>
    <P>I decided, in the circumstances, that the final phase of the multi-annual budgeting system will be introduced with effect from the year 2000. It is my intention that, under this new timetable, financial envelopes will be decided by the Government for the years 2001 and 2002 in the first quarter of 2000.</P>

The property is available for State purposes. At the end of the respective trust periods designated in the trust deed, the trust property will come into absolute State ownership and State care for the use, benefit and enjoyment of the Irish people. The trust property is under the management of Mr. Congreve on behalf of the trustees. The gardens at Mount Congreve are internationally famous and house a massive and magnificent collection of both mature and developing exotic plants and shrubs from around the world, many of which are extremely rare.

      <P>I am aware of the motions which were adopted at the recent annual conferences of the teacher unions about a salary increase for teachers.</P>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to public service pay is well known &ndash; pay developments in the public service have to respect the terms of the pay agreements negotiated with the social partners as part of the national programmes.</P>
      <P>In February 1997, the three teacher unions concluded a local bargaining settlement under the terms of the PCW which involved concessions on pensions, early retirement, allowances and pay. Teachers, therefore, have no unfinished business under the PCW.</P>
      <P>Teachers are entitled to pursue a local bargaining increase under the terms of the Partnership 2000 pay agreement. This provides for an increase of up to 2 per cent, payable from a date not earlier than 1 July 1999, subject to verified progress to a satisfactory level on implementation of the modernisation programme in the public service.</P>
      <P>The Government has made it clear that there can be no question of re-opening existing PCW</P>
      <P>local bargaining settlements or departing from the 2 per cent limit on local bargaining increases in Partnership 2000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Over several months, I have received written requests from the Irish League of Credit Unions seeking changes to the taxation of returns on credit union member savings. However, as I have indicated in my replies to these correspondences, this is a complex issue and there are a number of matters which must be considered before any decisions can be taken. Not least, there is the EU <Col N="526" /> dimension which must be carefully examined. The corporation tax exemption for credit unions' surplus income has been questioned as a State aid in Brussels. While the EU Commission decided not to regard the exemption as a State aid, one consideration, I believe, which influenced its decision is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax. This EU dimension has only recently come to the fore. I am still considering this matter and as yet have no proposals in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The drafting of the National Development Plan, NDP, which is being co-ordinated in my Department is taking place in partnership with Government Departments, regional authorities and the social partners. Submissions have been received on the NDP from Government Departments, the existing regional authorities and the social partners and bilateral meetings to discuss those submissions have been held by my Department. I also met with the Irish Assembly of Regional Authorities and representatives of the four social partner pillars in January to discuss their submissions on the NDP. Additional infor<Col N="527" /> mal meetings involving Government Departments and the European Commission have also been held as part of the process. I have also indicated to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service that I would welcome a submission from it on the plan.</P>
    <P>The ESRI ex-ante evaluation of the NDP has also been received by me and I am expecting formal receipt shortly of the Fitzpatrick Associates NUTS II Regional Strategies commissioned by the groups of regional authorities which will comprise the two new NUTS II regions. The ESRI report, the regional strategies and the general strategy to underpin the NDP will be the subject of a seminar involving Government Departments, regional authorities and the social partners to be held on 13 May.</P>
    <P>If the Structural Fund regulations are adopted as anticipated at the end of May we would then have until the end of September to submit the NDP to the European Commission. We will, however, aim to finalise the NDP if possible and to submit it to the European Commission before the end of July.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the NDP will address the general development needs of the economy in the</P>
    <P>period 2000-6. While the plan will be subject to Government approval, I anticipate that particular emphasis will be placed on investment in infrastructure and human capital &ndash; areas which were also recommended for top priority in the ESRI report.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the press release issued by Government on the occasion of the regionalisation decision, regionalisation will not in any sense deflect from the Government's commitment to tackle social exclusion whether urban or rural. In relation to those programmes in the area of social exclusion which are eligible for EU co-financing under the current round, the Government will, within the overall parameters of EU and other funding available in the two new regions, ensure that the objectives of these programmes remain a priority in both regions. Assistance for initial education and training and reskilling opportunities for the unemployed and those with inadequate qualifications will continue to be available in both regions. There will continue to be support for only school leavers, local enterprise development and the integrated development of disadvantaged areas within the new regions, and in particular, in urban blackspots.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Government speedily reacted to the findings of the report into house prices by Peter Bacon and Associates, and announced a number of measures aimed at redressing the imbalance between supply and demand in the housing market. As part of these measures I made a number of changes to the tax system and these were contained in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998. Earlier this year the Government commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to review the effectiveness of the measures taken last year and to consider other recent developments in the housing sector.</P>
      <P>In their second report, the consultants noted that there is widespread consensus that the Government actions, taken last year, have played a key role in achieving a slow-down in the rate of increase in house prices. They stated that the primary impact towards price stability has been achieved through, (i) reducing investor demand, (ii) promoting liquidity in the secondhand market through the reforms of the stamp duty code and (iii) implementing a strategy to address the problem which has been credible to the market.</P>
      <P>In my 1999 Finance Bill, I acted promptly on one further recommendation in the second report to free up the conditions where one can qualify for the special low rate of CGT for development land, where this is sold to form part of the supply of housing land.</P>
      <P>I have previously said that the tax measures taken last year and the further amendment to the capital gains tax code contained in this year's Finance Act were only part of an overall balanced package of ongoing measures taken by this Government. There are a number of measures which my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal have announced in this regard. These measures, which have been discussed at length both inside and outside this House, are aimed at increasing the supply of housing as well as improving the affordability of house purchasing.</P>
      <P>In short, what could be done in the short-term under the tax code has been done and done promptly. Furthermore, tax measures have been put in place to encourage the increased supply of land for housing development.    </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The very significant increases in the price of houses and other property reflects the exceptional performance of the economy in recent years. Nominal GDP is estimated to have increased by almost 30 per cent since 1996. The rapid rise in house prices is largely explained as a lagged response to sharp rises in incomes, employment and household formation in the face of inadequate housing supply. This was one of the main conclusions of the Bacon Report which examined developments in the housing market and made a number of recommendations.</P>
      <P>In response to the Bacon Report the Government implemented a number of measures aimed at both dampening housing demand and improving the supply of housing. In order to review the effectiveness of these measures, the Government commissioned a follow-up study to the Bacon Report. In this report, it was concluded that the Government's measures had achieved some slowing in the rate of increase in house prices. However, it was noted that it will take some time before the supply measures which have been introduced will have a significant impact.</P>
      <P>As regards the link between wage developments and the increase in house prices, the Government is concerned that excessive house price increases might result in wage inflation which undermines the economy's competitiveness. In some sectors there is evidence of wage inflation, most notably in information technology and construction, where there exists an imbalance between the supply and demand for labour. More generally, and despite some pressures, wage inflation is being contained and is broadly in line with the terms of social partnership agreements. However developments in both the housing and labour markets are being monitored closely.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated in a reply to an earlier question today, the Government has decided to support the merger and flotation of ACC Bank and TSB. The Government has also decided in principle in favour of an employee share ownership trust on the basis of up to 5 per cent of the shares of the merged bank being available in return for productivity enhancement and flexibility and a further 9.9 per cent at a cost equiv<Col N="531" /> alent to a valuation of ACC Bank's and TSB's existing operations.</P>
      <P>I have since moved, on a non statutory basis, to appoint a board for the new bank so that planning for the merger may begin. It is my intention that Mr. Matthew Barrett, chairperson of that board, will be appointed to the board of ACC Bank at its forthcoming AGM and the board of trustees of TSB have also agreed to appoint him to their board. Mr. Harry Lorton, chief executive-designate of the new bank and chief executive of TSB has also been appointed to the board of ACC Bank.</P>
      <P>I have also decided to appoint Mr. Padraic O'Connor, who is a member of the non-statutory board, to be the next chairperson of ACC Bank. In addition I have advertised for advisers to assist me in relation to the merger/flotation process and I expect to be in a position to appoint advisers before the end of May.</P>

The Department has been fully engaged in the lead up to key decision points and in managing the normal logistics associated with a flotation process.</P>
    <P>In most cases the bulk of the State's shareholding in State companies is held by the Minister for Finance. The legislation under which Telecom Éireann was established provided that the State's shareholding in the company is held by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the shares to be floated will come from her holding in the company apart from a single share held by the Minister for Finance. The key strategic decisions on the various elements of the flotation are taken at Government level on foot of proposals from the Minister for Public Enterprise who has primary shareholder responsibility for the process, The Minister for Public Enterprise has sponsored the amending legislation necessary to facilitate the public offering of shares in the company. She has also ensured that Deputies have been fully briefed on developments affecting the IPO through her statements in the Dáil and in replies to parliamentary questions.</P>

      <P>The latest position regarding the approval of the urban and rural renewal schemes is that the EU Commission has recently written to my Department with further queries arising from our response to their previous letter seeking additional information. A reply to them is currently being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Treaties contain provisions for the recovery from recipients of relief that the Commissions rules as illegal state aids. Ruling on the illegality or otherwise of an aid in any particular case is a matter for the Commission. The position regarding double rent allowance and rates remission in the Custom House Docks area is that the EU Commission have initiated proceedings against Ireland, under Article 92(3) of the EU Treaty for the non-notified introduction of this relief in the Custom House Docks area from end May 1993. As part of these proceedings, the EU Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 10 April 1999 its formal letter of 30 January 1999 to <Col N="534" /> the Irish Government. Third parties across the EU are entitled to comment on this matter within one month of the date of publication and I will not be in a position to comment further on the matter until this stage of the proceedings is completed. I emphasise that the initiation of such procedures is a common occurrence and the Government is hopeful of bringing the matter to a satisfactory conclusion with the EU Commission within the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Euro 11 meeting held on 15 March 1999 had an initial discussion on a proposal from the European Central Bank, ECB, that, in order to facilitate the final testing of financial market systems to ensure Year 2000 compliance, there should be full closure of all financial markets on 31 December 1999. The meeting also had a general discussion on the economic situation and outlook and the German Presidency updated the meeting on the implementation of the conclusions of the Vienna European Council on the External Representation of the Community at G7 meetings.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, held on the same day consisted of the following number of issues. ECOFIN considered the progress of Agenda 2000 negotiations, focusing on agriculture and financing issues. I joined with the majority of Finance Ministers in welcoming the progress that had been made at the Agriculture Council the previous week. However, several Ministers were anxious to secure further savings to offset the higher than expected cost of the agricultural package. Overall, the discussion was a frank and useful one which helped to prepare the ground for the Berlin European Council.</P>
      <P>Regarding the implementation of the stability and growth pact and Stability Programme of Spain (1998-2002) the Council examined Spain's stability programme. The Council considered that the medium term macroeconomic scenario presented in the programme was achievable, based on structural reform, a stable monetary framework within the euro area, and sound budgetary consolidation. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Stability Programme of Belgium (1999-2002), the Council examined Belgium's stability programme. The Council considered that the underlying budgetary position in Belgium was sufficient to provide a safety margin to prevent the deficit from breaching the 3 per cent of GDP threshold as a result of cyclical fluctuations. However, the Council noted that fiscal consolidation needed to be pursued beyond the horizon of the programme in order to ensure the debt <Col N="535" /> ratio continued to fall, and to respond to longer term issues, in particular those stemming from the ageing of the population. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Stability Programme of Germany (1998-2002), the Council examined Germany's stability programme. It noted that the envisaged medium-term deficit objective of 1 per cent of GDP would be sufficient to allow automatic stabilisers to work in a normal cyclical downturn without any large risk of breaching the 3 per cent of GDP reference value. However, the Council considered that the German authorities should aim to reduce the difference beyond the projected level at the end of the programme period when growth is projected to have picked up. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Stability Programme of France (1998-2002), the Council examined France's stability programme. It noted that the macroeconomic scenario presented realistic GDP growth assumptions close to growth potential and past performance. It commanded the fact that the government deficit reduction over the period of the programme was entirely attributable to the expected reduction in Government expenditure. However, the Council considered that the safety margin provided by the programme should be wider in order to accommodate unforeseen developments such as the uncertain budgetary impact of major structural reforms. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Stability Programme of Luxembourg (1999-2002), the Council examined the stability programme of Luxembourg. The Council noted that the good performance of the economy and sound policies have been the basis for the healthy state of the public finance in Luxembourg. It commended the approach taken by the Luxembourg Government to sound public finance management, structural reform and other policy measures. The Council opinion was adopted.</P>
    <P>Regarding the preparation of the 1999 broad economic policy guidelines, the Council held a further orientation debate on the policy issues to be dealt with in the broad economic policy guidelines. The debate focused on the structural aspects of economic reform, in the light of reports from the Commission and from the Economic Policy Committee. These reports recommended a number of priority areas for attention including reforms in goods, services and capital markets, labour market developments and fiscal sustainability. I welcomed the reports, which in a number of cases focused on issues highlighted in our own Structural Reform Report.</P>
    <P>On the Report of the Court of Auditors for 1997, the Council took note of a presentation by the President of the Council of Auditors outlining the main features of the Court's annual report on the implementation of the 1997 budget. Council also adopted a recommendation to the European <Col N="536" /> Parliament on the discharge to be given to the European Commission for the implementation of the 1997 budget. The Council made a number of comments accompanying this recommendation which emphasised its commitment to protecting the financial interests of the Community through combating fraud and promoting sound and effective financial management.</P>
    <P>On the fight against fraud and the establishment of a european fraud investigation office, Council agreed a set of conclusions concerning the establishment of a new European fraud investigation office. These conclusions support the establishment of an office which is independent in its operation, and which is capable of both internal investigations with the Community institutions and external investigations within the member states.</P>
    <P>Council discussed the issue of duty free, taking note of certain measures proposed by the Commission to tackle the problems which the abolition of duty free on 1 July 1999 would cause. The Permanent Representatives Committee was asked to examine the Commission's proposals and to report on them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On the taxation on savings, Council took note of an interim oral report from the Commission on discussions held with third countries on a possible international application of the principles underlying the draft directive on savings. The Council agreed that work on the draft directive should be accelerated with the aim of reaching political agreement by the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    <P>The Council took note of an interim report on the issue of energy taxation, and asked the competent bodies to pursue work on the basis of the report of ECOFIN to the Vienna European Council.</P>
    <P>The Council noted a presentation by Commissioner Monti on the proposal for a directive allowing member states to impose a reduced VAT on certain labour-intense services for an experimental period, and asked the competent bodies to examine the proposal and to report back to it in due time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the March CPI which was published on 13 April. The year-to-year increase in the consumer price index fell to 1.4 per cent in March from 1.6 per cent in February and has fallen from its peak of 3.2 per cent last August. However, this headline inflation rate has benefited from the recent cuts in mortgage interest rates. Excluding mortgage interest costs, inflation was 2.4 per cent in March compared to <Col N="537" /> 2.6 per cent in February and has been around 2.5 per cent since last November.</P>
      <P>While the reduction in inflation in recent months is welcome, it is important to remember that inflation has been falling in our trading partners also. As measured by the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, inflation here was 2 per cent in March compared with about 1 per cent for the EU as a whole.</P>
      <P>With international inflation very subdued, the latest figures data suggest the existence of domestic inflationary pressures in the Irish economy. In the year to March there have been increases in food prices of 4.5 per cent and in services and related expenditure of 4.4 per cent. The increase in food prices probably reflects once off factors which should gradually unwind. However, the increase in services inflation suggests that domestic inflationary pressures remain a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>It is essential that wage and other cost developments, in the context of social partnership, continue to support low inflation.</P>
      <P>As regards the forecast for the year as a whole, I do not envisage changing my budget day forecast at this stage. As the mortgage interest rate reductions drop out of the year-to-year comparisons, the baseline inflation rate is likely to pick up in the second half of the year. Updated economic forecasts, including a projection for inflation, will be published as usual in mid-year.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, all Government Departments-offices engaged in a tender process which resulted in the appointment of a travel agent to procure air transport and related services for officers travelling on official business.

My Department has finalised its foreign travel policy which emphasises the need to achieve value for money in respect of each official trip undertaken. In determining which travel option offers best value for money, the staff of my Department have been advised that they must be prepared to use the services of all carriers operating out of Ireland where the carrier meets the reasonable requirements of the staff and the Department. Neither my Department nor the appointed agent will enter into any exclusive arrangement with any one carrier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Banks are independent institutions and it is a matter for individual banks to say what steps they take to trace the owners of dormant accounts.</P>
      <P>As regards banks taking steps to find relatives of a deceased account holder, this raises a number of issues. Banks may not be aware of the death of a customer unless someone tells them.  However, I understand that banks do often, due to a variety of circumstances such as the bank/customer relationship, advice from families and from third parties such as payers of pensions etc. become aware when a customer dies. The banks have said that, on becoming aware of the death of a customer, they do endeavour to draw the attention of the next-of-kin to the existence of a bank account.  </P>
      <P>It would probably be relatively unusual for there to be no documentary evidence among a deceased's personal effects such as a bank statement, receipts, pass books, bank cards etc. which would suggest that an account exists.</P>
      <P>Banks also provide a checking service for solicitors or for the personal representatives of deceased persons whereby they can readily obtain information to establish whether or not an account exists in the name of the deceased person. This facility enables the whole of a bank's network to be checked. I should also mention that the banks have recently published an explanatory leaflet entitled &ldquo;A Guide to Dormant Bank Accounts&rdquo;, together with a claim form, which is available from bank branches. It would be wise for people who have savings or other accounts in credit institutions or other assets to take steps to ensure that their next-of-kin became aware of these assets by leaving a will or some other notification.</P>
      <P>On the separate issue of obliging the banks to hand over the assets in dormant accounts to the State, this raises a number of problems. There is no legal definition of a dormant account. Practice in relation to the classification of accounts as dormant varies from institution to institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the legal owners of a dormant account may not be dead. Many people leave <Col N="540" /> money in accounts, are aware of these accounts and do not wish to take steps in relation to them for considerable periods of time.  This could arise, for example, where a grandparent opens an account for a minor and intends to pay the sum accrued to the minor on his 21st birthday.  If the account holder is deceased, they may not have died intestate. Even if they are deceased and intestate, they may not be without heirs or successors.</P>
    <P>Sequestration of the assets in dormant bank accounts by the State is fraught with difficulties. It would give rise to legal and even constitutional difficulties, particularly in the area of property rights.  Nevertheless, I accept that there is a view that dormant accounts existing for long periods of time should benefit the public good, if credit institutions have no legal or moral claim to them.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous parliamentary questions on the issue of dormant accounts, my Department is actively considering how this complex issue might be addressed. I expect to be able to submit policy proposals in the matter to the Government soon.</P>

      <P>The new urban renewal designations were announced by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, on 17 February 1999. The urban renewal scheme is comprised of incentives for both commercial and residential development. As the commercial incentives are subject to EU approval. the Government decided to introduce the scheme in two stages. The residential tax incentives were introduced with effect from 1 March 1999. I will not be in a position to announce the introduction of the business elements of the scheme until EU approval is received.</P>
      <P>The latest position regarding the approval of the scheme is that the EU Commission has recently written to my Department with further queries arising from our response to their previous letter seeking additional information. The reply to them is currently being prepared. I would stress that this is part of the normal process associated with obtaining EU approval and that the procedure may take some time to complete. Any final decision made by the Commission in this context will be announced at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to parliamentary questions on 4 March 1999, a review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. The review has not yet been completed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out a wide ranging technical review of the operation of the scheme and their report is awaited. However, this review is much narrower in scope in that it addresses problems with the present scheme and makes recommendations on how to make it operate in a more effective and cost-efficient manner for its present target group.</P>
      <P>However, I should caution against raising expectations that any person who suffers from some form of disability will be admitted to the scheme following the completion of these examinations. As was pointed out in the reply to the Adjournment debate held on 2 March 1999, which sought extension to one particular category, very large groups or categories have sought to be included in the scheme.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, public service occupational pensions have been financed on a pay-as-you-go basis as part of the public service pay bill, with the costs met each year from current revenue and employee contributions. However, as the Deputy may be aware, recent actuarial studies suggest that the cost of public service pensions, expressed in constant price terms, is expected to increase fourfold over the next thirty years. The Commission on Public Service Pensions is considering this matter &ndash; including the question of advance funding &ndash; as part of its examination of public service pension arrangements. In its interim report, published in November 1997, the commission stated that the evolution of pension costs required careful monitoring. It noted that funding, were it to be introduced on a full or partial basis, would raise significant practical and budgetary issues. It went on to say that it would consider the full range of arguments regarding funding in its final report, taking into account the experience of other countries.</P>
      <P>I look forward to considering the forthcoming report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>

      <QRef>[10201/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall outline the results of the Berlin European Council as they affected the future financing of the Community, with particular regard for our potential receipts from the Structural and Cohesion Funds and our contributions to the EU budget.</P>
      <P>Concerning future financing, the main outcome was the agreement of the future financial framework covering the years 2000-2006. This involves maintaining the own resources ceiling for the budget at 1.27 per cent of EU GNP. The Berlin European Council agreed a number of changes to the financing system for the EU Budget, mainly in response to the concerns of the four biggest net contributors: Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, who each make a net contribution to the EU of over 3.5 per cent of GNP. It is estimated that the changes to the own resource system agreed at Berlin will reduce Ireland's contribution to the EU budget by some £31 million, compared to what it would otherwise be, over the period of the 2000-2006 financial perspective. Although Ireland's budget contribution will increase over the period, largely reflecting increases in our GNP, Ireland will still be a sizeable net beneficiary from the EU budget in 2006.</P>
      <P>On the expenditure side, the agreement on agriculture, the details of which have been given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, represents a very satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Structural Funds, the outcome of the Berlin negotiations encompasses the reclassification of Ireland into two regions, of which one, the Border, midlands and western region, will retain full Objective One status while the other region, the southern and eastern region, will be treated as a region in transition under Objective One. This transition status will last for six years but in the seventh year, 2006, residual amounts of funding from the various funds will still be available under various headings. It is estimated that the regionalisation approach has secured an amount of about £470 million and above what would have otherwise been available to Ireland.</P>
      <P>We estimate that, subject to confirmation when the Commission approves member state shareout, Ireland's overall allocation from Structural and Cohesion Fund support in the next round will amount to about £3.3 billion. This overall allocation takes account of headage payments being transferred from category two of the EU budget to category one which deals with agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About £2.4 billion will be available from the Structural Funds over the next seven years. About £1 billion of this will be allocated to the Border, midlands and west region with the <Col N="544" /> remaining £1.4 billion allocated to the southern and eastern region.</P>
    <P>About £118 million will be available to Ireland from the Community initiatives. The estimated £118 million from the Community initiatives will encompass the INTERREG initiative, enhancing cross-border, transnational and interregional co-operation, the LEADER initiative, assisting rural development, and the EQUAL initiative, transnational co-operation to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in the labour market. Precise details and amounts for each initiative will have to be negotiated with the Commission.</P>
    <P>The overall peace programme will amount to 500 million euros, of which 100 million euros, i.e., about £79 million, reflects Ireland's share. This 100 million euros will be spent in the Border counties. The remaining 400 million euros of the peace programme will be allocated to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>About £440 million will be available to Ireland over the next four years from the Cohesion Fund. Receipts from the Cohesion Fund will be divided on a roughly 50/50 basis between projects in the transport sector and environmental projects. Because of the substantial economic progress of recent years and because of the expectations that Ireland's economy will continue to grow strongly, a mid-term review in 2003 is likely to see Ireland exceed the threshold for Cohesion Fund eligibility of 90 per cent of the average EU per-capita GNP.</P>
    <P>The agreement for Ireland represents a satisfactory outcome, reflecting in particular the success of the Government's regionalisation strategy. In total, taking account of headage payments in the agriculture area, an overall transfer of some £3.3 billion has been achieved.</P>

      <P>Local employment service (LES) networks are currently operating in the following 18 areas: Dublin northside, Dublin inner city, Tallaght, Finglas/Cabra, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Cork city, south Kerry, west Waterford, south west Wexford, Mayo, Dundalk, Limerick city, Drogheda, Counties Kildare and Clare.</P>
      <P>On 29 September 1998, I announced the expansion of the LES to a further seven areas, namely, Bray, Southside, comprising 12 areas in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Canal communities, Bluebell, Inchicore, Islandbridge, Kilmainham, Rialto, Galway city, County Monaghan, Tralee and Waterford city. Those areas are currently at various stages in establishing the LES.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Combat Poverty Agency's report from 1998, Where are Poor Households?, ranked counties by unemployment rate based on 1986 and 1991 data. The first 11 areas ranked in that analysis were, for 1991, Donegal, <Col N="546" /> Limerick county borough, Louth, Dublin county borough, Cork county borough, Waterford county borough, Wexford, Carlow, South Tipperary, Wicklow and Offaly. Within particular areas there can be a substantial variation in the unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>Despite the tremendous progress we are making in terms of increased employment, there are certain areas of the country which continue to suffer serious disadvantage and long-term unemployment. The Government is tackling that problem. We have decided to bring the LES and the FÁS employment service together in a co-ordinated manner under the auspices of FÁS. Within this new framework FÁS will be establishing a widely representative employment service advisory committee to support it in the implentation of the employment service function. This restructuring should ensure that resources are utilised in the optimum manner and that a comprehensive employment service is available for those who need it. Furthermore, the Government's Employment Action Plan is being implemented vigorously. There has been substantial progress reported in the 18-25 year old age group who passed six months on the live register. In March we extended the action plan to those under 25 years old as they crossed 18 months on the live register and from 1 May we will be addressing the 25-34 year old age group who are on the live register for one year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 117, 118, 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The European Single Market gives the right to any firm within the European Union to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the European Union. This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the Single Market. Once the relevant provisions of EU competition law and Single Market rules are adhered to, it is open to all companies to source their products anywhere within the EU. I am not aware of the failure by any company to comply with commitments or obligations entered into under national mergers legislation.</P>
      <P>Tesco, for its part, voluntarily gave commitments to increase the value of purchases from Irish companies. An independent study was carried out by the ESRI to establish a benchmark of the level of Irish products sourced by Tesco as of February 1997. On the basis of the study, Tesco gave a commitment to increase its purchases from Irish companies from £692 million to £997 million, an increase of 44 per cent over the five year period 1997 to 2002.</P>
      <P>The latest ESRI study, which covers the period up to February 1998, shows that purchases from Irish companies grew from £692 million to £770 million, an increase of 12 per cent. These results are welcome and represent a step in the right direction. However, if the target of £997 million is to be achieved, much more needs to be done. I conveyed this message to Tesco management when I met them recently. Tesco, on their part, pointed out that during its first two years in the Irish market, much time and effort was spent on consolidating the business and they would expect substantial improvements over the next three years. My Department, in co-operation with Tesco, will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>The ESRI studies cannot be made available as they contain information which is commercially sensitive. Further studies will be carried out by the ESRI on a yearly basis to measure progress made by Tesco in achieving its objective. It is intended that the report covering the period up to February 1999 will be available before the end of the year.</P>

      <Col N="548" /> Enterprise Ireland has had a number of meetings with the other company referred to with a view to identifying the opportunities for sourcing products from Irish companies. I also had a meeting with the company in November last at which they agreed to work closely with Enterprise Ireland to ensure that Irish companies would be given every opportunity to compete for business. I am aware of complaints regarding the sourcing of products by the company. My Department has been in contact with the company and a meeting has been arranged to discuss the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 116, 135, 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The structures under which community training workshops &ndash; CTWs &ndash; operate are as follows: CTWs are voluntary bodies which provide community based training opportunities to socially or educationally disadvantaged young people; The workshops are under the control of management committees drawn from different sectors of the community; and the management committees employ the staff in CTWs and are responsible for the terms and conditions of their employment.</P>
      <P>FÁS's role is to provide funding for the payment of staff wages, and for payment of allowances to trainees. In 1997, a review was undertaken of FÁS's funding of CTWs. The outcome of that review was that FÁS increased its grant to the CTWs to facilitate improvements in the salary levels of CTW staff. Sick leave and annual leave entitlements of CTW staff were also improved.</P>
      <P>While I do not have any direct function in relation to the CTWs, my attention has been drawn to a number of specific issues, including structural difficulties, which have arisen in negotiating redundancy payments for CTW staff.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials to examine the matter with a view to bringing about a resolution as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> I take it that the Deputy is referring in both cases to land sold for the purposes of development specifically for dwelling houses.</P>
    <P>The total amount of land sold by Shannon Development to property developers, from 1994-1998, was 18.76 acres. This was disposed of in 13 individual lots ranging in size from 0.5 acres to 3.5 acres. The total amount of money received by Shannon Development in this regard was £497,006. In the period, no land for housing purposes was sold to private individuals.</P>

      <P>The process of disposing of land for development by tender, auction, and private treaty allows for competition, thus enabling Shannon Development to achieve the best open market price. These procedures ensure openness and transparency.</P>
      <P>Negotiated sales take place on the basis of direct enquiries received from individuals or builders and prices are based on benchmarks established by previous auctions, tenders etc. In such cases, the sale price is also endorsed by an independent market valuation by an external estate agent.</P>

      <P>On 6 April 1999, a WTO panel ruled that the EU revised banana import regime is non-WTO compatible. The panel assessed the damage to US interests at $191 million, which is less than half the amount of sanctions threatened by the US. The EU Commission and the member states are currently studying the panel report.</P>
      <P>On 9 April, the US published a revised list of products to reflect the panel's findings; exports of these products from the EU would be subject to 100 per cent tariffs.</P>
      <P>My Department and I are monitoring the potential impact of these proposed sanctions on Irish exporters. Some products of importance to Irish exporters which featured on the US preliminary list, including greeting cards, chandeliers and pig meat, are now no longer affected, and therefore, the impact, if any, of the proposed sanctions would be considerably lessened.</P>
      <P>There are ongoing discussions within the EU and also between the EU Commission and the US, with a view to resolving the dispute. Ireland is very active in these discussions. There are no proposals for any indemnification scheme currently under consideration.</P>

    <P>In the year to April 1997 &ndash; the latest period for which cross-comparative data is available &ndash;<Col N="554" /> growth in employment in Ireland, at 5.0 per cent, was the highest of all EU member states. The growth rate was over one-quarter higher than Luxembourg who had the next highest employment growth rate of 3.7 per cent. Ireland's employment growth exceeded the average European growth rate, of 0.6 per cent, by a factor of eight. Over a more extended period, covering the two years from April 1995, Irelands employment growth rate, of 8.8 per cent, was nearly one-third higher than the next highest rate of 6.1 per cent, and exceeded the European average, of 0.9 per cent, by a factor of nine.</P>

      <P>FÁS's Excellence Through People award provides recognition to companies who demonstrate that they have invested in a systematic way in training and developing their employees.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has an important role to play in raising the awareness of employers in indigenous companies to the importance of training and development. Through its client-centred approach to company development, Enterprise Ireland will work with employers to develop key business functions such as training, and thus enhance their competitive advantage.  </P>
      <P>I will shortly be formally launching a new business-led training networks programme, which is aimed at adding impetus to Irish business drive to identifying and addressing its training needs. The networks programme, which will operate on a three-year pilot basis from 1999, will focus on mobilising groups of companies to develop strategies which address their common training needs. The programme is based on the recognition that the private sector has primary responsibility for defining its own human resources development requirements. It is being driven by a board which is representative of business, trade unions and State bodies.</P>
      <P>A provision of £3 million has been made in my Department's revised Estimate for 1999 towards the cost of the programme. A sum of £2.3 million is also being provided this year from the European Social Fund. The objective is that the pilot programme will demonstrate the benefits of training to firms and that it will lead to an increased commitment on the part of Irish companies to investment in training and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initiatives such as those mentioned above are vital if we are to develop, within our enterprises, a culture of learning which is essential to ensure <Col N="555" /> that Ireland's competitive edge is maintained into the next millennium.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 134, inclusive, and 139 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent substantial falls in unemployment. Trends in both the labour force survey and live register confirm the considerable falls in <Col N="556" /> overall and long-term unemployment. Already this year the target set in the employment action plan of reducing unemployment to 7 per cent has been achieved well ahead of the end year 2000 target date. The standardised unemployment rate at end March 1999 was 6.7 per cent. The seasonally adjusted live register figure of 201, 600 at the end of March 1999, is the lowest since October 1983.</P>
    <P>The fall in unemployment has been achieved during a period of exceptional economic and employment growth. Estimates for the 12 months to April 1998, based on the labour force survey, show that underlying growth in employment of 95,000 or 6.9 per cent, was accompanied by a significant reduction of 32,400 or 20.4 per cent, in unemployment, despite the substantial 62,000 or 4 per cent increase in the labour force.</P>
    <P>The labour force survey is the internationally agreed standard statistical method of establishing the numbers at work, unemployed and outside the labour force. It uses internationally comparable definitions of employment and unemployment as recommended by the International Labour Office. Because of its comprehensiveness and coherence it is the key measure of employment and unemployment which informs policy-making in my Department. Obviously, additional sources such as the live register provide complimentary data on short-term trend indicators between publication of the labour force survey results. The recent introduction of quarterly national household surveys, carried out by the Central Statistics Office, is a significant and very positive development in the provision of more regular data on employment and unemployment trends.</P>
    <P>We must continue to strive to further reduce unemployment. I have signalled that I would wish to see unemployment fall towards 5 per cent in the period ahead. The unemployment projections underpinning budget 1999, which are determined by many factors such as economic trends and demographic factors, are for the unemployment rate to fall from 6.8 per cent in 1999 to 5.9 per cent by 2001.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Dáil Public Accounts Committee on 1 April 1999 which, I understand, considered a report on unemployment commissioned by the committee. A key conclusion of the consultants' report called for the introduction, subject to the provision of additional resources, of a case-management approach for all unemployed persons given the recent success of the employment action plan approach for young unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The Government recently agreed that the employment action plan be extended, with effect from 1 March 1999, to young persons as they cross 18 months on the live register, and with effect from 1 May to adult unemployed in the age cohort 25 to 34 as they cross 12 months on the live register. These are significant positive additions to the phased implementation of the employment action plan and I will continue this <Col N="557" /> process in the period ahead. This approach represents the best way forward in assisting the unemployed on their progression to the open labour market and back to work.   </P>
    <P>The employment action plan sets the policy framework for further growing employment and reducing unemployment. It will form a key determinant in the development of policies aimed at mobilising our labour supply aimed at meeting the labour needs of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the EU Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions. This directive has been adopted by both the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers and entered into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities, 30 July 1998. All the EU member states are required to transpose the directive into national legislation by July 2000 and my Department is currently making the necessary arrangements for transposition by that date.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the directive is to confirm, clarify and consolidate existing patent law with regard to biotechnological inventions throughout the EU in order, inter alia, to overcome the perceived view that EU countries, including Ireland, are less favourable for developing new products using biotechnology in terms of speed, stability, transparency and profitability. The purpose of a patent system is to promote technical innovation by encouraging inventive activity through awarding inventors for their creative efforts. Thus a harmonised patent system throughout the EU in the area of biotechnological inventions should secure investment in research and development and simultaneously encourage an early and beneficial dissemination of knowledge in the biotechnology/genetic engineering industry, which is viewed as being of fundamental importance in the industrial development of the EU. An essential requirement for the patent system throughout most of the world is that the invention must be new, must be inventive and must not have been in the public domain at any time before the date on which the patent was applied for. It follows from these requirements that a patent granted for any new invention cannot be used to prevent people in developing or indeed any other countries from continuing to undertake traditional activities.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the national consultation process, initiated by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with the issuing of a consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment, in August 1998, was to stimulate an informed public debate in this area. To conclude the process, which is now at an advanced stage, the many respondents to the consultation paper have been invited to participate in a two-part debate at which key environmental issues will be identified and analysed. On foot of a report from the independent chairing panel which will manage this debate, and having regard to the written submissions already received, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will complete a review of national environmental policy on the release of genetically modified organisms and make a statement on the matter.</P>

A total of 30 former employees responded to the questionnaire, of whom 17 have already found employment while 13 are still unemployed.</P>
      <P>The questionnaire also sought to establish the level of training required for the ex-employees of the company. The local employment services group is organising for training to be arranged for 14 people by FÁS or the Mayo County Enterprise Board.</P>

I believe that competition in the marketplace and the provision of adequate information will ensure that consumers' interests are provided for.</P>
      <P>The lack of information and transparency about such additional charges was adverted to by the previous Director of Consumer Affairs in his annual reports for both 1991 and 1994, together with a recommendation that a transparency order be made. The order, which was made in 1997, is one of a series of transparency orders which have been made to ensure that consumers have adequate information about the prices of goods and services.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Consumer Information (Advertisements for Concert or Theatre Performances) Order, 1997 (S.I. No. 103 of 1997) requires that advertisements for the purchase of tickets for public concert or theatre performances should contain certain information in relation to booking charges. Every written advertisement for a public concert or theatre performance must indicate the amount, in monetary or percentage terms, of any additional charge and the circumstances in which such an additional charge is payable. In all other forms of advertising, the admission price must be stated together with a reference to the fact that an additional charge may be payable in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for the enforcement of the 1997 order and is empowered to take legal action in the event of any established case of non-compliance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 enabled local authorities and others to propose that jet skis and fast power craft would not operate in certain designated areas, I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 27 of 27 May 1998 that there were difficulties concerning the implementation of these regulations.</P>
      <P>However, I have initiated action on a number of fronts to address the wide ranging public concerns that have been expressed in relation to the indiscriminate use of jet skis and fast power boats in certain inland and coastal waters.</P>
      <P>A safety code for jet skis has been introduced by the marine safety working group (MSWG) which operates under the chairmanship of the director of the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of my Department and whose aim is to create and communicate marine safety information and messages, and to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters. I am arranging to send a copy of the safety code to the Deputy. The purpose of the code is to heighten awareness of the requirements to operate such craft in a safe manner with particular regard to the safety of other water users. The safety code is being distributed widely to safety organisations, local authorities and people involved in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Institute, whose functions include the promotion of the sustainable development of the marine leisure resource, has engaged consultants to undertake a full examination of safety in the water leisure sector with a view to proposing models as to how best the safety in the sector can be addressed. The operation of jet skis and fast power craft is being specifically addressed in this examination. The institute and its consultants have been asked that there be full consultation with interested parties, including public authorities and voluntary bodies, and that the examination will, among other things, involve assessing the most appropriate statutory and non<Col N="566" /> statutory models, including local authorities input, for management and promotion of the safe use of jet skis and fast power craft.</P>
    <P>As the Marine Institute's examination of the matter will involve assessing the most appropriate local authority input, I am particularly keen to explore further the appropriate role for local authorities in dealing with the problem in their own areas. Indeed, I understand that Fingal County Council has, in recent days, formally adopted beach bye-laws which are due to come into force shortly and which will deal with jet skis in certain areas under that council's control in accordance with powers under the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>

    <P>The remainder of the area off the west coast is not licensed at present and the acreage which was offered to the industry in rounds during the last four years is closed for licensing at this time.</P>
    <P>The benefits to the taxpayer arising from further discoveries of commercial quantities of oil and gas would be very considerable, though difficult to quantify precisely at this stage. The direct impact would depend on aspects such as the size of the accumulation, duration of production, flow rates, the cost of development, operating expenses and market price. The economic benefits resulting directly from the natural gas produced from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas fields illustrate the obvious importance of indigenous energy supplies. These benefits reflect the employment in the services sector of engineering and technical industries, technical support industries, the import substitution effect and downstream economic activity.</P>
    <P>The licence held by Enterprise Oil to which the Deputy refers is subject, as are all exploration licences, to the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development 1992, and the 1992 Finance Act. A development under the 1992 terms and the 1992 Finance Act would not be subject to royalties or state participation and corporation tax would be levied at a special rate of 25 per cent for developments brought into production by certain specified dates. The terms are attractive but are necessary and appropriate given the current position of oil and gas exploration and production offshore Ireland. The terms strike a balance between the interests of the State and those of the oil and gas industry. Rentals in respect of all licences are specified in the terms and these are collected on an annual basis. An information package, which contains details of licensing procedures and terms and provisions relating to petroleum taxation, is being furnished to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>My Department receives all data obtained by the operators of licences in respect of exploration, <Col N="572" /> appraisal and development operations. In the case of the Corrib appraisal well, as for all wells, daily reports, together with all specific data acquired, were received in my Department as soon as they became available, on a confidential basis, via the Internet. This data was analysed by specialists in my Department who also used the services of specialist consultants where considered necessary. An authorised officer from my Department was present on the drilling rig during the test. He has assured me that I have a full and accurate set of data from the well.</P>
    <P>The report by consultants to which the Deputy refers is the October 1998 edition of the North West Europe Upstream Report which contains an article about the Corrib gas discovery. This was published by Wood Mackenzie and they have provided my Department with a copy of the article. Even though Wood Mackenzie state that they believe the field can already be regarded as commercial, I am satisfied that, on the basis of the data acquired to date, such a conclusion cannot be made at this stage. This view is borne out by the fact that a further appraisal well is to be drilled this year. At this time, it is not known with precision how much gas is in place and one, perhaps two, more years extended char 4,28 assessment is needed before a decision on commerciality can be taken. If so it is then likely to take up to two further years to carry out development and bring the field into production. Nonetheless, as I explained in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question on 16 February 1999, Enterprise Oil have indicated that the Corrib gas accumulation could contain one trillion cubic feet of gas in-place.</P>
    <P>Reference to five trillion cubic feet of gas in the Corrib Field is not an accurate representation of what Wood Mackenzie concluded in their article. While it is unlikely that Wood Mackenzie has had access to specific data from the Corrib Field, they estimated that the structure could hold about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of reserves but indi<Col N="573" /> cated that at this stage estimates must be tentative. They considered that there was potential in the greater Slyne Erris Trough area for up to five trillion cubic feet of gas because of other structures known to exist in the area but as yet undrilled. At this time such a figure is purely speculative. As the Wood Mackenzie report was not commissioned by my Department, but is a commercial publication for private circulation to subscribers only, the matter of laying it before Dáil Éireann does not arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 178, 179, 180, 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>I have read with considerable dismay reports regarding the outcome of the presidential elections in Algeria last week. As the House may be aware, the six opposition candidates withdrew from the campaign in its final stages, leaving only one candidate who was duly elected.</P>
      <P>Such an outcome can only be regarded as a serious setback to the whole process of democratising the Algerian political system.  The result, instead of strengthening the legitimacy and credibility of the democratic institutions of Algeria, especially that of the presidency, can only serve to undermine them. Given the current extremely disturbed state of that country, this is a most worrying development.</P>
      <P>I will be discussing with our European Union partners what steps, if any, the Union can take in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>On the issue of international observers it is my understanding that the Algerian Government were not receptive to the presence of such observers. Clearly without the explicit approval of that Government, which would have to provide physical protection for the observers, the issue could not be pursued further.</P>
      <P>The situation in Algeria was addressed by the European Union in its statement in the discussion on the agenda item dealing with the general situation of human rights at the current session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I am confident that the British Government would share my positive view of the institute and of other similar research projects being developed in third level educational institutions elsewhere in these islands.

      <P>The extension of this type of protest to yet another church would, of course, be an extremely worrying development.

      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned about the trials of Fathers Leno Sebit and Hilary Boma and their co-accused, detained following the bombings which took place in Khartoum last June. We have been especially concerned that they were being tried by military tribunal with limited access to their legal representatives and under threat of the death penalty. The Government is continuing its efforts aimed at ensuring that these trials are conducted in accordance with international standards of human rights and justice and with a right of appeal. The current position is that the competence of the military tribunal to hear the cases is under review by the constitutional court, which has adjourned the relevant hearings. Pending the outcome of the hearings, some priest colleagues have been able to accompany lawyers visiting the accused in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's concerns about the human rights situation in Sudan, including these cases, were raised when I met the Minister for External Affairs of Sudan, Dr. Mustafa Ismail Osman, during his official visit to Dublin on 12 April. I have previously raised them at the EU General Affairs <Col N="578" /> Council and they are being addressed in the Union's ongoing contacts with the Sudanese authorities. In addition, they are being pursued by the Irish Ambassador in Cairo who is also accredited to Sudan; at my request, he has been monitoring the cases since last year. The matter is also being followed closely by the Embassy to the Holy Sea. The Papal Nuncio to Sudan has previously visited the accused. Our continuing concerns about human rights violations in Sudan are under active discussion at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue its efforts, both bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners, to urge the Sudanese authorities to treat these cases in accordance with international standards of human rights and justice. We will closely monitor any future hearings. It is hoped that our efforts can help to ensure a fair trial for those accused as well as contribute to building the confidence necessary for lasting peace with justice for all people of Sudan.</P>

      <P>My Department has a transport inspectorate of nine transport officers who are engaged full time on the detection and prosecution of breaches of the tachograph regulations and other offences under the Road Transport Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport officers conduct regular roadside checkpoints and visit operators' premises to ensure the highest possible level of compliance with the regulations. They also fulfil an educational role in helping drivers and operators to understand their obligations under the regulations and are often invited to visit operators premises to update staff on the requirements of <Col N="579" /> the legislation and to emphasise the need for compliance.</P>
    <P>In an effort to heighten awareness among drivers and employers, transport officers conduct roadside checks at regular intervals. These normal roadside checks have been extended through the introduction of more intensive multi-agency checkpoints in co-operation with the gardaí, Cus<Col N="580" /> toms and Excise, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health. This new enforcement focus is proving to be effective in detecting breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>My Department has responsibility for drivers hours and rest periods. I have no responsibility for working hours and working conditions of bus and coach drivers.</P>

      <P>The North Kerry line ran from Tralee to Ballingrane Junction and was closed to traffic in 1975. As it was no longer required for operational purposes the line was finally abandoned by order made by the board of CIE in 1987.</P>
      <P>I understand that, over the years, the property department of CIE has been in lengthy discussions with Shannon Development, in conjunction with Kerry and Limerick County Councils, with a view to disposing of the line in one lot. However, no satisfactory conclusion to these discussions was reached.</P>
      <P>The board of CIE, at its February 1998 meeting, decided to afford both Shannon Development and the county councils one last opportunity to purchase the line. Kerry County Council are now in discussions with CIE with regard to the Kerry portion of the line and a response is awaited from Limerick County Council with regard to the Limerick portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Great Southern Trail Company, to whom CIE gave permission to develop a small portion of the line at Newcastlewest as a walkway, is interested in developing the line as a recreational trail. However, it would not be for <Col N="581" /> me to support any particular proposal for the disposal of this or any other line.</P>

      <P>The report was submitted in response to my request, last August, to the Chairman of Aer Rianta that the board carry out a review of the full range of development options for the company and reflect on the most appropriate direction for Aer Rianta in the years ahead.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of upgrading the sewage collection and disposal system which serves the Curragh Camp has been under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the Corps of Engineers. Specialist assistance will be required to assess fully the condition of the present system and as regards project options for upgrading. As a first step the Department made contact last year with Kildare County Council regarding a proposal, which had emerged following consultation between the Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to commission a feasibility study to examine at strategic level sewage collection and disposal requirements in the broader Curragh area. The study duly commenced in February 1999. The results of the study will be an essential factor in determining the Department's approach to upgrading the Curragh Camp system and on this basis the Department <Col N="583" /> has agreed to contribute to the consultancy costs. Options for a works project relating to the sewage system at the camp will be examined further in the light of the outcome of the study which is due for completion later this year and financial provision will be made in the Building and Engineering Subhead of the Defence Vote as required.</P>

      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement provides for continued support for early retirement from farming and includes some changes to the existing scheme. Under the new arrangements which cannot apply before 1 January 2000, applications will be acceptable from part-time farmers and the enlargement requirement will be replaced by a provision linked to the improved viability of the holding transferred. The new scheme also provides for possible changes in relation to the level and duration of pension payments.</P>
      <P>Formal adoption of the EU Council regulation including European Parliament approval is expected next month and detailed rules will have to be adopted by the member states on the basis of proposals to be put forward by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The new early retirement scheme to apply in Ireland will form part of the rural development plan which my Department has to submit to the European Commission within six months of adoption of the council regulation. The Commission will approve such a plan within six months of submission.</P>

      <P>The milk quota clawback measure was introduced in October 1996 in order to encourage   non-active quota holders to re-direct their quota away from private land transactions and to offer it instead to the restructuring or temporary leasing schemes. The quota is then available to small scale producers who have first priority status under both schemes.</P>
      <P>Quota becoming available as a result of clawback is added to the national reserve and is allocated to producers, free of charge, on hardship grounds or on a temporary basis on animal disease grounds.</P>
      <P>There are no provisions in place which allow for the return of the quota surrendered under the clawback arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are specific land transactions to which the clawback arrangements do not apply.</P>

      <P>An Bord Bia was established in 1994 with the statutory function to promote, assist and develop in any manner which the board considers necessary or desirable, the marketing of Irish food and livestock. The board's operational budget for 1999 is just under £21 million with £7.061 million provided by way of grant-in-aid and £6.324 million in EU funds.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia carries out appropriate programmes and activities tailored to the requirements of the different product sectors and the relevant marketing objectives. The programmes and activities undertaken by the board are geared to exploit market opportunities and to help suppliers of Irish food to meet the challenges of an ever more demanding and competitive marketplace. Every opportunity is availed of within this framework to promote Ireland as a source of high quality food from a green and clean environment that maximises natural grass based extensive production systems.</P>
      <P>A measure of the success of the board's activities is the fact that exports of food and drink products in 1998 exceeded £5 billion.</P>

      <P>While the person named applied to my Department for a herd number in 1994, she could not be registered as a herdowner because she did not own or lease land at that time. She applied again in 1997 for a herd number and as she had leased land she was allocated a herd number by the District Veterinary Office.</P>
      <P>No applications under the headage schemes were submitted by the person named for the years 1994 to 1997, inclusive. In any event no grant can be paid for these years as the person concerned was not a registered herdowner.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation governing the disposal of animal offal, special provision is made for the disposal of specified risk material (SRM). This is defined as including the skull, brain, eyes, tonsils and spinal cord of cattle over one year old and of sheep and goats in which a permanent incisor tooth has emerged. This material must be removed from the animal at a licensed slaughtering premises or at a knackery and subsequently taken for disposal at a plant designated for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The charges imposed by that plant for the service are a commercial matter and vary depending on the source of the material. In the case of material coming from individual farmers and from knackeries, the plant has agreed to charges which are considerably less than those applying to the slaughtering sector. These lower charges reflect the need to ensure that maximum use is made of the service as a means of disposing safely of SRM from fallen animals and to preventing uncontrolled or unlawful disposal.</P>

      <P>Pending the availability of commonage framework plans arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put an interim national commonage framework plan in place. The interim plan involves a destocking of mountain ewes equivalent to 30 per cent of the quota held in 1998 for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, that is those counties identified as having overgrazed commonages. Commonage framework plans will determine the rate of destocking, if any, on individual commonages and the level of stocking allowed on commonages under the interim plan will be reviewed when the individual commonage framework plans are available.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the REP scheme under which an allowance could be paid to farmers for housing stock in the winter months.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations, farmers holding suckler cow quotas of seven premium rights or more, are required to use at least 90 per cent of that quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named held a suckler cow quota of 25 premium rights in 1997. He applied for the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme in respect of <Col N="599" /> 19 cows, 79 per cent of his quota, and he stood to forfeit the six premium rights he did not use.</P>
    <P>However, on appeal, he was allowed retain the full quota for 1998 on the basis that he would use at least 90 per cent in 1998. He applied for the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme, again on 19 cows, and as this is less than the required 90 per cent, the unused six premium rights have been returned to the national reserve.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for, and was paid on, 24 animals under the ten month special beef premium scheme and five animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme in 1997. All 29 animals paid on were under two years and were, therefore, equivalent to 0.6 livestock units (LU) i.e. 17.4 LUs in total.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> He also applied for, and was paid on, 36 cows under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme and 60 ewes under the 1997 ewe premium scheme. Each ewe is equivalent to 0.15LU (60 x 0.15 = 9LUs). He declared 39.40 hectares on his 1997 area aid application.</P>
    <P>The total livestock units for 1997 of 62.4 divided by the hectares declared of 39.40 give a stocking density of 1.58 LUs per hectare. Under the regulations the stocking density of the holding must be less than 1.4LU/hectare to qualify for extensification premium. Accordingly, as the stocking density of the person named was not less than 1.4 LU/hectare he has no entitlement to extensification premium in 1997.</P>
    <P>The father of the person named leased his lands for ten years with effect from 1 March 1997 and subsequently declared 40.19 hectares on his 1997 area aid application on 12 May 1997. He also submitted applications under the ten month special beef premium scheme for 1997 on 13 February and 28 October 1997 and under the 22 month special beef premium scheme on 13 February, 6 August and 17 October 1997 and an application under the ewe premium and sheep headage schemes.

      <P>Having no suckler cow quota of his own, the person concerned submitted leasing forms to lease 21 premium rights from three farmers. All the leasing forms were received after the final closing date of 31 May 1998 and could not therefore be considered. Under EU regulations, farmers leasing in quota must, except in justified exceptional circumstances, do so on or before the lodgment of the application for the suckler cow premium scheme. As the person named lodged his suckler cow premium application on 29 May 1998, he could not lease in quota after that.</P>

      <P>A pilot scheme for term time working was introduced in Revenue in 1999. Revenue is one of the four Government Departments/offices participating in the pilot term time scheme, which provides for a period of ten or 13 weeks special unpaid leave during the summer months known as term time leave. Applicants for term time leave must (a) be serving in the Department/office in an established or unestablished position in a full-time capacity, and (b) have one or more children aged 17 or younger on 1 June 1999, or (c) be the primary carer of a person for the period of the term time of a person who resides with them and who has a disability of such a nature as to give rise to the need for care on a continuing or frequent basis.</P>
      <P>The operation of the pilot scheme is subject to the operating requirements of participating Departments/offices not being adversely affected. Revenue in considering applications for term time leave was conscious of the need to balance operational requirements, in particular, the need to maintain a high standard of customer service in Wexford, with the wishes of staff to participate in the pilot scheme. Eight applications were received from the Wexford tax district to participate in the pilot scheme. Following careful consideration of the applications and the operational needs of the Wexford tax district, the four most senior applicants were approved for participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is intended to review the operation of the pilot term time scheme in Revenue and the other pilot Department/offices by the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 73 and 76 on 4 March 1999, a review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. The review has not yet been completed.</P>
      <P>However, I should caution against raising expectations that any person who suffers from some form of disability will be admitted to the scheme following the completion of this examination. As was pointed out in the reply to the Adjournment debate held on 2 March 1999, which sought extension to one particular category, very large groups or categories have sought to be included in the scheme. According to lobbyists for the disabled, there are up to 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree. In addition, this figure may not include people suffering from various heart ailments.</P>
      <P>The cost of the scheme in 1998 was approximately £14.4 million. It is clear that the potential cost to the Exchequer of extending the scheme is substantial, especially given that the scheme is not means tested.</P>

      <P>The officer in question retired from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as an estates officer having being transferred from the Department of Agriculture and Food. At the time of his retirement it was intended that the grade of estates officer would be abolished and that an officer retiring from that grade would be linked to the executive officer grade in the civil service for pension increase purposes. The grade of estates officer was not abolished at the time and will continue in existence until the difficulties <i>vis-à-vis </i>serving officers in that grade in the Department of Agriculture and Food are resolved.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the retired officer in question has received all general round pay increases but, as there is no restructuring agreement for serving officers in his grade under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  (PCW), he cannot benefit from PCW restructuring.</P>

      <P>The inheritance tax position regarding two unrelated people who jointly own a house is as follows: If one of the joint owners receives the other owner's share of the house through inheritance, capital acquisitions tax (CAT) will be chargeable on the value of that share received less any qualifying threshold. In the case of two unrelated people, the qualifying threshold is £12,860. Where the beneficiary has received previous inheritances since 2 December 1998, the value of these benefits is added to the value of the current benefit when determining the CAT liability. This process is known as aggregation. The rate of CAT on inheritances is nil up to the appropriate threshold rate, 20 per cent on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance.</P>
      <P>I very much appreciate the concerns which have been raised and I recently undertook in the Dáil that prior to the next budget, I would examine the CAT code in some detail. I want to see if we can come up with a solution that alleviates the tax burden and, at the same time, is fair to all who face similar circumstances in relation to CAT on the domestic residence. However, it must be remembered that any changes in the CAT area are costly and, for this reason, must be looked at in a budgetary context when choices have to be made on which elements of the tax system to address.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group on the taxation of the returns of credit union savings, was presented to me last October. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. It is clear from reading the report that this matter is a complex issue and that there are a number of issues to be considered before any decision can be taken. Not least, there is the EU dimension which must be carefully examined. The corporation tax exemption for credit unions surplus income has been questioned as a State aid in Brussels. While the EU Commission decided not to regard the exemption as a State aid, one consideration, I believe, which influenced its decision is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to be corporation tax exemption could change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax. This EU dimension has only recently come to the fore. I am still considering this matter and as yet have no proposals in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1997, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates; however, in order to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided, as a once-off measure, that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent (or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent).  The Government also announced that, because those restructuring pay deals posed major difficulties in applying parity, they were referring the matter to the commission on public service pensions.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Initially, there were difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines applied to certain groups of pensioners, particularly in the local authority and health board areas. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department along with other Departments made every effort to ensure that public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have met representatives of the National Association of Retired Public Service Employees (formerly the Public Service Pensions Action Group) on a number of occasions, most recently in March 1999. The issues now being pursued by that association and other pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy.  For example, they want personal long service increments paid to certain serving staff on a personal basis under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel.  My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale.  This was one of the key criteria set out in the guidelines issued to Departments.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that &ldquo;Government policy in this area is being entirely set by trade unions&rdquo;. Trade unions do, of course, have legitimate interests in this area, particularly in relation to their serving members.  However, as indicated above, Government policy in relation to PCW restructuring deals has been determined primarily on the basis of adhering as closely as possible to parity as traditionally applied but with certain adjustments to protect the position of those groups of pensioners who would otherwise lose out because of the nature and complexity of the pay deals.</P>

    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): As the Taoiseach mentioned in his reply of 10 February, under the Official Secrets Act, 1963, former Ministers may retain certain official documents. It is not intended to interfere with this practice which has been in place over many years.</P>
    <P>Following from recommendations of the interdepartmental committee on the protection of classified information, a review of the Official Secrets Act will provide the opportunity for taking a fresh look at the matter. There is a need to clarify how the provisions of that Act and other relevant legislation interact.</P>
    <P>In the meantime information technology offers a practical solution. Electronic diaries are now used in most Ministers and Ministers of State offices. These will enable Ministers to take a copy of their diaries when leaving office, while leaving diary details of all their official engagements with their respective departments. To this end, remaining ministers offices which operate a manual system are being encouraged to switch to electronic diaries.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 73 and 76 on 4 March 1999, a review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is being undertaken by an inter-departmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. The review has not yet been completed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out a wide ranging technical review of the operation of the scheme and their report is awaited. However, this review is much narrower in scope in that it addresses problems with the present scheme and makes recommendations on how to make it operate in a more effective and cost &ndash; efficient manner for its present target group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> However, I should caution against raising expectations that any person who suffers from some form of disability will be admitted to the scheme following the completion of these examinations. As was pointed out in the reply to the Adjournment Debate held on 2 March, 1999, which sought extension to one particular category, very large groups or categories have sought to be included in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuit of tax evasion is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I understand from the Commissioners that arrangements are in place to ensure that where an inspector of taxes discovers or becomes aware of a case of tax evasion, he or she will undertake an investigation to determine the extent of the evasion and to quantify the tax, interest and penalties which require to be paid by the taxpayer. Prosecution will also be considered in the case of serious tax evasion under the more active prosecution policy now in place in Revenue.</P>
      <P>If the taxpayer concerned had settled his or her affairs in accordance with the 1988 or 1993 tax amnesty schemes, then there will be no further payments to be made. On the other hand, if the 1993 amnesty scheme was not availed of to settle any outstanding liabilities for pre-April 1991 years the taxpayer will be required to pay arrears of tax, interest and penalties.</P>
      <P>If the taxpayer availed of the 1993 tax amnesty scheme but the confidential declaration made to the chief special collector who operated the scheme did not contain a full and true statement of income and gains underlying outstanding tax, the benefits of the amnesty would not apply and the taxpayer would be liable to pay the full arrears of tax, together with appropriate interest and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, in the case of a taxpayer who availed of the 1993 amnesty scheme, an inspector commences inquiries in relation to a period covered by the amnesty, the taxpayer may produce the certificate given to him or her by the chief special collector. Under the amnesty legislation the inspector will then be precluded from proceeding with the inquiries unless he or she shows to the satisfaction of the appeal commissioners that there are reasonable grounds which indicate that the amnesty declaration made by the taxpayer did not contain a full and true statement of the income and gains underlying outstanding tax. If the appeal commissioners accept the inspector's <Col N="623" /> case the inquiries may proceed. I understand from Revenue that this procedure has been followed by them in a number of cases so as to allow inquiries to proceed.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their policy to inquire into all information received concerning alleged tax evasion, including anonymous information. Such information is initially evaluated for relevance and quality and, where possible, steps are taken to validate it before follow up action is taken. Follow up action would include the initiation of an audit or investigation if the information about alleged tax evasion appeared to be valid.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question seems to link the follow-up by Revenue in relation to information supplied by citizens with revelations about taxation matters at tribunals of inquiry. The Revenue Commissioners advise me that, if this is so, it is not clear what reports or information the Deputy may have in mind and that there has been no failure to act on information received in regard to high profile cases or indeed any cases involved in tribunals. If the Deputy is aware of specific information in this regard he should of course bring it to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The investigation of cases in the office of the chief inspector of taxes, whether initiated on the basis of information received or otherwise, can take, in some cases, a considerable period of time. This can be due to a variety of factors such as the size and complexity of a case, the level of co-operation received from the taxpayer or his advisers, whether application has to be made to the courts for information disclosure orders, whether prosecution has to be considered, the length of time taken up by the appeal process and the time required to enforce collection. The Revenue Commissioners assure me that audits and investigations are completed in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> In limited circumstances the Revenue Commissioners operate a reward scheme for certain information received. Where information is supplied on the basis that a reward is being sought and such information leads directly to the recovery of duty, the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to consider the question of making an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment. They make a small number of such payments every year. I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the current operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Bretton Woods Amendment Act, 1999, which came into effect on 7 April 1999, includes provision for a contribution by Ireland to the joint IMF/World Bank Highly Indebted Poor  Countries Debt Initiative of the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Act authorises me to make the payments authorised by the Government under the debt relief package announced by myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 16 September 1998. The package will amount to £31.5 million over 12 years of which £17 million will be disbursed in 1999. The package consists essentially of the following three elements: Debt relief of £11 million is being provided to the World Bank's HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund; £4 million to the IMF's (ESAF) HIPC Trust; and £7 million is being provided to the IMF to provide interest subsidies under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a review of the HIPC debt initiative which is currently being conducted. In a recent statement by the president and managing director of the international development association (ie, the soft loan arm of the World Bank) on the HIPC initiative it was suggested that there should be tighter links between debt relief and poverty reduction and social policies in the countries affected. It was noted that there was widespread concern &ndash; shared by the executive board of the international development agency &ndash; about ensuring that the resources released through debt relief should contribute to strengthening programs to improve social and economic services for the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 41 HIPCs worldwide that owe some US$170 billion in external debt (1996 dollars). While this amount is but a small fraction of the total debt of developing countries of more than US$2 trillion, the debts of HIPCs are, on average, more than four times their annual export earnings, and well exceed their GNPS. These are <Col N="625" /> about twice the levels considered to be sustainable. Thirty-three African countries are HIPCs, and many of these have debt that is unsustainable.</P>

      <P>A review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. The review has not yet been completed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the technical review of the scheme by the Revenue Commissioners, I should point out that this review is much narrower in scope in that it addresses problems with the present scheme and makes recommendations on how to make it operate in a more effective and cost &ndash; efficient manner for its present target group.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme provides a wide-ranging treatment and curative service for medical card holders. Accordingly, screening services <i>per se, </i>including cervical smear testing, are not currently provided by GPs under the scheme for medical card holders. However, it is important to emphasise that cervical smear testing and all such other measures, as are found to be necessary, in the context of an individual patient's medical examination and clinical needs are available under the GMS scheme.</P>
      <P>The report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee recommended the setting up of a national cervical screening programme for women in the 25 &ndash; 60 age group at five year intervals. In line with that recommendation, the programme is being piloted in the Mid- Western Health Board area to identify and resolve any difficulties which may arise. Work is currently in progress and it is hoped to call women for screening early next year. Cervical screening will be provided free of charge to women involved in the pilot scheme and to all women on the introduction of the national screening programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is concerned about the stigmatisation caused by delivering a mobile health service in disadvantaged areas. The board has health centres in most areas and is committed to the provision of modern and appropriate health centres throughout its area of responsibility. A new health centre was opened in Cherry Orchard last year so that Cherry <Col N="628" /> Orchard/Gallanstown area is adequately catered for.</P>
      <P>The board has concerns about opportunistic screening as against programmes of targeted screening, such as breast screening. My Department is funding a national breast screening campaign which will target at risk age groups. This campaign will be conducted on a mobile basis and cognisance will have to be taken of such matters as suitable and adequate parking, a three phase electricity supply and security.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board does provide a mobile health service to the travelling community. The board had intended to make a second mobile unit available but following discussions with the traveller association it became clear that this was not the preferred way forward. The association has requested strong education programmes to encourage travellers to attend local health centres. In this context the board is committed to promoting a traveller friendly culture in its health centres.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board's focus is on health promotion to increase clients' knowledge of personal health and social gain. This focus is particularly pertinent to disadvantaged areas. The board targets disadvantaged areas and provides additional staff as appropriate. The board provides cervical screening in such areas through the public health nursing service.</P>

      <P>When a new screening service is being launched one of the considerations is the best way to inform the target population.</P>
      <P>A major success factor for the national breast cancer screening programme is the achievement of a high compliance rate in the target population. I am conscious that every effort needs to be made to encourage women to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The national breast screening programme is developing its promotional and advertising strategy with the assistance of the communication officers of the three health board areas to be included in phase I of the programme, i.e. Eastern, Midland and Northern Eastern Health Board areas.</P>
      <P>The promotion of the programme requires that the publicity and education should be directed at:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the women in the target age group;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the public as a whole;</P>
      <P>&ndash;health professionals, women's groups and voluntary organisations which might have an opportunity to inform and influence women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to target these groups using the following mechanisms. Communication with the national and local media by way of the issue of general press statements on the progress, on the implementation of the service, as well as pro<Col N="629" /> vision of interviews and articles on different aspects of breast disorders. Direct communication with women in the target age group. In this context, the issue of the consent and invitation letters is a key promotional opportunity. It is also intended to use every opportunity to distribute relevant information about the programme to the target group so that women can make informed decisions about participation in the programme. Regarding communication with the primary care team, it is acknowledged that the primary care team has a major contribution to make to the promotion of the programme and in this regard, it is planned to provide an information pack to the GPs well in advance of the programme. It is also proposed to notify practices in each target area about the programme in order to improve compliance among the target population and the assistance of the ICGP is being sought on how best to communicate with all practices. Regarding communication with women's groups and voluntary bodies, every effort will be made to work in partnership with women's groups and the voluntary organisations and employers. Regarding communication through other bodies and professionals, it is proposed to work closely with bodies such as my Department's health promotion unit, the national cancer forum and regional directors of cancer, the Irish Cancer Society, the voluntary agencies and health boards in promoting the programmes.</P>
    <P>The launch of the programmes identity &ldquo;BreastCheck&rdquo; on 29 March 1999 was the first step in the implementation of the promotional strategy. It received extensive coverage in the national media and in medical publications. In addition, I circulated the first report of the national breast screening committee with the chairperson's comprehensive statement to all TDs and Senators. I also understand that there has been extensive circulation of the report to professional and voluntary bodies and women's groups. It is the intention of the national breast screening programme to build a strong relationship with all those using the service and to continually draw on new ideas to improve the service.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are currently being made for the piloting of a cervical screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Education, promotion and advertising will be undertaken and directed to women in the target age group, health professionals etc.</P>
    <P>Screening services such as developmental check or school health services are organised by the health boards and notified to parents by health board staff or through schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 letter of determination to the Eastern Health Board included £4.2 million for the contracting of 270 beds in private nursing homes throughout the board's area, the majority of which were for the purpose of alleviating pressure on acute beds in Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, additional funding of £150,000 was made available to the Eastern Health Board to contract a further 65 beds in private nursing homes. The Eastern Health Board has informed me that these additional beds enabled patients to be transferred from acute hospitals in the Dublin area who had been medically assessed as requiring long stay care and who were inappropriately occupying acute hospital beds. These 65 beds have been retained in 1999 at a full year cost of approximately £1 million which is being funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>Arising from the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and pending the provision of more comprehensive services for older people and for persons who receive rehabilitation and long-term care in the acute hospital setting, health boards and voluntary hospitals have been requested to make arrangements for the appropriate post-hospital care of such persons. In particular, the Minister has asked health boards and the voluntary hospitals to consider the following measures:</P>
      <P>(i) the development of a network of private nursing home places, as satellite &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; facilities, around each acute hospital. It is envisaged that acute hospitals would, under the waiting list initiative, make arrangements with such nursing homes, by way of service agreements, to provide appropriate convalescent care to persons discharged from the hospitals. Hospitals would have access to an agreed number of places in the nursing homes and would have control over the persons admitted to these places.</P>
      <P>(ii) Acute hospitals to be supported by district care teams, which would provide out-reach support services to persons discharged, either in step-down facilities or in their own homes. The teams would be comprised of relevant health care professionals, such as physiotherapists; occupational therapists, home helps and general practitioners and would be co-ordinated through the health board community care arrangements.</P>
      <P>(iii) The role of district hospitals in the catchment area of the acute hospital should be maximised.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended to meet the full costs involved.  It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £9 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors viz. the increase in number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency (resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions) and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £33 million. Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on budgetary circumstances and competing priorities at the time.</P>

    <P>State funding for St. Francis Hospice is provided by the Eastern Health Board. In 1998 the Eastern Health Board provided £2,055,156 to St. Francis Hospice for the provision of palliative <Col N="632" /> care services.

    <P>State funding for Our Lady's Hospice is currently provided directly by my Department. In 1998 I provided £7,732,000 to Our Lady's Hospice for the provision of palliative care services. As part of the State's overall control on employment levels, each health agency funded directly by my Department has an employment control ceiling relative to the level of funding provided. Our Lady's Hospice current ceiling is 371.2 WTE posts.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the management of both agencies to provide services within the level of funding and the approved level of employment provided by the Eastern Health Board and my Department.</P>

The figure given in respect of St. Francis Hospice was £2,030,000. However, the Eastern Health Board has since advised me of additional pay costs which were incurred in 1998 but were not included in the original reply. The revised figure in respect of St. Francis Hospice is now £2,055,156.</P>
    <P>There was a typographical error in the reply concerning St. Patrick's Hospital, Cork. The figure given in the reply was £2,488,412. The Southern Health Board has advised me that the actual expenditure was £2,417,187. The total funding provided by health boards as outlined above includes base allocations and additional funding provided in 1998 by my Department, together with grants payable under the National Cancer Strategy (where applicable) and National Lottery grants paid by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Payments made directly by my Department are as follows:</P>

    <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that applications for departmental national lottery grants far exceed resources and it was not possible, therefore, to further assist any hospice during 1998.</P>

      <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families. I am pleased to say that the Government has decided the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which were already higher than the guidelines for younger age groups, have increased by one third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001. A table setting out the medical card guidelines which came into effect from 1 March of this year will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the review of eligibility for medical cards of large families, my Department is still considering this issue in conjunction with health board chief executive officers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330 and 331 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dental health action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service. A consultant-led ser<Col N="635" /> vice ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services.  The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>
    <P>I understand that this group has recently made <Col N="636" /> a report to the chief executive officers of the health boards and this report is currently the subject of discussion and correspondence between the chief executive officers of the health boards and my Department.</P>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons under the Health Acts is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.  Waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are maintained by the health boards. I have had inquiries made of the health boards and the information received from the health boards is set out in tabular form below.</P>

    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in providing additional nursing home accommodation for elderly patients who no longer require acute hospital beds. My Department is currently working with the Eastern Health Board and the major acute voluntary hospitals in Dublin on a number of proposals to meet the needs of certain other categories of patients who require sub-acute care. It is my view that we must make progress in this area to ensure the maximum availability of specialist acute beds at all times and I am actively pursing the recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative on the matter.</P>

      <P>The family referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance in respect of the child in question. This allowance is a monthly allowance paid by the health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and sixteen who are so severely physically disabled or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of services, I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the child in question is attending a special school and has been identified as requiring respite services in the future.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy has also put this question to my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, who has responsibility for various other family support allowances.</P>

      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards scan only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.

      <P>Orthodontic treatment is carried out for elective reasons and is not carried out where the patients have tooth decay or gum disease.</P>
      <P>The two and a half year waiting list period relates to patients who have good dental health and who are awaiting elective orthodontic treatment.  It does not relate to patients having gum swellings and severe pain. Patients who have gum swellings and severe pain are normally seen by the local health board dental clinic immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the new residential, respite and day places which are being provided this year for persons with a mental handicap. Additional revenue funding of £12 million is being provided in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for new services. In addition to the new residential, respite and day services, this funding will also enable the health related support services for children with autism to be enhanced, the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements to be continued and additional specialist and other support services to be provided. This funding is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
      <P>The eight regional health boards were notified of the additional funding for new services in their determination of health expenditure for 1999 which issued from my Department in December, 1998. The details of the precise services to be put place in the health board regions are a matter for the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for the health board regions.</P>
      <P>Many of the new services have already been put in place by the boards and the mental handicap agencies. Other new places will come on stream over the coming months as the necessary preparatory work such as the recruitment of appropriate staff or the refurbishment or the development of new facilities is completed. In the case of some day services, for example those for school leavers, these will come on stream with effect from September.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested that the boards forward details of the new places, including their location, to my Department upon their finalisation and I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>Aids and appliances are provided under the generic community care, acute general hospital and other programmes operated by the health boards. Figures on the amounts allocated to people with disabilities under the various programmes are not readily available within my Department. Arising from a similar question by the Deputy on 23 March last, I am having inquiries made of the health boards in the matter and I will communicate further with her when the information is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office, this Government, has made almost £37 million available by way of additional <Col N="642" /> funding to the physical and sensory disability sector. This includes special allocations, by way of Supplementary Estimate, for the provision of aids and appliances in the sector in 1997 and 1998 totalling £8.325 million. In addition, almost £1 million was provided to the sector for this purpose from the capital programme last year. The amount allocated to each health board from these sources is given in the following table. I have asked the health boards to provide details of the expenditure as soon as possible and I will communicate further with the Deputy in this regard.</P>
    <P>This year, additional funding of £13.4 million has been allocated for the maintenance and development of services in the sector including capital supports. However, it is not possible to say at this stage what amount of this funding will be spent on aids and appliances.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services over a five-year period and estimated the cost at £50 million over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of 1997, the previous Government made available an additional £3.688 million revenue for the maintenance and development of the services. After taking office, this Government provided £10 million by way of additional funding before the end of 1997. This was allocated to agencies in the voluntary sector providing services to people with physical and sensory disabilities for the provision of aids and appliances, to assist capital projects and for the elimination of accumulated funding deficits. In 1998 a total of £13.262 million was provided for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this £5.4 million revenue was allocated for the maintenance and development of the services and a total of £5 million was made available for the provision of aids, appliances and other equipment, In 1999 a total of £13.4 million is being provided for these <Col N="645" /> services, of which £9.4 million (£12.4 million full year cost in the year 2000) is for the maintenance and development of the services. Accordingly, since the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future was published, a total of £40.35 million additional funding has been invested in services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>As set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed. With regard to the provision of health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, this commitment includes the implementation of the recommendations in the report, Towards an Independent Future. The substantial additional funding made available to date by the Government is evidence of this commitment.</P>

      <P>The dangers of smoking and its detrimental effect on human health are well known. Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and coronary heart disease. Smoking is also a major cause of cardiovascular disease, the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland. Stopping smoking is one of the most immediate and worthwhile contributions anyone can make to the improvement of health both on an individual and collective level.  Promoting a smoke free <Col N="646" /> society is a priority for myself and my Department. There has been a significant reduction in the proportion of the adult population smoking over the last 25 years due largely to the various public health initiatives which have been undertaken. However, I am concerned that the reported prevalence of smoking among young people and particularly children remains unacceptably high. I established a policy review group to carry out a fundamental review on smoking and health policy. One of the areas being looked at is the incidence of smoking among teenagers and young children. 1 expect to receive the group's report soon.</P>

The adoption of a directive to this effect by the European Parliament and Council in July 1998 is welcomed.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the cost of treating tobacco related illnesses at primary and secondary level is in excess of the revenue generated from the sale of tobacco; the plans, if any, he has in place to deal with this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of diseases such as lung cancer, emphysema and heart disease which are caused by tobacco consumption. Cot deaths and low birth weights are also associated with tobacco consumption. All of these impose a significant economic cost on the State and particularly the health services and social welfare services. They also impose a significant social cost combined with health costs to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic costs imposed on society by tobacco is comprised of the cost of illness, providing income support, loss of working days and the cost of treating illness, and the cost of ending the tobacco epidemic. On that basis I am of the opinion that the revenue generated by way of taxation of tobacco products is less than the treatment and remedial costs to the economy. On taking office <Col N="647" /> I established a smoke free policy group to carry out a fundamental review of smoking and health policy. The question of litigation against the tobacco industry to recoup the costs incurred for treating persons with tobacco related illnesses is also being considered by the group. When the group reports to me I will make a further statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report entitled, Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People in Ireland : An Exploratory Study, which was recently published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People.</P>
      <P>The study was commissioned by the national council following a request from my Department that it investigate the question of elder abuse in Ireland and advise on how it should be evaluated and responded to.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations to emerge was that a working group should be established to advise on policy, procedures and guidelines on elder abuse in Ireland. In September 1998 my Department requested the national council to arrange for the publication of the report and suggested that an expert group be appointed, under the direction of the council, to prepare guidelines and advise on appropriate procedures for dealing with the matters raised in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time there were a number of vacancies <Col N="649" /> in the membership of the national council and it was without a chairperson. Because of this and the importance of the subject, the council decided to defer further action on the matter until it was back to full strength. The new appointments were made at the end of December 1998 and I understand that at a meeting of the council on 10 February 1999, the establishment of an expert group was discussed. Subsequently the matter was considered by a group of council members at a special meeting and certain proposals to progress matters were put to my Department. My Department has arranged to meet the national council on 6 May and I expect that the functions and membership of the expert group will be agreed at this meeting.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I regard any type of abuse of an older person in a serious light. What I hope will emerge from this exercise is a clear set of definitions, policies, guidelines and procedures which will lessen the possibility of abuse of an older person and where there is a suggestion that it might have occurred, agreed mechanisms for a full investigation and any appropriate responses, where required.</P>

    <P>Further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 218 and 234 of October 1998 there has been an improve<Col N="650" /> ment in the waiting time for assessment in the Cork area with a reduction from three years to 15 months. The waiting time in the Kerry area remains at 12 months. The Southern Health Board has increased the staffing in the adoption department by three social workers in Cork and has transferred a half time post from Cork to Kerry. These appointments are currently being made and it is expected that they will help to reduce the overall waiting times in due course.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned previously in the House, I recently commissioned an independent consultancy to review the inter-country adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring an efficient and standardised assessment procedure which accords with best practice in the field operates across the country while at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services. A draft report was submitted to my Department last month and was examined by the advisory committee established to oversee the consultancy. I hope to be in receipt of the consultant's final report by the end of the month.</P>

      <P>The hospital has submitted to the Department its 1999 Service Plan within budget, a very experienced and competent interim chief executive officer has been installed at the hospital, and satisfactory progress to date has been made in implementing the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</P>
      <P>Progress has also been made in the area of industrial relations and the recruitment process for a new chief executive officer is well advanced. Services at the hospital have continued uninterrupted. In-patient and out-patient activities are running marginally ahead of planned activity levels for the three months to the end of March.</P>
      <P>Much work remains to be done to establish the hospital but I am confident that this will be achieved and the progress to date will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out to the Deputy at the outset that I have no statutory role in relation to the private hospital system. The level of provision of health services at private hospitals is determined by private health care providers in association with the health insurance industry.</P>
      <P>On 30 March, my Department was informed by the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, who are the owners of St. Michael's Private Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, that the hospital is to close in the coming months. The Order indicated that the decision was taken after a lengthy assessment. In particular they referred to the unsustainable financial position of the hospital which has apparently put it at a competitive disadvantage in relation to other similar facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mercy Sisters have indicated that several alternatives have already been considered for the <Col N="654" /> premises and that the disposal of some or all of the property is considered essential. The Eastern Health Board has statutory responsibility for the provision of public health services in the Eastern Region and the board has indicated that it will be contacting the Order to determine any possible interest by the board in the site. When these contacts are completed, I would expect to hear further from the board in relation to any resulting proposals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that St Michael's Public Hospital is also located on the same campus as the private hospital and is unaffected by the closure. The board of management of St. Michael's Public Hospital has prepared a development control plan for the upgrading of facilities throughout the public hospital. As part of this work, I understand that the board of management will be in discussion with the Order in relation to possible future use of the private hospital facilities.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to approve such a pay relativity arrangement as the United Kingdom State Enrolled Nurse, SEN, qualification is not recognised here. I should explain that in this country there is only one level of general nurse, that of Registered General Nurse, RGN, and that this is equivalent to the UK qualification of the same title. This level of general nursing is governed by EU Directives which set down the minimum amount of training required to achieve the RGN qualification or its equivalent throughout the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Deloitte &amp; Touche report was critical of the management processes and controls at Tallaght Hospital. Furthermore, the report went on to state &ldquo;In our view, it is not acceptable for the Board to continue to seek exchequer funding or to continue to maintain that it must be made available to develop the hospital until such time as it has demonstrated a capacity to create an effective man<Col N="655" /> agement system for the present profile of the hospital, and operate at net expenditure levels which are accepted as appropriate for the size, nature and circumstances of the hospital, from its new location in Tallaght&rdquo;  (Reference page 38)</P>
      <P>The services to which the Deputy refers are new services and are part of the planned developments at the hospital. I have set aside £1 million for top priority developments this year. This funding will be provided when the chairman of the group, established to put the hospital on a firm footing, confirms that sufficient progress has been made in the implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche recommendations to allow some resumption of funding for the development of services.</P>

I have provided funding for the organisation of the year and, in advertisements which appeared some weeks ago in the national daily newspapers, details were given of how interested groups could apply for financial support for local, regional and national projects. A calendar of events is available from the National Steering Committee.</P>
      <P>In regard to health services for older people, the Government has provided additional on-going revenue funding of £25 million in 1999 across a range of services. The sum of £9.95 million was allocated for nursing home subventions to meet the increased demand for the service and the additional costs arising from increased dependency levels; £4.5 million for the home help service and £1 million for the support of carers. £800,000 is provided for the recruitment of additional paramedical and nursing staff to be assigned to the home care of older people; £1.45 million has been allocated for the development of new units and £3 million for the further development of specialist assessment units for older people; £3 million has been provided to increase significantly, the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 and over; £300,000 has been allocated to allow four additional physicians in the medicine of older age to be recruited; £500,000 is being allocated to continuing the programme of developing consultant led psychiatry of old age services.

      <P>The main priority in relation to capital investment in the Blood Transfusion Service Board is to ensure regulatory compliance. The Irish Medicines Board, the regulatory authority for the BTSB, required the replacement of the area for processing donations at the Cork centre as a condition of its manufacturing licence which covers the period to 31 October, 1999. The BTSB recently completed the provision of new components processing laboratory at the Cork centre. Funding for this project was made available by my Department as a matter of priority. The BTSB has advised that the new laboratory is now among the best of its kind in Europe, and that, at a recent inspection by the IMB, the level of compliance was in accordance with the EC Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice. The total level of capital funding made available was £524,000 which also ensured the provision of a new compatibility testing laboratory, new product storage area, an upgrade of the donor clinic, and new office accommodation. Additional capital requirements specified recently by the IMB are currently being assessed by the BTSB and it not expected that necessary capital investment required will be significant.</P>
      <P>I advised the Deputy in reply to a parliamentary question of 20 April 1999 that further capital investment in the centre will be dictated by the requirements of the IMB and any additional resources necessary for this purpose will be made available. Funding necessary for this purpose will be made available in 1999. Furthermore, proposals submitted by the board of the BTSB for capital investment which are over and above those necessary to ensure regulatory compliance will also be considered by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The internal quality assurance practices in Sligo General Hospital include primary screening of all smears; rapid rescreening of all smears; any abnormal smears from borderline up reviewed by a consultant pathologist; all smears from women who have had a previous abnormal smear or those who are clinically indicated are re-checked by the consultant pathologist; review by consultant pathologist of all previous tests for any patient presenting with an abnormal smear.</P>
      <P>The errors in the relevant reports were identified as a result of these quality control measures which are currently in place in Sligo General laboratory. The errors in the screening process occurred outside the region.</P>
      <P>The main priority for the North-Western Health Board has been the health and welfare of the women directly affected by the situation. The board regrets the trauma caused for the women and their families who have been affected by the errors made by the external laboratory and has apologised unreservedly. The health board considered that in the first instance, the most appropriate means of contacting these women was through their general practitioners. An information pack was prepared, but only as an adjunct to the general practitioners' approach.  It was arranged with general practitioners that women who needed a repeat smear would be offered this as soon as possible. A taxi service was contracted to transport the slides directly to the laboratory. A fast track service within the laboratory will ensure that results are available within the week.</P>
      <P>For those women who need further investigation by colposcopy, the board considered it important that they should have a choice as to where and when this would be carried out. Three clinics have been organised, one in Sligo and two in Derry, and additionally some appointments were arranged in Dublin where this was more convenient.</P>
      <P>Telephone support lines were established, staffed by trained nursing and medical staff. Over 90 calls were received during the four days that they were in operation. Some women required and received follow-up phone calls from the support staff. Further counselling will be made available for women whose general practitioners request it. In partnership with their general practitioners, the board will continue to provide ongoing care and support to all the women into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I want to acknowledge the tremendous support given by general practitioners, area medical officers and other board staff to ensure that the women directly involved received the best possible service. I also wish to acknowledge the support received from Altnagelvin Hospital and consultants at Holles Street hospital. The health board assured me that it will take any and all further steps to support and help those affected in any way.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the health board's report, of the results of the rescreening of the 2,115 smears previously read by a private laboratory, I immediately took steps to identify the extent to which the laboratory was used for cervical cytology. It has been established that no other health board used the laboratory. In the North-Eastern Health Board a voluntary hospital &ndash; now in the ownership of the health board &ndash; and Beaumont Hospital between them sent some 350 smears to the private laboratory. These smears are in the process of being rechecked and this will be completed this week. I have also instructed the hospitals where the people involved were or are employed to review the smears processed and to take any necessary follow up action.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the introduction of a national cervical screening programme. I am equally determined to ensure that it will be properly managed, resourced, computerised and that comprehensive quality control is an integral part of the programme at every level. For these reasons the programme is being piloted in the Mid-Western region to identify and resolve any difficulties which might arise. I have instructed senior officials from the Department to meet with the project directors to ensure that the pilot commences screening as early as possible in January 2000. All laboratories have been asked to implement the recommendations of the report of the Department of Health and Children's cervical screening committee which placed a heavy emphasis on quality assurance.</P>
    <P>I met last week the chairman of the Expert Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening whose terms of reference include advising the Department of Health and Children on quality assurance. A sub-group of that committee has made much progress on the development of quality assurance guidelines on all aspects of the programme. I have requested that the sub-group meet this week and conclude their work. These guidelines will ensure that quality assurance can be comprehensively addressed. I am determined that they will be implemented and strictly enforced in our cervical cytology laboratories. I am equally determined that a national programme cannot be introduced until the system is geared up to deal with it.</P>
    <P>However, as with all screening tests there is a chance that some abnormalities may not be detected. That is one of the reasons why regular cervical smear tests are recommended at minimum intervals of five years. It is also important <Col N="660" /> that laboratories and smear takers do not encourage the taking of smears more frequently than is necessary. To do otherwise contributes to backlogs, which in turn causes anxiety for women and may compromise quality assurance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I fully sympathise with the women who have had to have their smears retaken and I want to assure them that any further requirements by way of services or counselling will be made available to them.</P>

These regulatory improvements, as recommended by the forum, include issues related to hackneys such as external identification, the use of two-way radios and telephonic equipment and the carrying of a log of agreed fares. The forum has, however, recommended against the merging of the separate service roles of taxis and hackneys and, in that context, against permitting use of bus lanes by hackneys.</P>

I have allocated over £237 million for non-national roads in 1999, an increase of more than £37 million or nearly 19 per cent on the original 1998 allocation figure of almost £200 million and £62 million or 35 per cent on the 1997 outturn. This figure included discretionary grants to county councils of approximately £23 million, the discretionary maintenance element of which, £12.805 million, is an increase of almost 32 per cent on the 1998 discretionary maintenance grant provision of £9.7 million. This figure also included £138 million for the restoration programme, an increase of over £20 million on last year's restoration programme allocation.</P>

      <P>The operational programme for environmental services provides for the investment of £92.459 million of which £57.155 million is being provided by the European Regional Development Fund, over the period 1994-99, in water and waste services, coastal protection works and environmental monitoring, research and development. Its main investment objectives are to strengthen the long-term infrastructural base of the economy, protect natural resources which are a basis for economic growth, meet identified servicing needs and develop greater environmental R&amp;D capacity.</P>
      <P>The EU funding is available to the end of the operational programme &ndash; payments may be made to the end of the year 2000. Almost all the available money has been allocated and while some underspend, up to 1998 has been reported on specific measures within the programme, I anticipate that all available funding will be fully expended by programme end.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for the Graiguenamanagh sewerage scheme have been received in my Department <Col N="664" /> but have not been approved. As the scheme is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme, it comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority list will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-2006. In the meanwhile, the scheme will be considered, along with all other competing proposals, under the rural towns and villages initiate, details of which will be announced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There is no specific proposal from any member state for a European wide moratorium on the commercial release of genetically modified organisms. Such a proposal would have wider application than to the particular areas of genetic engineering covered by Council Directive 90/220/EEC, for which I am responsible at national level.

      <P>I can confirm that representations have been made by the Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation in relation to the recent fee increases for dog licences.</P>
      <P>The increase in licence fees arises from a specific provision of the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act, 1992, and came into force automatically on commencement of the Act. I do not propose any change to this position.</P>
      <P>The fee increase will provide additional revenue for local authorities to enable them to put in place more effective dog control arrangements. Dog control problems related to greyhounds can be a significant part of the work of dog wardens, and it is reasonable to expect greyhound owners to contribute, through the licence fee, to the cost of the dog control service.</P>
      <P>It is open to greyhound owners-breeders to purchase a general dog licence for an unspecified number of dogs and there are also special arrangements made in relation to greyhounds purchased for export and exported from the State within 30 days of the date of purchase.</P>

      <P>The couple concerned were both claiming unemployment assistance payments in their own right and had been receiving payment at the rate of £55.90 each per week, the maximum rate payable in their circumstances.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 412 and 413 together.</P>
      <P>The legal basis for the social services card is provided in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as amended by the Social Welfare Act, 1998, Part IV, section 14 of the 1998 Act refers.</P>
      <P>At present, the social services card is issued to all persons who hold a personal public service number, PPSN.</P>
      <P>There is no legal obligation on a person to carry the social services card. However, the legislation obliges a person to produce the card at the request of the Department or other specified body for the purposes of a transaction.</P>
      <P>The card is an important requirement in establishing the identity of persons receiving certain payments from my Department. The customer is paid on production of a valid social services card or a temporary signing card.</P>
      <P>While persons signing for credits at a social welfare local office are not normally required to produce a social services card, they can be asked to do so.</P>
      <P>The social services card is fundamental to the efficient payment of benefits and the delivery of good service to the customer. It is important to have a secure system in place regarding the replacement of social services cards which in such cases are used to collect payment. This also protects the customer as it prevents misuse or misappropriation of the card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person loses his or her social services card, a form is given to him or her for completion. This <Col N="674" /> form includes a portion to be completed at the customer's local Garda station in which a Garda certifies that the person has reported the loss of the card to that Garda station. The Garda station stamp is affixed to the form. There is no legal obligation, however, on a person who loses his or her social services card to seek Garda confirmation of his or her identity.</P>
    <P>Establishing the identity and the address of social welfare customers is a vital part of the control function in local offices. Where evidence of identification is required it normally takes the form of a long form birth certificate or passport together with another document such as a driver's licence, rent book etc. Proof of identity must be supplied in all cases of new or repeat claims for payment at local offices of the Department.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant legislation, where a couple are living together, the means attributable to each are taken to be one-half of the total means of the couple. In the circumstances while the British retirement pension of £13.93 a week in payment to the person concerned is lower than that of her husband, this does not entitle her to a higher rate of old age pension than him. The equalised old age pensions payable to each of the couple correctly reflect their aggregate means situation and their individual legal entitlements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415 and 416 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned initially contacted my Department in 1995 regarding a number of occu<Col N="675" /> pational pension issues, which centre on the position of occupational pension scheme members who left those schemes early, have a deferred benefit and for whom there is no revaluation of this benefit.</P>
    <P>The issue of revaluation of deferred benefits prior to 1991, when the Pensions Act, 1990 came into effect, was fully considered by the Pensions Board in the context of the board's report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative &ndash;&ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;&ndash; which was published last year. A copy of this report was circulated to each Deputy. The person concerned also received a copy.</P>
    <P>While the Pensions Board does not recommend a statutory requirement to revalue all pre-1991 rights, it does urge employers to consider the revaluation of such benefits, where people remain within the scheme, on a voluntary basis. Bearing in mind the voluntary nature of occupational pension provision and the Pensions Board's conclusion on the matter, I do not consider that there is anything further I can do in this case. It would not be appropriate to introduce legislation to address this issue.</P>
    <P>I should point out that since these queries were initially raised, my Department and the Pensions Board have engaged in extensive correspondence with the person concerned to explain the position. Officials from my Department and the Pensions Board have also met him on three occasions, the most recent in August last year, when the issues were again comprehensively discussed, and the position clarified for him. The letters from the person concerned to which the Deputy refers in the questions merely repeat the points which have been the subject of exhaustive discussion and correspondence.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the issues have received due consideration and that my Department and the Pensions Board have dealt with the person concerned as comprehensively and effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, an exception to this rule is made in the case of widows, widowers and other lone parents who are sick or unemployed. Where a person who is in receipt of a Widow(er)'s Pension or <Col N="676" /> One-Parent Family Payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may be entitled to receive Disability Benefit or Unemployment Benefit at half-rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their pension. Furthermore, if they are entitled to a Widow(er)'s Pension at a reduced rate (e.g. on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on account of means), the rate of that pension is also increased up the maximum level for the duration of their claim for Disability Benefit or Unemployment Benefit.</P>
    <P>These provisions, which are designed to take account of the special circumstances of widowed people and lone parents, discriminate positively in their favour. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the current arrangements for payment of Disability Benefit in addition to Widow(er)'s Pension and One-Parent Family Payment are reasonable and I have no plans to make any changes in this area.</P>

      <Quest>if he has been approached in relation to a submission by the ESB Meter Readers' Association with a view to having the PRSI rate for contract meter readers changed from class S to class A; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Contract meter readers engaged by the ESB have been considered to be self employed persons for social insurance purposes for over 30 years. The insurability of such workers has been examined on various occasions in the intervening years and successive decisions by deciding officers of my Department and, where appropriate, the social welfare appeals office have maintained this position. Accordingly, contract meter readers pay PRSI as self employed persons &ndash; PRSI Class S. However, the relevant meter readers are treated as employees subject to PAYE (Schedule E) for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>A submission was received from the ESB Meter Readers' Association last February seeking the reclassification, for social insurance purposes, of contract meter readers from PRSI Class S to PRSI Class A, the PRSI class applicable to employees. I met, at their request, with a delegation from the ESB Meter Readers' Association and the Amalgamated Transport and General Worker's Union &ndash; AT&amp;GWU &ndash; on 3 March last to discuss the matter. Members of the Association are members of the AT&amp;GWU. At that meeting, the association-union indicated that they wished to retain their current status as self employed contributors (PRSI Class S) but wished to be treated for income tax purposes as self employed &ndash; Schedule D &ndash; taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advised the association-union that the income tax status of meter readers was a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and should be taken up <Col N="677" /> with that body. The association was also advised that if it wished to have the social insurance position of meter readers re-examined it could submit a number of test cases to scope section in my Department for formal decisions on the matter.</P>
    <P>I understand that the association/union is now preparing test cases for submission to both the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. When these cases are received by my Department, they will be examined by a deciding officer and a formal decision on the insurability of the employment or self employment will issue. In the event of dissatisfaction with any decision there is also a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance from later this month. It is also available to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
      <P>A person aged 75 years or over, who is unfit to travel alone, also qualifies for a companion free travel pass.</P>
      <P>It is considered that it would be difficult to monitor the proper usage of the companion pass if those travelling on these passes were able to travel independently of the qualifying person.</P>
      <P>The free schemes generally were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, has commenced to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner. The Deputy's proposal will be examined further in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review is being undertaken by the policy institute in TCD in association with the Department and it is expected that it will be completed <Col N="678" /> and published by the institute in October-November 1999. The conclusions of the review will then be considered in a budgetary context, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>There are a number of specific schemes of assistance which are designed to meet accommodation costs, such as nursing home charges. For instance, a nursing home subvention is available from the health boards towards meeting the costs of nursing home care. In addition, most nursing homes are approved by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of obtaining tax relief on fees paid. In the circumstances, it is not considered necessary to provide additional assistance towards nursing home charges by way of disregarding those charges under the means-tested old age non-contributory pension scheme.</P>
      <P>However, if, as a consequence of the operation of the provisions of the nursing home subvention scheme, the spouse of the person who goes into nursing home care is left with no income or insufficient income to meet their day-to-day living expenses, then this would be a matter which should more properly be addressed, in the first instance, by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy knows of any particular case where the provisions of the nursing home subvention scheme are operating in such a way, perhaps he could forward details to me I will have the matter fully examined.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 10 September 1998. Following an examination of his entitlement his means were assessed at £199 per week derived from benefit from his spouse's earnings and from farm income. On the basis of this means assessment he was not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance and a deciding officer made a decision to that effect.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed that decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. The case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that the assessment was fair and reasonable. All allowable expenses in respect of benefit from his spouse's earnings and from the farming operation had been allowed in the means assessment. The person's appeal was disallowed and he was notified accordingly. The person concerned has now made a supplementary claim for assistance and that claim is being examined by my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" />&ndash;to co-ordinate family policy;</P>
    <P>&ndash;to pursue the findings in the final report of the Commission on the family following their consideration by the Government;</P>
    <P>&ndash;to undertake research, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;to promote awareness about family issues.</P>
    <P>The unit has responsibility for support for the marriage and child counselling services and the family mediation service as well as a number of other family services including a pilot programme to improve services to families from local offices of my Department through the one-stop-shop model and the introduction of an information programme on parenting issues in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The family affairs unit in pursuing its function to co-ordinate family policy and to pursue the findings in the report of the Commission on the Family works closely with other Government Departments and agencies which share responsibility for the Governments programme in relation to policy development for families and children.</P>
    <P>The family affairs unit was established in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in line with the Government's pro-family approach to the development of policy and services as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, and in response to the recommendations of the Commission on the Family.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to protecting the family through political, economic, social and other measures which will support the stability of the family. The specific responsibilities of the family affairs unit in this context include the administration of the £2.1 million grant aid programme to support the provision of marriage, child and bereavement counselling, the nation-wide extension of the family mediation service which is now available from eight centres throughout the country as well as the development of support projects to do with parenting and improved information services for families. The unit further contributes to the development of family policy through highlighting awareness about family issues and the findings of the Commission on the Family and undertaking research. A series of family services information fora for voluntary and community groups who work with families is under way throughout the country in line with the unit's functions in this area. A families research programme to encourage high quality research about families to underpin the future development of policies and services was launched last month. The promotion of one form of family arrangement over another does not arise in any of these contexts.</P>
    <P>The overriding responsibility of my Department relates to the provision of income support payments in an equitable manner to individuals and families who depend on these services.</P>
    <P>In the wider context of the treatment of different types of households under the income support system, the report of the working group which <Col N="683" /> was established to examine the tax and social welfare treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households will be highly relevant to future income support policy development. The group's terms of reference include identifying and costing ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of all household types. I expect to receive the report of the working group in the Summer.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is an educational opportunities scheme for unemployed people who wish to pursue approved second or third level courses of education. Participants receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit. The scheme also provides for the retention of secondary benefits such as rent or mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of participants are students who were in receipt of the maximum rate of an unemployment payment immediately prior to qualifying for a back to education allowance. These students continue to receive their rent/mortgage supplement at the same level as previously.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy concerns a participant who was in receipt of a reduced rate of unemployment assistance because he was assessed with means from another source. When he qualified for a back to education allowance, he was entitled to a higher basic weekly payment, equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit. When taken together with his other means, his income exceeded the threshold for payment of mortgage interest relief and the supplement had to be discontinued.</P>
      <P>However, allowing for the increase in his basic payment, he received a net increase of £12.70 in weekly income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently announced the publication of a report entitled &ldquo;The Disincentive Effects of Secondary Benefits&rdquo;, following on a study by Goodbody Economic Consultants on this issue. I have now commenced a process of consultation with the social partners on the question of alleviating any remaining poverty traps associated with various schemes including the back to education allowance. Following completion of this process I <Col N="684" /> will be bringing forward proposals to address any anomalies in the present arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to maternity benefit is that the woman's employer must certify that she is entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994. Accordingly, entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent on the woman's entitlement to maternity leave.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, a pregnant worker is entitled to 14 weeks maternity leave from her employer, at least four of which must be taken immediately before the baby is due and four weeks immediately after the baby is born. The balance of six weeks can be taken at the woman's discretion. However, this 14 week maternity leave period can be extended, in certain limited circumstances, for up to a further four weeks where the baby is born late. This is to ensure that the woman is always entitled to at least four weeks maternity leave in the period immediately after the baby is born.</P>
      <P>As the duration of payment of maternity benefit is generally linked to this maternity leave period, maternity benefit is not, therefore, paid during periods for which a woman is not entitled to maternity leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, in the case raised by the Deputy, where the baby is born prematurely, the maternity benefit claim is put into payment with effect from the date of birth of the child. <Col N="686" /> Although she had not taken the normal four weeks leave before the birth of her child, the woman still qualifies for the payment of maternity benefit for the full 14 weeks duration. However, there is no facility under current legislation within which the period of maternity leave and consequently the period of maternity benefit can be extended on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the 1994 Maternity Protection Act provides women with the option of taking up to four weeks unpaid &ldquo;additional maternity leave&rdquo; following the exhaustion of their ordinary maternity leave entitlement. Furthermore, under the terms of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, the woman in question could avail of part or all of her 14 weeks parental leave entitlement following exhaustion of her maternity leave entitlement, subject to prior approval from her employer. The child's father is also separately entitled to 14 weeks parental leave.</P>
    <P>I am already aware of the problems relating to entitlement to maternity benefit in cases such as that raised by the Deputy and, indeed, in other similar cases where, for instance, a baby is born with a serious illness. However, as these matters also concern the woman's entitlement to maternity leave in the first instance, I have brought them to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for consideration in the context of the review which he is carrying out arising from the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium for the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation.</P>
    <P>I should point out that any proposals to extend the duration of entitlement to maternity benefit would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide income support during the summer holiday period for less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and who are unable to obtain summer work.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> This year, sponsors are being limited to a maximum of ten students each in order to ensure a more even spread of students among all sponsors. Last year, over 1,000 sponsors (mainly community-based organisations) failed to get any students for their projects. Over the past five years, it has been the larger statutory bodies (such as county councils and health boards) who have accounted for the largest number of students to the detriment of the smaller community-based organisations who were unable to attract any students or insufficient numbers of students to their projects. Our experience suggests that, in any event, the vast majority of the smaller organisations require less than ten students.</P>

However, she has exhausted her entitlement to unemployment benefit and that payment ceased with effect from the 2 April.</P>
      <P>The one-parent family payment was introduced in January 1997 and is designed as an income support mechanism to take into account the special needs and requirements of persons parenting alone. A particular feature of the scheme is the means test which allows a lone parent earn up to £115.38 per week and still receive a full payment. The means test which applies to one-parent family payment is very favourable and, in the circumstances, it would be difficult to justify further improvements which would be specifically aimed at lone parents.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have announced a compensation package for the cessation of turf cutting in proposed special areas of conservation. The various options I have put forward under this package may be availed of as and from the beginning of the current turfcutting season.</P>
      <P>In most areas of the country where such is required, alternative sites (or swop sites) have been acquired by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. In many areas these sites are currently being used by turfcutters who have decided to avail of that particular option under the compensation package. Any person who wishes to avail of this option and who has not already done so, should contact the local staff of Dúchas without delay.</P>

      <P>RTE informs me that it is aware that the quality of reception of RTE 1, Network 2 and Teilifís na Gaeilge in the areas in question is inadequate. RTE reports that it planned to install a transmitter at Dooncartin during 1997, but was unable to do so. RTE states that it has since purchased a new site and are awaiting planning permission from Mayo County Council. Subject to the planning permission being granted, and site development, the installation of the transmitter should be completed before the end of 1999. The transmitter will provide good quality reception of the three channels referred to viewers in the north Mayo area.</P>

These include a lecture, film show, tea and refreshments in Tara, County Meath in July, a special tour for the elderly at Mellifont Abbey, County Louth in August, a week in October for events and activities for the elderly in Glenveagh National Park, County Donegal and, similarly, a week in November in Kilkenny Castle.

    <P>The organisation of events by other bodies under the aegis of my Department to mark the UN Year of the Elderly is a matter for those bodies. However, I am aware that the Irish Museum of Modern Art is currently staging an exhibition of artworks created by older people since the Museum opened in 1991. The exhibition under the title &ldquo;..And Start to Wear Purple&rdquo; presents artworks from projects organised by the Inchicore Active Retirement Group in conjunction with IMMA and the National Age and Opportunity Agency over the past eight years.</P>
    <P>IMMA is also developing a proposal for a group of older people who have worked previously with the museum to select and curate an exhibition of artworks from the museum's collection for the coming Autumn period. Workshops and discussions are currently under way during which older people have direct contact with the artists whose works are in the collection. A research project on lifelong learning is also under way, organised in association with the IMMA, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and the City of Stockholm Museum. The National Gallery of Ireland has devised a programme of events in May to mark the UN designation which will be entitled &ldquo;Art Never Ages&rdquo;.</P>

My Department did approve a special grant of £25,851 in August 1998 to assist with the preliminary costs of the project. The Deputy will be happy to hear that I recently appointed a firm of consultants to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the case compiled by Comhar Bigil Teo. for the provision of a cable-car link between Inis Bigil and the mainland. This appraisal will include an evaluation of the methodology and findings of the case made as well as other considerations such as the optimum size of a cable-car, maintenance, general efficiency, current costs, capital costs, level of income likely to be generated and the effective administrative structure for the operation of the proposed cable-car system.</P>

I understand that young people living in the area attract people of their own age to the estate and the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1990, are being used to prevent large numbers of youths gathering in the estate. I am also informed that the estate has a very active neighbourhood watch scheme, which works closely with the Garda. The area is being patrolled by a community garda assigned to the area, and mobile units, both plain clothes and uniform, are also paying regular attention to the estate. I am assured by the Garda <Col N="699" /> authorities that the area will continue to receive the appropriate garda attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 477 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who have advised that the Castletroy area is situated in the Limerick City North Division. The policing of it is divided between the sub-district of Henry Street and Castleconnell. Henry Street Garda station is open to the public on a 24 hour basis.</P>
      <P>The University of Limerick caters for approximately 10,000 students. During peak periods such as rag week, pre-Christmas and post exams a number of extra gardaí are deployed on foot patrol to deal with any public order related offences. There are two community gardaí assigned to the Castletroy area. They operate Campus Watch with the student and university authorities. There is a temporary office, Garda clinic, on campus one day a week to cater for student requirements and also to liaise with student union representatives and college authorities in addressing complaints from residents and other interested parties. The Garda authorities have informed me that the situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of the Limerick division will be considered in conjunction with all other divisions throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that due consideration has been given to the possible development of a Garda station at Castletroy. Research carried out recently indicates that crime in the district is down 19 per cent between 1991 and 1998 and while the population increased by 3.5 per cent between 1991 and 1996, unemployment is down 18.8 per cent over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that based on current crime, population and other figures and having regard to current policing arrangements operating in the area, there is no <Col N="700" /> justification at present for the establishment of a new sub-district at Castletroy.</P>

      <P>With regard to the possibility of introducing a year round operation freeflow campaign, I am further informed by the Garda authorities that such a course of action would not be possible due to the non-availability of the large number of probationer gardaí who were allocated to the Dublin area specifically for the duration of the last campaign.</P>
      <P>However, Operation Clearway II commenced on the 25 January 1999 and will continue until 6 December 1999 when Operation Freeflow will recommence. The 22 main traffic arteries which were identified as areas needing targeted Garda attention under the &lsquo;Freeflow' campaigns are now patrolled by Garda motorcyclists in a &lsquo;looped' system comprising 14 routes. Each day during peak periods morning and evening 40 motor cyclists are deployed on these routes. In addition, approximately 35 garda on foot patrol are employed on &lsquo;Clearway' duties.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I allocated a grant of £80,000 to Muintir na Tire in December 1998 to partly fund the cost of employing the development officers who organise the running of the community alert programme nationwide. The House may be interested to know that Muintir na Tire also received a grant of £65,000 in June 1997.</P>
      <P>Neighbourhood Watch does not receive any funding directly from the Department but it receives considerable support from the Garda Síochána. As such, the Garda have met many of the costs associated with operating the scheme such as the costs of funding for publicity material. In June 1997, 50,000 Neighbourhood Watch booklets were produced at a total cost of almost £7,000 of which AMEV Insurance sponsored half. In July 1998, 500,000 Neighbourhood Watch stickers were produced at a cost of approximately £13,500. The majority of the costs associated with the programme are opportunity costs, such as the Garda time devoted to the project and it is not possible to quantify this.</P>

    <P>I have already indicated to the House that a scheme of an intoxicating liquor bill has been prepared in my Department to take account of the June 1998 report on liquor licensing laws by the Sub-Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights and the September 1998 interim report of the Competition Authority. The proposals in the scheme are also a response to the many submissions which have been received from groups and individuals, in response to the invitation, by way of advertisements placed by my Department in the national and local press in <Col N="703" /> August 1998, for comments on our licensing laws. These include written submissions from the nightclub sector. I have also had the benefit of extensive consultations and meetings with representative groups, including representatives of the nightclub sector.</P>

      <P>The Government has committed itself, under the Good Friday Agreement, to put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoners, including repatriated prisoners, who qualify for such a programme under the terms of the Agreement. Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from these arrangements. Part of the mechanism in place under the Agreement is the procedure laid down in the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998 and all proposed releases under the Agreement must go through that procedure.</P>
      <P>Twenty four prisoners have been released to date under the terms of the Agreement. Thirteen of these had been repatriated from Britain. There are currently a further 14 repatriated PIRA prisoners in custody in Portlaoise Prison. I can inform the Deputy that the Government is aware of and fully committed to filfilling its obligations under the Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 481 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, many of the policies proposed in the position paper, published by my party in March 1997 entitled A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drug Related Crime have been incorporated with those of our partners in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium. The policy of this Government for tackling the drugs problem is based upon strong legislation backed up by tough law enforcement and a multi-agency approach to the issue of demand reduction.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am committed to a zero tolerance approach towards those who benefit most from the insidious drugs trade. In that regard, the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which goes to Report Stage on Wednesday, 21 April 1999, proposes a mandatory minimum ten year sentence for persons convicted of dealing or trafficking in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more, and for automatic asset inquiry at sentence stage. This Bill also contains a provision to abolish preliminary examinations in relation to all indictable offences in order to allow trials take place more quickly and it is expected that the Bill will be enacted shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the Garda Síochána has sufficient resources to enable the Garda to tackle the supply of drugs and to deprive the criminal elements involved in this trade of their ill gotten gains. In 1998, the Garda seized illicit drugs with a notional street value in excess of £90 million. During the same period Operations Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet yielded cumulative seizures of heroin and other controlled substances with a notional street value in excess of £5.6 million and resulted in the arrest of over 10,5000 persons for drug offences.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to be successful in targeting assets derived from criminal activity and provisional figures for 1998 indicated that six interim orders, under section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, to the value of £1.6 million and five interlocutory orders, under section 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 to the value of £1 million were obtained by the bureau in that year. The bureau also made demands for the payment of income tax with interest on persons suspected of criminal activity to the value of £10.8 million and assessed social welfare overpayments of £0.221 million. Savings to the Exchequer in respect of terminated social welfare payments amounted to £0.206 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochana operates a confidential 24-hour free phone service to the public, which allows any member of the public to contact the Garda in confidence relating to any matter, <Col N="706" /> including suspected incidents of drug dealing. In addition, the Crime Stoppers free phone was set up in January 1998 and up to March 1999, 48 per cent of calls received on this line were drug related resulting in the seizure of drugs with a notional street value in excess of £42,000.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware that the drugs problems cannot be tackled successfully by supply side measures alone and as I have already stated a central plank of the Government's policy is a commitment to a multi-agency approach to the issue of demand reduction.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am a member of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, which gives political leadership to the national drugs strategy, which has been established to deal with drug misuse at a national and local level. The national drugs strategy operational team implements the Government's strategy on drugs and maintains a close liaison with the 13 local drugs task forces, which have developed action plans to tackle the drugs problem in local communities. The range of measures which have been brought forward by the local drugs task forces represent a balanced approach to the problems posed by drugs and drug addiction. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government is committed to keeping the local drugs task forces in place for, at lease, a further two years.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives, under the national drugs strategy, are the young people facilities and services fund, which is being promoted by my colleague, the Minister for State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, targeted at young people &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of falling into the cycle of crime and drugs, and the integrated services process, which has been launched in four areas, on a pilot basis, to provide an integrated delivery of services to these disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences is a key feature of the Government's programme to combat the drugs problem. Following Government approval, a drug courts planning committee has been set up and part of its remit is to prepare plans for the establishment of a drug courts pilot project in the District Court in 1999.</P>
    <P>The development of a drug courts system on a pilot basis marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system. In effect, drug courts will afford persons in trouble with the law on foot of having committed minor or non-violent drug related offences an opportunity to be treated under court supervision as an alternative to the more usual penal sanctions which can be imposed. I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course and am optimistic that this initiative is likely to have a significant impact in reducing criminal activity for drug related crimes.</P>
    <P>From what I have outlined, I am sure the Deputy will agree that significant progress has <Col N="707" /> been made on the issue of drugs and drug related crime and I would like to assure the Deputy that I see the drugs problem as a major priority and will continue to treat it as such.</P>

      <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme is a two year programme which contains three funding initiatives &ndash; the capital infrastructure, the community support and the employers' demonstration initiatives &ndash; each of which has a separate budget with distinct criteria and targets. All three initiatives are interdependent and strive towards the common aim of improving the quality and quantity of child care provision in Ireland from an equal opportunities/disadvantaged perspective. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme is administered by Area Development Management Limited (ADM) on behalf of my Department. ADM is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area <Col N="708" /> partnership companies established by the Government.</P>
      <P>Applications were invited in relation to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme in the national newspapers and the closing date for receipt of applications for funding under this two year programme was May-June 1998. All funding is being allocated on the basis of applications received in advance of the May-June 1998 deadline. The bulk of this funding was allocated in July of last year and a further £450,000 is now being allocated to applicants who met the qualifying criteria under the capital infrastructure strand.</P>
      <P>The Busy Bees Community Playgroup in Sligo is one of the 16 organisations to which funding is now being provided. A sum of £45,000 is being provided to this group towards capital infrastructure expenditure. I understand Area Development Management Ltd. have recently informed the group of this funding and will make the necessary arrangements in relation to the drawdown of this funding.</P>

      <P>The position is that there have been arrangements in place since 1994 whereby the Garda Síochána carry out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advices received in the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> My Department, together with the Garda authorities, have been in discussions for some time with FÁS, the aim of which is to extend to employees having substantial contact with children in non-residential community employment schemes, the same arrangements as apply to prospective employees in the health care area. The issues involved, while clearly of considerable importance as they relate to the security and safety of children, are quite complex as it is also essential to safeguard the privacy. and other rights of individuals. However, a meeting between the secretary general of my Department, the Garda commissioner and the director-general of FÁS will take place this week with a view to resolving outstanding difficulties. This would allow arrangements to be put in place which would assist in guarding against unsuitable persons participating in FÁS-funded projects involving substantial contact with children.</P>
    <P>I should also say that a comprehensive review will be undertaken of the need for &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; arrangements in the child care area generally and, perhaps, other areas also having regard, inter alia, to the recent report of the expert working group on child care. However, irrespective of whatever new arrangements may be introduced in this area in the future, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage &ndash; e.g., good interviewing practice, checking references etc. &ndash; and, also, when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 26 July 1995, accepted the recommendations submitted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in regard to the Dublin Transportation Initiative plan for Dublin. This plan recommended, among other traffic management initiatives, the appointment of a director of traffic by Dublin Corporation to take over responsibility from the Garda Commissioner for traffic wardens, on the spot fines and tow-away services, introduce wheel clamping and have overall responsibility for traffic management in Dublin city. I should state that the transfer of the traffic <Col N="712" /> wardens to Dublin Corporation will bring the Dublin Metropolitan Area into line with the rest of the State where local authorities employ traffic wardens under the Local Government (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975.</P>
      <P>The progress on the implementation of the Government decision is as follows.</P>
      <P>The director of traffic was appointed by Dublin Corporation in April 1997.</P>
      <P>Wheel clamping was introduced in the summer of 1998 and Dublin Corporation took over responsibility for the tow-away service in September 1998.</P>
      <P>Prolonged and intensive negotiations between my Department, the Department of Finance, Dublin Corporation and the unions representing the traffic wardens have taken place. Earlier this month all 146 traffic wardens in the greater Dublin area were notified by the Garda Commissioner that they will transfer to Dublin Corporation on 29 April 1999, thus implementing the Government decision in so far as the traffic services are concerned.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who have advised that Ballinrobe Garda station is the area headquarters for Kilmaine, Shrule and Cong stations under the community policing scheme. This administrative area is situated in the southern part of Mayo and the current staffing strength assigned to it is four sergeants and eight gardaí, of whom two sergeants and four gardaí are allocated to Ballinrobe Garda station. The community policing initiative has been operating in the area since June 1982 and has been a success.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have advised that Ballinrobe Garda station is open to the public from 11 a. m. to 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday to Saturday and from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. on Sunday. When the station is unmanned, there is a direct communication link with Claremorris district headquarters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 501 to 504, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allocations to national governing bodies of sport are decided on the basis of recommendations made to my Department by the Irish Sports Council which considers the applications in the first instance. The council's recommend<Col N="717" /> ations are based on a close and detailed evaluation of applications received from each of the governing bodies and are made having regard to the criteria for grant approval outlined in my Department's section 15 and 16 reference book prepared under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. While the grants to the bodies are made up of amounts under a number of headings, it is a matter for each body to prioritise individual items under these headings including the elements of its international competition programme.</P>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of total allocations to national governing bodies of sport in 1998 is set out in the form of a tabular statement which I shall circulate in the Official Report. However, in relation to 1999, as allocations to NGBs under the international carding scheme in respect of their high performing members have still to be finalised, comparable figures with those in the 1998 table will not be available until then.</P>
    <P>Allocations for 1999 to the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI will be finalised as soon as details of their proposed projects for disadvantaged areas have been agreed with the respective bodies. The decision on the 1999 allocation to Swim Ireland is also pending confirmation by the membership that they are satisfied that their restructured organisation has adequate structures in place to ensure the safety of swimmers, particularly young swimmers. Swim Ireland's AGM is due to take place on 25 April.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that the Sports Council has recommended and I have agreed that grants of £3,000 and £18,000, respectively, be made available to the Paralympic Council to assist in meeting costs associated with a pre-Olympic visit to Sydney and to CUSAI towards the cost of participating in the World Student Games.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 505, 506 and 507 together.</P>
      <P>The proposals referred to by the Deputy for tourism promotion and the development of air access into the north-west arose in direct response to the work of the Donegal Employment Initiative which was set up by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to mitigate the impact of the scaling down of the Fruit of the Loom operation in Donegal.</P>
      <P>As I recently announced, a £250,000 funding package is being made available through Bord Fáilte for 1999 and 2000 for incremental tourism marketing for County Donegal.</P>
      <P>In addition, a specific cross-Border initiative is being developed by the Air Access Group in the north-west, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, for the development of air access through the airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo and Knock, for approval for funding of up to £250,000 under the EU co-funded North-South INTERREG programme.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that resources have already been allocated under another EU co-funded programme, the Tourism Operational Programme, by the management board for marketing to stimulate air traffic growth to the south-west and other regions. Details of this support are contained in the annual reports of the management board, copies of which have been placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>Additional funds are also being provided through Bord Fáilte to undertake a series of tourism marketing initiatives with a view to encouraging a more diversified spread of tourism benefits, including in the south-west. Some £920,000 of these funds have been allocated for regional development of tourism throughout the country and £300,000 to support the overseas marketing of small accommodation providers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 509 and 510 together.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme, there are four applications awaiting approval in my Department, from bodies other than local authorities, for funding to build new pools. In addition, there is one application awaiting approval from a body other than a local authority, for funding to refurbish a pool. In all such cases, the proposals must be supported by the local authority before they can be considered.</P>
      <P>Applications have also been received from seven bodies, other than a local authority, for funding swimming pools, six of them involving the refurbishment of existing pools, under the new sports capital programme. Almost 1,900 applications in all have been received under this programme covering a wide range of sporting facilities.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by the organisation to which the Deputy refers. However, I do not concur with such views. The Ministers to whom the Deputy has addressed separate questions in this regard will deal with the various aspects of the overall drugs strategy which fall within their areas of responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say, in particular, that the drugs initiative, which operates under the aegis of the National Drugs Strategy Team located in my Department, is running effectively &ndash; a fact that has been borne out by the findings of a recent external evaluation of the initiative.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that 13 local drugs task forces were set up on foot of a recommendation in the first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs. In this report, the ministerial task force focused on heroin abuse, which is the most pressing aspect of the drug problem, because of its public health implications and close relationship with crime. The task forces were set up to develop an integrated response to the drug problem in the areas experiencing the highest levels of substance, particularly heroin, abuse.</P>
      <P>The areas were designated primarily on the basis of treatment statistics for heroin misuse, provided &ndash; in both written and oral submissions &ndash; by the Health Research Board, which is the Irish focal point of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ministerial task force received over 120 submissions from statutory, voluntary and community organisations working in the drugs area. The submissions which dealt with the issue of prevalence of drug misuse supported the Health Research Board's analysis of where the problem was at its most acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> Following the external evaluation of the drugs initiative, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion has agreed to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being, on the basis of an evaluation framework being put in place which would enable the initiative to be measured in terms of impacts and outcomes in due course.</P>

      <P>The position is that my Department has already responded to the National Parents Council in relation to this proposal explaining why it is not considered either necessary or viable.</P>
      <P>Quality assurance in marking of examination papers is best achieved by ensuring that examiners are well briefed in relation to the application of the marking scheme and through sampling and close supervision of the marking of each examiner as the marking proceeds. The key concern issue is to ensure a standardised approach in the marking as distinct from providing a standardised environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 4,000 teachers are required for the task of examining during the period late June to early August. Each examiner is allowed 26 days to complete the marking. Imposing a requirement that would necessitate each of those teachers having to reside for up to a month adjacent to a cen<Col N="727" /> tral location, common to all examiners for that subject, would inevitably bring about a dramatic reduction in the number of teachers prepared to serve as examiner. This, in turn, would render it impossible to publish the results of the examinations within a reasonable timescale.</P>

      <P>My Department endeavours to provide school transport for all children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services. However, in some cases this is not feasible due to particular circumstances such as excessive cost, too long a distance, or the inability of a child to avail of the service because of the nature of the disability. In such cases, my Department offers a grant to the parents or guardians of the pupil concerned to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.</P>
      <P>I understand that the issue to which the Deputy refers relates to six pupils attending a special class at the school and for whom a special transport service could not be provided due to cost factors and the distances involved. My Department has offered transport grants to the families of the children involved to assist in their making private transport arrangements.</P>
      <P>The amount of transport grant paid in each case depends on the distance involved and the level of school attendance of the pupil. The level of grant may be appealed in any individual case where it can be shown that the family involved is encountering hardship in supporting the private transport arrangement. I understand that the amount of grant offered in respect of one of the families involved has since been increased on appeal.</P>

      <P>The authorities of Castlecomer Community School and St. Mary's secondary school, Holy Faith Convent, Glasnevin Dublin 11, have applied to my Department for disadvantaged status.

The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a shortage of replacement teachers in Dublin and that schools frequently have problems in finding substitute teachers; and the length of time the schools must wait before the number of substitute teachers available is sufficient to meet demand.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned since coming into office at the shortage of trained teachers at primary level, and I am aware of difficulties being experienced by many schools, in Dublin and elsewhere, in securing the services of qualified teachers for substitute posts. For this reason I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I ensured that the intake of students to the colleges of education in the current school year was increased to over 1,000. This includes 748 students pursuing the three-year B.Ed. degree programme, in addition to 280 degree holders who have commenced an 18-month full-time post-graduate teacher training course. I am committed to maintaining this level of intake in coming years.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I have arranged that B. Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education and who have Irish either as part of their degree or to higher level grade C in the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I further decided that from September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education shall be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service. Montessori-trained teachers who have successfully completed the three-year course at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire which is recognised by the NCEA shall also be granted recognition for substitute service with effect from September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that 500 newly-trained teachers will qualify at the end of the current academic year. I am satisfied that the supply of trained teachers will be adequate to fill all permanent posts arising in September next, including the additional teaching posts which I recently announced. However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there has been a shortage of <Col N="733" /> trained teachers in the system for a number of years, and that this shortage cannot be completely eliminated in the short-term.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that there will be a sufficient supply of trained teachers to meet all the future needs of the primary education system, including substitution needs, and I am satisfied that the initiatives I have already introduced will go a long way towards achieving this target.</P>

      <P>For any one subject at the junior or leaving certificate examinations a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty which <Col N="734" /> might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.</P>
      <P>This year my Department will be instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on schools already in the scheme which have the greatest concentration of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The breaking the cycle of disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study. This scheme is operating over a planned five-year period. The operation of the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department and the scheme is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>I recently announced details of a major initiative to tackle educational disadvantage. This initiative involves expenditure of £57 million over the next two years to address educational disadvantage at all levels in the education system. It represents the largest ever programme of its type in this country and it is my intention to build further on this initiative in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional initiatives which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage in the primary sector.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third level course.

      <P>To be eligible for a maintenance grant under the terms of the student support schemes a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, academic attainments, means and nationality.

      <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000.

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Caherline National School is a principal and three mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 87 on 30 September 1997. The enrolment at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 82 pupils. This falls short of the minimum of 85 pupils necessary to retain the third teaching post in the school for the coming school year.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret that even though there is a significant improvement in the primary school staffing schedule for the coming year, there is no basis whereby the school can retain its existing staffing levels for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway is not entitled to a higher rate of grant towards the cost of his education as a mature student at the Regional Technical College, Galway, where he is studying for a National Certificate in Manufacturing Technology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending.</P>
      <P>In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college. If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which she or he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, where an independent mature student can produce supporting evidence that she <Col N="742" /> or he is maintaining a residence other than his or her address while attending college, it will be open to the awarding authority to regard that address at the candidate's normal residence.</P>
    <P>I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy is residing within 15 miles of Galway Institute of Technology and he has therefore been awarded the adjacent rate of maintenance grant by City of Galway Vocational Education Committee. This is the maximum rate of grant payable to the student in question under the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>I previously indicated my concern about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular, with regard to the rate of grant payable in accordance with the provisions of the schemes. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant. This improvement is estimated to cost over £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>

      <P>The joint programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, while stating that an integrated philosophy of prevention will be part of its overall strategy for dealing with drugs, does not specify appointments to any of the posts referred to in the copy of the newsletter supplied. In the case of my Department's support for schools in developing educational programmes for the prevention of misuse of drugs, priority has been given to completion of the development of the substance misuse prevention programme for primary schools, Walk Tall. The preparation of this programme was completed by the end of 1998 and its dissemination to all primary schools, over a two year period, commenced early this year. There is a support team, comprising a national project officer and five teacher trainers, in place to carry out the dissemination. A sum of £1 million has been assigned for this process over the two years, 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The Walk Tall programme for primary schools was evaluated independently and the outcome of this evaluation has indicated that it is suitable for children generally in primary schools, and that teachers regard the programme positively.</P>
      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for post-primary schools, On My Own Two Feet, which was introduced in 1995, continues to be supported by my Department. Twelve substantial in-career development courses on implementing the programme, for post-primary teachers, were held during the current school year, each course lasting 50 hours. Further such training programmes are being planned for the coming school year. This training support is co-ordinated by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>In the context of the revised curriculum for primary schools social, personal and health education will be introduced as part of the phased introduction of the revised curriculum. The substance misuse prevention education programme will be subsumed as part of SPHE as it is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 578 and 579 together.</P>
      <P>Improvements in the labour market generally have meant that it is those whose difficulties are most entrenched, including in terms of literacy and basic education, who now remain unemployed, and who also find themselves unable to access mainstream education and training programmes. The OECD international adult literacy survey attests to the low levels of literacy in the adult population in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following the survey, an extra £0.25 million was provided for adult literacy in 1997, and the funds were doubled, by a further £2 million in 1998. A further increase of £3.2 million has been provided over 1999 and 2000 as part of the December budget package. The funds have been used to establish a national adult literacy development fund to test approaches which will lead to mainstreaming. Key priorities are the promotion of awareness strategies using a range of media, the deployment of staff to outreach work, the establishment of referral networks with other agencies, the promotion of a continuum from one-to-one voluntary tuition to tuition in small groups to progression to certified learning options, and the promotion of flexibility in the delivery and timing of services. Open learning centres and family literacy approaches are also being tested.</P>
      <P>A working group, representative of Departments and other interested organisations, has been established under the aegis of my Department to examine how the literacy services might best serve unemployed people.</P>
      <P>The recently published Green Paper on Adult Education sets out as a top priority the establishment of a national adult literacy programme, and proposes that funding in this area should increase on a phased basis to at least £10 million per annum.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The annual higher education grants scheme, which I approve, sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions. However, there are a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the year.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to the scope of the scheme must be considered in the light of overall resource constraints and the competing demands within the education sector. My priorities in the area of student support have been to introduce a maintenance grants scheme for students attending plc courses in the current academic year and to address the position of mature students under the various grant schemes. In addition, funding is being targeted at significantly increasing the number of third level places.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, £15 per pupil in respect of each service, to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no secretarial or caretaking provision already rather than increase the <i>per capita</i> grant rate of £30 per pupil. In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing grant aid to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for these services. The posi<Col N="751" /> tion of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners. In addition, the staffing schedule for primary schools has been significantly improved for the coming year.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Archbishop McQuaid junior school is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 229 as at 30 September 1997. The enrolment on 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 204 pupils. Unfortunately, this does not meet the retention requirement for the seventh and eighth teaching posts for the next school year, and I regret that there is therefore no basis for sanctioning the retention of these posts.</P>
      <P>The school will continue to have the services of two remedial teachers, a special teacher for travellers, a teacher for the mildly mentally handicapped and a home school liaison teacher. It will also, by virtue of its disadvantaged status, retain the services of its concessionary teaching post for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

      <P>The cost of operating the school attendance service covered by the school attendance committee in Dublin city, Cork city, Waterford city and the borough of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown in 1998 was £1.33 million approximately. The cost of enforcing the School Attendance Acts by the Garda Síochána is not available, as it is not possible to segregate this cost from the overall costs of the wider range of functions carried out by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I expect to be in a position to publish a Bill which will replace existing legislation on school attendance in the very near future. This Bill will provide for legislative and administrative arrangements which can effectively uphold a child's constitutional right to education. These arrangements will reflect current thinking in respect of educational and social issues. The Bill will, in particular, address the problem of truancy and other school attendance problems within the overall context of the general educational welfare of children and their families. It will raise the minimum school leaving age to 16 years or the completion of three years of junior cycle education, whichever is later. It is also proposed to provide for a nationally co-ordinated approach to school attendance issues, by establishing a national board to oversee the operation of the Bill, when enacted. The Bill will also provide for the duties of parents, schools and employers.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the psychological assessment service for children in a number of Tallaght schools has been effectively withdrawn; if he was consulted about such a serious reduction in service to schools; the course of action which should be taken in the case of pupils where teachers and parents request assessment; the service, if any, he will provide for the schools and children affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The psychologist assigned to the schools in question unfortunately had to take a career break at very short notice due to unforeseen personal circumstances. It was not possible to provide a substitute immediately. However, I share the Deputy's concern that the psychological service should be restored to these schools as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>A number of psychologists are about to be engaged on short-term contract to carry out urgent assessment work. Referrals of an urgent nature from these schools should be sent to the headquarters of the psychological service in Marlborough Street where a senior psychologist has been nominated to co-ordinate the response for the remainder of term.</P>
      <P>The new national educational psychological service agency will shortly be formally established. My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. One of the priorities for the deployment of these additional psychologists will be the restoration of the psychological service in any area where it has been temporarily withdrawn.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 136 of 31 March 1999, if he will expand on the contents of the reply about the distinctive and unique mission in the south-east region which the Government intends to maintain.</Quest>

      <P>Waterford Institute of Technology plays a vital role in the life of the south-east region. Through the breadth and quality of its activities, unmatched by any other institution in the region, it has achieved a position of considerable standing. The Government is conscious that, while <Col N="758" /> promising much, previous Governments failed to properly invest in the development of the institute in order to maintain and expand its contribution to the region.</P>
      <P>As a result, we have put in place unprecedented levels of investment in the future of the institute. For example, recurrent funding, excluding fees, was increased by 21 per cent last year alone and the institute's facilities are being transformed as a result of the millions allocated to capital developments.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 137 of 31 March 1999 and in view of the fact that his reply stated that there was no significance in the different wording of the reports on Waterford Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology in relation to further delegation of degree awarding powers, he will ask the interim review group to make the appropriate alteration to the recommendations for Waterford Institute of Technology by deleting the word primary in order that the recommendations for Waterford are in line with the recommendation for Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 31 March reports of the interim review group have been completed and published. The group operated entirely independently of my Department and I am sure the Deputy would agree that it would be highly inappropriate for me to interfere in the process by seeking to have final reports withdrawn and changed, especially on the basis of a difference between the reports which has no significance.</P>
      <P>The crucial point is that each institute will have, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, delegated authority to make awards in relation to existing and new programmes at the level of certificate and diploma. In addition, each institute will be free to seek further delegation in respect of degree qualifications when they wish.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>when the special teaching support for children attending schools on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1998 I announced a range of important new developments in special education services. The developments in question included an undertaking that all children assessed <Col N="759" /> as having a special educational need and attending ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis, would be entitled to an automatic response to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been engaged in delivering on this undertaking since the time of my announcement. Significant numbers of additional resource teacher and child care assistant posts have already been allocated to cater for special <Col N="760" /> needs children in integrated settings. The level and nature of the response in each case is based on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to respond to such cases as they arise. The Deputy will appreciate that the backlog of cases caused due to the previous deficiencies in policy cannot be cleared overnight, but my officials are doing all they can to address cases as quickly as possible.</P>
