    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intensive efforts have been made right through the period since last February to secure an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  The SDLP leader, Mr. John Hume, has played and continues to play a very important and helpful role in this regard.  In many respects, he is <Col N="618" /> uniquely placed to convince republicans of the inherently counterproductive nature of violence.</P>
    <P>The Government has always been strongly supportive of John Hume's efforts.  Owing to the particular sensitivities involved, Deputies will appreciate that it would be neither appropriate nor helpful for me to go into detail on this matter. I can say, however, that the Government and the SDLP leadership share the same broad aim &mdash; fully inclusive talks, taking place in an environment of peace, and leading to a political settlement founded on agreement and consent. We will both continue to do everything we can to bring that about.</P>
    <P>The criteria for participation in the multi-party talks were set out in the Joint Communique of 28 February and were subsequently restated in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ground Rules paper. They were in turn referred to in the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations) Act which, for the British side, forms the legal basis of the multi-party talks.  Those remain the entry conditions.  In addition, it was also stated in both the communique and the Ground Rules that all participants must make clear at the beginning of negotiations their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the international body. This was done last June by all the participants involved at present in the multi-party talks.  It would also be required of Sinn Féin following an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The Government wishes to see Sinn Féin participate in the negotiations.  IRA actions since last February, however, have placed a question mark over the credibility of the republican movement.  That is why the two Governments have called for a restored ceasefire to be unequivocal.  Sinn Féin and the IRA must be convincing in their commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic methods.</P>
    <P>The multi-party talks have the potential to provide a meaningful and inclusive process where all legitimate concerns can be addressed &mdash; in particular, once substantive three strand negotiations are launched.  The ultimate purpose of these talks is the achievement of an agreed settlement to which both Nationalists and Unionists could give their support and allegiance. That requires that due recognition and respect must be accorded to the allegiances, aspirations, identities and concerns of both communities. When substantive three-strand negotiations get under way, the Government will honour the relevant commitment in paragraph 6 of the Joint Declaration.  That commitment, as Deputy Harney will be aware, is set in the context of representations being made by the Unionist political representatives in the course of political dialogue.</P>
    <P>Without pre-empting such representations, much useful work on the broad theme of paragraph 6 has nevertheless been done by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and in particular, by the Sub-committee on Obstacles in <Col N="619" /> the South to Reconciliation.  The Sub-committee had been close to finalising its report when it was decided to defer forum meetings.  The Government will take account of the deliberations of the sub-committee, as appropriate, in the multi-party talks.</P>
    <P>Regarding President Clinton's re-election, I sent him a short personal message of congratulations and thanked him for his continued interest in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is reasonable that, if the unequivocal ceasefire requested by both Governments and all parties is declared by the IRA, the British Government should set out its unequivocal position at this stage so that everyone knows what will happen? The Taoiseach has continually stated that both Governments are in agreement on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is set out in large measure in that a talks process exists and an indication has been given of the requirement which parties must fulfil for entry to the talks, namely, signing up to the Mitchell Principles.  It is also mentioned in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ground Rules paper which sets out the criteria for eligibility to participate in the talks which would result in making a declaration of acceptance of the Mitchell Principles.  I believe there is greater detail now of what needs to be done and what will happen than when the ceasefire was declared in August 1994.  There is a talks process, for which the conditions for eligibility are set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ground Rules, the Mitchell Principles exist and people know exactly what they mean, how exacting they are and what they must do to make their commitment to them meaningful.  There is a lot of information already.</P>
      <P>The purpose of John Hume's work, to which the Deputy referred in one of his questions, is to assist in bridging any gaps of misunderstanding which may exist and to assist all parties in ensuring there is another ceasefire.  The terms of any such ceasefire announcement are important. As I have often said in response to questions from the Deputy and others, it is important that those declaring the ceasefire seek to put themselves into the minds of those who have reason to fear their organisation, who have, perhaps, been hurt, wounded or suffered at the hands of their organisation in the past, and to try to find words in the declaration of a ceasefire which will convince those people and past victims of the IRA that, this time, the ceasefire is for good.  The best people to find the most convincing words to convey that conviction are the people making the declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply to Question No. 5, the Taoiseach referred at some length to the work of a subcommittee in the Forum and suggested that the Government would use that as the basis for what it would do.  Has the Government any <Col N="620" /> proposals of its own, independent of the Forum subcommittee, to deal with this important aspect of the Downing Street Declaration and one which will be carefully examined in Northern Ireland and, perhaps, in Britain and elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As the Deputy will be aware, since the Downing Street Declaration, the Government enacted legislation to allow civil divorce in this jurisdiction.  That complies with the terms of the declaration.  Legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation which will put our education system on a statutory footing for the first time and respect the pluralist nature of our society.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is promoting legislation on equality across a range of areas where inequality might exist.  That is also in line with the requirements to make this State fully consistent with the norms of a modern, democratic and pluralist society.  The Government is continuing its work on this matter and has been active in implementing that aspect of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the British Government wants to firmly tie down all matters before it finally commits itself?  It seems reasonable it should also firmly state what its position would be if a ceasefire were declared. That is creating some difficulties.  It would be very helpful if the British Government played the game fairly.  It and the Taoiseach are correct to say that the wording of any ceasefire should be clear and unambiguous and I agree.  However, those who must deliver and stand over any ceasefire in future, something which is difficult in such organisations, must know what they are signing up to.  The British Government should pay as much attention to that as to the argument the Taoiseach put and with which I agree.</P>
      <P>I am not personally convinced of the timescale argument so I will not argue that issue.  I am not sure how there can be an agreed timescale on something so complex.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any information to show that the British Government is about to tie itself down on the important issues at stake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the closest possible contact with the British Government on these matters.  I have had a number of substantial conversations recently with the Prime Minister and a lengthy meeting with the Secretary of State. The Tánaiste is also in intensive contact with the British Government on all matters with a view to being able to give the best possible assurances that the talks process will be meaningful, inclusive and effective for all participants, including Sinn Féin, if it is allowed to join them as a result of an IRA ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to convey to the House that I have had recent discussions with John Hume about the same matter.  The Government is doing everything it can to overcome any difficulties or misunderstandings which may arise and to give <Col N="621" /> assurances to the best of its ability so that we have an early and unequivocal ceasefire.  The opportunity, which took great effort to put in place, now exists but will not last forever.  As I said before to the Deputy, talk about setting up a new peace process is foolish as a peace process and talks process are already in place.</P>
    <P>It has carefully drafted and hard-won safeguards such as independent chairpersons, ground rules for its operation &mdash; for example, the sufficient consensus rule &mdash; all of which are designed to ensure that no minority is in any way oppressed in the process and that every party is enabled to ensure that its views are heard and no item is excluded from the agenda.  It is very important, that opportunity being there, that it be seized.  I do not know that it would be appropriate for me to go any further into detail about the work we are doing to give the assurances that are necessary, but the House can be assured that we are doing a great deal on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying, if the communiqué of 28 February and the Ground Rules document, particularly the relevant paragraphs, are adhered to, that following a genuine ceasefire Sinn Féin should be requested by both Governments to sign the Mitchell Principles which will allow them thereafter to take their seat at the all-party negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that adherence to the Mitchell Principles is not a commitment to the Governments <i>per se</i> but to the other participants in the talks.  Those who have given a commitment to adhere to the Mitchell Principles in the talks up to now have not only given that commitment but have been questioned in the talks about the validity of their commitments.  It is not simply a question of signing a piece of paper.  It is a process being committed to in the talks themselves.  To do that in that form, the participants must be in the talks; to be in the talks they must be invited to the talks, and to be invited to the talks they must have complied with paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ground Rules.</P>
      <P>So far as paragraph 9 is concerned the issue is whether there is a ceasefire.  As to paragraph 8, there are evaluations to be made about the validity of the ceasefire, the extent of the commitment and so forth.  That is where the wording of any declaration of a ceasefire is particularly important.  It is important in regard to showing that the commitment required in paragraph 8 of the Ground Rules is being met.  A ceasefire that is purely tactical is not sufficient.  It could be argued that a purely tactical ceasefire would comply with paragraph 9 but it plainly would not comply with paragraph 8 because paragraph 8 requires that people be satisfied as to its genuineness.  That is the area where work is continuing and is being pursued most intensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that is a helpful exposition of the matter. <Col N="622" /> I am sure the Deputy is already well aware of most of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming there is a ceasefire and that it is regarded as genuine and satisfactory to the various parties and that talks begin some time after that, will the Taoiseach give an indication of what might be regarded as an indicative timeframe for those talks?  Will he not agree that that would be more desirable than having open-ended talks that might run into the period in office of another British Government which might conceivably have a lesser degree of commitment to the whole process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this in some detail in the speech I made at the Centre for the Unemployed in Finglas earlier this year.  There is already a timeframe of a year in the legislation establishing the talks, with the option of a second year.  Such timeframe is liable to cross the date of a British general election.  That was known from the outset.  It is not a particular problem because in the House of Commons there is a good level of consensus that the talks process is the way forward and that we need to make it work.</P>
      <P>In my speech in Finglas I said that perhaps the parties might agree on parcelling out the work within the timeframe, agreeing to deal with particular matters at particular times, perhaps not concluding any of them, not departing from the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but at least having a programme of work that would show that all the items on the indicative agenda would be got through.  That is a concept that would be worth considering. However, it is a matter for the parties themselves, and the parties are not just the two Governments but all of the parties present in the talks.  It would not be appropriate or productive for the Governments to attempt to dictate or appear to dictate an agenda of that nature.  Given how people react if they feel their democratic rights are being taken for granted or overruled in any way, the reaction to too strong an attempt by the Governments to set that sort of timeframe could be negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach call it a guillotine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  That is not the way we should approach it.  In a matter of this sensitivity it would be best to give the parties the maximum freedom to choose their own timeframe.  I do not wish to be accused, as I sometimes am, of going on too long or repeating things I have said before, but it is important to make the point that this problem in Northern Ireland has existed for about 400 years.  It has given rise to 25 years of violence which is not ended at this point.  The idea that it could all be solved in some short timeframe set by people who are a little removed from the problem is unrealistic.  That is not to say that it is not urgent <Col N="623" /> that we should solve it.  However, we must be realistic and give people space to come to terms with one another in a way that they have not done over 400 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Teasing the issues out is helpful. Mr. John Hume is engaged in trying to clarify various matters and narrow down areas of difference.  Have the Taoiseach or the British Government suggested to him that perhaps they could draft whatever is being sought to allow the IRA to declare a ceasefire and to have no doubt about the move into all-party talks?  Leaving aside the question of a timeframe &mdash; I have made my comments on that, as has the Taoiseach &mdash; there is still concern that there will be a trick somewhere along the way, that we will be down again to arguing with the British Government about a legal definition of the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;&mdash; there are none better than the legal powers in the British Government, whether they are in Europe arguing about an &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; clause or in Northern Ireland arguing about an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; clause, at finding ways to delay.  That is a fact responsible for much of what happened during the 400 years mentioned by the Taoiseach.  Has the Taoiseach thought about trying to break that logjam and giving some certainty to the people engaged in trying to deliver an IRA ceasefire?  If that logjam could be broken &mdash; and it will not be easy &mdash; there might be a ceasefire by Christmas 1996.  If we do not break the logjam the situation will continue as it is and that could be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any peace process every participant must make at least a minimal assumption of good faith on the part of every other relevant participant.  It is not possible before the process commences to have either the outcome agreed or to have every conceivable question answered by the other side.  It is necessary to make assumptions of good faith.  The republican movement, given its history, has difficulty making assumptions of good faith about the British Government but the republican movement must also realise that it is just as difficult for the British Government to make assumptions about the good faith of the republican movement.  If either side is to wait until it is satisfied beyond all doubt about the good faith of the other side, neither side will ever get started as far as the peace process is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I understand the concern of parties to ask every question they can and seek the maximum degree of reassurance, it is important to reiterate that there must be a willingness to trust and to take a risk.  People speak about taking risks for peace.  The ultimate risk one takes in a peace process is the risk involved in trusting somebody whom one might not have reason to trust but whom one decides to trust because one believes it is the best way forward for peace.  I urge all those involved in these discussions to <Col N="624" /> take the risk of trusting people they might not usually be disposed to trust in the interests of peace.  That is the best general approach.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy Ahern's question, every possibility of bridging gaps of understanding is being explored and will continue to be explored.  However, it still comes back to what I said in the first part of my answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;unequivocal&rdquo; frequently but he has created a great deal of ambiguity about its meaning.  He tried to explain paragraph 8 of the Ground Rules. Does that paragraph not deserve a better explanation?  Is it the Taoiseach's impression that Sinn Féin is the main barrier to peace in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to suggest that anybody is the main barrier to peace in Northern Ireland.  To make any such suggestion, which the Deputy invites me to make, would not be helpful and I do not understand why the Deputy makes it.</P>
      <P>The Ground Rules document is clear and I have quoted it, not interpreted it.  The words are in the document and I have quoted them extensively in this House.  The Ground Rules are there to be met and I have simply drawn attention to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The key word appears to be &ldquo;trust&rdquo;. Rather than have an academic argument about what is included in documents 1 and 2, the jargon should be pushed aside and the Taoiseach's word on trust accepted.  Who would decide the question of trust?  Instead of waiting for the IRA to declare a ceasefire, could we not assume that there are people in the IRA who want a ceasefire and take that on trust?  If we use the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; who decides that we should or should not trust? Would it be the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach?  If so, I ask the Taoiseach to accept his own analysis, accept this on trust and move on to a new position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on a number of occasions, the final analysis is paragraph 8 of the ground rules document which requires people to demonstrate their commitment to peaceful methods.  The interpretation of paragraph 8 is a matter of belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Until there is a ceasefire declaration we do not have a statement we can believe or otherwise.  The first prerequisite is a ceasefire declaration.  As long as there is no ceasefire there is no question that anybody involved in the republican movement could sign up to the Mitchell Principles.  Including them in <Col N="625" /> the talks in the absence of a ceasefire would make no sense because even if they were admitted to the talks in such circumstances they could not sign up to the Mitchell Principles.  There must first be a ceasefire and the terms of the ceasefire must be interpreted in light of the requirements of paragraphs 8 and 9.  We have been working hard to get a basis for a ceasefire that will be durable and understood by all to be durable.  We want that to happen soon but there must be a modicum of willingness to trust on each side.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that Deputy Harte's proposal that the IRA should be allowed to the table without a ceasefire is not Government or Fine Gael policy? As far as this side of the House is concerned, there is no question of Sinn Féin being at the negotiating table without a ceasefire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke is trying to be mischievous or has misunderstood my position. The record shows that I have never been ambivalent in speaking out against the IRA.  My theory is that in waiting so many months for the IRA to deliver a ceasefire we are giving it a veto to hold everybody else back.  Is it possible to assume that there is a ceasefire because there has been no violence for so long and to move to the next stage or move in that direction?  That is not breaking with Government policy; it is facing the reality that the IRA has a veto on everything if it does not declare a ceasefire.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which requires care in the way we formulate what we say.  I would like to say what I have to say without being interrupted.  Regarding the first part of Deputy Harte's question, the IRA has no veto whatever in this area.  The Tánaiste, myself and, indeed, Fianna Fáil have made it clear repeatedly that the talks can proceed and will proceed with the other parties in the absence of Sinn Féin in the absence of an IRA ceasefire.  Let us not forget that the parties already at the talks represent 85 per cent of the electorate, a majority of both communities, in Northern Ireland.  It would be profoundly undemocratic to suggest that those people cannot do business with one another just because a violent organisation is continuing a campaign of violence.</P>
      <P>I would not accept the fact that the IRA has not reinstated its ceasefire but is not actually killing people this week would be a sufficient entry requirement to the talks.  I will never accept such a position and I am surprised at Deputy Harte putting such a proposition forward because it has no basis in reality.  If the organisation is unwilling to declare a ceasefire it is retaining the option of violence.  An unwillingness to declare a ceasefire represents a retention of the option of violence which is entirely contrary to the Mitchell Principles.  I invite Deputy Harte to read the Mitchell Principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as 15 February last in a face to face meeting with Sinn Féin, the Fianna Fáil Party leader together with members of his Front Bench made it clear to Sinn Féin it could not have a veto and that it could not re-enter talks unless and until there was a ceasefire and the Mitchell Principles were adhered to.  The question does not arise of the participation of Sinn Féin in talks until there is an IRA ceasefire. That is the clear policy of the main Opposition party as it is of the Government.</P>

      <P>The summit will take place in Washington on 16 December which is the Monday after the summit in Dublin of the EU heads of Government.  It will deal with all the issues on the transatlantic agenda.  Obviously trade will be a major issue.  We will be looking at recognition of standards.  A number of the questions I discussed when I met President Clinton in September will be more formally dealt with in the agenda for the summit which will take place on 16 December.  I hope to avail of the opportunity to discuss Irish US relations and, in particular, the peace process with President Clinton when I meet him in Washington on Monday, 16 December.  The President's schedule did not make it possible for him to come to Europe to have the summit.  The Americans have suggested that in future, because all elections in the United States tend to take place in the second half of the year, the US-Europe Summit should take place in the United States in the second half of the year and where it is due to take place in the first half of the year it will take place in Europe.  That is the pattern they wish to establish for the future.  It seems to be a common sense pattern because of the fixed election dates in November every two years in the United States.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately in recent years the election timeframe seems to run in November in Ireland as well.  On the preparatory work for the summit, will the Taoiseach, as a matter of urgency, raise with the US authorities the issue of Zaire and the human tragedy unfolding there?  In view of our Presidency of the EU I ask the Taoiseach to take immediate action to indicate to the UN and the US that we are prepared and should participate in the provision of troops within our resources to whatever peace mission is being established at UN level, which we hope will be sooner rather than later, to tackle this humanitarian problem.  Will the Taoiseach examine participation of Irish troops at this stage in a UN peacekeeping mission and discuss this matter with the US authorities?</P>

      <P>This is a very important subject and I would like to do justice to it.  It does not arise under this question.  The only question that relates in any way to the United States is the content of my message to President Clinton congratulating him on his re-election.  I did not mention the Zaire situation in that letter.  The letter was concerned solely with personal congratulations to somebody whom I know quite well at this stage.  So far as the matter to which the Deputy referred is concerned, he will be aware that Deputy David Andrews has asked for a debate on this subject.  I indicated we would have such a debate; it was planned to have it this <Col N="628" /> week and we may yet have it this week.  If not, we will have it as soon as possible.  I agree with the Deputy it is an important issue but it is a sufficiently important issue for me not to give answers to the Deputy's questions without further study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss of peatland habitat in recent years has been a source of concern to me and my Department has made every effort to ensure that these habitats survive into the future. To this end my Department, through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), has proposed that all intact peatlands, and those less severely damaged, be designated natural heritage areas (NHAs).</P>
      <P>The NHA proposals have been advertised throughout the country as part of the consultation process prior to designation.  This consultation process is ongoing at present and designations will be made when the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been amended by the Oireachtas.  I hope to be in a position to introduce amending legislation before the end of this year and I am sure the Deputy's party will co-operate fully in its swift enactment, to allow for the formal designation of these important sites.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is preparing the necessary regulations which will give effect to the EU Habitats Directive and I expect to be in a position to transpose the directive into national legislation later this month. I will then propose the best peatland sites for designation as special areas of conservation and no activity or development likely to have a significant damaging effect on these sites will be allowed, other than on grounds of human health or public safety.</P>
      <P>My Department has designated 106 special protection areas under the EU Birds Directive for the protection of wild birds and their habitats. Twelve of these sites, covering an area of 59,500 hectares, are of a peatland type.  The regulations I previously mentioned will provide additional protection, similar to that provided for special areas of conservation, to these sites also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has requested the planning authorities to refer all applications for planning <Col N="629" /> permission likely to impact on the proposed sites to the NPWS for comment and recommendations. This provides an opportunity to the State to inform the relevant bodies should a development requiring planning permission be considered damaging to the environment.  It is Government and EU policy to confine grant-aid to developments which are compatible with protecting the environment and my Department advises grant-aiding bodies in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The NPWS has discussed the importance of peatlands in their own right as habitats with Coillte and Bord na Móna.  It has reached agreement with these bodies that no further peat extraction or afforestation will occur on any peatlands of international importance.</P>
    <P>The NPWS has also acquired approximately 30,000 hectares of peatlands, in addition to peatlands contained within the national parks, and, through ownership, the long-term conservation of these peatlands is assured.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree with the Irish Peatland Conservation Plan 2000 which stated that, since 1987, the Government adopted a reactive approach to achieving the peatland conservation target?  Does he agree there has not been the kind of strategy needed as regards our peatland?  What strategy does he have in mind? Does he believe the peatlands are living archives? I listened carefully to his reply which seemed to be all platitudes.  To have real conservation we need to establish the national heritage areas.  We have been promised an amendment to wildlife legislation for some time, which is still not forthcoming.  What does the Minister feel about the compensation issue in relation to NHAs? When will we have the proposed legislation on national parks and wildlife?  What is the Minister doing to ensure the implementation of the wise use and conservation of wetlands, endorsed by the Government in March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered some of the questions raised by the Deputy in my substantive original reply.  We hope to introduce the amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, before the end of this year.  I also gave details about the order I will make next month to introduce the Directive.</P>
      <P>I agree that when responsibility in this area was transferred to me, there had been a considerable amount of neglect.  I appreciate and share the Deputy's concern.  Peatland covers 17.2 per cent of the State territory, which is under 2 million hectares.  Of that, a considerable amount had been damaged in the absence of a policy.  It is interesting that the National Parks and Wildlife Service estimates that 950,000 hectares of the original 1.2 million have been damaged.  I inherited that situation of no policy and no protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the NHAs to be established on a secure legal basis, the Wildlife Act, 1976, needs to be <Col N="630" /> amended.  It will be amended before the end of the year.  I am also preparing the order to implement the directive later this month.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Deputy to say she finds my reply bland and vague.  We came to this point of destruction of peatlands when Fianna Fáil was in power.  When other parties were in power, no policy or conservation strategy was put in place. As regards compensation, which arises in special areas of conservation, I and my officials met representatives of the farming organisations and have made considerable progress on a range of matters.</P>

      <P>I noted the Minister's belated consultation with the farming organisations as regards NHAs.  There has been prevarication on this issue.  Without the legal framework in place, does the Minister agree that damage to these habitats will continue?  It is important to remind the Minister the latest report on the conservation of peatlands recognises that the last statement on nature conservation since 1987 was made in 1992 by Deputy Noel Treacy.  What has the Minister done since then?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware when I became Minister.  I am aware of the work of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council.  I was a member of a delegation which received the deeds for bogs purchased by the citizens of Holland, at a time when we neglected our bogs.</P>
      <P>I agree with the council, but I also agree that something needs to be done.  Attempts were previously made to establish areas of scientific interest, and this gave rise to a Supreme Court challenge in the absence of a clear legal basis. This is why I am introducing amending legislation to the Wildlife Act, 1976.  This will have a clear legal basis before the end of the year.  It is important not to try to ride two horses at the same time.  A conservation strategy for the peatlands must be negotiated with the agencies involved.  We have consulted state agencies, including Coillte.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service is proactive in its attempts to restore some of the damaged sites.  In projects in the Clara and Raheenmore bogs in County Offaly, an attempt is being made through damming drains to conserve the peatland before it is damaged further.  There is a policy, commitment and timescale in the legislation which contrasts with the widespread and sustained neglect of previous Governments.</P>

      <P>Má tá na réigiúin seo sa chóras oideachais le bunú, tá éileamh a dhéanamh ag na scoileanna Gaeltachta go mbeadh réigiún speisialta ann dóibhsean agus go mbeadh bord faoi leith ann don réigiún sin.  Dúirt an tAire ar an 12 Meitheamh 1996 nach mbunófar bord oideachais ar leith do scoileanna Gaeltachta agus tá sé tar éis an rud céanna a rá inniu.  Is polasaí é sin a ghlacann sé féin leis de réir dealraimh mar tá sé sa Rialtas agus sin an seasamh atá tógtha anois ní amháin ag an Aire Oideachais ach ag an Rialtas ar fad, é féin san áireamh.  Cuireann sé ionadh ar a lán daoine nach bhfuil níos mó suime aige sna deacrachtaí agus sna fadhbanna atá ag scoileanna Gaeltachta agus cur ina luí ar an Rialtas go mba chóir an réigiún agus an bord speisialta seo a bhunú ionas go bhféadfaí na deacrachtaí seo a phlé eatarthu féin agus as sin, <Col N="634" /> leis an Roinn Oideachais.  Más córas nua atá i gceist ag an Rialtas, cé fáth go bhfuil na scoileanna Gaeltachta agus lánghaeilge á bhfágáil amach as?</P>

      <P>Tá an cás pléite agam le mo chomhleacaí ach nílim ag tógaint cúramaí oideachais orm féin.  Taobh amuigh den bhunéileamh sin go mbunófaí réigiún speisialta, bhí mé in ann dul chun cinn ar a lán nithe eile maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tá argóint ann an cóir na scoileanna lánghaeilge a chur i réigiún amháin nó an mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr cúram na Gaeilge a leathadh ar bhonn náisiúnta.  Ar thaobh amháin, tá an dearcadh ann go n-eireodh sórt ghetto as agus ar an dtaobh eile, deir daoine go bhfuil riachtanais speisialta ann agus nach féidir freastal orthu ach taobh istigh de choincheap an réigiúin.</P>
      <P>An tuairim atá agam féin ná gur féidir freastal ar na riachtanais go léir taobh istigh de struchtúr nach dtiocfadh leis an mbunéileamh seo.  Is féidir dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ar an mbonn sin ach caithfimid fanacht ar an reachtaíocht i gcúrsaí oideachais chun na torthaí a fheiceáil.</P>

Nach caitheamh anuas é sin ar an nGaeilge agus ar an obair a ba chóir a bheith ar siúl ag an Aire mar Aire Gaeltachta?

      <P>In June last I approved, in principle, an offer of grant assistance to an absolute maximum of £1.1 million towards the cost of developing the proposed arts centre at Blanchardstown.  This project is still at an early planning stage and since I made the offer of funding, discussions to advance the development of the centre have been ongoing between officials of my Department and representatives of Blanchardstown Arts Centre Committee, to whom the offer of grant assistance was made, and Fingal County Council.  Subject to satisfactory compliance with the terms of the cultural development incentives scheme to enable me to release the funds earmarked for the project, I <Col N="639" /> expect that construction work will commerce in mid-1997.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in the matter and I am anxious to give him as much information as possible, but some aspects of the matter are more appropriate for the Blanchardstown Arts Centre Committee.  The total cost of the project will be £1.640 million.  A total of £1.1 million has been offered by way of grant and 30 per cent is required in matching finance.  This means Blanchardstown Arts Centre Committee must raise £471,428 towards the cost of developing the project.  Green Property Company Limited, the developers of Blanchardstown Shopping Centre where the arts centre will be located, is committed to providing £200,000 and as recently as 23 October the Department received confirmation that Fingal County Council will provide £160,000.  That leaves a balance of £110,000 to be raised in local contributions.  We are awaiting a reply to our communication in August 1966 to Blanchardstown Arts Centre Committee.  That committee and Fingal County Council will have the utmost co-operation from officials in my Department in advancing the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The document referred to is a discussion document entitled &ldquo;Developing a Government Policy on Architecture: A proposed framework and discussion of issues&rdquo; which I launched on 17 September 1996.  The document sets out a proposed policy framework for architecture in its broadest sense, including a specific section on architectural heritage to which the Deputy refers, and raises issues of how to achieve high standards of design and construction, innovation in architecture and sustainable development.  As I stated in the preface to the discussion document, the policy proposals contained in it have not yet been discussed with my Cabinet colleagues, and before bringing specific policy recommendations to Government early next year, it is important to stimulate a wideranging discussion involving the community at large.  I therefore instituted a four month public consultation process and have invited Government Departments, local authorities, professional bodies, interest groups and the general public to submit their observations on the discussion document to the heritage policy division of my Department, not later than 17 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental working group on Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage was published simultaneously with the discussion document referred to in the Deputy's question, and deals comprehensively with the protection of the architectural heritage.  Most of the proposed actions relating to the protection of the architectural heritage contained in section of 2.4.5 of the discussion document on developing a Government policy on architecture referred to by the Deputy are also contained in the interdepartmental working group's report.  Any aspects of the policy proposals contained in section 2.4.5 of the discussion document which are not already specifically dealt with in the working group's report will be considered in the context of consideration of the recommendations of that report and of any observations received on those recommendations.  The report will form the basis for a package of specific legislative, administrative and financial proposals relating to the protection of the architectural heritage which I, with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, intend to bring to Government, following detailed consideration of the report which is currently taking place in both of our Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposal in the discussion document that the Convention on the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe should be ratified, the Government recently authorised me to move a motion in Dáil Éireann approving the terms of that convention, which Ireland signed in 1985.  I will move such a motion in the Dáil shortly and subject to Dáil approval, the <Col N="641" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs will arrange for ratification of the convention.</P>

I appreciate the Deputy's concerns and I will have the matter investigated by my Department. Deputy Quill's Bill drew attention to the need for consistency in relation to interiors as well as exteriors.</P>

Will the Minister ensure that written statements are included during the planning process?  Our architectural heritage is under threat every day.  Some planning officials are endeavouring to stem the tide. Preservation orders and listings carry weight in the written statements, therefore they could help to protect our architectural heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That responsibility lies with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, although I do not say that to take away from the Deputy's proposal.  A proper national inventory would be no good without the support of society. I will examine this issue with the local authorities to see if they can operate in the way suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister tried to cloud what I said.  I said the Heritage Council had put forward certain recommendations and had expressed its concern about setting up a new central authority to draw up a national inventory of architecture.  I want to know if the Minister shares that concern. Does he agree that the establishment of this committee to give advice is another excuse for prevarication?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that what is needed is not further discussion or deliberation, but action and law.  Ireland is losing on average five major houses of historic or architectural importance per year.  Each year we delay enacting law to give them proper protection the more buildings are lost that can never be replaced.</P>
      <P>To illustrate my point I draw the Minister's attention to the destruction in the past month of the historic house in which Tomás Mac Curtáin, the Lord Mayor of Cork was assassinated in 1920. There was no law to protect or prevent its demolition or to require the developer to restore the essential historic features of that house.  That is only one case in point that illustrates the necessity to enact law in this area sooner rather than later.  I ask the Minister to respond to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill's supplementary question has the merit of drawing attention to the fact that not all the great houses were occupied by people with a particular background, but that the concept &ldquo;historic house&rdquo; includes the house of Tomás Mac Curtáin, for whom I have great admiration.  I agree that this is a dangerous situation and I do not want to score any point. The legislation on the protection of such buildings should have been in place long ago.  I will try to ensure that there will not be any undue delay in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Large scale archaeological excavations have been taking place in the medieval core of Dublin City since the early 1960s.  Various recommendations have been <Col N="644" /> made on foot of these excavations, some having specific and some having general relevance. Based on their extensive experience of these excavations, the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service of my Department in conjunction with the National Museum of Ireland, has over the years evolved a policy in relation to the impact of building development on medieval remains.</P>
      <P>The general nature of this approach relates to the positioning of piling layouts, types of piling and nature of impact depending on the form of building foundations.  Other considerations include lifting building and service trenches above archaeological levels, to minimise impact.</P>
      <P>Last March, I also made an announcement in relation to basement development within the urban zones of archaeological potential.  In this, I reaffirmed that it would be the clear and unambiguous policy of the National Monuments Service in the future to oppose planning applications for basements within these zones unless it could be demonstrated that the construction of such basements could be achieved without unacceptable archaeological implications. I added that where it was considered unsuitable planning permissions had been granted, powers under the National Monuments Acts would be invoked.</P>
      <P>The need for archaeological excavations in the inner city has largely emanated from proposed redevelopment projects.  These excavations have greatly enhanced the archaeological knowledge of specific sites and have contributed significantly in developing the perception of a wider view of medieval Dublin.  Further excavations in the future will assist in the continuing development of appropriate strategies to conserve and record the vital archaeological heritage of all our medieval towns and cities.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Will he indicate what proposals, if any, he has to improve public knowledge of and to exhibit some of the findings of medieval Dublin?  Proposals in that regard have been floating for some years, but have not come to fruition.  While building policy has arisen from excavation works to date, has anything been specifically brought to the Minister's attention that warrants special address in relation to the protection of medieval Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy's interest in this area, I have a certain difficulty in relation to his question.  There have been many excavations and if he wishes to correspond with my Department on any aspect of a particular one, I would be delighted to provide such information as I have.</P>
      <P>Regarding his first suggestion, I made the decision in relation to planning because my attention was drawn to a particular site, an Augustinian friary in Temple Bar, of which the Deputy will be aware.  I took action in relation to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> My attention was also drawn to a site adjacent to St. Michael's where there has been vandalism. The National Monuments Service and the National Museum of Ireland have indicated their objections to development on that site.  If there is any further site on which the Deputy wishes to seek information as to whether any section of my Department has indicated a position, I would be delighted to provide the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Will he write to me on matters specifically drawn to his attention on any aspect of medieval Dublin?  Will he respond to my point on the proposals, if any, he has to improve public awareness of and to exhibit excavation findings in medieval Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with the Deputy on his assumption that the greater knowledge there is of our archaeology and history, the better our heritage will be protected in the future.  That comes before the idea that our heritage is an attractive focus of attention for those who come from abroad.  It is important because the more knowledge we have about the matter the better it will be protected.  I had that thinking very much in mind when under the heritage Act the Heritage Council was given responsibility for education in a proactive way.  A great deal of knowledge has been gathered by the National Museum of Ireland.  I will examine those institutions in terms of their plans to make information on this area more available.  If there are aspects of any excavation in the context of the Deputy's general question, I will provide such information as I have.</P>

Will the Taoiseach ensure every effort is made to explain what is being proposed?</P>

      <P>I urge all Members to go out and meet members of the public and talk to them. When canvassing for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in various constituencies I found no ignorance on this subject.  I advise all Deputies of that mind to do so.  Any information the Government can provide in the normal way within the confines of the McKenna judgment will be provided but it cannot engage in anything that would be contrary to that judgment.  On the interim report of the task force on suicide, the Deputy should direct his request for a debate through his party's whip, Deputy Dermot Ahern, but as he has raised the matter in the House I will investigate it.  As he said, it is a matter of serious concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government.&rdquo;  Let me make one thing clear.  What happened in relation to Judge Lynch's removal, at his own request, from the Special Criminal Court should not have happened.  The decision taken by the Government on 1 August should have been implemented immediately.  It was not and we do not yet know why.  The Minister for Justice has instituted an inquiry which is being conducted by two independent, experienced and respected persons, Mr. Sean Cromien, former secretary of the Department of Finance, and Dr. Edmond Molloy, an independent consultant with expertise in the information technology area.  Their report is expected to be with the Minister next Monday, 18 November.</P>
      <P>The findings of this inquiry will be made available to the Dáil.  The Minister has told the Dáil that when the inquiry is complete she will submit herself to more questions on every aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The inquiry team will not just be looking at the raw data on the file, they will be able to seek explanations from anyone, inside or outside the public service, who can throw light on anything in the file or the issues surrounding it.  Where documentary information is incomplete or partial, the inquiry team will be able to ask questions designed to fill in the gaps.  They will also be considering what procedural, administrative or other changes should be made in light of the outcome of the inquiry.  When all that is done and the report is complete, the Minister will answer questions in the House for as long as Members have questions to put.  That is the fair way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, knew that this inquiry was under way; the Minister told them so on Thursday.  They knew the Minister would answer questions here next week when the inquiry was over, but they were not prepared to wait.  They rushed in with their political motion of no confidence on Friday last.  They decided that regardless of any facts the inquiry might disclose they had no confidence in the Minister.  Quite literally, the two Opposition parties are prejudiced on this matter.  They have prejudged the issue before the inquiry is complete.  That literally is what prejudice means.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn put it last week &ldquo;somebody will be blamed&rdquo;, &ldquo;the blame game&rdquo; she called it.  I could not put it better myself.  As far as the two Opposition parties are concerned, it is just that, a game of blame.  I do not think it is a game.  What happened is serious.  It should be seriously examined and it should not be prejudged, as it is by the motion tabled by the Opposition parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I do not know the full facts and reasons that the Government decision of 1 August was not promptly implemented.  Let me repeat that I do not know the full facts.  As the Minister for Justice made repeatedly clear last week, she does not know the full facts either.  She also made clear that she did not want to give out partial information.  She told the Dáil that she would not be doing so because &ldquo;disclosure of partial information could be misleading to the House and possibly leave the propriety of the inquiry procedures open to challenge&rdquo;.  That remains a valid concern.  We need to know not only what happened but when and why it happened.  Only a completed inquiry will enable us to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being criticised and her resignation called for because she did not tell the Dáil about an undated letter from Judge Lynch that had been first drawn to her attention shortly before she came into the Dáil to speak last Thursday.  Because the letter had neither been dated by the sender nor date stamped by the recipient it was not clear to the Minister whether <Col N="650" /> that letter was relevant to an assessment of culpability for the non-implementation of the decision of 1 August.  If the letter had been received before the Government decision of 1 August it would have had no relevance to explaining why the Government decision was not implemented afterwards.  Without a date on the letter, and given that it was no more than a simple inquiry pursuant to an earlier letter, the letter was impossible to situate in any chain of evidence.</P>
    <P>We now know, because Judge Lynch has since told the Minister, that his letter was sent after the Government decision of 1 August and therefore is relevant, along with the two letters from the Attorney General, in establishing the seriousness of the lapse involved in the failure to implement the Government decision in the period after 1 August, but the Minister did not know that when she spoke in the Dáil last week.</P>

      <P>It is wrong to accuse the Minister of wanting to conceal that letter.  If the Minister wanted to conceal from the Dáil that letter or any other matter relevant to this issue, she would not have set up an independent inquiry with full access to all her files and correspondence, all her officials and indeed Mr. Justice Lynch, and anyone else they want to talk to.  If the Minister had any intention in her speech last week of concealing anything she would not, in the same speech, have announced such an unprecedentedly far-reaching, free and independent inquiry and she would not have told the Dáil that she would be coming back with the results of that inquiry to answer questions on it. I am not aware of any inquiry of this kind instituted by any previous Minister of any Department into an administrative failure.  I repeat that I want the facts to come out.  If, to use Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's well chosen phrase, Deputies want to engage in the &ldquo;blame game&rdquo; let them wait until they have the facts.</P>

      <P>I want Deputies to ask questions and have them answered fully, but equally I want Deputies to be just in their judgments and wait for the evidence.  In considering that evidence we need to understand the context.  For this it is necessary to say a few words about the organisation of public administration in Ireland.  The basic legislation is the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;under which the Minister is legally responsible, in a formal way, for all matters relating to his or her Department.  This Act has given us one of the most centralised <Col N="651" /> government systems in the world.  For many years commentators have queried the appropriateness of this legislation, particularly in the circumstances now prevailing in Ireland.  As far back as 1975 William Smyth, a former civil servant, writing in <i>Administration</i> put it like this:</P>
      <P>This model of civil service subordination, and ministerial omniscience, may have had some resemblance of reality up to, say, the mid 19th century... It can have no such reality today.  The truth is that the archaic doctrine of ministerial responsibility covering all actions of civil servants serves to conceal the fact that there is an elaborate system of delegation... Apart from the vast size of Departments, there is the well known fact that Ministers must be away from their Departments a good deal.</P>
      <P>That was written in 1975 and it was true in 1975, but it is even more true in 1996.  It is a matter of fact that a wide gap has grown up over the years between the law and the way public administration works in practice in Ireland on a daily basis.  Professor David Gwynn Morgan wrote as follows in his <i>Constitutional Law of Ireland</i> published in 1985:</P>
      <P>It certainly seems unrealistic and dogmatic to expect a Minister's head to roll because some routine act of administration is badly executed by one of his or her civil servants.  Departments include hundreds of civil servants and it would be artificial to regard one man as responsible for all their activities.  Furthermore resignation offers no gradation of sanctions to deal with different offences of widely varying culpability. Finally, resignation would be impossible in a case in which the responsible Minister had left the Department before the error came to light.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While Ministers in this or previous Governments may not have been punished for the misdeeds of officials, in this Government Ministers, almost uniquely, have been willing to take responsibility for personal errors.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phil Hogan, took responsibility for the premature release of budget information and resigned his position. Deputy Coveney took responsibility for a statement attributed to him which suggested a potential conflict of interest and resigned as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Ministers have taken responsibility by making appropriate personal apologies in circumstances where that has been required.  That is different from the record when the parties opposite were in office, particularly in <Col N="652" /> the period 1987-94.  I have reminded Deputies opposite often enough of an extensive and expensive recent inquiry where no responsibility was accepted by Ministers for anything that went on, for what they did or what their offices did.</P>
      <P>This Government has, in addition to requiring Ministers to be personally accountable where that is appropriate, decided to end the impossible and archaic position created by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  We will shortly publish the text of a public service management Bill which will amend that Act and bring public administration up to date for the 21st century. The new public service management Bill, which the Government wants to see enacted early in the New Year, will provide a legal mechanism which will allow responsibilities and accountability within the Civil Service to be clearly set out and assigned to identifiable individuals.  The responsibilities and accountability of Ministers will also be identified, so also will be the responsibilities and accountability of officials at different levels of administration.</P>
      <P>At the same time the ultimate responsibility of Ministers to Dáil Éireann, as well as their positions as heads of their respective Departments, will be preserved.  Then no longer will responsibility for the implementation of Government decisions be undefined in terms of clear cut delegation and accountability because the basic legal framework for the Civil Service has remained unaltered since 1924.  The enactment of the Public Service Management Bill will be but the latest step this Government will take to improve accountability at all levels.</P>
      <P>Other steps we have taken include the following.  First, Ministers and I have come before this House to deal specifically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have also asked the Minister for Finance to issue shortly to all Government Departments, new guidelines to follow through Government decisions.  I do not minimise the seriousness of the failure to implement a Government decision in this case but this is not the first time in the history of public administration there has been a failure involving a judicial appointment.  I draw your attention to the following.  First, Judge Vivian Lavan was nominated to the High Court in 1982.  It was subsequently discovered there was no vacancy in that court and the nomination had to be withdrawn.  The Minister for Justice at the relevant period was Deputy Seán Doherty.</P>
      <P>Second, Judge Jarlath Ruane was appointed to the District Court in November 1977.  Because of subsequent uncertainty about whether he had the relevant professional practising certificates, he was obliged not to hear cases for five and a half years, even though he was paid a full salary for all those years.  The Minister for Justice at the time of that appointment was Deputy Gerry Collins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Third, Judge Michael Murphy was purportedly appointed to the District Court in 1981.  His appointment was subsequently set aside in the High Court on the grounds that he did not have the requisite statutory qualifications. The Minister for Justice at the time of that appointment was Deputy Gerry Collins.</P>
      <P>These are just three examples, presided over by Fianna Fáil Ministers, of administrative difficulties relating to judicial appointments.  In no case did the relevant Minister resign.  In no case was there an apology to this House.  In no case was there even an opportunity for this House to debate the issue.  Above all, in no case did the relevant Minister institute an inquiry or cause steps to be taken to ensure there would not be a repetition, and, if inquiries had been undertaken at the right time when those three errors were discovered, there would not probably have been a repetition.</P>

      <P>On 2 October, as is now well known, the Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice indicating that he had been in conversation with Judge Harvey Kenny who said there was an impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of the Special Criminal Court.  The Attorney General, in his letter of 2 October, requested the Minister to establish whether the Government decision had been notified to Judge Lynch and the President of the Circuit Court.  At this stage, the Attorney General worked on the assumption that the Government decision had been implemented, that Judge Lynch had been delisted, but that it was simply the case that Judge Harvey Kenny had just not been informed about this.</P>

      <P>It appeared to the Attorney General that it was likely there had been some failure of communications during the legal vacation, which was still proceeding at that time, and that word of the changes had simply not percolated through to Judge Harvey Kenny.  The Attorney General was aware the President of the Circuit Court had been abroad on official business for an extended period during the summer and that judges were generally due to return to work on the 7 October, after he wrote the letter.</P>
      <P>Why did the Attorney General not follow up his letter of 2 October, orally or otherwise?  First, as I indicated, the Attorney General has no responsibility in the matter of implementing Government decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, he had no reason to assume the matter had not been fully put in order before the law term began on the 7 October, either on foot of the original Government decision or on foot of his letter, and that whatever communications difficulty existed had been resolved.  It is relevant to state that Judge Lynch had not sat in the Special Criminal Court at any time between 2 August and 2 October; he had last sat in that court in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the Attorney General conducts a substantial volume of written communication with Ministers and civil servants each month.  In October alone, between formal advices given by <Col N="657" /> the Attorney General, and letters written by him, he had 112 such written communications with Ministers and senior civil servants, apart from the approximately 150 files he would handle in a normal month, and many other advices given by his legal staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the function of the Attorney General, and never has been the function of any Attorney General, to follow up his advices by demanding to know whether they have been acted upon.  The Attorney's function, as with any lawyer, is to give advice or information, but it is for the client to act on it. Nor would it be a sensible use of resources for an extremely busy office such as the Attorney General's to follow up every case where advice or information was given, make 112 phone calls or hold 112 personal conversations per month or follow up a similar number of written communications, apart from the fact that most clients would regard such a procedure as an interference with their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the way professional advisers work, either inside or outside the public service.  Clients, once advised, are normally responsible for action to be taken on foot of advice given by a professional adviser. The Attorney General acts in that capacity <i>vis-ávis</i> the Departments, which are his clients.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are tracking and follow up systems in the Attorney General's office.  They are geared to tracking and following up tasks within the office's competence, which it is the business of the Attorney General's office to perform.  Requests for advice or instructions by the Attorney to his staff, are all followed up as part of this system.  The tracking systems do not cover matters that are appropriately for action by others outside the office.  It is not part of the system to police compliance with his advice or action upon information which he may pass on by persons or agencies outside his office.  This is normal for professional advisers, be they legal, medical or others, inside or outside the public <Col N="658" /> service.  Clients are expected to take responsibility for implementing advice received.</P>
      <P>When the Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice on Friday, 1 November 1996, he did so because of an uncertainty raised by a newspaper report, as to Judge Lynch's status on the court which the Department of Justice would have been in a position to resolve.  That second letter finally brought matters to a head, with results with which we are now familiar.  The House cannot today be given a definitive explanation of where in the administrative system things went wrong because the independent inquiry has not completed its work.  What I have given is an account of the actions taken by the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General. As the motion has been broadened by the Opposition to include, in effect, the Government as a whole, let me now give the reasons for public confidence in this Government.</P>
      <P>As Taoiseach and Leader of the largest party in the Government, I conduct business in an open and honest way with my colleagues, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare.  Of course we have differences on some policy matters.</P>

      <P>Our parties have different origins, different approaches and individual political philosophies.  However, we work well together in Government.  We are implementing an agreed programme, we respect each other's positions and trust one another.  During the past two years we have shown what genuine openness and honesty can accomplish.  Our legislative programme saw the enactment of 36 Bills last year and 33 so far this year.  We have conducted an effective and efficient Presidency of the EU. This has been widely acknowledged by our European partners.  Our economic record is second to none and it is the envy of many countries in Europe and further afield.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in new overseas investment projects, significant increases in real take-home pay in contrast with the stagnation of earlier periods, sustained low inflation, and low interest rates, benefiting investors and mortgage-holders alike.  Mortgage rates are now at their lowest level for 30 years.  We have been able to ease the tax burden on businesses and householders while at the same time make dramatic improvements in our public finances. Our economic performance and our success in following the strategy of responsible public sector management has meant that our qualifications for entry to the third phase of economic and monetary union are now fully accepted by the financial markets. <Col N="659" /> Economic growth has been very high.  GNP growth averaged 7 per cent, twice the rate projected in 1994 when we came into office.  In 1995 growth here was four times the European average.  In 1996 growth is expected to remain high at more than 5 per cent per annum.  Medium-term forecasts suggest a continuation of strong growth throughout the remainder of this decade.</P>
      <P>There has been record employment growth over the past two years since this Government came into office with an increase of 46,000 in 1994 in the numbers at work, measured by the Labour Force Survey, and 57,000 in 1995 alone in just 12 months of this Government.</P>

      <P>That is approximately 1,000 more people at work each week since this Government came to office and since I became Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Our economic success has brought our public finances under control with a Government deficit of less than 2 per cent of GDP and a ratio of debt to GDP moving consistently downwards to a point where our debt/GNP ratio is close to what it was more than 20 years ago.  It has given us much lower interest rates and a strong balance of payments position which underpins our ability to achieve high growth on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>Our economic success has produced a substantial real increase in net disposable income. Policy for the 1995 and 1996 budgets has been focused on reducing the income tax and PRSI burden on employment, particularly for those on low pay who come very low in the Progressive Democrats order of priorities.  These budgets saw personal allowances increased by almost 22 per cent and the standard income tax rate band widened by 22.5 per cent, increases in the allowance and the income tax bands that are more than three times the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under budgets of this Government people with incomes below £9,750 have been exempted from payment of the health and employment training levies.  I know these people would not be a high priority for the new ideologies on the other side of the House but they are a high priority for this Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach paid lip service throughout his speech to his Minister for Justice and reaffirmed his confidence in her.  However, it is a peculiar way to show confidence in a Minister for Justice by taking away more than 50 per cent of her responsibilities in one go.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary to take away a whole core section in one go.  The Opposition put down a motion which gave rise to this two day debate.  The motion stated:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann has no confidence in the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General by reason of their failure to implement a Government decision of major importance which resulted in the Special Criminal Court not being properly constituted between August and November 1996...</P>
      <P>and concluded:</P>
      <P>...that Dáil Éireann condemns the Taoiseach's failure to oversee the proper running of Government and to understand or appreciate the gravity of these errors all of which undermine public confidence in the Institutions of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of justice is the oldest function of Government.  It is its core function, the purpose for which it was originally instituted. Justice is central to any ordered society, especially a democracy.  Confidence in the administration of justice is therefore equivalent to confidence in Government.  How can anyone have confidence in a system where 16 prisoners, <Col N="664" /> charged with serious crimes relating to the security of the State, had to be released and then rearrested because of errors made by the Government?  Those who engage in crime, especially subversive crime, have little enough regard for the institutions of State.  The legal charade last week of release followed by immediate rearrest could send a wrong message, likely to be cynically received, that the administration of justice can be manipulated at will.  The procedure is open to legal challenge.  I gather that a number of applications will now be heard under <i>habeas corpus.</i>  The possibility that prisoners could be released again on a more permanent basis as a consequence of a ministerial error is damaging.  Even Deputy Eric Byrne admitted the Minister would have to resign if one prisoner was set free.</P>
    <P>In a case in 1991, where a judge was allowed to continue to sit because of an official error relating to his date of birth of which the Minister could not reasonably have been aware, the irregularity was fatal to conviction.

From the beginning, the Minister for Justice has given the impression she is not in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one could credibly say that about her predecessors all of whom performed their jobs in difficult circumstances to a high standard.  We have great satisfaction on this side of the House in our last three Ministers and all our Ministers for Justice, including Deputies Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Ray Burke and Gerard Collins.  No one was in any doubt in their time that there was a firm hand in the Department of Justice which had the respect and confidence of colleagues in the <Col N="665" /> ongoing fight against crime in very difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>If something went wrong, it was corrected.  There was no attempt to evade responsibility.  The last Minister for Justice nobly offered to resign if it would have helped save a good Government in the spurious dispute over the absence of a reference in the Taoiseach's speech to the Duggan case, something subsequently established by the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security as irrelevant.  Fianna Fáil Ministers did not need extravagant and unbelievable testimonials from their colleagues and their civil servants.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach, because he refused to mention it, if it is in the public interest to have Deputy Owen, a constantly embattled Minister on issue after issue, in charge of such a sensitive Department as Justice?  What we discuss goes to the heart of the doctrine of democratic accountability.  We are not discussing some minor administrative or technical error although the Government has tried extremely hard to no avail over the last five days to convince the Irish public this error is such.  We are not talking about some technical issue down the line in the Department which no Minister could reasonably be expected to know about.  There are plenty of such issues. We are talking about a matter in the personal charge of the Minister relieving a judge in the Special Criminal Court and appointing another. These decisions were taken at Cabinet at the request of the Minister for Justice.  She had to be familiar with the case as did the Attorney General and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>A decision was published the next day in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 August on foot of a briefing by the Government Press Secretary in an article by Geraldine Kennedy headed &ldquo;Spring to act as Taoiseach while Bruton goes on holidays&rdquo;.  The article also stated &ldquo;the Government also appointed Judge Kevin Haugh... to the Special Criminal Court to replace Mr. Justice Dominic Lynch&rdquo;.  I brought this article to the attention of the Taoiseach in a question about the role of the acting Taoiseach to which he finally replied on 8 October, and it is surprising that on that day it rang no bells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Criminal Court is one of the most important courts, its function is vital to the security of the State, which is the first responsibility of any Minister for Justice.  In a High Court judgment on 19 May 1983, Mr. Justice Barrington made the point that the court was a creature of statute and that the conditions of the statute on which its jurisdiction depended must be vigorously and meticulously observed.  In a Supreme Court judgment in 1990, Mr. Justice Walsh said that the provisions relating to the procedure of the Special Criminal Court must be construed strictly because an accused person was <Col N="666" /> deprived of the constitutional right to trial by jury.  If there have been irregularities before, they were not in the ultra-sensitive Special Criminal Court where particular care is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has a special personal relationship with the Judiciary.  She is present at Áras an Uachtaráin when the President confers appointments on the most senior judges.  Subject to Government decision, it is on the Minister's recommendation that all judicial appointments are made.  Such appointments are brought to Government only after consultation with the Attorney General who is head of the Irish Bar, so he is equally involved.  The Minister is also personally responsible for ensuring that the State's gratitude is expressed for long service in a court such as the Special Criminal Court which is a particularly onerous responsibility.  Yet in this instance three months passed and a letter was still not ready for ministerial signature to notify Mr. Justice Dominic Lynch that he was being relieved as he had requested and at least thanking him for his service.  The Minister clearly forgot to ask about the matter.  A Minister who paid more attention to what was happening in her office might not have so readily forgotten.  The Cabinet Secretariat were able to have the decision published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within eight days.  It has been a time honoured tradition for Ministers to go through decisions with the Secretary of the Department or a senior official.  That has happened down through the years in respect of all kinds of minor, not to mind major, decisions.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Mr. Justice Dominic Lynch was concerned to get clarification about his position, that is why he wrote to the Minister on 10 October.  We now have the terms of that letter which was belatedly brought to the attention of the Minister last Thursday, and read into the record of the House during this debate.  Last Thursday the Minister stated the facts, &ldquo;in so far as they could be established at that stage&rdquo;.  She said she thought it was right that the House should have the facts but she did not think to mention the letter from Mr. Justice Lynch of which she was already aware.  To paraphrase what the Taoiseach said in May 1995, if no one had asked her the question, would we know about it today?  The Minister is clearly guilty of covering up the truth, and the extent of her failure in the matter is now clear to everybody.  Revelation by drip-feed is totally destructive of confidence in Government.  The mere suspicion of such a scenario was sufficient to lead Labour out of Government not just once but twice in November and December 1994.  Where stands the Tánaiste today?  Will the Minister state categorically&mdash; and it would be helpful if she did rather than engaging in more drip-feeding of the information &mdash; whether any court official was in touch with her or her Department about this matter?  If so will she give the time and the circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Minister and her Department are responsible for administering the courts.  There is no autonomous court service in this jurisdiction. <Col N="667" /> Perhaps the Taoiseach was right when he said today that perhaps we now need one, but it has been dragged out of him in the present circumstances, and we will come back to it another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, through her Department, should monitor as a matter of course what is going on in the courts.  It defies belief that a Minister and a Department that administer the courts should still not be ready to officially notify a judge, even after three months, that he has been relieved by his duties by Government decision and is, therefore, no longer eligible to sit in the Special Criminal Court.  One would have thought that one of the first priorities would to ensure that such a decision was communicated immediately, particularly when the court in question is vital to the security of the State.  What has occurred is an appalling lapse in administration and accountability.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's office is also in touch with the courts on a daily basis.  because of its overall responsibility for the representation of the State and the public interest in criminal and civil proceedings.  The programme A Government of Renewal, refers to the Attorney General's office as &ldquo;upholder of the public interest in the courts of justice&rdquo;.  The Attorney General clearly failed to uphold the public interest in this instance.  The matter eventually came to the Attorney General's attention, though only as &ldquo;an impression&rdquo;, and he wrote a letter to the Minister for Justice on 2 October.  Why was there no speedy follow up? Why in view of the importance of the matter, did he let it ride for another month?  When the Attorney General wrote to the Minister on 2 October, was he aware of the serious legal implications?  If not, that was surely a lapse on his part.  If he was, surely the letter should have been followed up immediately by a telephone call or personal conversation on the many occasions that the Attorney General meets the Minister.  As the Minister stated last week, the Attorney General's letter of 2 October requested &ldquo;that I establish whether the Government decision had been notified to Judge Lynch and to the President of the Circuit Court&rdquo;.  The Minister did nothing about the letter which did not receive her personal attention.  How that happened is another matter.  It is not good enough that another month should have elapsed before the Attorney General took any further action.  He knew about it.  If he knew the implications, he is in a very serious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought we had all agreed in this House that it was time to bring the Attorney General's office out of the age of Victorian bureaucracy and equip it with the latest technology to assist swift <Col N="668" /> follow-up correspondence.  We were told in the second report of the Review Group on the Attorney General's office in April 1996 laid before the Dáil: &ldquo;In less than one year there has been a fundamental change.  The culture of information technology is now firmly embedded in the office.&rdquo;  This is obviously not the case.  We were further told that the Attorney General is developing a case and correspondence tracking system, which when fully operative, will enable the Attorney General and senior management to keep sensitive office correspondence and files under continuing review.  It is obviously not working, or working much too slowly.</P>
    <P>On 15 October I asked the Taoiseach whether there was a large backlog of files in the Attorney General's office and whether there were priority cases lagging far behind and running into difficulty.  The Taoiseach replied that any legal adviser had to prioritise his or her work, that he was not aware of any significant backlog and that his impression was that the Office of the Attorney General was working exceptionally well and to a high standard of excellence.  All that confidence has been undermined in the light of what happened.</P>
    <P>It is mind-boggling that the Minister does not have every letter from the Attorney General, the colleague at the Cabinet table closest to her in terms of function, put in front of her immediately as a matter of course.  I do not suppose there would be a huge pile of such letters.  When I was a Minister I insisted that I be immediately shown all letters from the Taoiseach, other Government Departments and senior officers of State.  With my private office I developed a system of tracking such correspondence when it went through the Department for advice and further consideration. The Minister obviously has no such system in operation despite being nearly two years in office. She has had ample opportunity to instruct her private office about what she needs to see and does not need to see immediately.  If the Minister is not interested immediately in seeing letters from the Attorney General she is culpable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>She has no effective system.  She requested and knew of the Cabinet decision but did not implement it.  She did not ensure that she immediately received, as a matter of course, letters from the Attorney General and from a senior judge so she could act on them.  There is not just one letter involved; there are several letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a litany of Fine Gael mishaps with technology in the lifetime of this Government.  Deputy Hogan was sacked for using the fax machine; the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, was demoted for using the telephone; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, used a mobile telephone when he should have been in Dublin Airport.  The Minister for Justice's story is different: she did <Col N="669" /> not telephone or write to the judge to inform him of the Cabinet decision.  The Attorney General did not telephone the Minister to tell her Judge Lynch was still on the bench and nobody rang Judge Lynch to find out when he sent his second letter updating the Minister.</P>
    <P>On 27 October 1994, as can be seen from the Official Report, Vol. 446, Col. 1136, Deputy Owen told the Dáil: &ldquo;Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, a Minister is responsible for everything that happens in his or her Department&rdquo;.  That is the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the controversy in the Brendan Smyth case the parties coming into Government, despite what they said in the Dáil, might have believed the legislation was too rigorous.  The Taoiseach clearly does.  However, the Government has not yet reformed it.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on 23 October when I asked him if the reluctance to act on promised legislation to improve openness, transparency and accountability was part of the Government's general sloth.</P>
      <P>However, even if the legislation had been reformed the Minister would surely remain responsible and accountable for the execution of decisions which she prepared, brought to Cabinet and brought back from Cabinet.  She is also accountable for lack of action on correspondence from the Office of the Attorney General and from Judge Lynch which was addressed to her.  If the Minister and the Attorney General are not accountable for what happened in this case, is there anything for which they are accountable? Does the doctrine of democratic accountability not begin to break down?</P>
      <P>The Minister offers a distinction between accountability and culpability which the Tánaiste dismissed two years ago on 16 November, 1994. He stated: &ldquo;If this House were to accept that a Minister would never be accountable to the Dáil without direct culpability on his or her part, the principle of accountability would wither away. Without accountability the value of a parliamentary democracy would be fatally undermined&rdquo;.  The quote is in the Official Report, Vol. 447, Col. 346.  Does this still stand?  I look forward to hearing from the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>The inquiry set up is a political red herring designed to focus attention on failures within the Civil Service.  What are the terms of reference and do they exclude attaching blame to the Minister?  It is obvious the Minister is more focused on public relations and does not have a hands-on approach to her Department.  An inquiry is not necessary to show that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government always worked within the 1924 Act.  It was hard at times.  It was hard for Fianna Fáil Ministers to take the political hassle but they answered to the Act.  If certain civil servants fail to perform in a particular area <Col N="670" /> their responsibilities can be re-allocated.  That happened many times under Fianna Fáil Ministers.  Ministers are entitled to demand the best service the Civil Service can provide but if civil servants fail they should not be scapegoated. They should not be scapegoated on their failures when Ministers do not make best use of the service provided.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for civil servants in the Department of Justice and for their work in all types of difficulty.  However, I take grave exception to the statement issued by the Association of Higher Civil Servants in the Department.  It was most political.</P>

      <P>This country has a tradition of having a politically neutral public service regardless of who is in Government.  It is unprecedented that a Civil Service organisation would issue effusive public statements in support of a Minister who is likely to be subject to a no confidence motion in the Dáil.  The Government must not corrupt the neutral ethos that has hitherto been the prevailing characteristic of one of the key institutions of the State.</P>

      <P>The Government is responsible for staffing levels.  It allowed public service numbers to rise by more than 1,000 persons since December 1994 and imposed a temporary embargo that has since been lifted.  If the courts division is understaffed it is the Government's fault for not directing both existing and additional resources to where they are most needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's argument appears to be that neither civil servants nor the Minister is to blame but something abstract such as lack of resources to do the job properly.  This makes a nonsense of democratic accountability and the Taoiseach knows it.  He said a great deal about democratic accountability during his many years in the House.  The Taoiseach is answerable in this House for the Attorney General and has leapt to the defence of the Minister for Justice in terms which cast serious doubts on his political judgment.  On 15 November 1994, the Taoiseach asserted that Ministers were legally responsible for decisions of Departments under the Ministers <Col N="671" /> and Secretaries Act and criticised the then Government for alleged &ldquo;evasion of responsibility, by shoving the matter into the hands of officials&rdquo;.  He declared this &ldquo;is not acceptable&rdquo; in the Official Report, Volume 447, Column 39.  What was not acceptable then is apparently acceptable now.  The Taoiseach in Government has changed his mind about everything he said in Opposition or when he held any other office in the State.</P>
    <P>It is obvious this Government came into office with a false prospectus.  Its members said one thing but have now changed their minds.  Most of the promised reforms designed to open up Government and improve openness, transparency and accountability have been reneged on, put on the long finger or are proving ineffective.  The Office of the Attorney General continues to give rise to the same controversy as previously, even though the Taoiseach has issued two reports and claimed many times there are no problems there.  We know there are many problems in that office.</P>
    <P>One of Ireland's senior businessmen privately observed recently that most of the Ministers in this Government, especially Fine Gael Ministers, are inexperienced.  That is why so many of those Ministers, such as Deputies Owen, Lowry and Yates, have been found wanting in recent times.</P>

At last some heat has been brought to bear on drug dealers, not least by fed up communities, but it should have been done much earlier.

One of the curses of this Administration has been the determination of the Tánaiste, with his legal background, and his office, to act as surrogate Minister for Justice, second-guessing all the Minister's proposals.  In the last Government the Tánaiste was more exercised about who would get promotion to the High Court than about other serious issues.  In those crucial days of November two years ago the old Bar network counted more with the Tánaiste, who twice preferred to listen to an Attorney General, of 48 hours standing and then three weeks, standing than to colleagues with whom he had served two years in Government.  His friends at the Bar must have advised the Tánaiste that the extent of the crime problem was being exaggerated.  He vetoed a referendum Bill proposed by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  When the Minister for Justice was away, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairi Quinn, cancelled the plans for extra prison spaces at Castlerea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have had the hepatitis C and BSE issues and this debacle.  While I would not wish to deny that some good work has been done by some Ministers and some Ministers of State, the episode has highlighted the incompetence at the heart of the Government and it is surely time for the Taoiseach and the Government to test the people as we head into the fifth year of this Dáil.

The logo would sum up the Government beautifully &mdash;<Col N="674" /> three bodies holding each other up and trying to conceal the disasters behind the embrace of tatty teamwork.

      <P>We were kind to the Minister today, he has had too many other days.  I want to direct my remarks to the Taoiseach.  The Government claims that the difference is that the parties trust each other and that this trust is keeping them all together.  It is wonderful but it is also arrogant.  What about public trust?  Does it not matter to the Taoiseach?  He talks continually here as he brushes this and that issue aside and he has no interest in the people outside.  He arrogantly defends everything that is indefensible.  He rarely apologises and glosses over everything as if he does not care about the public.  That is his tactic.  As an opinion poll showed in December 1994, the previous Government made up of Fianna Fáil and Labour had created the current economic boom, negotiated the EU funding, had responsibility for the three month peace process and enjoyed a high degree of public trust and support when it was abandoned.  The Taoiseach's argument does not hold up.</P>

      <P>The inquiry that is taking place is for the purpose of deciding how a Minister should have had a proper system in her Department.  It is not an inquiry that is central to the following issues: how a Minister went to the Cabinet and asked for decisions about a judge, got those decisions, went back to her Department and refused to implement those decisions; how an Attorney General wrote a letter on 2 October and the Minister did not deal with it.  It is about how the Attorney General wrote another letter on 1 November and nobody dealt with it.  It is about how the judge concerned wrote a letter on October 10 and nobody dealt with it.  The Minister could have made one mistake, but this House does not need to know what civil servant did what.  We need to know how the Minister was so incompetent on every issue before her.  She has been incompetent and culpable on every issue she has laid her hands on for the last two years and she should resign.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;This is a political crisis, not an administrative one.  Every time there is a political crisis in this House, this Government seeks to blame administrators and turn it into an administrative crisis.  This is a political crisis touching on the integrity and veracity of Ministers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are not my words but those of the Taoiseach speaking here on 30 November 1994 Vol 447 Column 373 of the Official Report.  This evening I propose to judge this Government by no higher a standard than that set by the Government itself for its own term of office.</P>
      <P>It says in the programme for Government that the Government belongs to the people and the relationship between the Government and the people it serves has been damaged by a lack of openness.  It says that relationship must be renewed so that the people have total confidence in government and in a political system which is fully inclusive.  On 17 November 1994, Taoiseach John Bruton, then in Opposition said:</P>
      <P>The lesson is that the truth should not come out in instalments.  The truth, the whole truth should be given on the first day.  Let the cards fall as they will after that.  That is the good lesson for all of us who aspire to high office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach not take an opportunity today to answer some of the questions I posed over the last few days?  Did the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court contact the Department of Justice or any other Department as regards Judge Dominic Lynch's position?  Did a leading defence lawyer contact the Department of Justice and other Government agencies in early October, explaining what had happened in the Special Criminal Court?  Did that defence lawyer telephone last Tuesday and threaten to go public if the matter was not sorted out?  Why will the Taoiseach not publish the letter sent by Judge Lynch to the Minister or the letter sent by the Attorney General to the Minister?  I believe the <Col N="676" /> publication of those letters would throw light on this debate.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach took office on 15 December, he said that the Government must go about its work without excess or extravagance, as transparently as if it were working behind a pane of glass.  Behind that pane of glass there is now a stone wall which has been built and fortified by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa and the Taoiseach, who pledged in the programme for Government to reform our institutions at national and local level so they would provide, service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information.</P>
    <P>This debate is not about the personal integrity or the personal qualities of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who is a woman of the highest integrity.  She is affable and hard-working and none of those qualities is in question.  It is unacceptable to level criticism against her because of her gender.  This debate is about confidence in the Minister for Justice, as the person who holds the most sensitive position in the Government.  The primary duty of Government is to protect its citizens.  If people cannot have confidence in the Minister in charge of that key ministry of Government, they cannot believe the Government is protecting them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to political point scoring.  Would we have a bail referendum on 28 November if the journalist Veronica Guerin had not been murdered?  Would we have a tribunal of inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board if Brigid McCole had not died?  Would we have an independent food inspectorate if Russia had not banned our beef?  Would this Government have promised an independent prison services board if it had not been for the present fiasco? All these crises have led to Government action and without them we would not have had action.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has sought to distract the public. He has spoken about point scoring, opportunism and playing party politics.  He said today we were prejudiced and into the blame game.  These are all colourful terms.  We could make up a dictionary, of which the Taoiseach would be a great author, on how to make little of serious political debate.  The accusations are wearing thin.  There is no excuse for what happened in this instance.  It is incompetent, insensitive and wrong. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to constantly keep running for cover from his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Taoiseach's speech I found it hard to believe he was the same person with whom I worked so closely in Opposition.  The Taoiseach spoke about not understanding the concerns of the poor or the low-paid.  As someone who grew up on a 39 acre farm in Dublin, I know all about poverty and low pay.  I will not take lectures from the Taoiseach about not understanding those on a low income.  The Taoiseach should be careful in the accusations he makes about others.  I want to create the kind of <Col N="677" /> opportunities I had for society.  I want an enterprising and fair society and a system of Government where Ministers take responsibility for their actions.  It is hard to believe that the former champion of Dáil reform is running for cover.  I remind the Taoiseach of the former Premier of Denmark, Poul Schluter, who resigned in January 1993 because he stood by his Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>What are the legal implications of what happened?  There is no more fundamental a court in this country than the Special Criminal Court.  There is no more fundamental an error than the wrong composition of that court.  The implications are serious and the prisoners in question are charged with serious offences, some in relation to the making or possession of explosives, others in relation to the investigation into the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe.  These are not ordinary matters.  The possibility that any of these prisoners could walk free because of Government incompetence is sufficient to demand ministerial accountability and responsibility.  The Government cannot give us an assurance that none of them will walk free because it is a matter for the courts and not the Government.  Deputy Eric Byrne gave conditional support to the Minister for Justice today &mdash; conditional on nobody being let free.  I resent the fact that anyone would seek to put political pressure on the Judiciary by telling them if they make a certain decision the Government will collapse.</P>
    <P>One of the definitive authorities in this area is Mr. Justice O'Higgins, who in a hearing in the case of the State, McDonagh <i>v.</i>  Frawley in the Supreme Court in 1978, ruled:</P>
    <P>In cases where it has not been shown to the satisfaction of the court that the detention is &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo; in the sense indicated, the release of the detained person must be ordered and notwithstanding judicial dicta to the contrary, the order of release may not be coupled with an order of re-arrest.  The protection of personal liberty which Article 40.4. is intended to ensure, would be hollow and ineffectual, if the order of release was not unqualified and unconditional.</P>
    <P>That is a clear judgment.  For this and other reasons, what has happened is extremely serious and cannot be dismissed as a clerical or administrative error.</P>
    <P>Accountablility is not a buzz word.  It goes further than transparency or openness.  It strikes at the heart of our parliamentary democracy and is its cornerstone. The Government, which is the executive arm of the State, is accountable through the Dáil.  The Government must be accountable through its elected representatives.  It is the Opposition's duty in a democracy to be vigilant in ensuring a Government is accountable and the Opposition must be fair and even-handed.  It must not just seek accountability when one set of <Col N="678" /> parties is in Government.  It is not only a matter for the Opposition to ensure accountability.  It is also a matter for the partners in Government who have a duty to ensure that if things are wrong, they are put right.  This is an absolute, not just something which can be chosen.  What happened last night is similar to what emerged in the Duggan case.  At 10.22 a.m. on 16 November 1994 the Labour Party was prepared to go back into office with Fianna Fáil.  Later that day it told us all had changed because the Tánaiste had become aware of the Duggan case.  What annoyed the Tánaiste about the Duggan case is that it had not been brought to the attention of the Dáil a few days earlier.  He said that fundamentally changed everything.</P>
    <P>If the Tánaiste and the Labour Party are to be even-handed and consistent they would have to admit, in fairness, that what happened yesterday evening is the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not as if the Minister for Justice did not get an opportunity to talk about the correspondence from Judge Lynch.  My colleague, Deputy McDowell, asked a supplementary question about her statement that Judge Lynch had reiterated his request to be delisted last July.  There was no reference to an earlier request and Deputy McDowell asked the obvious question: when did he make the first request?  The Minister dealt with Judge Lynch's correspondence on that occasion and it is extraordinary that she failed to mention the letter which came to light last night after the Opposition parties had raised questions.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that responsibility cannot be equated with personal culpability.  In case there is any doubt about this I can quote no greater an authority than the Tánaiste who, on 16 November 1994, stated:</P>
      <P>The key issue throughout this entire episode has been accountability &mdash; the right of the public to secure adequate explanations and the responsibility of the holders of high office to take responsibility for their actions.</P>
      <P>At the outset I have to say that semantic distinctions between responsibility and culpability, however interesting they might be in their own right, do not meet the needs of this case.  If this House were to accept that a Minister would never be accountable to the Dáil without direct culpability on his or her part, the principle of accountability would wither away.  Without accountability the values of parliamentary democracy would be fatally undermined.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>Are we really to believe that a Government or its agents are only accountable in respect of the things they have done and never in respect of the things they should have done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Accountability means that a Minister must take charge, must exert authority over his or her Department, and must avoid doing certain things because they are wrong but must do other things that are required of them.  That is what duty is all about: Ministers must take charge and discharge their duties.  A Minister cannot become a prisoner of his or her staff.</P>
    <P>What was the duty of the Minister in regard to this Government decision?  First, there was a duty to ensure it was implemented; second, there was a duty to ensure the judge and the court became aware of it; third, there was a duty to ensure the Minister saw correspondence from the Attorney General; fourth, there was a duty to ensure she saw correspondence from any member of the Judiciary but, particularly, from a member of the Special Criminal Court and, fifth, there was a duty on her to ensure the Special Criminal Court was properly constituted.</P>
    <P>If we accept that a Minister who &ldquo;does not know&rdquo; is able to get away with it then what we are saying is that a Minister can abdicate his or her duty to this House and the public by simply not knowing.  I wish to quote from an authority on this matter, the late John Kelly.  At footnote 7 on page 123 of the 1983 edition of his book on the Constitution he states:</P>
    <P>The Departments have no legal personality, they are merely organisations with public purposes defined by Statute.  Any legal personality required for those public purposes is to be found in the Ministers in charge of them.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Attorney General has key responsibilities in this case and I am surprised the Taoiseach took the opposite view.  First, as the law officer to the Government, the Attorney General surely has a right to advise the Government if the Special Criminal Court is not properly constituted and, second, as the protector of the public interest, it was his duty to ensure that no citizen went before or was tried by a court which was not properly constituted.  For those two reasons, the Attorney General had a key role to play in this matter.  The Attorney General simply writing a letter is akin to writing a letter to the fire brigade when one's house is on fire.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>In recent days many Ministers said that when the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, found out about the matter she acted quickly.  The same cannot be said of the Attorney General.  Did he tell the Taoiseach?  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, said the first he heard about these events was late Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning.  I presume, therefore, he did not tell the Government.  Why did the Attorney General not speak to the Minister?  Was he not concerned that citizens would be tried before a court which was not properly constituted?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> Of all people, Dermot Gleeson, the Attorney General, could not have been in any doubt about the consequences of this because in 1981 he was one of the counsel involved in the State-Walsh <i>v.</i>  Murphy case in which a person convicted of drunken driving had the conviction quashed on the grounds that the District Justice had not been properly appointed &mdash;<i>Irish Reports, 1981</i>, page 275.  The Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, could have been in no doubt about the legal implications of a judge not being properly appointed or a judge in place who should not have been there.  The constitutional obligations of Ministers and the legal ones under the 1924 Act cannot be abandoned or delegated as they are personal functions for which Ministers must be responsible.  Even if the Government amends the 1924 Act there will never be a situation where an official will be responsible for who sits on the Special Criminal Court or for the appointment of judges; this will always remain the responsibility of Ministers.</P>
    <P>During the early part of the term of office of the Government, the Taoiseach insisted there would be political accountability and the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Phil Hogan, walked the plank in the interests of this ideal.  However, the Taoiseach set a limbo bar of political standards once matters began to affect the Labour Party. The only other time I have sought the resignation of a member of the Government &mdash; and this includes recent events &mdash; was during the case involving the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald.  I did so because I believed the Minister sponsoring the Government's ethics in office legislation was not the appropriate person to write a letter of the kind she wrote to 700 business people seeking support for a fund raising event.  The tone and terms of that letter were in conflict with her position as the sponsoring Minister for a Bill of that kind and I sought her resignation.</P>
    <P>When I heard the Tánaiste's statement last night I thought a chink had appeared in the armour; I thought the Labour Party was heading for the political lifeboat in case the ship went down.  I do not know if that is still the case but I wish to make a point to the Labour Party.  If the Duggan case was so important on 16 November 1994 as to require from Government despite an agreement entered into at 10.22. that morning then what has happened in this case is equally important.  I say to the public sector unions that a shortage of staff or a shortfall in administrative budgets is a completely unacceptable excuse.  The administrative budget for the Department of Justice has increased by 20 per cent since the Minister took office, the staff in the courts section has increased by 40 and the budget has risen by 32 per cent.  I cannot, therefore, accept that there it is a question of a lack of resources or staff in the Department.</P>
    <P>The issues at stake in this case go to the heart of parliamentary democracy.  It is about <Col N="681" /> accountability and responsibility and a Taoiseach in charge of a Government who insists, regardless of who the Minister is and without fear or favour, on the same standards applying across the board. Once trouble hit the Labour Party the Taoiseach abandoned the high standards he had initially set for his Government.  He has made a crucial mistake for which he will pay a very dear price. The Taoiseach was not prepared last week to answer questions in the House about the Attorney General.  He wants to wash his hands and say he has no role in the appointment of judges.  He has no role in the appointment of judges but he had responsibility when he found out about the matter.  However, he failed to take sufficient action.</P>
    <P>The quote from Macbeth: &ldquo;When sorrows come they come not in single file but in a battalion&rdquo; is very appropriate to the situation in which we find ourselves at present.  The Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;tracking&rdquo;, something he and the Government have been doing for a little too long.  It is hard to have confidence in a Government with a Minister for Justice who gets into crisis after crisis and fiasco after fiasco.  On 16 November 1994 the Leader of Democratic Left said: &ldquo;We want to be involved in a Government which does not go from crisis to crisis&rdquo;.  He also said: &ldquo;All too often the Labour Party is prepared to look the other way, to turn a blind eye and to leave unasked questions which need to be put&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has adopted a docile and compliant attitude on virtually every issue of principle to have emerged during the lifetime of this Government.  Whether on hepatitis C, the beef crisis or now in relation to this matter, Democratic Left has adopted a compliant and docile attitude.  It does not ask the hard questions and does not seem to use its critical faculties. Shame on all of them.  They are all responsible for ensuring that accountability is upheld in Government and that our parliamentary democracy, the foundation and cornerstone of which is accountability, is protected.  I believe they have let the people down by not ensuring that it is.</P>

      <P>The failure to inform Mr. Justice Lynch that his membership of the Special Criminal Court had been terminated was one of great seriousness.  Let me make it clear that I fully recognise that I carry political accountability and responsibility for that. The issue now is how that accountability should be carried out.  I came into this House last Thursday, at the earliest available opportunity, to inform Members of circumstances surrounding the need the previous night and early that morning to release a number of prisoners, who were subsequently re-arrested, as a result of a problem with the membership of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is now well aware, this arose because a Government decision dated 1 August <Col N="682" /> 1996 relating to the composition of the court had not been fully implemented.  On Thursday I said that I was giving the facts I had in so far as they could then be established.  I also made it clear that I did not want to give partial information but, most importantly, that I was immediately setting up an independent inquiry so that all the facts could be established and made known to this House.</P>
    <P>I regret the reference to this inquiry being a red herring.

I have told my Department that the independent inquiry will have to investigate all the circumstances, all the papers, all the communications and all the phone calls relating to the non-implementation, in its full force, of the 1 August Government decision to delist Judge Dominic Lynch and put Judge Kevin Haugh in his place.</P>
      <P>I was able to establish beyond any doubt that a letter had been received in my Department, dated 2 July, from Judge Dominic Lynch.  I was able to establish, beyond any doubt, that a letter had been received in my Department on 3 October from the Attorney General, and to establish what had happened to that letter because there were marks on it.  I fully informed the Dáil about both of those letters.</P>
      <P>Any other information which I gave to the House was information about which I had no doubt and also it related to my knowledge of events after I received a letter on 5 November from the Attorney General.  I was conscious in giving this information of being accountable to the Dáil and that the people who had been involved in any of these communications were going to be the subject of the inquiry and they would have to give an account of their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter from Judge Dominic Lynch was brought to my attention shortly before I left my office to come to this House.  This letter was not date-stamped by the Department of Justice nor was it actually dated by the sender when it was received in the Department.  Owing to the fact that there were no markings on it, nobody could tell me in the limited time available when it came in, how it appeared on the file, who had put it on the file and what its status was in relation to the Government decision of 1 August.  The only thing <Col N="683" /> I knew was that I had never seen it before Thursday, 7 November.</P>
    <P>Until I was able to establish if this letter had relevance to the period after 1 August, as the letter could have been received prior to the 1 August decision, I instructed that this letter be part of the inquiry.  In the interests of the inquiry and in the interests of fair play, I could not speak with any certainty about a letter shown to me shortly before I made my Dáil statement last Thursday, a letter whose date was unknown and whose progress through the Department was unknown.</P>
    <P>There may well be more information about which I know nothing which will become evident in the course of this inquiry.  Any such information will be thoroughly investigated by this inquiry which has already started.  Between last Thursday and next Monday when the report is due there may well be rumours, questions or suggestions that I may or may not be able to confirm or deny.</P>
    <P>Since speaking last Thursday I have been able to confirm that a phone call was received some time after 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November by an official in my Department from an official in the DPP's office.  I have also been informed this morning that another staff member received a telephone call last week on Tuesday evening, 5 November from the Special Criminal Court Registrar.  I do not know what other phone calls, if any, were made.  I do not know what conversations took place on those days.  Perhaps more information will come to light about those days or the previous three months which I do not yet know but I can assure this House that I have never failed to be accountable to it.</P>

      <P>On Friday morning, 8 November I telephoned Judge Lynch to express my regret and <Col N="684" /> apology on my own behalf and on the behalf of the Department that his name was now the subject of public controversy and indicated my full support for him as a member of the Judiciary. In the course of that conversation I also apologised to him that his letters had not been acknowledged.  He mentioned his second letter and I indicated to him that it was undated and that I had no idea when that letter was received as I had only seen it the previous afternoon.  He indicated to me that it might have been in early October but that he might be able to check.  The conversation concluded with me reiterating my appreciation of his courtesy to me, or words to that effect.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, at approximately 1.35 p.m., I received in my office a letter from Judge Dominic Lynch referring to our conversation on Friday and indicating to me that he had sent a letter in the afternoon post of 10 October 1996 addressed to me and marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo;.  I sought permission from Judge Lynch yesterday evening to make public the contents of his letter of 2 July, his undated letter of 10 October, as is now known, and his letter of 11 November.</P>
      <P>I will read the contents of those letters.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the House &mdash; and, ultimately, the people &mdash; to arrive at their conclusions but, equally, it is only right that I <Col N="686" /> should ask the House to deal with this matter in a fair and measured way, to wait until all the facts are available and to view them in their proper context.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that as soon as doubt was raised with me through a letter I received from the Attorney General on 5 November 1996, I immediately took action.  As soon as I was informed on Wednesday evening, 6 November, between 10.15 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., I ordered the release of the relevant people and the independent inquiry that I announced in the Dáil last Thursday, 7 November.  The key issues in this inquiry are to establish precisely what happened and &mdash; of great importance &mdash; to recommend whatever steps are necessary to ensure a mistake of this nature and gravity does not occur again.  I must let that inquiry take its course.</P>
      <P>We have heard and, I am sure, will continue to hear of misdeeds and transgressions of my predecessors and former Ministers now on the other side of the House.  For my part, I am determined that the Dáil and the public should get all the facts when they have been fully established.  Surely nobody can seriously argue that setting up an independent inquiry is consistent with an intention to cover up or mislead.  What kind of reasoning process would persuade people they should cover up something in the knowledge that an independent investigation would certainly reveal it?  The departmental files containing all the records on this matter have been handed over to the inquiry team.</P>
      <P>None of my predecessors in the Department of Justice has ever taken such steps to ensure that the facts about a matter on which the Department was at fault were examined thoroughly completely independently of the Department.</P>
      <P>I doubt if any of my predecessors will try to claim this is the first time in its history a serious error has been made by the Department.  I doubt if anybody who has served as a Minister in any Department will claim there is a Department which has never erred.</P>
      <P>Before I came to the Dáil last Thursday, I had arranged to set up an inquiry into these events. This inquiry by Mr. Sean Cromien and Dr. Edmund Molloy has started and I have asked for a report to be submitted to me by Monday next, 18 November.  Natural justice demands that all who had any part to play in the matter are given the fullest opportunity to explain their role in how a Government decision relieving Judge Lynch of his duties on the Special Criminal Court was not conveyed directly to him and he continued to serve in the court.  When this investigation is complete, the Dáil and the people will have an opportunity to make a balanced judgment on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already briefly indicated that I have been able to establish further information since last Thursday.  To be perfectly clear, at about 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday last, 6 November, a principal officer in my Department received a telephone <Col N="687" /> call from the office of the DPP asking for clarification on Judge Lynch's position.  At that stage, the matter had already been under investigation in the Department as a result of my initiative on the previous day, 5 November, when I received a letter from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Media queries during Saturday alerted me to the possible existence of a telephone call or calls from someone to the Department.  I asked for information on this possibility and between approximately 6.30 p.m. to 7.00 p.m.  I was informed about the DPP's call.  A statement was immediately issued by the Department of Justice confirming that a telephone call had been made.</P>
    <P>This morning, Tuesday, 12 November, I was informed that a junior official in the Department also received a telephone call from the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court about the matter on Tuesday evening last, 5 November.  This call also took place subsequent to my intervention on that same day.  I am not aware of any further contacts with the Department on the matter but &mdash; I state this clearly &mdash; there may well be more information as people make their statements to the inquiry.  It will have to be left to the inquiry to ascertain the full facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify the present composition of the Special Criminal Court.  Prior to 1 August of this year there were nine judges on the court.  On 1 August the Government, on my recommendation and at his request, terminated the appointment of Judge Dominic Lynch as a member of that court.  On 1 August also the Government appointed Judge Kevin Haugh as a member of the court.  Judge Haugh was to replace Judge Lynch.  On 6 September the warrant appointing Judge Haugh to the Special Criminal Court was sent to the Dublin County Registrar.  Separately, but in relation to the Special Criminal Court, on 27 August Judge Gerard Buchanan retired from the Bench.  I am advised he still is a member of the Special <Col N="688" /> Criminal Court and the procedures for his replacement are in train.  My Department is in the process of preparing a Government memorandum.  The papers for this new appointment were already in preparation before the events of last week.</P>
      <P>For two years now, I have listened to claims from both parties opposite about how effective they are in opposition dealing with the crime problem.  If by &ldquo;effective&rdquo; they mean attempting to exploit the type of difficulties that arise in criminal justice systems everywhere to their advantage, they may have a point.  Most people, however, would consider it more convincing if they could speak instead about what they did while in Government to deal with the crime problem.</P>
      <P>Many Members have said the Ministry for Justice is a poisoned chalice, a crisis management Department, the bad news Department, the place where one's reputation can only be damaged and never made.  Public criticism goes with the job, not just criticism of the incumbent's job but also of the Department.  It is a fact that in every State the Justice or Home Affairs Ministry constantly deals with matters of utmost seriousness at short notice.  Almost by necessity that Ministry is at the heart of crises.</P>
      <P>The officials of the Department work under extraordinary pressure and I can say from my experience many of them work way above and beyond the call of duty.  I was glad to note that Deputy Ray Burke, who had his experience of crisis in the Justice Department, made exactly the same point on television last Sunday evening.</P>

      <P>In addition to the normal Justice and Home Affairs matters, our Department of Justice has a major role to play in matters relating to Northern Ireland.  In recent years, this role has widened and the workload at a very senior level has increased enormously.  My involvement in the latter, as Deputies will know, has been very substantial.</P>
      <P>I became Minister for Justice on 15 December 1994.  It became apparent to me fairly quickly that there had been little or no root and branch reform of the criminal justice system for many decades.  The system was lurching from one crisis to the next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>My objective has, been, and continues to be, to reform our criminal justice system in all its facets &mdash; to reduce crime, detect <Col N="689" /> a higher percentage of offenders, have the resources to put them away, have laws that have regard for the victim and potential victim and, generally, have the expertise, personnel, technology and management to tackle today's criminal.  This necessary process &mdash; neglected for so long &mdash; is under way.  It is recognised that significant reforming steps have been taken during the past two years with the Garda Síochána, the prisons and the courts.</P>
      <P>The much debated matter of our bail laws had been kicked to touch by many Governments.  We should examine who has been in Government for the past 30 years, since the O'Callaghan case. Within months of becoming Minister I made my view known and now, in just over two weeks, the people will have an opportunity to make the necessary change to our Constitution.  We treasure the right to liberty, but the Government believes we should no longer have the system that prevails &mdash; the most liberal regime in Europe.</P>
      <P>Our prisons have long been under appalling strain.  Between 1989 and 1993 &mdash; a time when both Opposition parties were in Government &mdash; not a single extra prison place was provided.  In 1993, 57 additional places were provided in Mountjoy.  Since then, no extra places were provided until I became Minister for Justice in December 1994 and started a programme of providing phased in extra prison spaces.  In this year alone, an additional 164 extra places will be provided, including the Curragh and Castlerea. This is treble the 57 places provided in the five years before this Government took office.</P>
      <P>By next January construction will have begun on the Castlerea main prison, which will provide 125 places, and shortly after the Mountjoy women's prison, which will provide 60 places. Some 55 extra places will come on stream from a new wing at Limerick prison within a year.  In addition, planning is already under way on a new remand prison at Wheatfield.  This will provide 400 places which are of particular relevance in relation to bail reform.  We cannot rest on our laurels after this work on prison places.  There must be constant reassessment of the requirements.  Otherwise, we will end up back where we were before I came to the job.</P>
      <P>This long-overdue work on our prisons is not the work of this Minister alone.  It has depended on the Minister for Finance making resources available and other Ministers recognising the priority that the fight against crime demands.</P>

      <P>This Government, more than any other, has been prepared to set aside the resources necessary for the ongoing struggle against crime and, thereby, has shown its bona fides on this crucial fight.  It is disgraceful that matters were allowed to drift until I became <Col N="690" /> Minister.  I want to go further with reform. Deputies will be aware that the Government has decided to establish an independent prisons board or agency.  This is long overdue.  In 1985 the Whitaker Report recommended such an agency but nothing happened since then.  I have been advancing work on this agency since taking office and that is why the Government is now ready to announce its establishment.  It is not a panic measure.</P>

      <P>Many times I have outlined my actions in the fight against drugs and I will continue my efforts.</P>
      <P>This Government wants to see lasting improvements in the courts.  During my first year as Minister, I appointed a working group headed by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to take a fresh look at the way the courts operate.  In May 1996 the Government approved an independent courts service in principle and today the Government took a further decision to advance this new service.  I commend Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and the working group for the speed with which they have advanced this work.  Another report is due shortly.</P>
      <P>Revitalisation of the Garda has taken place through regionalisation, additional numbers, new technology, new laws, the proposed aerial wing and extra resources.  This Government has shown it recognises that the problems of crime are not only ones for the Department of Justice.  A budget that focuses on tackling long-term unemployment and social inclusion is an anti-crime budget.  An education policy that works to include all and divert funds to the disadvantaged is an anti-crime education policy.  A health policy that reaches out to inform young people about drugs is an anti-crime health policy.  A housing policy that has humanity is an anti-crime housing policy.</P>
      <P>There have been years of neglect.  I came to the Department with all the energy I could muster to turn around the damage done by years of inertia.  I defy anyone in this House to deny that the most far-reaching reforms in our criminal justice system for years have been undertaken over the past 23 months.</P>

      <P>The fair-minded people to whom we are all responsible will ask some questions at the conclusion of this debate.  Which is more responsible &mdash; for a Minister to quickly bring the truth to public attention through an independent inquiry and to act on the results of the inquiry, or to abandon ship on the basis of politically motivated accusations, thereby abandoning also a programme of reform which is fundamental and crucial to the effective functioning and future development of all of the justice institutions?</P>

      <P>When the Government assembled on 1 August last the agenda was not an ordinary one.  That day it was to deal with a matter of particular constitutional significance &mdash; a request from a judge, who has served this State well both as a member of the Circuit Court and the Special Criminal Court, to be relieved of his duties as a judge of the Special Criminal Court. It was, given his years of distinguished service and <Col N="692" /> his case load in the Circuit Court, a reasonable request.  However, it was more than a mere administrative decision.  It was a decision which, by law, could be made by the Government only.</P>
      <P>Section 39(2) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, provides that each member of a Special Criminal Court shall be appointed and be removable at will by the Government.  The reason the membership of the Special Criminal Court is considered to be sufficiently important to warrant a decision by the Government is to be found in the nature of that court.  It is, by virtue of Article 38.3.1 of the Constitution, entitled to deal only with cases where it may be determined &ldquo;that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order&rdquo;.  On 1 August last the Government met to consider a matter which it knew had consequences for the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in this State.  It is scarcely possible to imagine any Government meeting to deal with a more important matter.</P>
      <P>On 16 May 1974 a distinguished jurist and lawyer, speaking at Trinity College Dublin about the Special Criminal Court, said:</P>
      <P>It is a precondition to the establishment of special courts that the ordinary courts are found to be inadequate.  In other words, their existence testifies to the existence of extraordinary circumstances in this State during a particular period.  It is vital to maintain a strict scrutiny of such circumstances &mdash; which justify departing from the norm &mdash; to analyse the way in which special courts can be introduced to cope with such circumstances, and to keep under constant review the day to day functioning of these special courts.</P>
      <P>The topic of that lecture was considered so serious that the lecturer sought and received the advice and assistance of the then Attorney General, Mr. Declan Costello, Senior Counsel. The lecturer, who was then Reid Professor of Criminal Law, subsequently went on to bring great distinction to this country as a Senior Counsel and now as President.</P>
      <P>I believe the assessment President Robinson made in 1974 was correct.  I, too, believe it is vital to keep under constant review the day to day functioning of the Special Criminal Court.  What President Robinson identified as being vital was not done, in this instance, by the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General, the Taoiseach or any member of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is about the consequences of incompetence and failure and political responsibility or lack of it.  It is a debate about that word, which has suddenly become unfashionable with this Government, &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;.  This is a debate about political accountability on the part of the Minister for Justice for her failure to properly implement a Government decision, on the part of the Attorney <Col N="693" /> General, for his personal failure to act or adequately advise when action and advice was needed and on the part of the Taoiseach as the political master of the Attorney General.  It is a debate about accountability in the context of a decision accepted by everybody involved as having consequences for the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>The individual responsibility of Ministers in Government with regard to their Departments is established by statute, pursuant to Article 28.12 of the Constitution.  The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, as amended, provides that: &ldquo;...every such Minister shall be the responsible head of the Department or Departments under his charge and shall be individually responsible to Dáil Éireann alone for the administration of the Department or Departments of which he is the head.&rdquo; It is of great significance that the Minister is by law held to be individually responsible to Dáil Éireann for the administration of the Department under his control.  It is equally of significance to note where responsibility lies when one Minister is authorised to carry out the functions of another.  Section 11 of the 1924 Act permits delegation of this nature, &ldquo;without relieving such other Minister of his responsibility for the administration of such public service&rdquo;.  It is crystal clear that the law requires a Minister to be responsible for the administration of his or her Department, even in circumstances where some other person performed or neglected to perform the act in question.  In this instance the Minister for Justice acknowledged maladministration in her Department.  I invite her to do no more than obey the law and take the necessary individual responsibility for the administration of her Department.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Government was formed the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance resigned from office because a junior official in his office had prematurely faxed details of the budget to the media.  He did not direct this breach of proper procedures nor did he know of the breach until after it had occurred.  He resigned.  He did so because the law required him to take individual responsibility for the administration of his Department.  Why does the law not apply to the Minister for Justice?  Who granted her immunity from accountability?  The answer, of course, is that the law does apply to the Minister for Justice, but she is not prepared to act in an honourable and accountable fashion. She is prepared to cling grimly to the wreckage in the deluded belief that the Taoiseach did not have his tongue firmly in his cheek when he proclaimed her to be &ldquo;the best Minister for Justice we have had in years&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The people of Ireland cannot take much more success of this nature. What the Tánaiste whispered furtively to <Col N="694" /> journalists in the summer of 1995 is now being spoken openly in the corridors of this building.  It is time to go.  The Minister for Justice has become an embarrassment.  Whatever the opposite to the Midas-touch is, she has it.  Each succeeding month of her ministry has brought new embarrassment.</P>
      <P>Let me add to her embarrassment.  The flagship achievement of the Minister's period in office has been her appointment of new judges.  She has triumphantly proclaimed the slashing of court waiting lists as proof of her competence and capability.  On 1 October 1995 there were 51 murder and rape cases awaiting trial before the Central Criminal Court.  The Minister then announced her initiative.  She appointed new judges and arranged for special sittings last September.  On 1 October 1996 &mdash; after the new judges had been appointed and the special sittings had taken place &mdash; there were 65 cases of murder and rape awaiting trial before the Central Criminal Court.</P>

      <P>The backlog is up by close to 30 per cent &mdash; yet another achievement for the Minister for Justice.  That is what the Minister calls progress.  Who will take responsibility for the increased length of time victims of rape and the families of murder victims have to endure while awaiting trial?  Certainly not the Minister.  She seeks to share in the success of gardaí when they uncover drug caches.  She can be found peering at cameras over bags of white powder.  With hindsight would she not have been better staying in her office and reading her post?</P>
      <P>How much hard earned taxpayers' money did the Minister spend to cultivate the public image she now has?  The litany of disasters over which she has presided since she took office is, to say the least, most impressive.  She started, as she clearly intended to continue, by delaying the introduction of the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 by in excess of 100 days in the immediate aftermath of the Brinks-Allied raid.  At the time the greatest money laundering operation in the history of the State was under way, the Minister failed to sign the necessary order giving those provisions, which had been put in place by Fianna Fáil, the force of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As an encore, she went on the &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; programme and announced an impromptu bail referendum, which was cancelled by the Tánaiste before the Minister could read the laudatory headlines.  Thereafter she presided over the greatest legislative drought the Department of Justice ever experienced.  At a time of escalating crime she failed to introduce a single anti-crime Bill.  This was the era of the ostrich in the Department of Justice.  The Minister's head was firmly in the sand and the <Col N="695" /> official line was that crime was at an acceptable level and no new measures were needed.  So prevalent was the belief among members of the Government that crime was not a problem that they cancelled the prisons building programme put in place by the previous Fianna Fáil-led administration.  The Minister was publicly humiliated by the cancellation of her principal projects in her absence.  The Taoiseach denied she had threatened to resign &mdash; with hindsight it would have been better if she had.</P>
      <P>The Minister then initiated the Paul Daniels phase of her ministry and the report of the Law Reform Commission, which had been sent to the Government in August, mysteriously appeared on the eve of the Dáil debate on the Second Stage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution (No. 1) Bill, 1995 introduced by Fianna Fáil, which provided for a bail referendum.  This, in turn, yielded to the Xerox phase of her administration when she managed to produce and introduce poor quality copies of Bills which had already been published by Fianna Fáil.  This phase was interrupted by the terrible events of last summer which left the Minister bereft of inspiration or direction.  In desperation for guidance she accepted the proceeds of crime Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Even then, three short months ago, few people realised what little grasp the Minister had of her portfolio.  The events of recent days have shown the Minister in her true light.  Not alone is she not in charge of her own Department, she is not even in charge of her own private office.  She enjoys the trappings but not the substance of power.</P>
      <P>However ill-informed the Minister might have been she heaped insult upon injury last Thursday when she came to this House and made a statement in which she made no reference to the letter in early October from Judge Dominic Lynch to her.  When she spoke to this House she knew of that letter and made a deliberate choice not to mention it.  Being a clever Dick may well appeal to the Taoiseach who has pioneered the &ldquo;you did not ask the right question&rdquo; category of disclosure, but it will not appeal to others in this House.  I invite the Minister to do no more than to judge herself by the standards of openness and transparency by which she judges others.  I also invite her to adjudicate her performance by the criteria of openness, transparency and accountability.  The only conclusion to which any honest appraisal can lead is that her performance was unacceptably shabby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may chose to ignore the requirements of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  She may decline to apply the law to herself. She may chose to continue to profess that it is politically acceptable for a Minister not to know what is going on in her private office, but no official made her come to this House and conceal the existence of the letter of early October.  She made that decision herself.  She embarked on the route of half truth and was found out.  If she is not <Col N="696" /> prepared to take responsibility for administrative omissions in her Department, will she at least take responsibility for her own omissions in this House?  It is over, she has to go, decency demands it, but she should not go alone as others are equally to blame.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made an incorrect statement regarding the role of the Attorney General.  He said that clients, once advised, are normally responsible for action to be taken on foot of advice given by a professional adviser and that the Attorney General acts in that capacity <i>vis-ávis</i> Government Departments.  He also said that the Attorney General has no responsibility in the matter of implementing Government decisions. He is wrong, the Constitution gives the Attorney General two separate and distinct legal functions. He is both legal adviser to the Government and guardian of the public interest.  It gives me no pleasure to say that, in this instance, the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, senior counsel has failed to discharge either function adequately.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy, commenting on the role of the Attorney General as guardian of the public interest in the case of Attorney General <i>v.</i>  Hamilton, 1993 Irish Reports, page 266, stated: &ldquo;Independence of function in this context has its duties as well as its rights&rdquo;.  The Attorney General, in his capacity as guardian of the public interest, had a duty to act when he became aware there was an impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of the Special Criminal Court.  He did not discharge that duty when he decided to communicate with the Minister in a manner more suited to estranged pen pals than ordinary human beings.  He had a further duty to act when he received no reply.  He must have been aware of the speed with which the Minister had responded to previous crises.  The Minister waited for over 100 days after the Brink's-Allied raid before she signed the necessary order bringing the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, into law.  He had a duty to follow up on his request for clarification but failed to discharge it.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is well aware that the question of the correct composition of the Special Criminal Court can and has given rise to litigation.  Twice in the past 14 years this issue has come before the High Court and the Supreme Court.  In Gallagher <i>v.</i>  Governor of Portlaoise Prison, High Court, unreported, 27 July 1983, and McGlinchey <i>v.</i>  Governor of Portlaoise Prison, 1988, Irish Reports, unsuccessful challenges were mounted against decisions of the Special Criminal Court on the grounds that it had been improperly constituted.  The Attorney General must have been well aware of the consequences of a person sitting as a judge in a court where he is not entitled to sit as he appeared for the applicant in the leading Irish case of this nature, the State Walshe <i>v.</i>  Murphy, 1981 Irish Reports, page 275.</P>
    <P>To suggest that a request for clarification discharged that duty is dishonest.  There was nothing which needed to be clarified.  The <Col N="697" /> Attorney General was aware that the Government had decided on 1 August to remove Judge Lynch as a judge of the Special Criminal Court.  He was aware since late September of the impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of that court and that if Judge Lynch sat as a member having been removed by the Government it would give rise to legal difficulties.  Despite this he took no effective step to avoid the calamity.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for this error?  The Attorney General is responsible.  He does not have the luxury of being able to seek to hide behind the inadvertence of any group of nameless officials.  He and he alone made the error.  His predecessor as Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan, senior counsel, relinquished his position as President of the High Court over demands that he be held responsible for a delay in dealing with extradition papers which everyone agreed had not been brought to his attention.  He did not know and did not act.  Mr. Gleeson knew and did not act.  Which of them is the more culpable?</P>
    <P>The fine upstanding moralists in the Labour Party went looking for Mr. Whelehan's head. They said it was not personal but that the Attorney General had to be answerable for what happened in his office, even if he did not know what had happened.  On this occasion the Attorney General not alone knew what was done in his office, he personally did it.  The high moral head hunters of the Labour Party have been placed in a dilemma.  They have been forced to choose between principle and preservation and have made the choice most suited to themselves. When the Labour Party has a battle with its conscience, it always abandons it.</P>

      <P>It will be judged by the electorate in the light of the standards it finds acceptable.</P>
      <P>I wish to pose some extremely serious questions to the Minister.  Why did she not get the letter of the Attorney General of 2 October but did get his letter of 1 November?  How did she get the letter of Judge Dominic Lynch of 2 July but did not get his letter of 10 October?  Why will she not immediately publish all the correspondence from the Attorney General about this serious matter?  Will the Minister and the Attorney General tell the House whether they failed to tell the Taoiseach about this serious constitutional crisis throughout October and into November?</P>
      <P>The days of high standards and people like Deputy Gerard Collins are over.  There are unprincipled chameleons in charge of the State who change the rules and principles as they go along.  On 22 November 1994 the Taoiseach said in the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to find the people a Government they will believe in, a Government they can <Col N="698" /> trust and, above all, a Government of truth. Without truth there is no foundation for good government.  Ministers must not conceal the truth from the Dáil nor must they conceal it from each other.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday the Minister concealed the truth from the Dáil, the people's Parliament.  How does the Taoiseach reconcile that with what he said in November 1994?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said:</P>
    <P>This is the correct and appropriate place for those who hold public office and are responsible for decisions of public concern to account for their actions and omissions.  The key issue throughout this entire episode has been accountability, the right of the public to secure adequate explanations and the responsibility of the holders of high office to take responsibility for their actions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, the Attorney General and all others involved in this sordid affair to take responsibility for their actions.  This is no laughing matter, it is a matter which goes to the foundations of the democratic institutions of the State.  If the Minister and the Attorney General stay in office, let us abandon all pretence of parliamentary accountability.  It appears that with this Government what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  Is it too much to ask it to enforce openness, transparency and accountability which it trumpeted to the people prior to coming to office?</P>

      <P>The Government has the full confidence and support of the House.  In the past two years it has made significant progress in the economy and areas of social policy, including education, health and crime prevention.  It has been a busy two years of solid work and achievement.</P>
      <P>I add my support and backing to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, a friend and ally in Government.  She has been a supportive member of Government and shown an interest in and commitment to all areas of Government policy, including my own work in the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The Minister inherited a serious and escalating crime problem.  With the active co-operation of her colleagues in Government, she has tackled it effectively.  I have had the opportunity to work with her on the anti-drugs task force.  As a result of this work and co-operation, I will be in a position shortly to launch a major new anti-drugs campaign targeted at all primary schools.  Co-operation and participation of the wider school communities will be the key to the programme's successful implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> The Minister has faced this difficult challenge in her usual honest and fortright way.  She has admitted publicly that the systems of communication in her Department have failed and has responded swiftly by setting up an independent inquiry into the sequence of events surrounding the Government decision to remove Judge Lynch, at his own request, from the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>This House will have to wait for the inquiry to be completed, until all the relevant information becomes available.  It would be unwise of Members to rush to judgment before seeing all the relevant facts, which will be put before the House.  The Minister in her statement last week committed herself to returning to the House on completion of the inquiry and she is prepared to respond to further questions on every aspect of the matter.  I welcome the major changes announced by the Taoiseach today on how our courts and prisons are to be administered.</P>
    <P>I can assert to this House absolute confidence in the Government, which has truly been a Government of renewal.  Two years ago the Government made commitments to the people on reform, progress, targeting the employment needs of all our people and enhancing our social and economic life.  Our policies were outlined in the policy agreement, a Government of Renewal, an agreement between Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  We have focused on these policies, have worked for them and have achieved significant progress in the past two years.</P>
    <P>As Minister charged with implementing the educational provisions of the programme, A Government of Renewal, I am ever more conscious that education has a central role to play in improving the life chances of young people today.  Our education system is a success.  It is the key to a dynamic economy.  It is essential for increased employment and is needed for the holistic development of our young people.</P>
    <P>Our policies are succeeding.  Students staying on to leaving certificate represent more than 80 per cent, well on target for 90 per cent by the year 2000.  Thousands of additional students have gone on to third level studies, a progress which is assisted by the dramatic abolition of fees by the Government, a policy objective which was stated by previous Governments but achieved by this one.  We have reformed the curriculum at first and second levels.  We have developed new courses at leaving certificate to meet the needs of a growing and dynamic economy.  The leaving certificate applied programme is flourishing and the leaving certificate vocational programme has been improved and expanded.  In the traditional leaving certificate we are engaged in steady reform of each subject to meet the needs of today.</P>
    <P>The financial and fiscal policies which have been developed by my colleague the Minister for <Col N="700" /> Finance, Deputy Quinn, have led to a declining debt burden, low inflation, low interest rates and a range of tax incentives to encourage employment.  My colleagues in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputies Richard Bruton and Rabbitte, have promoted new business, provided retraining and operated dynamic and successful programmes to increase employment.  The success or failure of these policies depends on a highly skilled, flexible and adaptable workforce ready to respond to changes throughout their lives.  It depends on high skills being available to all.  It depends on the investment which we, as a people, make in education.</P>
    <P>The facts are striking.  The OECD calculates that in 1992, 70 per cent of the unemployed had left school before completion of the senior cycle. On the other hand, the World Competitiveness Report, 1995, shows that of 48 countries surveyed Ireland's education system ranks second, after Singapore, in meeting the needs of a competitive economy.  In the past two years the Government has sustained a planned and targeted investment in our greatest resource, our people.  Investment in education has increased by more than £100 million in the lifetime of this Government.  This investment has been targeted wisely and well throughout our education system, at primary level, second level, third level and in adult and continuing education to promote lifelong learning.</P>
    <P>At primary level we increased the capitation grant last year and again this year.  We targeted capitation support on disadvantaged schools.  We expanded the Early Start project to give a good foundation to a child's education, to help prevent early drop out from school, combat school failure, enhance later employment prospects and improve life chances.  Recently I launched a programme called &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage&rdquo;. Thirty-three urban schools and 118 rural schools will be involved in the programme.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in urban schools will be 15 pupils to one.  This is a dramatic change.  The research presented to me by the Combat Poverty Agency of the Education Research Centre proved that unless the pupil-teacher ratio was as low as 15:1 no real change would take place.  This is for the long haul, to enable children to stay at school longer and enhance their life chances by preventing them becoming the new long-term unemployed.  These 33 schools will receive increased grants for projects and equipment and there will be special in-service training for all the teachers involved.  The effects of these new plans will be carefully evaluated.  The schools are being invited to develop a five year plan so that there will be real innovative and dynamic teaching and learning in these schools.  Rural schools will be in clusters of 25 and each cluster will have a specially trained co-ordinator of the project.</P>
    <P>Both Early Start and Breaking the Cycle will rely heavily on partnerships between home and school.  The reason I have increased the number <Col N="701" /> of home-school links teachers is to help this partnership.  Parents are now part of the life of every primary school and when the Education Bill is introduced parents will have statutory rights in the development of the curriculum and management of the schools.</P>
    <P>At second level we increased capitation grants last year and again this year.  We launched a huge in-career development programme so that teachers can respond to the challenge of change. We have enormously expanded the number of students who take the transition year, a year which ensures they are better prepared for work and life.  Major developments are under way in the second level curriculum.  Revised syllabuses are being introduced in phases and in-career training and development for teachers of each subject is taking place.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate applied programme, a two-year programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working life, has been introduced in 130 schools for more than 3,000 pupils this year and will expand next year.  A restructured leaving certificate vocational programme with a strong vocational dimension is being introduced on a phased basis.  This year 11,000 students will avail of the leaving certificate vocational programme. In addition, more than 550 schools will offer the transition year to 28,000 students this year.  Civics, social and political education will commence in 300 schools this September and will be part of the core curriculum.  Relationships and sexuality education is being developed and an agreed school policy and suitable programme will be in place in all schools during the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    <P>At third level, 1996 is the historic year when full time undergraduates will no longer have to pay tuition fees.  It is the year when students maintenance grants have again been increased by double the rate of inflation and when the hardship fund for third level students continues to be available to help students overcome obstacles to continue in their studies.</P>
    <P>This Government has also recognised education as a vital echelon in improving employment prospects throughout a person's life. This Government has provided for additional resources for adult education, the vocational training opportunities scheme and Youthreach places.  This Government has targeted resources on adult literacy and on second chance education for disadvantaged adults.</P>
    <P>This record of achievement is in stark contrast to the lack of policy, direction and focus on educational issues which we see on the Opposition benches.  Fianna Fáil promises much but fails to deliver.  Fianna Fáil promised free third level education in 1992 but this Government delivered it.  Fianna Fáil promised a White Paper on Education but this Government delivered it. Fianna Fáil promised education legislation but this Government will deliver it.</P>
    <P>The lack of coherent policy from Opposition speakers is matched only by their lack of <Col N="702" /> commitment to education when they held the responsibility for it.  Fianna Fáil is the party which froze capitation grants for schools, savagely cut investment in school buildings and signally failed to deliver on in-career training for teachers. Today, Fianna Fáil is the party committed to every issue but it delivers on none.</P>
    <P>This Government delivers.  This Government has policies and is committed to education reform.  Our education, employment and economic policies are bearing fruit.  The economy is growing strongly in 1996.  Strong retail sales growth, buoyant construction activity and the strong trend in tax receipts support this view. Gross National Product will grow by at least 6 per cent this year, personal consumption expenditure will increase by about 5 per cent and investment will record a further substantial increase which is expected to be about 9.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Most importantly of all, the policies of this Government are translating into growth in employment.  This year the number of people at work will be almost 1.3 million.  The number of new jobs created this year will be around 50,000. Contrast this with the 6,000 jobs created as recently as 1992.</P>
    <P>The success of this Government in education, enterprise and finance has been reflected in other social areas, such as health, social welfare, the reform of legislation, growth of the arts, planning of the environment, attracting visitors to Ireland as a tourist destination and in promoting and safeguarding the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>This has been reflected in the contribution made by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, to creating a society where justice is done and seen to be done.  The citizen can rely on the law and the vulnerable in society are protected from attack and crime.  Deputy Nora Owen has introduced more reforms to the justice system than any Minister in recent times. She has worked incessantly on a comprehensive package of measures to ensure that the twin evils of lawlessness and drug abuse are combated at every level.  With the full support of her colleagues in Government, she has progressed an unprecedented range of measures to ensure the safety of all citizens.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the record of this Government. I stand over my record in implementing the education commitments of the programme for renewal and I stand over the record of each and every member of this Government which has provided strong, united and confident leadership to the people over the last two years.  I commend this motion of confidence to the House.</P>

      <P>The ability of Deputies on all sides of this House to live in a world of their own never ceases to amaze me.  This unique common denominator manifests itself greatly when one is in Government.  I do not for a moment suggest that Fianna Fáil or I have not been subject to this phenomena in our time but this bubble of government in which we live means that we seem <Col N="703" /> to lose all consciousness of what goes on in the outside world, what ordinary people think about and how they assess things.</P>
      <P>This phenomena is exacerbated on many occasions by politicians meeting the same media people day in day out in the same hothouse atmosphere of Dáil Éireann.  We end up speaking to each other and we think that is where the world begins and ends.  This is particularly true when one is in Government because one is cocooned to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>An example of that today, if one needed an example, is that someone must have come to the Taoiseach with the idea this would be a wonderful occasion on which to announce some changes relating to the Department of Justice.  It is not that some of these commitments should not have been announced at some date or that they should have been brought forward by many Governments, but somebody came up with the idea that this would be a great way to announce them because it would take the heat off the Minister.  That same genius thought it would be a great idea to announce the Taoiseach's third recommendation, where he has given my former colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, responsibility for tracking ministerial correspondence, during this motion of confidence proves beyond all else that we live in such a cocoon.  I am sure Deputies, and particularly Government Deputies, believe this was a wonderful idea and that this is the way we should progress.</P>
      <P>The same can be said about the inquiry announced by the Minister last week.  It is not that the people charged with the inquiry will not do a good job but they will do a job relating to administration because there lies their expertise. Irrespective of the outcome, the inquiry cannot relieve the Minister of her responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am often amazed at how little people think of politicians.  One of the reasons for this is we all say one thing when we are in Opposition and do exactly the opposite in Government.  Is it any wonder the public is so cynical.  We have all been equally guilty of this malaise over a long period of years.</P>
      <P>Other speakers to this motion will refer to many fine quotations from debates in this House in the dying months of 1994.  The people who said those things in 1994 are now in Government saying the opposite.  We will wonder in a few months time why people are cynical and think so little of politicians.</P>
      <P>I can think of no finer travelling companion and friend than the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen.  She is affable, good-humoured and undoubtedly hardworking but her job is Minister for Justice and not friend of mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister's conduct of her office in this particular matter <Col N="704" /> leaves much to be desired.  She said a number of things during the course of her address last Thursday but it is quite obvious from her speech that there were some changes.  She stated yesterday that Judge Dominic Lynch had subsequently written a letter to which she did not refer on Thursday last because it was not dated. From reading the letter, outlined earlier by the Minister, it is obvious that it was written after 2 July because the judge refers to his letter of that date.  One would not need to be Einstein or Sherlock Holmes to realise that the undated letter was received after 2 July.  Last Thursday the Minister also gave the impression that action was taken by the Department of Justice as a result of a letter received from the Attorney General, dated Friday, 1 November, which was not received, for some miraculous reason, until Tuesday, 5 November.</P>
      <P>I understand that in late September an eminent senior counsel learnt that Judge Lynch had been removed from the Special Criminal Court but was still sitting as a member of that court.  The individual in question contacted the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General in early October.  I also believe that on Tuesday, 5 November, the same eminent senior counsel again contacted the Department of Justice and threatened to go public unless action was taken. He also contacted the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Deputy Harney and others have inquired whether this occurred but a reply has not been forthcoming.  The eminent counsel to whom I referred is Mr. Barry White, a very well known defence attorney, who contacted the Department of Justice and the DPP on the occasions to which I referred.  It was only when Mr. White contacted the Department last week and stated that he intended to go public on the matter that action was taken.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that an assistant secretary not in the courts division dealt with the matter on Wednesday last.  When did the DPP contact the Department of Justice and why did the Minister not refer to such contact on Thursday last?  I must inform the Minister that, during the past number of weeks, this matter was discussed by officials in her Department.  Questions were posed as to what action should be taken.  I am not connected to the Department of Justice but those events occurred.  The Minister indicated that the registrar of the Special Criminal Court was in contact with the Department of Justice a number of weeks ago.  However, this information was not provided on Thursday last.  Why was an Assistant Secretary not in the courts division responsible for raising the alarm and taking action?  This action did not, as the Minister implied in her speech last Thursday, result from telephone calls she made on Tuesday on foot of the letter she received from the Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Special Criminal Court and correspondence received by the Minister, I know of no other Minister who would treat, as this <Col N="705" /> Minister has done, correspondence received from the Attorney General in such a flippant manner. In any Department in which I served, letters from the Attorney General or the Taoiseach are brought to the Minister's immediate attention.  If one were on top of a mountain in the Himalayas, the private secretary would bring such a letter to one's attention by telephone or fax message. While in Government I visited many parts of the world on trade missions and any correspondence from the Attorney General or the Taoiseach was related to me immediately.  The term of office of this Minister for Justice must be the first occasion on which such action was not taken.</P>
    <P>This matter does not merely involve Mr. Joe Smith corresponding with the Minister to discover what action she intends to take regarding a parking fine, for example.  What impression is given if communications between the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice are not dealt with?  Are we to believe that correspondence from the Taoiseach or the Attorney General arrives in the Department of Justice and is put aside until someone is free to deal with it?  That is not the way that things are done, as anyone who has served in Government is aware.  I suggest that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, does not deal with correspondence from the Attorney General or the Taoiseach in that fashion.  I know of no Minister whose Department deals with correspondence in such a manner.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to believe many things, some of which I can accept.  I am willing to accept that, by 2 October, the decision of 1 August may not have impinged on anyone.  I believe the letter of 2 October, which stated it had come to the Attorney General's notice that perhaps Justice Lynch had not been removed as a member of the Special Criminal Court, was legitimate.  However, I am being further asked to believe, as is implied, that the Attorney General does not know the law. I have known the Attorney General on a personal basis for a long period.  If I were faced with going to trial on a charge of murder, I would choose the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, to defend me because I could rely on his knowledge of the law.  Am I expected to believe that he does not know the law or that an improperly constituted court is not a serious matter?</P>
    <P>This matter was dealt with during the past ten years.  As a result of difficulties relating to a judge's age, the Government of the day had to introduce legislation to validate the decisions made by the district justice in question.  At least two cases over which he presided were appealed to the Supreme Court which held that it was an inadvertent error and administrative difficulties had occurred.  Notwithstanding that the Legislature, on behalf of the people, had legislated to validate the judge's decision, the Supreme Court held that the decisions reached in the two cases were invalid.  That illustrates the importance the court attached to the Article in <Col N="706" /> the Constitution which states that courts must be properly constituted.  Am I expected to believe that the Attorney General was not aware of this fact?</P>
    <P>Having accepted that, am I expected to believe that on Friday, 5 November, the Attorney General again wrote to the Minister for Justice to inform her that there would be legal difficulties if Judge Lynch remained a member of the Special Criminal Court?  Am I further expected to believe that, because of the seriousness of the matter, he did not immediately telephone the Department of Justice to ensure that action was taken?  For some reason, I am expected to believe that the letter did not reach the Department until the following Tuesday.  When I served in Government, letters from other Ministers were delivered to my office by courier.  However, I am now expected to believe that the Minister for Justice did not receive the Attorney General's letter until Tuesday and there was no follow up. I am also expected to believe that on 10 October Judge Lynch sent a letter to the Minister for Justice which was not dated and not date stamped.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I wish to inform the Minister for Justice about dated and undated letters received by Departments.  Civil servants have a notorious habit of stapling letters to envelopes.  This is done in some Departments with all letters, whether dated or not.  It is done in every Department in the case of undated letters. However, I am now expected to believe that this does not occur in the Department of Justice and the letter in question only came to the Minister's attention before she entered the Dáil on Thursday last.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to Ministers for many difficulties in which they find themselves, but my credibility is being stretched to its very limit.  I am further being asked to believe that the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, despite the fact that they should be the closest members in the Government, and notwithstanding the fact that they travel weekly to Belfast, do not speak to each other about these particular matters which involve doubts about the composition of the most delicate court in the land, the Special Criminal Court.  I find that very difficult to understand.  I am prepared to make allowances for certain difficulties that may occur in any Department but it is impossible to believe that this succession of errors occurred and nothing was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a defining moment not only in the history of this Government; the people will decide on these and other matters regardless of whether we shout here all day and all night.  They will make their decision on Minister Owen, Deputy McDowell and the rest of us in their own good time.  I am prepared to wait until that time, be it next week or next month, because these <Col N="707" /> matters will affect people's judgment when they make their decision.  If on this particular issue, however, a Minister, the Taoiseach or the Attorney General is not held responsible and does not suffer the consequences, a Minister in any Government will never again feel obliged to resign.  If this occasion passes without somebody taking the blame, a Minister should not be asked by this House in the future to resign.</P>
    <P>I cannot envisage any circumstances under which a Minister would feel obliged to resign because the doctrine now being expounded by the Government is what I refer to as the BOG or the Bruton-Owen-Gleeson principle of resignation. The new principle, which will be established if nobody resigns, will read as follows: A Minister is not obliged to resign under the BOG principle because one is not to blame when one does not know; one is not to blame when one does know; one is not responsible for any actions of one's Department at any level; all communications are to be ignored notwithstanding the importance of the contents or the status of the writer; and all modern communications technology is hereby ignored.  Those are the principles we will be establishing if somebody does not resign over this matter.</P>
    <P>I put this question to the Labour and Democratic Left Members, particularly the Labour Members, and to commentators outside the House: are there to be two standards by which political parties are judged?  Will one set of criteria be applied to members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seeks to inflate an admittedly serious chain of administrative errors or omissions into an attack on the cohesion of the Government and its three most principled members.  I would like to dispose of the fiction <Col N="708" /> that the Taoiseach or the Attorney General have any direct role in the implementation of a Government decision to delist Judge Lynch as a member of the Special Criminal Court.  Any member of the Opposition parties who has been in Government and any member of those parties who aspires ever to be in Government knows that neither the Taoiseach nor the Attorney General has any functional responsibility in this matter. If they doubt this I refer the Opposition to the Government Procedure Instructions or to any of the major academic texts on the governance of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It would be ludicrous to expect the Taoiseach to supervise personally the implementation of every Government decision.  If he tried to do so it would be an utterly inefficient use of his time. Is the Attorney General then to be pilloried for stepping outside his formal responsibilities to exercise his sense of collegiality in seeking to alert a Government colleague to a possible sin of omission by her Department?</P>

      <P>I want to cite briefly Minister Owen's record as a member of this Government.  A wide range of measures to tackle crime and speed up the administration of justice have been set in train.  We have more judges at each level of the system, extended sittings in the courts, more efficient use of Garda time and, perhaps most fundamentally, the establishment of the Working Group on the Courts Commission which is involved in a radical overhaul of the operation of the courts.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau operates effectively against organised crime and a major programme of prison building is under way which will involve the provision of approximately 800 extra places.  This is an unprecedented increase of about one third of the existing accommodation. In the further development of the Government's initiatives in the area of justice, an independent board, the Courts Service, will be set up on a statutory basis with the task of managing a unified court system.  In addition, responsibility for the prison service will be transferred from the Department of Justice to an independent, permanent statutory body.</P>
      <P>The Opposition parties should be reminded that the bail referendum, for which Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell have been clamouring, will take place in a fortnight's time. However, instead of supporting the Minister concerned and securing passage of the bail reform amendment, the Opposition is focusing on game playing with a decidedly misogynist tinge.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the debate on the Minister's notional shortcomings has been underscored by an implicit inference that the job of Minister for Justice is not for a woman.  I remind the Opposition that this woman is intent on resolving the bitter and bloody-minded dispute between rival Garda representative organisations, a complex and difficult task for any Minister for Justice in any Administration.</P>

When the Government took its decision to delist Mr. <Col N="710" /> Justice Lynch on 1 August of this year, in line with his request, the Minister had every right to expect that a straightforward administrative decision would have been routinely implemented by her Department.  This was not done.  On three successive occasions the non-implementation of the decision was brought to the attention of the Department, in two letters to the Minister sent by the Attorney General on 2 October and 1 November and in a letter by Mr. Justice Lynch on 10 October, as now established.  It was only the third of those letters, the one from the Attorney General on 1 November, which was shown to the Minister on its receipt on 5 November.</P>

      <P>I do not seek to minimise the seriousness of what did or did not take place. The consequences of the inaction on this issue are potentially serious and not entirely certain at this juncture.  It is inexplicable to me why no action &mdash; uncomplicated, routine action &mdash; was taken on three occasions, i.e. the initial receipt of the Government decision and the subsequent October letters of the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Lynch, when the receipt of any one of these items of correspondence should have triggered such action.  I believe it would be utterly unfair and contrary to natural justice to seek to scapegoat the Minister for Justice for a series of omissions or errors with which she had no involvement.  Neither do I want to see an official or officials of the Department scapegoated.</P>

      <P>One of the key aspects of the matter before the House and under investigation by Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy is the apparent failure by a section in a Government Department to pass on, or act upon, a communication from the office of the Attorney General.  It is on that aspect, the failure to pass on a communication from the office of the Attorney General, that I invite the House to focus for a few moments.</P>
      <P>The most remarkable and outstanding instance in recent times of an important communication from an Attorney General not being passed on to the appropriate person did not occur in the courts section in the Department of Justice, the Minister's private office in the Department of Justice or in the privacy of some Government office.  It occurred in the view of those who had eyes to see and in the presence of a large number of those present at this debate and most who sat here earlier this afternoon.  It is a matter upon which a number of people in this House can give first hand evidence and one of them has recently given sworn evidence of it in another jurisdiction. It occurred down on the Front Bench in November 1994.  The intended recipient of a vital and important communication from the Attorney General was Deputy Albert Reynolds, the then Taoiseach, and the person who failed to pass on the communication from the then Attorney General was the then Minister for Finance, now leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to discuss attitudes towards not <Col N="713" /> passing on an important communication from the Attorney General, then we have in our midst&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;someone who can speak absolutely first hand of the reasons for not passing on a communication from the Attorney General.  For some strange and unaccountable reason, Deputy Ahern, normally very generous in this way, failed to share this experience with us this afternoon.</P>
      <P>There remains an area of uncertainty among many Members of this House and among members of Fianna Fáil about the reasons for Deputy Ahern making that decision not to pass on the communication.  We all have our opinions about it and we may or may not be right.  It is an area of speculation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds had his day in court recently and gave his version of this event on oath.  I read from a report of the court proceedings:</P>
      <P>Mr Reynolds told the jury that he had not received a letter from the then new Attorney General, Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, concerning the Duggan case until after he had made his crucial speech to the Dáil about the handling of Smyth's extradition.  In retrospect, he found the letter had been sent to the Dáil by staff from the AG's office and had been passed through a number of hands before arriving in his ministerial colleague's bundle of files.</P>
      <P>`It never got to me', he said.</P>
      <P>`Who was the ministerial colleague?', asked Lord Williams.</P>
      <P>`Bertie Ahern', replied Mr Reynolds.</P>
      <P>`Your successor?', asked Lord Williams.  Mr Reynolds said he was.' , And he did not pass it on to you?', continued Lord Williams.</P>
      <P>`No', replied Mr Reynolds.  `I hit the ceiling', he said, when he found it on his desk later the evening.</P>
      <P>This is an interesting reflection and it is a pity Deputy Ahern did not share his experience of that with us this afternoon because we might have found it enlightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many parallels have been drawn this afternoon but some are not accurate.  This confidence debate is utterly unlike the one that took place here two years ago when the Labour Party found Fianna Fáil to be totally untrustworthy &mdash; we will not go into the history of that, the locked doors in Government Buildings and so on.  Four years ago the Progressive Democrats told us that they had lost all trust in Fianna Fáil.  We remember the saga of evidence given to the beef tribunal and the descriptions that Deputies Reynolds and O'Malley used when describing each other inside and outside the House.  The Progressive Democrats concluded that they had lost all trust in Fianna Fáil.  I am bound to wonder, Sir, as many other Members of the House will, what <Col N="714" /> starry-eyed innocent optimists the Progressive Democrats must be to be making eyes at Fianna Fáil again today as we have seen.  I do not know how they can do it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is still reeling in shock.  We have seen in Fianna Fáil, time after time and speaker after speaker, evidence of post-traumatic stress syndrome.  They cannot get behind the fact that nobody trusts them anymore.  They do not even trust themselves.  What is happening on the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil?  I never saw a man in this House who looked less like a Leader of the Opposition engaging in a confidence debate where he thought he had some ground than Deputy Ahern today.  He looked the most depressed man I have ever seen here.  A few minutes ago Deputy McCreevy admitted that he does not expect any outcome from the huffing and puffing in which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have engaged this afternoon.</P>

      <P>That does not suit them.  They do not want information or facts.  What they want &mdash; the Progressive Democrats are just as guilty of this as Fianna Fáil &mdash; is a media circus, and that is what they are getting.  A media circus has one big advantage for the Opposition, it diverts attention away from the simple salient fact that the Minister moved with alacrity the moment the problem was brought to her attention in a way that Fianna Fáil never has, and in an area where the Progressive Democrats, for all their legal jargon, have never been tested.  We do not know what they would do in this situation.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue gave us another one of his prime examples of clowning in the House this evening with the facile rhetoric that passes for political comment in Fianna Fáil. It struck me that if the years were changed Deputy O'Donoghue could say exactly the same things about his colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in regard to her tenure in the Department of Justice as he said about the Minister for Justice.  To listen to Deputy O'Donoghue one would think that every Minister for Justice who ever held office was responsible for every crime that ever took place, be it rape, mugging, beating or whatever.  The Progressive Democrats seem to believe that.  They have the most facile, stupid <Col N="715" /> analysis of the reasons for crime that I have ever heard.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about delay on various fronts.  He missed one, Wheatfield Prison. Ten years ago, when I was Minister for Justice, we completed the perimeter wall of Wheatfield Prison.  An Estimate I got through Government resulted in the building of the first phase of Wheatfield Prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In eight years of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice not one stone was set on another in the second phase of Wheatfield Prison. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn invented a new religion in this country, I see it even in my own constituency.  People used to want advance factories in their towns but now they want a prison.  That is what Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn did for us without ever managing to add a single extra prison space to what was in place at the time she assumed office.  It takes some neck for a Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice to criticise this Minister who has provided more prison places already, some of them coming on stream at the end of this month, than Fianna Fáil did in the eight years they were in office.</P>
      <P>What Fianna Fáil Minister ever voluntarily resigned for any of the misdeeds for which they were found to be accountable?  Not a single one. This is the party the Progressive Democrats, a party that professes to be in favour of law and order, wants to cosy up to, the party that abolished the idea of law and order and any care for how we run our justice system.  I will not mention specific people, but we all remember one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The central plank of the Minister's defence is ignorance &mdash; she knew nothing, therefore no blame can be attributed to her.  She says what happened in her Department was a debacle, a catastrophe, the worst possible thing <Col N="716" /> that could happen in a Department.  Because it happened in her Department and because it was a debacle she accepts full responsibility in a technical sense, whatever that means, but she will be damned if she will take any of the blame.  The Minister for Justice should know, as every independent commentator in this country knows, that that argument is about as solid as Legoland. If accountability means anything, blame must sometimes be taken and consequences sometimes ensue in the absence of knowledge and, therefore, in the absence of culpability in that sense.  If that were not the position nobody would ever have to resign because, however great the disaster, it could never be proved as a definitive fact that a Minister had actual as opposed to constructive knowledge.</P>
      <P>As authority for that proposition let me quote none other than the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the high priest of accountability who two years ago said that if that principle were accepted there could be no accountability, no blame without personal knowledge and the whole principle of accountability would wither away.  He said that in 1994, and he was right.  Now he is standing behind a Government and a Minister who is seeking to escape the consequences of her action and whose defence is based solely on that principle.  What has withered away is not the principle of accountability but the Labour Party's standards, if it ever had any, its grasp of the difference between right and wrong, between what should be acceptable and what should not.  Were that principle to be accepted, there could be no blame, no resignation, no consequences without personal knowledge.  The Minister, Deputy Owen, is a perfect example.</P>
      <P>If actual knowledge had to be proved on all occasions before somebody could be blamed, Deputy Owen, Minister for Justice, could never be blamed for anything because she never seems to know anything.  During the Brinks Allied controversy the Minister for Justice knew nothing for extended periods of time, and the longer the controversy went on, her degree of knowledge seemed to be less.  In the Urlingford debacle the Minister was so clueless she publicly congratulated the Garda on a massive drugs find. During the controversy about the Duncan case she knew nothing for more than a month after the case collapsed and the Garda did not feel the need to inform her.  The sergeant in charge of the extradition warrant in that case was moved from his position a few days after the case collapsed. The Garda Commissioner and gardaí at senior level knew that.  Did anybody think it worth their while to inform the Minister?  Not a chance.  The Minister for Justice remained silent while the Government press spokespeople, henchmen and spin doctors of various types continued to blame the British for the collapse of the extradition proceedings.  People in the Department of Justice must have known the facts but did they consider informing the Minister?  Not a hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> In this case the civil servants in the Minister's Department never bothered to tell the Minister whether steps had been taken to inform Judge Lynch that he had been removed from the Special Criminal Court.  No effort was made to inform the Minister about whether one of the most crucial decisions a Minister can make, in terms of its potential consequences, had been implemented. A letter, marked &ldquo;Personal&rdquo;, arrived at the Minister's private office from the Attorney General as the court was about to commence sittings.  It pointed out that the official delisting might not have been communicated to Judge Lynch.  The Minister's officials received that letter.  Did they tell her?  No.  It is a miracle she got the letter of 5 November although perhaps it was for the reason outlined by my colleague, Deputy McCreevy.  If somebody on the outside had not been putting pressure on the Department of Justice, this letter would probably have ended up in the dustbin or in the shredder with the odd extradition warrant or two.</P>
    <P>On 10 October, Judge Lynch wrote to the Minister for Justice inquiring about his status. Her officials received that letter.  Did they tell the Minister?  No.  Why change a winning formula? Nobody had told her anything about anything in the past, so why start now?</P>
    <P>That is an impressive catalogue of ignorance for the Minister for Justice.  It is hard to equal.  It appears what the Minister does not know about the workings of her Department would fill the National Library several times.  Never in the history of human knowledge has so much been concealed by so many from so few or, in this case, from one.  This two years of darkness and not knowing has been brought to us courtesy of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  Did the Minister ever consider that people might be conspiring to keep things from her?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that in certain circumstances the wife is always the last to know. In the Department of Justice the Minister is invariably the last to know.</P>
      <P>If the Minister did not know any of these things, as she says, did it not occur to her that she might have taken pains to find out what she should know?  The net result of this lack of knowledge is that the Department of Justice is on auto-pilot, if not in orbit.  During the debates on the Duncan controversy I had the impression that the Minister and the Department were operating on different planets.  Events over the last few days have convinced me I was wrong.  They are not operating on different planets, they are operating in different galaxies.  Did it occur to the Minister for Justice that this constant lack of knowledge might afford a simpler explanation?  Might it be explained by her inability to run a major Department in view of the fact that she knows so little about its workings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> The Minister for Justice might feel she is entitled to cling to office if the State manages to cling to the 16 prisoners, the bird men of Portlaoise.  However, it is not the consequences of the debacle over which the Minister has presided that matters but the potential consequences, which in this case are cataclysmic. If these people, who are accused of committing the most heinous crimes in the history of the State, do not manage to walk away on a technicality it will be in spite of, rather than because of, the Minister for Justice.  If somebody is employed to run a business and, through failure to inform themselves of what is going on around them, they allow the business to slide into bankruptcy, will it matter when they give an account of their stewardship whether somebody else discovers their failures and averts the situation?  Hardly.  The same principle applies in this case.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions to which I hope the Minister for Justice will reply.  The Minister went to Cabinet and proposed that Judge Lynch be removed from the Special Criminal Court.  Her proposition was accepted so why did the Minister not ensure that the decision, which was of potentially momentous importance, was implemented?  Last Thursday the Minister told the Dáil: &ldquo;I will give as accurately as I can all the information I have at this time, as the investigation in my Department is still continuing&rdquo;.  She said she would expand on this information after the inquiry.  A substantial part of that information consisted of four letters, two from Judge Lynch and two from the Attorney General, but the Minister for Justice only adverted to three letters.  Why did she fail to mention the second letter from Mr. Lynch?  Was that not information in her possession at the time she gave her statement?  She said she would expand on the information she was giving but expanding on information is different from withholding information, which the Minister did last Thursday.</P>
    <P>I also wish to ask about the position of Judge Kevin Haugh who was appointed to replace Judge Lynch.  Judge Haugh was informed of the position on 6 September.  Did the Minister receive any communications subsequent to that from Judge Haugh inquiring about his position?  This man was informed that he was to be a member of the Special Criminal Court on 6 September, yet the judge who had been delisted continued to sit until 5 November and was not informed of his delisting until then.  Was there communication between Judge Haugh and the Minister for Justice in the meantime?  What did Judge Haugh's duties consist of in that time?  Did he sit as a member of the Special Criminal Court?  Is there a panel system in that court?  I do not know how it operates in practice and I would like the Minister to clarify it.  Why did the Minister get some of the letters that arrived in her private office and not get others?  Why was it an official who was not working in the courts section of the <Col N="719" /> Department who took the initiative in this regard?  The Minister must give clear answers.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has a duty not only to be legal adviser to the Government but also to protect the public interest.  This is stated in unequivocal terms in section 6 (1) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  It is a duty clearly recognised by the courts.  In the case of McLoughlin <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare, 1958, Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore said: &ldquo;It is quite clear that the Attorney General is in no way the servant of the Government but is put into an independent position.  He is a great officer of State with grave responsibilities of a quasi-judicial as well as of an executive nature.  ... it may be his business to adopt a line antagonistic to the Government...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of Attorney General <i>v.</i> Hamilton, 1993, Mr. Justice McCarthy said &ldquo;In my view the nature of the Office of the Attorney General charges him with a duty to enforce the Constitution whether it be in the protection of the unprotected ... or in a claim of public right, or otherwise&rdquo;.  It is clearly in the public interest that people who are tried before the Special Criminal Court should have their cases processed properly.  The facts of the case demonstrate clearly that the Attorney General failed in his duty to protect the public interest.  Following the Supreme Court decision and the subsequent High Court decision the Attorney General has a positive duty to be proactive if something is brought to his attention, which it was in this case. The fact that Judge Lynch was still functioning as a member of the Special Criminal Court after his delisting was first brought to the attention of the Attorney General on 2 October.  His only response was to write a letter to the Minister to which he got no reply.  A month was allowed to elapse.  The Attorney General knew or could have discovered at any time during that month that the Special Criminal Court was operating illegally.  During that time the Attorney General was in regular contact with the Minister for Justice but he never felt obliged to discuss the matter with her or to inform the Taoiseach.  When he read in a newspaper at the end of the month that Judge Lynch was functioning as a judge of the Special Criminal Court his only reaction was to sit down and casually write another letter. Obviously, he was content to wait for the Minister to reply to this letter at her leisure, knowing all the time that the Special Criminal Court was operating outside the law.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gleeson's zealousness in enforcing the constitutional protection of the public interest can best be gleaned from the terminology in his two letters to the Minister.  The first, dated 1 October, stated there was an impression that Mr. Lynch was still functioning as a member of the Special Criminal Court.  Did he take any steps to confirm whether that impression was correct? Did he telephone Mr. Lynch, the Four Courts or the Secretary &mdash; if there is such a person in the <Col N="720" /> Special Criminal Court?  Did he even bother to speak to the newspaper vendor outside the offices of the Special Criminal Court who would have apprised him of the facts?</P>
    <P>The second letter is even more comical.  Mr. Gleeson apparently read in a newspaper an account of a case in which Mr. Lynch appeared as a member of the Special Criminal Court.  His reaction was not to telephone the Minister for Justice to immediately warn her but to write a letter saying &ldquo;it appears Mr. Lynch is still functioning as a member of the Special Criminal Court&rdquo;.  Appearances can be deceptive but what we are talking about here is reality.</P>
    <P>The tone of Mr. Gleeson's second letter where he says &ldquo;it appears he is still functioning as a member of the Special Criminal Court&rdquo; conjures up the image of Mr. Lynch arriving at the Special Criminal Court and entering by a back door or arriving in a car with darkened windows and entering with his head covered like the prisoners, or maybe he sat on the Bench with a Martin Cahill style balaclava over his head.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Mr. Lynch dispensed justice for five weeks in the Special Criminal Court after he had been delisted, in full view of the media and the public who were admitted to the court, even though he had no right to be there, no more than a traffic warden who has retired has the right to give out parking tickets.  That was through no fault of his own.  Justice was being dispensed in a three judge court by two judges and the invisible man.  All the chief law officer of the State said was that it could create legal difficulties.  Most senior members of the Bar are inclined to use language carefully.  This would be side-splitting were it not so serious.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the leader of Democratic Left took time off from his busy schedule of forgetting which comrade shot which or reminiscing about his rusty old rifle to issue his ritual defence of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can use a military analogy as we are dealing with Democratic Left. The Tánaiste, the Bollinger Bolshevik Deputy Spring, otherwise known as His Smugness, who is on a different mission, took time off from his busy job of running the world to issue a ponderous statement in carefully measured Waldorf-Astoria terms to support the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>A journalist, Brenda Power, writing in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> on 10 November 1996, page 17, put the matter relating to Deputy Spring much better than I ever could when she said:</P>
      <P>... and obviously mislaid letters and disingenuous remarks and significant questions over who knew what, and when, now bother Dick Spring and his &ldquo;skulking fixers&rdquo; an awful lot less than they used to.</P>

    <P>The Taoiseach supported the Minister in <Col N="721" /> recognition of her support for him at a vital time. He said he would not even accept her resignation, that she is too important to the country and all the gaffes, including this one, are part of a learning curve that will make her a better Minister.  When will the curve peak, in 2057?</P>

      <P>The inquiry will probably focus on administrative matters but its initial purpose was to set up a kangaroo court to scapegoat a defenceless civil servant for the Minister's incompetence.  That is Government by scapegoat. There is another conspiracy here, the conspiracy among the three party leaders to cling to power at any cost.  I ask the Minister to consider how the public view this situation and the nauseating hypocrisy of the difference stance taken by people such as the Minister now as opposed to 1994.  I was about to use the majestic intonation of Leo Amery to Chamberlain: &ldquo;In the name of God go&rdquo;, but that would lend too much dignity to the occasion.  In the circumstances it would be more appropriate to quote the words of an obscure turn-of-the-century music hall songwriter, William Jerome: &ldquo;You need not try to reason, your excuse is out of season, for Heaven's sake just kiss yourself good bye&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Tabling a motion of no confidence by the Opposition is political posturing, no more no less.  Does anyone in the House or outside, who has reached the age of political reasoning think a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice in the same circumstances would resign?  The answer is an emphatic no.  If the roles were reversed would Deputy Bertie Ahern resign as Taoiseach? Would, say, Deputy Burke, a former Minister for Justice, resign?  The answer again is an emphatic no.  That is the record of Fianna Fáil.  Despite all the outrage, and we have had much of it, the indignation and the rounding on an excellent Minister for Justice what we are engaged in is a ritual political exercise.  Deputy O'Dea asked <Col N="722" /> what the public will think of it.  The public know it is a political ritual exercised by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>If we were on that side of the House we might possibly do the same but I hope we would do it with more incisiveness than this which has already fizzled out on the first day.  This is not to suggest that the subject, the failure of the system within the Department of Justice, and the background to it, is not one of the utmost seriousness.  We must wait the outcome of the inquiry for a full explanation.  Whatever the findings we know at this stage there are serious problems in the Department.</P>
      <P>The essence of the charges and demands being made by the Opposition is that because of legislation passed in 1924, about the running of Departments of State, the Minister must take personal responsibility for every act of every civil servant and is legally responsible in a formal way for all these matters.  That Act was passed at a time when most of the business of the Government, by Ministers and civil servants, was done by hand written letters when the entire budget of the State for that particular year could be lost in a tot by the Minister for Finance in calculating his budget.  The period we are talking about is long before most parties in this House were formed.  My predecessor at that time was Alex McCabe who went on to found the Educational Building Society.</P>
      <P>That is when this legislation was passed and it is the time span we are dealing with.  The legislation on which the Opposition are basing their call for the resignation of the Minister is archaic.  It is on the Statute Book but many other archaic laws on the Statute Book have become meaningless with the passage of time.  How many Ministers would survive their full term of office if they were personally responsible for all serious mistakes made in their Department?  Has a Fianna Fáil Minister ever resigned without being pushed?</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an administrative mess which the Minister for Justice was personally not aware of nor responsible for.  Everyone accepts that and I have not heard any speaker in the Opposition suggest otherwise.  When she became aware of what had happened she acted swiftly, decisively and openly.  I am confident that when the findings of the inquiry are revealed she will act equally decisively in whatever way is required.</P>

      <P>The pressure of work on all Ministers and Ministers of State calls our electoral system into question.  It imposes fulltime constituency work on Ministers and Ministers of State, just as it does on Dáil Deputies.  Unless they do that work, they will not be returned to the Dáil.  There is no use being an excellent Minister or Minister of State as regards <Col N="723" /> policy and administration if one is not back in the House when the Taoiseach is forming a Government.</P>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that most hardworking Ministers with vast Departments to run are, of necessity, forced to spend more than 50 per cent of their working time looking after their constituencies.  We should re-examine the electoral system.  The public will not get rid of proportional representation but there should be some form of list system whereby Ministers and leading Opposition spokespeople can be free of constituency work for a particular period.</P>
      <P>I hope the inquiry will look into what the Association of Higher Civil Servants said about the work of civil servants in the Department of Justice.  It said they are stretched beyond breaking point and it is virtually impossible to provide a service they can stand over to any Minister.  This is a serious statement from a responsible association.  I hope the inquiry will examine what repairs and reforms are necessary in this area.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General acted in a manner which every reasonable person would agree was totally correct.  When he felt there could be a failure in communications he took the kind of action any sensible man or woman would have taken on an issue which was not directly in his own area.  This was an effective action and nobody should pillory the Attorney General in this case.  The ridiculous demands from the Opposition have underlined the fact that it is time for a new Ministers and Secretaries Act, tailored to the administration of Departments as they are at the end of the century, not as they were at the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen is an excellent, hardworking, imaginative and reforming Minister for Justice. She has revitalised the Garda system, introducing new divisions around the country, including Sligo, where an assistant commissioner has been appointed.  This has been exceptionally effective in the patrolling of the Border arising from the BSE scare.  She has initiated far-reaching reforms in all aspects of the criminal justice system.  I am glad I will have the opportunity to vote total confidence in her and the Government tomorrow.</P>

They think they are having a field day in the High Court and have other ambitions.  Why do they not wait until next week, when the report is issued and we will have answers?  At that stage the Minister will still be prepared to come to the House and answer questions.  She was expected to make a statement, which she did.  People shouted for her to publish the letters.  She published the letter from the judge concerned.  The response of the Opposition was to ask why she did not publish the Attorney General's letters.  If she published those, the Opposition would want to know why she did not publish something else.  This is not a serious debate by the Opposition.

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> If the Deputy thinks there is a cover-up, he is mistaken.  The Minister acted the minute she found out what was wrong.  She made a statement in the House at the first opportunity.  She established an investigating committee.  People like Deputy Power want to convince me about a cover-up.  It is the one case where there has not been a cover-up.  If one wants to cover something up, one certainly does not make a statement or set up an investigating committee.  For that reason, the Minister deserves all our thanks for upholding the standards a Minister should have once they find something is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the concept that, politically, a Minister is responsible.  If a Minister does, or fails to do, something or tells lies, he or she should take the consequences.  I am equally adamant that the people who did not do their work have to take the consequences also.  There has been <Col N="725" /> discussion about scapegoating civil servants.  Is a Minister expected to sit in an office and tolerate people who, in three months, could not deliver an important message from Cabinet?  If I were a Minister, I would send them somewhere else.  It is almost 70 years since the idea of ministerial responsibility was implemented, when Ministers knew their staff personally, because there were so few.  Times have changed and we now expect Ministers to accept full responsibility for everyone who makes a mistake in their Department.  The Opposition has said a civil servant is being used as a scapegoat in this case but nothing of the sort is happening.  To err is human and someone has to accept he made a mistake.  However, no Minister should be held responsible for the mistakes of others.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday, 5 November, 66 children at St. Conleth's school in Newbridge were inadvertently given a three-in-one vaccination rather than a two-in-one vaccination. This error caused much concern when it was noted and Eastern Health Board doctors visited parents the following day to explain what had happened and to examine the children.  The Eastern Health Board realised the seriousness of its mistake and acted in a mature and reassuring way.</P>
      <P>This controversy raises many serious issues. These include how the wrong vaccine was in the possession of the doctor, the absence of the written consent of parents for their children to be given a whooping cough vaccine and the attention paid to the medical history of the children before the administration of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the Minister for Health takes immediate action to reassure the public about the health services and to ensure that a similar controversy does not arise anywhere else.  The chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board has appointed an independent external group to investigate the circumstances leading up to and surrounding this controversy and to review Protocols to ensure a similar incident does not occur.  Will the Minister ensure the findings of the investigation are made public?  This is the least the parents of these children deserve.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Power for sharing his time with me.  This controversy which involves the administration of the wrong vaccine to 66 school children in Newbridge comes on top of the hepatitis C scandal.  There is, therefore, an urgent need for the Minister for Health to take <Col N="726" /> immediate steps to reassure the public about the health services and to put in place proper procedures on the administration of vaccines.</P>
      <P>This controversy raises a number of serious questions.  For example, why did the people who administered the vaccine have a three-in-one vaccine with them?  It is important for the inquiry to be held speedily and for the Minister to give a commitment to publish the facts.  It is also imperative that he puts in place new procedures on the administration of vaccines.  These should include the use of best practice and attendance by parents at schools on the day of vaccination. The inquiry should cover issues such as the state of the child's health before the vaccination, his or her vaccination history and ongoing neurological problems.  It is important for the written consent of parents to be given for the administration of vaccines to children.</P>
      <P>The uptake of vaccines is not great at present and it is very important for the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that the proper procedures are put in place.  This will reassure parents that their children are receiving the proper vaccinations, that the best system is in place and that the newest vaccines are administered.  This is very important in terms of the new three-in-one vaccination.</P>
      <P>It is important for a doctor and nurse to be present during the administration of the vaccine. Vaccines should be colour coded while the label should include information on the type of vaccine, the date of manufacture and the date of expiry.  This would help to eliminate many of the present problems.  Vaccines should ideally be administered in surgeries so that doctors have the necessary equipment to deal with any allergic reactions.  It is very important for proper procedures to be put in place to reassure the public about the safety of vaccinations.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Power and Moffatt for raising this matter.  The facts surrounding this incident were set out clearly by the Eastern Health Board in a press release issued last Friday.  Before summarising these, I want to make it absolutely clear that the board acknowledged from the outset that a serious mistake was made in the administration of the vaccine in question.  Fortunately, no child appears to have suffered any adverse consequence and the most important issue, therefore, is to find out exactly how the mistake was made and to put in place the necessary safeguards to ensure it will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children concerned were supposed to receive a routine two-in-one vaccine which provides immunisation against diphtheria and tetanus.  This is a booster for the immunisation children receive when they are babies, at which stage they normally receive a three-in-one vaccine which includes immunisation against pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough. The pertussis part of the vaccine is not offered <Col N="727" /> in the school booster programme as the risk of contracting this disease is very much less by the time children reach school going age.  This does not imply that the vaccine is contra-indicated for that age group; it is given to school children aged between four and six years in the United States.</P>
    <P>The wrong vaccine, that is the three-in-one rather than the two-in-one, was administered in this case.  As soon as the doctor concerned realised what had happened the health board was informed and arrangements were immediately put in place to inform the parents and to check on the children.  In addition to visiting all the families, a 24 hour freephone, manned by doctors, was set up for parents who were concerned about their children.  I am informed that apart from the normal minor, temporary reactions which occur as much with the two-in-one vaccination as with the three-in-one vaccination there have been no adverse reactions by the children.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has appointed an independent external group to investigate the circumstances leading up to and surrounding this mistake and to review Protocols to ensure that it will not happen again.  The Minister for Health has asked the board to ensure this investigation is carried out as quickly as possible, and I understand it is likely to be completed next week.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we cannot reach a final judgment on the circumstances in this case until the investigation has been completed.  There is no question but that a serious mistake was made.  However, the health board acted promptly and comprehensively on two fronts: first, by providing the necessary reassurance to parents and checking their children and, second, by setting up the investigation to which I referred.  It also provided full and detailed information to the media, which has helped to avoid any unnecessary panic.  The Minister will look carefully at the report of the investigation and any necessary action, whether in the Eastern Health Board or in health boards generally, will be taken.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, and I mean that sincerely, I am disappointed that the Minister for Education is not here to listen and to reply to this debate.  The Minister for Education is not taking this matter seriously.  Her Department has examined the accommodation at Kilmurray national school and accepts that the best solution is a one classroom extension plus appropriate ancillary accommodation.  Yet the Minister has not prioritised this school for such funding and she <Col N="728" /> makes only a vague reference to the project being reviewed at a later date.  The Minister seems to believe she has done her bit in providing grant aid to assist in the conversion of the hall for use as temporary accommodation.  However, I would like to point out to the Minister of State, who will perhaps pass it on to the Minister, that the Minister is not accurate when she says a grant has been paid.  Although much work has been completed at the school &mdash; for example, lighting, painting, carpeting, fencing, electricity, plumbing and fire equipment &mdash; to upgrade the hall, the school has not been given the grant.  In addition, although the management has been informed that the grant has been agreed to in principle, the money has not yet come through.  Perhaps the Minister of State will have some news about that.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Education not appreciate the difficulties for the management of a school which is being run from two sites?  If a teacher wants to bring her pupils to join the rest of the school she must accompany 21 four and five year olds along a main road on her own.  Think of the danger and the loss of school time involved in such a procedure.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate the frustration of teachers, parents and the board of management regarding the existing situation? Conditions at the school are sub-standard and it is unfair to expect pupils and teachers to work there.  Will the Minister guarantee that funding necessary for fundamental improvements will be prioritised and forthcoming from her Department following the 1997 budget?  Will the Minister agree to meet a deputation made up of public representatives and the school's board of management in the next few weeks to discuss this urgent matter?</P>

Due to the current level of contractual commitments on the primary school capital programme, the Minister is not in a position to give a commitment as to when funding will be made available to initiate this work.  This project will however be considered when the next capital programme is being determined.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that projects are reviewed against a set of objectives and a priority listing prepared which governs the order in which projects are prioritised.  The extent of the projects selected will be dictated by the capital allocations available.</P>

      <P>I will not get into a rehash of the universities legislation nor the débâcle concerning the removal of fees.  However, the Minister should intervene on behalf of students and their families with regard to the increase in fees imposed in University College, Dublin, I refer in particular to the repeat examination fees of £100 at UCD which are in stark contrast to many other universities.  For example, there is no repeat examination fee in Dublin University, or Trinity as it is commonly known, while in Dublin Institute of Technology it is £25 and in NCAD £24.  If we are trying to achieve equity within our third level institutions it is unfair for UCD to impose a fee of £100.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the deferral fee has been introduced.  Last year it was £30 in UCD but has now risen to £103.  That is a huge jump amounting to an increase of almost 250 per cent which is totally unwarranted.  The Minister should speak to the college authorities to see if that fee can be struck out.  Many colleges do not have deferral fees which are a disincentive as well as an imposition on students.  A request to defer an examination is usually made because of ill health or personal reasons.</P>
      <P>The £50 late payment fee is seen as an unfair fine.  Many students do not know when fees are expected so this late payment fee is unwarranted. In other universities and third level colleges the late payment fee is only £18 or £19 while in UCD it is £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be unfair of me to pre-empt his reply, I assume the Minister of State will say that the Minister has no role in the day to day running of universities.  I know, however, that the Higher <Col N="730" /> Education Authority is concerned about the diversity of fees being imposed by universities and particularly in UCD.</P>
    <P>Given that ordinary tuition fees have been removed, the Minister should ensure that universities do not try to create other forms of income on the backs of students, in particular with regard to repeat and deferral fees.  Currently, there is a huge debate in UK universities about the lack of State funding.  It is reminiscent of the rates support grants to county councils.  I would not like inordinate expense imposed on young people at examination time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister put these points to the administrator and registrar in UCD?  Many people are concerned about the matter.  The students union has expressed concern to the college authorities.  I hope the Minister can intervene on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity to respond to the Deputy on this matter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the overall policy approach to higher education was set out in the White Paper.  Among other things, the policy approach set out in that paper sought to balance institutional autonomy with the needs of public policy and accountability, having due regard to the respective rights and responsibilities of the State and the various institutions.</P>
      <P>The policy framework reflected in the White Paper is based on the recognition that the governance and management of universities is primarily a matter for the institutions within the broad constraints of the efficient and effective use of resources.  It follows, therefore, that it would not be appropriate for me to attempt to interfere in the day to day operational affairs of any such institutions.  The Deputy was correct in forecasting what I would say.  That was the thrust of the arguments her party put forward on the Universities Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>She is concerned about the undue influence the Government might have on the affairs of colleges and institutions.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is the statutory body directly involved with the universities.  It is the body responsible for the disbursement of Exchequer funding among the different institutions which have already been required to fund part of their expenditure through the generation of non-Exchequer income, such as fees.  Given the extent of demand for limited Exchequer funds, income from own resources must be an ongoing feature of university funding in the foreseeable future. Within agreed budgets, the universities are responsible for deploying all their resources in a cost effective and efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made about the level of fees charged by University College Dublin.  I <Col N="731" /> understand for those repeating an undergraduate examination there the fee has been increased from £100 to £103 in line with inflation.  For those repeating post-graduate examinations at mastershigher diploma level, the fee has been reduced from £126 to £103.  The fee for students who defer sitting their examinations has been increased from £30 to £50.  There has been no increase in the charge for students making late payment of college fees and this remains at its existing level of £50.  For students who defer taking up their places from one academic year to another the charge remains at £5, as heretofore.</P>
    <P>These fees and charges arise in the main from the needs of the institutions to meet the administrative and other costs involved in making the necessary arrangements and providing the various services to students.  These charges fall within the day to day operational arrangements in the institutions and it would be inappropriate for the Minister for Education to seek to interfere in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  While I understand the Minister cannot be in the House this evening because of the major debate in which she is involved, I am disappointed one of her two Ministers of State have not come in to reply to this serious matter.</P>
      <P>I do not have to tell the House the gardaí have given a splendid service to the State since its foundation, particularly in the Border area during the past 25 years.  This year they have been given a new task in helping to prevent the spread of BSE.  Since last March there have been permanent Garda checkpoints on main cross-Border roads.  The work of the gardaí is difficult and while it is not possible to change their anti-social working hours it is possible to improve their physical working conditions.</P>
      <P>Gardaí work eight hour shifts on Border duty, the crossings are manned on a 24 hour basis.  I passed through one of those checkpoints last night, a frosty damp night.  Our weather conditions differ somewhat from most other countries in the Northern Hemisphere where temperatures could be minus 20 degrees, but dry. If people dress in heavy clothing they do not feel cold in such conditions.  In Ireland's damp weather conditions, however, irrespective of how one dresses one will feel cold.  The gardaí are limited in the way they can dress for the weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about the refurbishment of an old barracks to provide a proper working environment for gardaí on Border duty.  These gardaí work out in the open when it is not necessary.  While we all accept it is necessary from time to time for gardaí to carry out routine checks, the checks on the Border are carried out on a 24 hour basis.  Will the Minister provide proper temporary accommodation for them?  I hope these duties will not be permanent.  When <Col N="732" /> the Customs checkpoints were taken off the Border I hoped it would not be necessary to place any other type of checkpoint on the Border. Surely with modern technology it should be possible to provide a portakabin, with heating and a modern chemical toilet, for these gardaí. They do not require elaborate facilities.  There is generally not much traffic on these roads late at night.</P>
    <P>This matter should be dealt with urgently.  Last night was a particularly cold night for a garda to have to stand at a checkpoint for eight hours.  The matter should be dealt with in a matter of days rather than weeks, and modern technology should make that possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the Minister's absence.  As Members are aware, she had a pressing day.  Like Deputy O'Hanlon, I have great admiration for the gardaí and their record. I assure the House that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, fully agrees that members of the Garda Síochána on Border checkpoints should be provided with basic facilities for shelter and domestic needs.  Her Department is currently pursuing this matter urgently with the Office of Public Works whose task it will be to provide and install the shelters.  What is needed are small shelters where gardaí can obtain protection from the elements, prepare tea and basic meals and have toilet facilities.  Obviously, therefore, we are not talking about providing a hut but also connection to an electricity supply and a sewerage system.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice was requested by the Garda authorities on 7 October to arrange with the Office of Public Works to provide shelters at 19 locations on the Border, later reduced to 15 locations.  This request was conveyed to the Office of Public Works which arranged for one of its architects to visit the locations and determine what exactly would be required.  The Office of Public Works reported back to the Department earlier this month and a departmental official and the Garda housing officer travelled to the Border this morning to discuss the matter locally.</P>
      <P>Shelters can be provided almost immediately at some locations where there were former facilities which can be reactivated.  At others, however, sites may need to be acquired and planning permission obtained which will mean some delay. However, in these cases I understand it has been agreed at the discussions today between the departmental official, the Garda housing officer, officials from the local Office of Public Works and Garda management in the Border areas that gardaí serving in these locations will be provided with temporary mobile shelters pending the provision of more permanent structures.  All gardaí manning these Border checkpoints will be provided with basic facilities as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 November 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceist ó Bhéal Uimh.  35 agus Ceisteanna Scríofa Uimh.  102 agus Uimh.  103 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The report of the independent consultants, Indecon, on the section 35 tax incentive for investment in film production contained four main recommendations, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; that preference should be given to support for indigenous production;</P>
      <P>&mdash; that there should be a reduction in the overall cost of the scheme to the Exchequer;</P>
      <P>&mdash; that the investor pool to avail of the tax incentive should be widened; and</P>
      <P>&mdash; that consideration should be given to offer an additional incentive for production in off-peak periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> The measures announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget last January and elaborated on in the Finance Act, 1996, responded to all four recommendations.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that a number of film practitioners have expressed concern at the impact of the new section 35 package on the level of production in the State, the fact is that section 35 was due to expire in 1996 and I consider it a considerable achievement that I have secured the new package which will run in the period to 1999. Film producers can now make sound business decisions to proceed with projects over the next three years in the sure knowledge that the incentive will be maintained.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future I am happy to assure the Deputy that the prospects are very good indeed.  Because of transitional arrangements announced in the 1996 budget before implementation of the new section 35 package it was end-March before I commenced certification of film and television projects under the new package.  Since then, I have certified six feature films, one animation series and one television project involving a total cost of production of some £23 million.  Under the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, RTÉ is obliged to make £7.5 million available for commissioning television programmes from the independent production sector in 1996 and this will rise to £8.5 million in 1997.  I understand that Teilifís na Gaeilge will expend approximately £7 million in 1996 and in 1997 on independent commissioning.</P>
    <P>In addition the level of applications for development and production loans from Bord Scannán na hÉirean, the Irish Film Board, has been consistently maintained this year at the high level of previous years.</P>
    <P>I expect that there will be further prospects for additional film and television production when the proposed independent television channel is established.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, the following factors will also serve to ensure a sound future for the film and television production sector:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the existence of a dedicated fund for training in the industry of some £3.58 million to 1999, which is being overseen by the National Training Committee for Film and Television;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the continued interventions by STATCOM &mdash; the Committee of senior officials of the State marketing, industrial, cultural and film and broadcasting promotional agencies &mdash; in seeking to maximise the value added component of the industry;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the potential of the Media II Programme of the European Union to assist the industry under the broad headings of Training, Development and Distribution; Media II has a budget of 310 million ECU and will be in operation until the year 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> The question of the establishment of a Screen Commission for Ireland remains my priority as a means of marketing the considerable attractions that exist to locate non-indigenous production in the State.  STATCOM is considering how best this objective can be achieved in the most economic way possible.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  36 agus 38 le chéile.</P>
      <P>At present there are 89 persons employed in the National Museum, 16 of whom are on temporary contract.  An additional two positions are vacant at present.  On average, an additional 12 temporary staff are recruited each year during the busy season.</P>
      <P>Approval has been received for the employment of 29 extra head of staff &mdash; 23 attendants and six management level positions. These positions are at present being discussed with museum management and with staff interests.  My intention is to have the new staff members at management level in place as soon as possible and the extra attendant staff in sufficient time for the opening of the Collins Barracks Museum Development.</P>
      <P>It was clear to me when I was appointed as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that additional resources, including staff, were required for our National Museum and I have endeavoured to address this at a time when staff numbers throughout the Civil Service as a whole are severely restricted.</P>
      <P>LORD Cultural Resources Planning and Management Limited was commissioned to assist in the development of a strategic plan for the National Museum and their recommendations were taken into account by the Interim Board of the museum in its report which was presented to me in May 1995.</P>
      <P>The Interim Board's report presents what is considered to be the most appropriate staffing structure for the National Museum.  The report recommended a number of key areas that needed to be addressed such as documentation, conservation, education, marketing and development, clerical support and attendant staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> A good deal of progress has already been made in those areas.  The museum has been carrying out documentation work for some time now with the assistance of staff recruited on temporary contracts.  The areas of conservation, education, marketing and development will be addressed by the new management level posts.  Additional clerical support staff have also been provided for the museum and, as I mentioned previously, 23 additional attendants will also be recruited for Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue to make every effort to ensure that an adequate staffing level is available in the National Museum to carry out the work with which it is charged.</P>

      <P>Strategic objective H.3 of the Beijing Platform for Action makes a number of recommendations concerning the compilation of gender-disaggregated statistics.  Many of the statistics complied by the CSO already comply with these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 206 (g) refers specifically to the conduct of time-use studies and to the evaluation of unwaged work as an extension of the standard National Accounts.  The Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) is currently co-ordinating the design and implementation of time-use surveys, on a pilot basis, in the EU.  The CSO has taken part in the relevant preparatory discussions and hopes to be able to carry out a small-scale pilot study during 1997.  Time-use <Col N="742" /> studies, in which members of a national representative sample of households keep a detailed diary of their activities for a period of about one week, are relatively expensive to conduct and place a considerable burden on respondents.</P>
    <P>In the National Accounts area, the CSO's priority is to extend the limited range of data available at present to comply with the full detail of the core EU national accounting system.  This is a legal requirement laid down in the recently adopted Council Regulation on the European System of National and Regional Accounts in the Community.  Satellite accounts, including the measurement of unwaged work, are outside the core system and given resource constraints priority is not, therefore, at present being given to their development.  However, the CSO will continue to keep in touch with the ongoing methodological developments in this area at international level.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners remain very concerned about the situation in Sudan.  The ongoing civil war, continuing human rights abuses and severe food shortages have caused great suffering to the Sudanese people, especially those in the south of the country.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Government about the situation in Sudan have been made known to the Sudanese Government by the Irish Ambassador in Cairo who is also accredited to Khartoum. Both bilaterally and with our European partners, we have supported the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which consists of Sudan and seven neighbouring countries, in its special initiative which is seeking to bring peace to Sudan.  We will continue to support efforts aimed at resolving the conflict in that country.</P>
      <P>As part of the ongoing process of critical dialogue between the European Union and Sudan, discussions have taken place with the Sudanese authorities on various issues, including the need to pursue the peace process democratisation, and to ensure protection of human rights and the unhindered distribution of humanitarian assistance.  This dialogue represents an important channel through which the European Union and its member states can communicate their concerns to the Government of Sudan and urge the Sudanese authorities to take concrete steps with a view to promoting a peaceful solution to the ongoing civil war and pressing human rights issues.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to provide assistance to those who have suffered from the conflict in Sudan.  Since 1994, it has provided nearly £1.25 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance in Sudan.  This includes a recent allocation of £100,000 to UNICEF/<i>Operation Lifeline Sudan</i> for the provision of basic healthcare to displaced people in southern Sudan and £125,000 which was provided to GOAL earlier this year, as part of an ongoing project with displaced people around Khartoum.  For its part the European Union has, since 1994, provided a total of 32.5 million ECU in emergency humanitarian aid for Sudan, of which 13.1 million ECU has been disbursed this year.</P>
      <P>With our European partners, the Government will continue to follow the situation in Sudan closely and with concern, and to avail of every appropriate opportunity to exert positive influence on the Sudanese authorities, including in the United Nations and other international fora.</P>

In the case of civil servants with professional legal qualifications the actual service required would range from 30 to 40 years depending on whether, and to what extent, the officer would fall to benefit under section 6 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, or the added years scheme introduced on foot of the 1984 <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration finding.  The added years fall to be determined at the time of retirement.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): General practitioners are contracted by health boards to provide general practitioner services to medical card patients.</P>
      <P>The contract between health boards and general practitioners for the provision of services under the General Medical Services Scheme includes a requirement that the contract agreement shall terminate when the doctor reaches 65 year of age and in certain cases at 70 years of age.  Arrangements have been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation for the deduction of superannuation contributions by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board from payments it makes to doctors under the contract agreement.  These payments are then transferred to a private pension scheme fund which is administered on behalf of the doctors by a board of trustees appointed by the Irish Medical Organisation.  As this is a private pension scheme, the number of years service required for full pension purposes is a matter for the administrators of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the superannuation schemes applicable in the health service, the number of pensionable service years required for full pension purposes in the case of nurses is 40 years.  For the purpose of calculating pensionable service in the case of health board psychiatric nurses whose names are on the register maintained under section 65 (1) of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended by the Mental Treatment Act, 1961, each year worked after 20 years' service is doubled for pension purposes, subject to total pensionable service not exceeding 40 years.</P>

    <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, I am concerned at the inadequacy of speech and language therapy services.  I am glad to report that services have improved in recent years and that health boards have viewed its development as a priority with the recruitment of 28 additional therapists in the last three years. Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear that services require further developments.  This issue will be given careful consideration in the context of the Report of the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities which has examined speech and language therapy services among its review of health services generally for people with disabilities.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Mid-Western Health Board is responsible for the delivery of the child and adolescent mental health services in its functional area which includes Limerick.  Mental health services for children and adolescents are generally provided in child and family centres.  A family-centered approach is adopted and the vast majority of cases are dealt with on a non-residential basis.  The board's child and adolescent services consist of an inter-disciplinary team which is led by a consultant child psychiatrist.  This team is to be strengthened which will enable the further development of the out-patient services in the board's functional area in 1997.</P>
      <P>In cases where in-patient treatment is required, services are provided in the Regional Hospital, Dooradoyle, with special nursing arrangements. In relation to the provision of a dedicated child and adolescent acute in-patient unit, this will be considered in the context of the review of policy on child and addolescent psychiatry currently being carried out by Dr. Paul McCarthy, adviser in child and adolescent psychiatry to my Department.  A proposal for the development of a special residential care service which would provide medium-term residential care for particularly troubled adolescents with severe behavioural difficulties will be considered in the context of the child care development programme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities in this matter and have been advised that the position is as follows.  The patient was seen in the International Missionary Training Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda (IMTH) and diagnosed with haemochromatosis, and it was open to him to have all the necessary treatment at that hospital.  He opted instead, in consultation with his general practitioner, to obtain a second opinion from Beaumont Hospital.  It confirmed the diagnosis and elected to treat the patient.</P>
      <P>In the patient's best interest, it is usual to have continuity of care, as the fragmentation of treatment between two hospitals can give rise to problems.  However, each case should be looked at on its own merits.  It is open, therefore, for the Beaumont consultant to discuss this patient's case with the consultant at IMTH and to look at options for shared care arrangements. Alternatively, the patient might now be in a position to be referred back to the IMTH for follow on treatment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A home care service has been operating at St. Francis's Hospice, Raheny, since 1989.  In the years 1989 to 1996 St. Francis's Hospice, Raheny, received lottery funding from my Department for the provision of home care-day care services as follows:  1989, £100,000; 1991, £60,000; 1992, £75,000; 1993, £75,000; 1994, £89,000; 1995, £75,000; 1996, £100,000.</P>
      <P>In 1995 I provided revenue funding of £300,000 to St. Francis's Hospice to enable it to open the first phase of its purpose built in-patient palliative care facility.  This year I provided an additional revenue allocation of £650,000 to cover the full year costs associated with operating phase 1 of the new in-patient facility.  This funding is being channelled through the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fund raising has been an integral part of the health service in general and hospice services in particular.  Fund raising not only supplements the State's investment in services but helps to forge links between health service providers and the <Col N="752" /> community.  The development of services at St. Francis's Hospice, Raheny, is an excellent example of the community and the State working together as a partnership to achieve a common goal.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the further development of in-patient services at St. Francis's Hospice.  The question of providing additional financial assistance to St. Francis's Hospice in 1997 in respect of commissioning phase 2 of the in-patient facility will be given sympathetic consideration in the context of my Department's Estimates negotiations for 1997.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Additional funding was made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This is reflected in the ongoing progress being made to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates £80,000 annually in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September, 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Just over £16 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to mention the conference, entitled Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders &mdash; Practical Management and Prevention, which is being held in Limerick on 20-22 November.  This conference has been organised by my Department, in association with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and with the support of the European Commission.  The purpose of the conference is to exchange information and to evaluate the success of practical advice and management and prevention strategies currently employed in relation to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.  I am <Col N="755" /> confident that the conference will be thought provoking and that the papers presented will provide a useful database for policy makers, health professionals, hospital managers and carers working with sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Midland Health Board concerning this case and have been assured that the application has been reviewed on hardship grounds.  However, as the person's income was substantially over the standard income guidelines the health board considered that the applicant would not be entiteld to a medical card on hardship grounds.  Should the circumstances of the applicant change a fresh application would, of course, be treated in a sympathetic manner by the health board.  Non-medical card holders are entitled to all in-patient public hospital services subject only to modest statutory charges and to out-patient services free of charges.  They are also entitled to a refund of expenditure (including that of dependants) over £90 per calendar quarter on prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure <Col N="760" /> on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 84 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The series of cancer initiatives which I announced last week are aimed at bringing about important improvements to services relating to cancer throughout the country.  The National Cancer Strategy contains plans for reorganising cancer treatment services, targeting resources to screening programmes of proven value and developing specialist palliative care.  All areas of the country, including the north-west region, will benefit over the coming years from the plans that I have announced.</P>
      <P>The services will concentrate on the needs of patients, with particular regard to the most sensitive and responsive arrangements for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  My plans include the development of specialist oncology services outside the Dublin area so that patients should not have to travel the lengthy distances experienced in some cases at present.  I also intend to develop specialist palliative care services on a phased basis and to strengthen haematology and histopathology services.</P>
      <P>I announced the establishment of a targeted national programme of screening for cervical cancer and gave details of progress made on the development of a targeted national programme of screening for breast cancer.  In addition I published a set of guidelines drawn up by experts on the safe administration of chemotherapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these steps are aimed at substantially improving our current system of preventing, <Col N="761" /> diagnosing and treating cancer.  I am confident that they will represent a considerable advance in the coming years and that the north-west will be among the regions to benefit from these initiatives.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of cross Border initiatives for cancer treatment or research, this possibility is explicitly identified in the strategy document in relation to radiology services.  The topic has been discussed in an initial manner at meetings with my colleagues from Northern Ireland and it is an area I intend to pursue further.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of the Chinese adoption authorities that applications for the adoption of Chinese children be transmitted by a relevant governmental organisation or by a recognised non-governmental organisation.  The Adoption Board, which has statutory responsibility under the Adoption Act, 1991, for the regulation and recognition of adoptions effected outside the State by Irish residents, has agreed to undertake the task of transmitting documents on behalf of prospective adopters to the China Centre for Adoption Affairs in Beijing. The relevant Chinese authorities have been informed accordingly through the diplomatic channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this development, the need for the recognition of a non-governmental organisation for this purpose does not arise. Having said that, I acknowledge that International Orphan Aid has built up a level of expertise in relation to the adoption of children from the People's Republic of China and that it provides important support to prospective adopters.  It seems it could have a valuable role to play in assisting the Adoption Board in the work that the board has agreed to undertake.  I would therefore suggest that the organisation <Col N="762" /> might contact the board to explore this possibility.</P>

      <P>My Department and the North-Western Health Board have provided resources to develop services at Cregg House.  Additional funding of £74,000 was provided in 1995 to increase staffing levels at Cregg House to improve and enhance services there.</P>
      <P>The priority in 1996 has been to provide additional residential, day and respite services and Cregg House has benefited from the additional funds for such services.  The provision of revenue funding for the hydro-therapy pool/recreation facilities, including the possibility of a phased opening of the facilities, has been discussed with representatives from Cregg House. My Department will review the situation again in 1997 in the light of resources which are available to it and the priorities which have been identified for the region in relation to services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>In June 1995, I met a deputation from the Parents Action on Disability, North Western Region.  The issues raised by the parents were: a charter of rights for disabled persons and their carers; the possibility of dispensing with the means test for the carer's allowance; the application of tax relief on donations to Irish charities similar to that applicable to Third World charities; escorts on school buses; the provision of medical cards for all persons with disabilities and the statutory application of a minimum industrial wage for disabled people in sheltered workshops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Atenolol is a medicinal product indicated <Col N="764" /> for use in the treatment of a number of cardiovascular conditions.  I am aware there is a significant variation in price in respect of the generic form of Atenolol in Northern Ireland and within the State.  This is due in large measure to a vibrant generic market in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition which affects prices charged for generic medicines.</P>
      <P>The comparative prices between Northern Ireland and the State in respect of generics, proprietary and branded generics only available in Ireland for Atenolol products, are detailed as follows.  It is understood there are a number of suppliers of the generic form of Atenolol in the Great Britain and Northern Ireland market.  The prices set out in the reply in relation to the generic form of Atenolol in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are tariff, flat rate prices in respect of which these companies are reimbursed by the state authorities.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of the pricing agreements with the pharmaceutical industry some discrepancies exist between the prices of individual products in Ireland and the UK. However, overall the current agreement has resulted in a stabilisation of prices in Ireland as compared with the rest of Europe given that a price freeze exists for the duration of the current agreement.</P>
      <P>The current pricing agreement with the pharmaceutical industry is due for renegotiation shortly and pricing of generic products will be one of the issues examined in the course of these negotiations.</P>

      <P>Field work on the National Museum's excavations finished in 1981.  These were the largest urban excavations ever undertaken in Western Europe and the National Museum is preparing a series of books on the results.  Some of these have already been published, while several others are in the course of preparation.  I understand that one publication is due to appear before Christmas and another on the Runic inscriptions early in the New Year. With regard to excavations carried out by the Office of Public Works in the Dublin Castle area. I understand that these results are also being prepared for publication.</P>
      <P>In general, reports are prepared on foot of each individual archaeological excavation, which is licensed by me following consultation with the Director of the National Museum.  The conditions which attach to all licences require the lodgment of a preliminary report with both the National Museum and the national monuments and historic properties service of my Department within four weeks of completion of an excavation. Detailed reports are required to be submitted within twelve months of completion and the licensees are expected to make every effort to publish these reports thereafter.</P>

      <P>The level of funding available to the National Theatre Society in 1995 and 1996 which is met from the Vote of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council, is as follows: 1995 &mdash; £2,574,000; 1996 &mdash; £2,783,000.  The amounts include the annual operating grant, a touring grant and a capital grant for each of the years in question.</P>
      <P>I have established a tripartite working group consisting of representatives of my Department, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the National Theatre Society to review the funding requirements of the Society whilst taking into account that the grant payable to the Society comes from the annual global allocation available to An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I hope the work of this group will be complete in the near future and can feed into the decision making process on the funding levels for the National Theatre Society for 1997 and beyond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the raising of awareness and appreciation of architecture, past, present and future, which I recognise as being of great importance as an integral part of our culture, and I have taken a number of significant measures in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I published, on September 17, a discussion document entitled <i>Developing a Government Policy on Architecture: A proposed framework and discussion of issues,</i> which envisages the development, for the first time in our history, of a Government policy on <Col N="769" /> architecture.  To stimulate a wide-ranging discussion within the community at large on this important issue, I initiated a four-month public consultation process, involving Government Departments, local authorities, professional bodies, interest groups and the general public, inviting their observations relating to this discussion document not later than 17 January 1997.  Following receipt and consideration of those observations, I will be bringing forward specific proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to this specific initiative, the Deputy will be aware that An Chomhairle Ealaíon, The Arts Council, is the statutory body appointed to promote and assist the arts, of which architecture forms part.  I understand that the Council already provides support for initiatives relating to architecture.</P>
    <P>With particular reference to the architectural heritage, one of the functions assigned under the Heritage Act, 1995, to An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, The Heritage Council, which I established as an autonomous statutory body in July, 1995, under that Act, is to promote interest, education, knowledge and pride in, and to facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of the national heritage, which includes the architectural heritage.  In accordance with the Act, the Council has established a standing committee on architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the recent publication by my Department of an interdepartmental working group report, entitled <i>Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage</i>, which I launched on September 17 at the same time as the discussion document referred to above.  This report contains 64 recommendations which will form the basis for a package of specific legislative, administrative and financial proposals relating to the protection of the architectural heritage which I, together with my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment, intend to bring forward to Government, following detailed consideration of the report which is currently taking place within both of our Departments.</P>

      <P>In the light of the decision to establish the office of director of traffic, a special consultancy study was commissioned to define the organisational structures required to ensure that the director could fully and effectively discharge his/her functions and that the new post and unit within Dublin Corporation would have optimum operational capacity, functional independence, and self-financing capability.  I expect that the study will be completed within the next week or so and urgent action will then be taken to appoint a director.</P>
      <P>I will make the necessary regulations, in consultation with the Minister for Justice and the director, to facilitate the introduction of wheelclamping by the Director as soon as possible after his or her appointment.</P>

      <P>Non-national road grants have been fully allocated this year and there are no moneys available to me from which an additional grant could be made to any local authority.</P>
      <P>I understand that the works required at this location would involve reconstruction rather than resurfacing of these roads and would cost in the region of £1.2 million.  In the normal course, responsibility for improvement and maintenance of non-national roads, such as those in question, is a matter for Dublin Corporation, financed from its own resources, supplemented by the annual discretionary grant provided by my Department. This grant will amount to £3 million in 1996.</P>
      <P>Last September, my Department invited local authorities to submit applications for consideration for funding in 1997 under the EU co-financed grants scheme for specific improvement projects on non-national roads which are of economic benefit and help generate employment.  It is a matter for Dublin Corporation to consider whether to submit an application for the roads in question, taking into account the EU eligibility criteria governing the scheme.</P>

The agency's report, entitled <i>Pesticides in Drinking Waters</i> (1996), is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency survey checked for the presence of 34 pesticide <Col N="782" /> compounds, selected on the basis of their use in Ireland, in a total of 251 samples of drinking water and entailing over 3,300 individual analyses.  No evidence of persistent background contamination by any of the target pesticide compounds was found.  In three samples, pesticides residues in excess of the 0.1 ug/1 limit specified in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 were detected.  In these cases, the supplies were resampled and found to be clear of residues.</P>
    <P>The results of the Environmental Protection Agency survey do not establish a need for the provision of specific treatment facilities for the removal of pesticides from drinking water in view of the satisfactory position in relation to the quality of supplies and the survey's conclusion that raw water sources for these supplies were also free from pollution by the target pesticide compounds.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were, however, asked to give consideration to the sale of maisonettes (particularly those which do not have common areas) where, having regard to the nature of the maisonettes, arrangements which do not involve the difficulties that arise in the case of flats could be devised.</P>

      <Quest>if house rental schemes for different estates based on demand and cost of housing can be put in place by local authorities; if a standard differential rent scheme must exist; if an economic rent based on true maintenance and service charges can be set; and if tenants, in such circumstances, can qualify for supplementary rent allowance subject to usual income regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The making and amending of their rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities.  Authorities have full discretion in these matters subject to following certain board principles, as follows: the rent payable should be related to the income of the tenants and a small proportion of income should be required from low income households; allowances should be made for dependent children; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners; and provision should be made to accept a lower rent in exceptional cases, where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.  Local authorities should also ensure that overall rental income reflects adequately, in so far as is practicable to do so, the management and maintenance costs of the houses under their control, having regard to appropriate local factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As differential rent schemes are based primarily on the incomes of tenants, it would not be appropriate for local authorities to fix rents on individual dwellings purely on an economic basis. Under social welfare legislation, local authority tenants are not eligible to receive a rent <Col N="784" /> supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The Building Regulations, 1991, place a duty on persons providing or reconstructing buildings to cater for the needs of disabled people. Departments and local authorities have been asked on a number of occasions over the years to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access for disabled people to all buildings under their control.  The provision of access for disabled people to other existing buildings is a matter for the owners or occupiers of the buildings concerned.</P>
      <P>In the design and execution of roadworks and pedestrian facilities, my Department has requested local authorities to pay particular attention to the needs of disabled people.  This includes consideration of such matters as the safety and accessibility of footpaths, including the dishing of kerbs, and pedestrian and parking facilities.</P>
      <P>A scheme of grants is available to local authorities in the Greater Dublin area to implement traffic management measures forming part of the overall DTI strategy.  Of grants totalling £3.7 million in 1994 and 1995, £770,000 was paid for the provision of facilities for the disabled.</P>

      <P>I welcome the creation of a national youth forum for people with disabilities.  The social contact, community involvement and interaction of youth with disabilities are major enabling factors for youth to lead full, active and independent lives. Youth with disabilities are active members of many youths organisations.  The availability of EU funding for the creation of a national youth forum is a matter for the relevant EU finance authorities.</P>

      <P>At present the school transport schemes operated by my Department extend only to students in the primary and post primary sectors.  Approximately 8,500 children with disabilities are carried daily on a national network of special school bus services involving 450 vehicles.</P>
      <P>The issue of transport for disabled students attending third level institutions was not raised in any of the recent submission to the school transport review committee which was set up earlier this year.  There are no plans at present to establish a college bus link along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 I set up a discretionary budget from which an allocation is made each year to a special <Col N="790" /> fund for students with disabilities.  I also established an advisory committee under the chairmanship of Professor John Kelly, UCD, to advise on the allocation of the fund.  Applications are invited in October each year through the third level institutions.  Students with disabilities who are experiencing transport difficulties may apply for funding towards their travel costs.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>Officers recruited from open competitions to fill certain established professional, technical or specialist posts in my Department may have their time spent in acquiring the qualifications and/or experience prescribed for appointment reckoned, along with actual service, for superannuation purposes where the recruitment conditions preclude them from taking up appointment before age 25.  The maximum number of years allowable is ten years.</P>
      <P>For the vast majority of primary teachers, years spent in training colleges are not reckonable for superannuation purposes.  However, a small number of junior assistant mistresses and some members of religious orders who were employed prior to commencing training and who employed substitute teachers for the duration of their absences while training, can have time spent in training colleges reckoned for superannuation purposes.  The maximum number of years allowable in both categories is two years.</P>
      <P>Pensionable staff in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology come under the terms of the local government superannuation scheme for which the Department of the Environment has overall responsibility.  The Department of the Environment has confirmed that certain teachers of trade subjects may be allowed extra years for superannuation purposes if the recruitment conditions preclude them from taking up a post before the age of 25.</P>
      <P>In the case of professional staff in the colleges of education for primary and home economics teachers, time spent acquiring the necessary minimum qualifications for a post may give rise to an award of professional added years for superannuation purposes, subject to a maximum of ten years and to various conditions and restrictions.</P>
      <P>Additional years of pensionable service are allowable mainly for academic staff in third level institutions in the university sector.  In general, added years are allowable for years spent acquiring qualifications and experience and are not confined solely to years spent training.</P>
      <P>The maximum number of years allowable in some institutions is ten, in others it is one third of full time service with the institution.  In all institutions the added years plus actual years of service may not exceed 40 years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 196 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>Resource teacher and remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.  Factors taken into account in the selection process would include the number of children with special needs attending a particular school and the nature and extent of the special needs in question.</P>
      <P>My Department has received applications for resource teachers in both of the cases mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke.  The cases in question were among those considered in the context of the recent allocation of ten extra resource teachers to the primary sector.</P>
      <P>However, neither of the cases mentioned by the Deputy was considered to be of such priority as to warrant inclusion in the recent resource teacher allocation.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  In the current year, in addition to allocating the ten resource teacher posts, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I will continue to review provision across the special needs area and in the event of additional resources becoming available in the future, the cases to which Deputy O'Rourke refers will be given every consideration.</P>

      <P>A total of ten additional resource teacher posts have been allocated nationally for the current school year.  Two of these posts have been allocated to schools in County Galway.  Details of the Galway schools in question are attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> No additional remedial teachers have been appointed in the current year.  I have no plans to allocate further resource teacher or remedial teacher posts in 1996.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated a total of 241 remedial teacher posts and 39 resource teacher posts to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 46 resource teachers are now in place.  The percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>

      <P>Under its terms of reference, the steering committee on the future development of higher education was asked to prepare projections of the total potential enrolments in higher education and to make recommendations on the appropriate level of provision.  The report envisaged a growth in enrolment for Tallaght regional technical college from its level of 1,411 in 1994-95 to 2,700 by 2000-01 and 3,000 by 2006-07.</P>
      <P>The Government has accepted in principle the recommendations of the report of the steering committee as a benchmark for future planning in the higher education sector.  The benchmark is to be subject to regular review, the first such review to be carried out in early 1997 on receipt of the report of a study group to be set up to advise on the appropriate level of provision of education and training places for school leavers and others, including the issue of rationalisation of existing provision.  Implementation of the recommendations of the steering committee has cost implications which will be subject in the normal way to the agreement of the Minister for Finance or the approval of the Government as appropriate.</P>
      <P>My Department has received a proposal from Tallaght regional technical college for an extension of the college comprising lecture theatres, laboratories and staff accommodation, which is estimated to cost £14.5 million.  Under the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund Programme a sum of £3.5 million was allocated for capital developments at the college and this sum remains available to the college for the commencement of construction work on the priority stage, mainly science facilities, of the extension in early 1997.</P>

      <P>Educational objectives at second level promote the right of each student to full and equal access, participation and benefit from educational provision in accordance with her or his ability.</P>
      <P>The principal policy directions in relation to second level education are set out in the White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i>  Implementation of the policy programme requires action across a number of fronts.  These include curricular reform in the junior and senior cycle areas which is designed to cater for students with varying abilities and aptitudes; ensuring a continuum of provision for special educational needs and developing teaching methodology in the context of a comprehensive programme of in-career development.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of educational policy is to encourage and facilitate students to continue in full-time education up to the end of senior cycle.  As outlined in the White Paper on Education, the target is that the percentage of the 16-18 year old age group completing senior cycle will increase to at least 90 per cent by the year 2000.  This objective will be achieved through providing an effective foundation of general education and a strengthened and expanded vocational orientation in a restructured senior cycle.</P>

      <P>There is no specific priority listing for school building projects.  The current practice is that where a need has been identified for a major capital project, the project is brought through the various stages of architectural planning.  When the planning has been completed, projects are released to construction in the light of available capital.</P>
      <P>Completion dates on individual projects vary and it is not practicable to give one overall completion date for all projects.  However, if the Deputy has a query about any specific project on the 1995 programme, I will be happy to provide the details.</P>

      <P>The position, generally, is that national schools do not have catchment areas as such for educational planning purposes.  The majority of national schools are denominational and parish based. While enrolment policy is a matter for the boards of management of schools, it is expected that each school will, in the first instance, care for the demand from pupils within its immediate vicinity. There are no plans in my Department at present to review the matter.</P>

      <P>As indicated to the Deputy in a previous reply to him on 23 May 1996, the future of teacher education in the two Colleges of Education for Home Economics has been under review for some years now having regard to the need for home economics teachers.  Any staff appointments which are deemed essential are made strictly on a temporary basis.  The person adverted to by the Deputy has been appointed in a temporary capacity on the above basis.</P>
      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education issued its report in June 1995 but it had not completed its examination of specialist teacher requirements, including home economics teachers.  It recommended, though, that the necessary review and analysis should be pursued further jointly between the Department and the Higher Education Authority.  This analysis and review is in the proces of going ahead and future plans for the home economics teacher training course will be formulated in the context of the outcome.</P>

      <P>Post primary school transport entitlement is determined by the distance measured from a pupil's home to a central point in their appropriate post primary centre, not to the school they attend.  Eligible pupils must be a minimum of three miles distant.</P>
      <P>The central point in the post primary centre to which the Deputy refers changed in June 1993 due to the closure of a post primary school in the area.  The pupil in question, who recently applied for transport, resides 2.8 miles from this central point and is ineligible for free school transport on distance grounds.</P>
      <P>It has only recently come to my Department's attention that a family in the same area has been availing of school transport contrary to the terms of the school transport scheme.  This matter is currently being examined.</P>

      <P>The International Swimming Hall of Fame and the Dublin International Sports Council's proposals for the provision of a 50-metre pool is only one of a number of proposals currently under consideration in my Department.  A project of <Col N="809" /> this scale requires very careful and detailed consideration because of the implications for Exchequer funding of the overall capital and operating costs involved, particularly in the context of the demand for funding for a wide range of other sports facilities.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in previous replies to parliamentary questions, the sports strategy working group established to prepare a national strategy for sport in Ireland is carrying out a wide-ranging and detailed review of all aspects of sport, including the future planning and funding of sports facilities.  The provision of a 50-metre pool is being examined in the context of this strategic plan.</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of this report, which is due to be completed later this year, I am not in a position to give specific details about any particular proposal.

      <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning disabilities, dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher and, in the case of post primary pupils, guidance counsellors and subject teachers.</P>
      <P>When more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I have established a pilot support unit for children with specific learning disabilities in a primary school in north County Dublin.  I will be keeping the operation of this pilot unit under close review.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>My intention for the present is to continue to concentrate available resources on the development of school based strategies for children with specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education sets out a range of measures aimed at ensuring early detection and intervention where children with special educational needs are concerned.  The fundamental objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area.  To this end, the White Paper provides for a continuum of provision ranging from specialised back-up services for children attending ordinary schools, to the provision of special facilities dedicated to children with more serious needs.  The needs of children with specific learning disability will be addressed within the comprehensive range of measures set out in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>At the time of announcement of the free fees initiative the net additional expenditure cost was estimated at £40 million on the basis of fee levels and estimated student numbers at that stage.  This cost excluded fees already being met by the State under the student support schemes.  The amount required to meet the tuition fee costs under the free fees initiative in the 1996 calendar year is projected at about £55 million.</P>
      <P>The difference between the £40 million estimate and the projected cost in 1996 is due to the following factors.  First, undergraduate fees increased by 4 per cent in each of the academic years 1995-96 and 1996-97.  Second, student numbers increased in each of the academic years also.  Third, fee costs previously met from the student support provisions are now directly charged against the provision for the free fees initiative.  For example, new entrants to third level in 1996-97 who satisfy the terms of the student support schemes will not have their fees charged against the schemes as was the practice previously.  The costs involved will now be a direct charge on the provision for free fees.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the free fees initiative was accompanied by the withdrawal of tax relief on most covenants.  It is estimated that if tax covenant relief had not been withdrawn its cost would have been in excess of £60 million in 1997-98.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the schools in question submitted additional data in support of their application for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle initiative.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 222 together.  The Deputy is aware that it is planned to refurbish and extend Bray Garda station when finance becomes available.  The need for additional cells will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>I understand that the room normally used for interviewing suspects in Bray Garda station is also used for other purposes and it would not be appropriate therefore to fit bars to the window, as this could constitute a hazard in the event of fire.  The question of providing a dedicated interview room will, of course, be considered in the context of the proposed extension and refurbishment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223, 224, 225 and 226 together.  I understand that the arrangements are that when drugs are seized by the gardaí and Customs and Excise, such drugs shall, having regard to any crime scene examination that may <Col N="817" /> be necessary, be delivered without delay to Garda Headquarters for forensic examination.  All drugs seized or otherwise coming into possession of the gardaí are kept in a safe and secure location under Garda protection.</P>
      <P>Where there are legal proceedings or other legal requirements involving the seizure of drugs, the drugs must be kept as evidence.  Where there are no legal proceedings or other legal restraints, drugs are disposed of as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am advised that it is not policy to have any member of the general public present when seized illegal drugs are being destroyed.  The destruction of drugs is witnessed by a Garda superintendent or inspector and there are set procedures to be followed, including maintaining a system of records and certification.</P>

      <P>In relation to the matter arising from my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 94 of 22 May, I have received a report from the Garda authorities regarding the correspondence passed to me by the Deputy, receipt of which was acknowledged on 30 May. The report shows that the person in question was arrested, dealt with by the gardaí and convicted by the Circuit Criminal Court in accordance with the law.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as such, it is not open to me to comment any further on this particular case.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's comment on the delay in dealing with this correspondence, the matter raised concerned a particular criminal conviction and, as such, a report had to be obtained from the Garda authorities addressing the specific point raised.  This report was received in my Department on 31 October 1996.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 159 of 8 May 1996 I indicated that if the Deputy let me have a detailed submission about the need for change in the area of the law referred to in the question I would arrange to have it examined.  The Deputy wrote to me subsequently and his correspondence was acknowledged on 23 May.  That correspondence dealt with a very complex and technical area of landlord and tenant legislation and a change of the nature proposed could only be brought forward after detailed legal research and a full examination of the issues involved. Because of the priority which I must give to the comprehensive programme of law reform which I have under way at present and the fact that I have no immediate proposals for change in the areas of the law referred to in the correspondence, it has not been possible in the time available to have had the suggestion made in the correspondence fully evaluated.  I have noted it, however, in the context of any general review of the law which may take place in the landlord and tenant area.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the present strength of Aughrim Garda station is two gardaí and that it has been maintained at this level for the past two years.  I understand that the station is open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily and when unmanned a direct communications link to <Col N="819" /> the District Headquarters at Wicklow comes into operation.  Mobile patrols of the area are carried out by units based at Wicklow and Rathdrum Garda stations and by the Divisional Traffic Corps based at Wexford Garda station.</P>
      <P>The incidents which the Deputy referred to in her question relate to two separate attacks on two elderly brothers at their home in the Aughrim area.  The Garda authorities inform me that three persons have been charged in relation to one of these attacks and that investigations are ongoing in relation to the second incident.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that there is a common alert scheme in operation in the Aughrim area and that a meeting will be held later this month between local organisations and Garda management with a view to reinforcing the importance of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the current deployment of Garda personnel and resources provides an adequate policing service to the Aughrim area and that there are no plans at present to allocate additional gardaí to Aughrim.  The situation will, however, be kept under continuous review, <Col N="820" /> especially in the light of any trend towards an increase in crime in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>The current Garda recruitment competition covers the period 1995 to 1997 inclusive and provides for the recruitment of a total of 1,050 new gardaí over that period.  One of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which I announced in July of this year was the recruitment of a further additional 400 gardaí to the Force over the period July 1996 to October 1997.  When both campaigns have been completed, towards the end of 1997, the total recruitment over the 1995-97 period will have been 1,450.</P>
      <P>I should also say that the anti-crime package approved in July provided for the recruitment of an additional 200 civilians to facilitate the release of an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.  I am confident that with the additional recruitment, coupled with continued civilisation and more effective usage of resources, the measures I have taken will maintain the strength of An Garda Síochána at a sufficient level to meet the changing policing needs of our society.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.  Expenditure on the scheme this year will amount to some £32.7 million and will benefit about 470,000 people.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception in 1967. They are necessary on city and provincial bus routes because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.  I should point out, however, that time restrictions do not apply in the case of people with a mental handicap, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other people with disability or sight impairment.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions apply in the case of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., Monday to Friday inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  The removal of these restrictions would have significant cost implications for my Department.

      <P>Where the spouse of a claimant for unemployment assistance is in employment, the first £45 of such weekly earnings plus travel expenses are disregarded in the assessment of means where the spouse works for more than three days per week.

      <P>Under existing provisions, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs and those of his or her dependants is entitled to supplementary welfare allowance (SWA).  SWA is a short-term payment which is designed to provide immediate assistance for those in need.  While the earnings of a spouse are currently assessed in full for SWA purposes, a person who claims SWA pending a determination of his or her claim for unemployment assistance would nonetheless benefit from the earnings disregards when the claim for unemployment assistance is determined.  The rationalisation of the different provisions for the assessment of means applied in the various social assistance is currently being examined in my Department having regard to the recently published inter-Departmental report on the development of an integrated social services system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the means test in social welfare assistance payments is to direct resources towards people in greatest need and I have no plans to abolish it.  The means test applied in determining entitlement to an old age (non-contributory) pension includes an assessment of the value of any capital or investments (other than the family home) held by the applicant.  The purpose of this assessment is to ascribe a national value to the capital owned and, at present, different methods of assessment apply in the various social assistance schemes.  These provisions are currently being reviewed in my Department with a view to devising proposals for a standard method of assessment of capital for all social assistance payments.  In view of the substantial costs involved, however, any changes in this area would have to be considered in the context of available resources.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I established a special Task Force on Security for the Elderly earlier this year to consider the security needs of the elderly.  Subsequently, £2 million in grants was made available by the Department to voluntary groups to support the installation of security equipment.  This £2 million is currently being allocated to over 400 voluntary organisations throughout the country who have applied to the Department for assistance in providing security systems for 11,000 vulnerable older people.  A further £1 million has been allocated to meet increased take-up of free telephone rental allowance as more pensioners elect to have phones installed for security reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also recently, in a joint venture with my colleague the Minister for Justice, launched a security information pack for older people and a free phone helpline in the week of the launch. <Col N="827" /> This information pack is the latest in a series of measures arising from the Task Force on Security for the Elderly.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that a person in receipt of a means-tested pension can have substantial savings and still have an entitlement to a pension and extra benefits such as free electricity and free TV licence.  For example, a pensioner with savings of up to £2,987.50 (£5,975 if married/cohabiting) is entitled to full rate old age (non-contributory) pension if he/she has no other sources of means.  A pensioner with savings of up to £35,227.50 (£70,455 if married/cohabiting) is entitled to a minimum rate of old age (non-contributory) pension if he/she has no other sources of means.</P>

      <P>Community employment (CE) is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those whom the programme is targeted at.</P>
      <P>Participants are generally engaged for a 12 month period for an average of 39 hours per fortnight.  However, some participants may be re-engaged for further periods with the agreement of FÁS where such participants are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available or where the participant would benefit from additional training/development.  Up to 10 per cent of participants on the part-time integration Option (which applies to those under 35 years) can be engaged for a further period and participants on the part-time job option (which applies to those over 35 years), who have an annual contract of engagement for 12 months, can have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>
      <P>The present criteria for CE only came into effect earlier this year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment. In view of this and taking into account that the programme is operating close to capacity I do not propose to widen the criteria at present.  However I will keep the situation under review.</P>

Given the rapidly changing nature of the electronics sector and its increasing importance to industrial development and employment creation in Ireland, all segments of the sector are kept under review both by my Department and the industrial development agencies.  In addition, the IDA regularly overviews progress in individual companies established in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> The IDA's recent comments on the sector were made against the background of its latest review which indicates that the sector is generally buoyant and stable.  Overall, the review demonstrates the strength of the electronics sector and the lesson to be learned is that we must continue to move and identify where the growth potential is and make sure Ireland is in a position to exploit that potential.  We have built strategic strength in this sector with quality suppliers and we now have more stronger companies with integrated functions based in Ireland than heretofore.  In this regard the IDA's review showed that 90 per cent of jobs in the sector were strong and stable.</P>
    <P>There are, however, some companies in this sector whose operations have been identified as high risk.  This is not something unique to the electronics sector.  Doing business means taking risks.  But the electronics sector is also characterised by a rapid rate of change of products, design and market conditions which, of course, is an extra risk.  But for those who keep abreast of changes it is a rewarding sector of business.</P>
    <P>The IDA is endeavouring to persuade such companies that they have identified as at risk to add a range of business functions in order to enhance the strength and depth of their Irish operations.  Naturally the identities of those companies cannot be revealed.  The IDA's comments were not directed to electronics companies in any specific region, they are relevant to companies everywhere.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the IDA's strategy for the sector is built around a number of core criteria so as to maximise the benefit of the sector to Ireland, but minimise the risk of decline.  The IDA competes for investments across a broad range of segments of the sector to achieve a balance.  The overall objective is to ensure that we have in Ireland the long-term winners while accepting the inevitability that some companies will face difficulties from time to time and may be forced to downsize or even close.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of our competitive cost base and infrastructure, combined with the availability of a skilled labour force and the range of financial incentives we have on offer are, of course, critical to the continued success of our electronics sector. Government policy is aimed at ensuring that the main elements of a competitive cost structure are maintained in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited substantially from the sector and it has shown remarkable growth over the past 20 years.  In 1995 over a third of the total employment in IDA assisted companies was in the electronics sector.  The sector generates expenditures of approximately £2 billion per annum in the Irish economy of which purchases of Irish-made components and supplies, by the sector, are currently worth nearly £600 million <Col N="830" /> per annum.  Up to 10,000 jobs in indigenous supplier companies have been generated out of the Irish linkages within electronics.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the sector in Ireland will continue its impressive growth record despite experiencing fluctuations in individual company fortunes, and specific segments, over time. However, it should be recognised that, despite the best endeavours of my Department and the State agencies, in the final analysis individual companies themselves must react to market situations and take the action which they consider necessary to remain competitive and to develop their operations.  I am satisfied with the IDA's positive response to date in securing increased employment in the electronics sector and look forward to the continued growth of the industry in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255 and 256, together.  There are provisions in the Forestry Act, 1988, and in the memorandum and articles of association of Coillte Teoranta which require that the company must obtain Ministerial approval for a development such as that proposed at Lough Key Forest Park.  There are, however, a number of aspects of the proposed developments on which Coillte is awaiting clarification from the project promoters.  Accordingly, no definite proposal has yet been submitted to me for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposed project is in keeping with the mandate given to Coillte Teoranta under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1988.  In so far as environmental and amenity issues are concerned, it is appropriate to bear in mind that these were considered in the context <Col N="832" /> of a detailed assessment of the proposed project which has already been undertaken by the relevant planning authorities.  The planning permission which was granted following this process includes conditions related to the protection of the environment and there is also specific provision for continued access by the general public to the park.  In this regard, I would stress that Coillte Teoranta made it clear to the project promoters from the very outset of discussion in 1990 that continued public access to the park was a prerequisite to its consideration of any development.</P>
    <P>Given that I have not yet received a definitive proposal from Coillte Teoranta, it would be premature to comment further on the nature of the development envisaged.  In the event of a formal proposal being received, I will, of course, have regard to the protection of local and national interests and I envisage consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, in that eventuality.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 257, 258, 259, 260, 261 and 262 together.  The EU Commission is required by regulation to provide a report on the sheepmeat quota regime to the Council of Agriculture Ministers in 1996.  In that context I proposed to the Commission that the opportunity should be availed of to examine the wider aspects of the sheepmeat regime.  As part of my submission to the Commission I have raised the various issues referred to by the Deputy, particularly in regard to adjusting the ewe premium system.  The Commission report, which is now available, is confined to the issue of the operation of the quota regime and therefore any discussions under Ireland's Presidency will be in the context of that report.</P>
      <P>The importation of sheepmeat into the EU takes place under the auspices of the 1995 GATT Agreement which prescribes import quotas and sets trading conditions up to 1999.  Under this agreement there is strict monitoring of sheepmeat imports but it would be a breach of the terms of the GATT to attempt to impose any further restrictions on imports.</P>
      <P>I should point out that Irish sheepmeat prices in 1996 have been at record levels, and to date are 18 per cent above 1995 levels.  The current buoyant demand for breeding stock indicates a strong degree of confidence in the sector.  I will however continue to press for adjustment to the regime in order to make it more responsive to market fluctuations.</P>

      <P>Different payment target dates are set out in the Charter of Rights for farmers for the various EU headage and premium schemes. In the case of disadvantaged areas' headage schemes the target is to commence payment in September and to complete payment in all eligible cases by 31 October.  For the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef premium scheme the target is to commence payment of <Col N="836" /> advances on 1 November and where the retention period is completed by 30 November (suckler cow) and 1 November (special beef premium) to complete payment of advances in all eligible cases by 31 December.  In the case of the arable aid schemes the target is to commence payment on 16 October and to complete payments in all eligible cases by 31 October.</P>
      <P>The position is that payments under the various 1996 schemes commenced on target and to date some 469,000 payments valued at £375 million have been made under these schemes.  In all, some 897,000 payments valued at over £633 million have been made to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes since 1 January 1996.</P>
      <P>As part of the integrated administration and control system, required by the EU, Ireland was committed to developing a new area aid related land parcel identification system (LPIS) in 1996. Given the increased level of checks and controls associated with the new system it was inevitable that some delay in making payments, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.  Payments under all schemes continue to be made and I am confident that all but the most intractable problem cases will be paid by mid-December.</P>

      <P>The number and percentages of applicants under the various 1996 headage and premium schemes remaining unpaid to date are set out in the following table.  Before payment can issue to any applicant under headage and premium schemes, other than the ewe premium and slaughter premium schemes and applicants with under 15 livestock units, a valid area aid application must be submitted.</P>
      <P>Area aid applications have been received from 131,000 farmers in 1996.  As part of the integrated administration and control system required by the EU, Ireland was committed to developing a new area aid related land parcel identification system (LPIS) in 1996.

    <P>So far in 1996, some 897,000 payments totalling over £633 million have been made to farmers under the various headage and premium schemes. The position with regard to the various 1996 schemes is that payments commenced on target and some 469,000 payments valued at £375 million have been made under these schemes to <Col N="837" /> date.

      <P>The introduction of public transport accessibility improvements is essentially a matter for transport operators themselves, who are aware that I am anxious that their services and infrastructure should offer the highest degree of accessibility to people with disabilities, including wheelchair users, having regard to the resources at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that very considerable progress in this area has been made on the railway.  The DART is the most accessible form of public transport in the country.  Trains can be accessed directly from platforms and the carriages have wide doors and a large area to accommodate wheelchairs.  The new Arrow diesel <Col N="838" /> railcars are similarly equipped and are also fitted with wheelchair accessible toilets.  As regards mainline services, Iarnród Éireann is working towards the goal of providing a dedicated space in the dining car of each InterCity train specifically designated for mobility impaired customers.  The dining car was chosen because there is a dining car on all InterCity trains, there is always a staff presence, refreshments are available and a telephone is also provided nearby.</P>
    <P>All of the major terminals and approximately 75 per cent of mainline stations are accessible to wheelchair users.  Accessible toilets have also been provided at all main terminals, while at smaller locations unisex toilets accessible to wheelchair users are being provided as part of an ongoing national programme which began in 1994.  The majority of DART stations are accessible and the company has continued to improve the accessibility of the systems through the addition of lifts and ramps at key locations.</P>
    <P>It is Iarnród Éireann's policy that all new rail stations and any major refurbishment projects at existing stations together with all new rolling stock purchased will feature facilities for the mobility impaired.  Iarnród Éireann recently published DART and InterCity guides for the mobility impaired which list facilities and access points for the entire Iarnród Éireann system. Special attention will also be given to the requirements of wheelchair users and other customers with mobility impairments in the design of the Light Rail system for Dublin.</P>
    <P>Meeting the needs of customers confined to wheelchairs presents a particular problem for bus operators.  An indication of progress to date and proposed future developments was given in my reply to Question No. 16 on 24 October 1996.</P>

      <P>To date three wells have been drilled off Dublin Bay, two in the Kish Bank Basin and the third on the flank of the basin.  These wells were drilled in 1977, 1979 and 1986.  In 1994 a licensing option was granted to Enterprise Oil plc in the basin and in July this year the company elected to convert the option into a licence.  They were granted five blocks 31/16, 33/17, 33/18, 33/21 and 33/22 under the exclusive exploration licence.</P>
      <P>A condition of the licence is that the company carries out an agreed work programme which includes drilling an exploration well during the first three years of the licence.  Enterprise intended drilling the well this year, after completing their drilling operations off the west coast.  However, unforeseen delays in completing the west coast drilling operations led to a postponement of the well and I now expect it will be drilled next year.  I welcome this renewed interest in the basin.</P>

      <P>I have received Government approval to progress the implementation of the recommendations of the Salmon Management Task Force report.  This entails a comprehensive package of measures designed to secure and augment salmon stocks and a move to management on a local catchment basis.</P>
      <P>The management of the necessary changes will, because of its socio-economic consequences, need to be carried through with great sensitivity, and with a high degree of consensus.  I am conscious that to proceed with the implementation of the recommendations will require the co-operation and goodwill of the interested sectors and organisations if a successful outcome is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>A delegation of 12 members of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board met the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, on 6 November 1996.  The delegation included traditional estuarial netsmen who made known their particular concerns at certain recommendations in the Salmon Management Task Force report.  These concerns had also been expressed at regional meetings held to discuss the practical arrangements necessary to put the policy decisions in place.</P>
      <P>Careful consideration is being given to the views which were expressed at these meetings and to the various observations which have been offered on the subject.  It was the intention of the report to increase the share of the total salmon catch going to the traditional estuarial netsmen, including draft and snap nets.  However, it is possible that some of the recommendations, in particular restricting them to fishing between 4 a.m. and 9 p.m. only, may prevent them increasing their share.  I am actively considering the possibility of some relief for that sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 279 together.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission (FFC) was established in 1952 under parallel primary legislation enacted by the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Parliament.  The FFC's existing functions are the conservation, protection and improvement of the salmon and inland fisheries of the Foyle area generally.  A map of that area is provided herewith.</P>
      <P>The FFC consists of four members, two each appointed by the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the Minister for the Marine.  The chairmanship rotates on an annual basis between the senior commissioners from each side.  The current members are Mr. Niall McCutcheon and Mr. Brendan Hogan of the Department of the Marine and Mr. Jack Allister and Mr. David Houston of the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While reasonably effective in securing its primary objective of achieving adequate breeding stocks of salmon throughout the Foyle system, the FFC, largely because of legislative constraints, has been unable to develop the fishery resources of the Foyle Area to their full potential.  This arises because the FFC does not have a development function under its present <Col N="842" /> statutes.  Because it lacks the powers to licence and control aquaculture development, considerable development potential for shellfish farming in Lough Foyle continues to go untapped and private enterprise promoters are unable to avail of national and EU grants to exploit a proven resource there.</P>
    <P>Against this background the two sponsoring Departments commissioned, in 1993, a review of the FFC's operations, funding, structure and staffing.  The main recommendation resulting from this review, which was undertaken by KPMG Managing Consultants, were that the FFC's remit with respect to salmon and inland fisheries should be expanded to enable it to undertake development work both in relation to the fishery resource and by promoting, developing and improving facilities for angling and that the role of the FFC should be extended to include regulation and licensing of shellfish farming and marine aquaculture and the regulation of sea fishing within the Foyle area. The report recommended that the devolution of powers in relation to sea fishing might relate to Lough Foyle initially but that provision should be made to allow an extension of these powers to the parts of the Foyle area seaward of Lough Foyle at some future time, if such an extension of powers was considered necessary.</P>
    <P>These, and other, recommendations of the Review were accepted by both Governments and legislation is now under preparation in both jurisdictions to implement them.  It is hoped to have this legislation in place next year.  In the meantime, the FFC has issued a consultation document and invited views from interested parties, both North and South, on how it might carry out these new roles.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied for a licence to cultivate mussels on longlines in Kilmakilloge Harbour, County Kerry.  To date some 14 aquaculture licences have been granted authorising mussel farming in Kilmakilloge Harbour and a number of applications are on hands in my Department, including that to which the question refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed both by growers and my Department's technical services as to the capacity of the water body in the harbour to sustain optimum growth levels for mussel cultivation.  My Department's engineering service is currently undertaking a technical survey of the <Col N="843" /> harbour to establish the level of sustainable development possible for mussel farming. Pending the outcome of the survey and <Col N="844" /> assessment, it is not possible to determine the scope for additional licensed sites, if any.  It is my Department's intention to complete the survey as quickly as possible.</P>
