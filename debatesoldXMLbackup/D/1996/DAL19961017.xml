      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Taoiseach to comment to the House on the insensitive remarks made yesterday by the Minister for Health during <Col N="510" /> the hepatitis C debate, his unwarranted attack and subsequent apology to the McCole family and relatives and the unwarranted attack, which created so much hostility and anger, on the legal team that represented the late Mrs. McCole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>When will the medical practitioners (amendment) Bill be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical practitioners legislation is at an early stage of drafting and it is hoped the Bill will be published in June or July 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the agreement papers with Russia?  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach had written to the Russian Prime Minister on the matter, did the Minister, Deputy Yates, communicate with the Taoiseach before making his decision on the Russian contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is down for debate which will take place shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately in all these matters, while Ministers make the decisions, the Taoiseach never speaks on them.  Surely it is in order to ask the Taoiseach if he will lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the agreement with Russia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow the question, but there is ample scope for debate on the matter later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the agreement which the Russian authorities believed was the basis on which they could continue to allow Irish beef into the Russian market is the subject of a debate in the House.  I remind Deputies that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, unlike his predecessor, is willing to answer questions for an extensive period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Ahern will have the opportunity of putting the question he has posed in the normal way.  There is no purpose to be served in the Deputy seeking <Col N="511" /> to pre-empt the debate to which the Government has fully agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and his colleagues should recall the last major debate on the beef industry regarding the outcome of the beef tribunal, when Fianna Fáil did not allow questions to be asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has not answered the question, I still do not know if we will see the document.  Did the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry consult the Taoiseach before he made his decision and, if not, why not? was the Taoiseach who made representations to the Russian Prime Minister, ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not anticipate the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For this Government, unlike the previous collapsed Government, collective responsibility applies.  Ministers are, collectively, responsible for their decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should come out of the bunker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since collective responsibility applies for this Government, will the Taoiseach clarify in the next day or so the confusing statements made by him at Question Time and by the Tánaiste in the Seanad yesterday?  Conflicting statements were made on how high the fence will be for those wishing to re-enter talks if there is a ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read what his brother said last night about subventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach wishes to intervene, he may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no conflict in this matter within or between members of the Government, the only conflict is in Deputy Ahern's mind.  The requirements for a party to enter the all-party talks in Belfast are set out clearly in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules paper.  As the Tánaiste said yesterday in the Seanad, the barrier set by those paragraphs has been neither raised nor lowered.  The first requirement is a ceasefire and the second is to establish that that <Col N="512" /> ceasefire is a credible one and not tactical.  The conditions have not been altered in any way.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste stated clearly yesterday in the Seanad that the collapse of the IRA ceasefire was an enormous blow to the credibility of the republican leadership and that this credibility gap has to be bridged.  That is what I said in the House yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow the question which must be relevant but I cannot allow a debate to ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not debate the matter. Anybody who reads what was said in the Seanad last night and at Question Time yesterday will see that contrasting and conflicting statements were made.  I thank the Tánaiste for at least answering the questions I put yesterday.  In the interests of achieving what we all want to achieve, it would be advisable for the Taoiseach to issue a statement in the next few days clarifying the answers to the questions I put yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions for a party to enter the all-party talks are set out in the paragraphs of the ground rules paper to which I referred several times yesterday.  They require that the commitment to exclusively peaceful methods be established and shown.  The Deputy tried to get me to say that there should be a time limit but I did not allow myself to be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say there should be a time limit.  He asked if there was one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply said that, in accordance with the precise wording of the ground rules paper, the commitment to exclusively peaceful methods had to be established and shown and that there had to be a ceasefire.  There has been no change in those requirements which were written out carefully in the ground rules paper in April this year.  They remain the sole conditions which have to be complied with.  As the Tánaiste and I said yesterday, the barrier has neither been raised nor lowered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the debate this afternoon on the BSE crisis is enough?  Will he, as President of the European Council, travel to Russia immediately to undo the damage caused by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the past few days?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is virtually Question Time and the Taoiseach responded to Deputy Ahern, will he clarify one matter for me?  Is it still his view that Sinn Féin is genuinely trying to have the IRA ceasefire reinstated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not turn the Order of Business into Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem answering questions at any time.  There are people within Sinn Fein who are genuinely seeking to have the IRA restore its ceasefire on a credible basis which complies fully with paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules paper.  The difficulty seems to be that, because of the way in which the movement works, there must be unanimity before there is a decision.  This means, in effect, that a minority which is unwilling to go along with this has a veto on any decision.  I hope that a ceasefire which is credible and complies fully with paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules paper is achieved.  It is worthwhile seeking that achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is international credit union day.  Last week when my colleague, Deputy Briscoe, raised the question of credit union legislation the Taoiseach said it was complex legislation comprising almost 200 sections and that it would be available in early 1997.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said yesterday that it would be available next month.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has been in preparation for well nigh 20 years during which period all parties in this House, with the exception of the Green Party, have held office.  In deference to the Government's concern for the credit union movement, the legislation will be produced, if possible, before Christmas.  If not, it will be produced shortly after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the legislation has been going through the various processes for 20 years, will the Taoiseach clarify which Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been asked virtually every week.  Deputy Briscoe was the Member to ask it most recently.  As Deputy Ahern knows, I have said several times that the legislation will be produced in either November or December this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying that the Green Party has not yet been in Government.  Will the Equal Status Bill be published before or during the disability and equality conference to be held in Cork in November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of this legislation, which is at an advanced stage of preparation, is dependent on its being complete and ready for publication and is not linked to any other event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on a matter of grave public concern in Killarney and south Kerry in which he is directly involved, that is, the issuing of an invitation to the £100 per head fund-raising dinner?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy had something relevant to raise at this time.  That is irrelevant to the Order of Business.  The Deputy must find another way to raise it and the Chair will facilitate him, if necessary, to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has declared it is no longer a White Paper but a Green Paper?  It is important for the Cabinet to tell the Taoiseach what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill on the reorganisation of health services, including the replacement of the Eastern Health Board, perhaps the Taoiseach could tell me what stage of preparation it is at and if there are any problems with funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is proceeding on the basis of existing statutory provisions and is operating effectively as far as its organisation is concerned.  There is now such a demand for motor cars that there are waiting lists for some models.  This is an indication of the spending power in the economy, which is in marked contrast to the condition of the economy when the Deputy's party last held office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind</P>
      <P>(1)  The serious public concern about the circumstances surrounding the contamination of blood and blood products and the consequences for the health of a significant number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> (2)  The report of the Expert Group which was published in April 1995</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(3)  The fact that further documents, testimony or other information, not available to the Expert Group, may now be available relevant to some or all of the matters following;</P>
    <P>resolves that it is expedient that a tribunal be established, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as adapted by or under subsequent enactments, and the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, to inquire urgently into and report and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to the following definite matters of public importance:</P>
    <P>1.  The circumstances in which anti-D, manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB), was infected with what is now known as hepatitis C and the implications thereof, including the consequences for the blood supply and other blood products.</P>
    <P>2.  The circumstances in which the BTSB first became aware that anti-D, manufactured by the BTSB, had become, or might have become, infected with what is now known as hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>3.  The implications of the discovery at 2. above, the action taken by the BTSB in response to the discovery and the adequacy or otherwise of such action including the consequences for the blood supply and other blood products.</P>
    <P>4.  The response of the BTSB to a letter of 16 December 1991 from the Middlesex Hospital, London in relation to human immunoglobulin-anti-D and the adequacy of such response including the consequences for the blood supply and blood products.</P>
    <P>5.  Whether the National Drugs Advisory Board in carrying out its functions in advising on the grant of a manufacturing licence for anti-D under the Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1974 and in advising on the grant of product authorisations under the European Communities (Proprietary Medical Products) Regulations, 1975 carried out its functions properly.</P>
    <P>6.  Whether supervision of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the National Drugs Advisory Board, in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1-5 above, was adequate and appropriate in the light of</P>
    <P>(i)  The functional and statutory responsibilities of the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and the boards.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Any other relevant circumstance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> 7.  Whether anti-D was a therapeutic substance for the purposes of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932 and the regulations made pursuant to it and whether the grant of a manufacturer's licence during the years 1970-1984 would have been appropriate and could have prevented the infection of human immunoglobulin-anti-D with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>8.  The relevance to the foregoing of any further documents, testimony or information not available to the Expert Group, which became available subsequent to the completion of the group's report.</P>
    <P>9.  The questions raised by the family of Mrs. Brigid McCole, in their open letter published on 9 October, in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above.</P>
    <P>And that the tribunal be asked to report on an interim basis not later than the 20th day of any oral hearings to the Minister for Health on the following matters.</P>
    <P>The number of parties then represented before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The progress which has been made in the hearings and the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that point in time) of the tribunal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Any other matters which the tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Minister at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference).</P>
    <P>And that the Minister for Health should inform the person selected to conduct the inquiry that it is the desire of the House that the inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it.</P>
    <P>The Government decided on 8 October to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  On 15 October I announced details of the proposed terms of reference of the tribunal determined by the Government and these are set out in the motion.  Yesterday the House had an opportunity to discuss at some length all the issues which form the background to the setting up of the tribunal.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to go into the level of detail which would be the norm in introducing such a motion to the House.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a tribunal of inquiry is the ultimate mechanism available to the House to establish the full truth surrounding any matter of major public concern.  It is not a power that is lightly used&mdash;this is only the sixth occasion since 1975 that this procedure has been invoked.  A tribunal of inquiry established under the Act has <Col N="518" /> the same powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court or a judge of the High Court.  These include the compelling of witnesses to attend and the production of documents before it.  It is an offence to disobey a summons to appear as a witness, not to produce documents requested by it or to obstruct or hinder the tribunal in its functions.  Persons found guilty of an offence under the relevant Acts are liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or up to two years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>The hearings of the tribunal must be in public unless the tribunal considers that it is in the public interest to refuse to allow the public or any portion of the public to be present for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence.</P>
    <P>There has been a general welcome for the Government's decision to establish the tribunal. Despite the costs involved it would appear that, because the infection of blood and blood products is such a major scandal and because there is a need to use all available means to establish the full facts of what happened, there is an acceptance that on this occasion a tribunal is the right mechanism.  The establishment of the truth is obviously of most importance to those whose health has been affected by the infection of the blood and blood products.  I accept that for them this is probably the single most important expectation that they have of the Government and Members of this House.  It is also of considerable importance to the well-being of the democratic system that we can be seen to address the critical issues of accountability and responsibility through the systems available to us.</P>
    <P>I will now address the terms of reference and, in particular, draw to the attention of the House some of their special features.  In drawing up the terms of reference, the Government's objectives might be summarised as follows: first, to enable the tribunal to address fully all the relevant matters of serious public concern; second, to ensure clarity in relation to the boundaries of the task to be undertaken by the tribunal; and third, to enable the tribunal to conduct its task as effectively and efficiently as possible consistent with a fair examination of all matters referred to it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the terms of reference are quite detailed and extensive, in contrast with shorter and more general terms which have characterised other such inquiries.  This is designed to balance comprehensiveness with clarity and to assist the tribunal in containing the task to those matters which must be addressed. However, Deputies will also note that provision is being made to allow the tribunal in its interim report to draw the Minister's attention to any matter relating to the terms of reference which it considers needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The inquiry will start with a considerable advantage, in so far as it will have available to it the report of the expert group, so ably chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien, which was published in April 1995.  It will also have full access <Col N="519" /> to all the documents discovered in preparation for the recent High Court case taken by the late Mrs. McCole.  This represents a significant proportion of all the work which might otherwise have to be undertaken by the tribunal.  I need hardly say that it can absolutely rely on the full co-operation of my Department and all other bodies under my aegis in undertaking the further researches which its work will involve and in gathering the testimony necessary to complete its task.</P>
    <P>There is a specific reference to the questions raised by the family in their open letter published on 9 October.  Yesterday I appologised unreservedly for any upset I may have inadvertently caused to the members of the family in raising questions about the conduct of Mrs. McCole's case by her solicitors.  I again assure each and every one of them of my deep regret about any hurt which my remarks caused.  I hope they accept my apology in the spirit in which I have been gladly willing to make it and repeat it in this House today.  I also made adverse references to the solicitors and counsel for the late Mrs. McCole in my contribution yesterday.  I withdraw these unequivocally.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is being asked to report on an interim basis not later than the 20th day of any oral hearings and the matters to be covered in that report are specified.  This, coupled with the expressed wish to conduct the inquiry in as economical a manner as possible, consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it, reflects the Government's concern with maintaining confidence in a tribunal of inquiry as an effective and efficient means of getting to the bottom of contested matters of major public concern.  These provisions are innovative but they derive directly from the experience gained in the establishment and conduct of previous inquiries.</P>
    <P>Finally, I draw the attention of the House to the specific reference to the supervisory responsibilities of the Minister and the Department of Health.  Because of the concept of the Minister as corporation sole and the reality that functions are exercised on his behalf by the officers of the Department of Health, it is considered appropriate to include both.  I was particularly anxious to avoid any suggestion that I am not prepared to be fully accountable for any responsibilities I hold in relation to the matters under review.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that Mr. Justice Thomas A. Finlay, the former Chief Justice, has agreed to be the chairman and sole member of the tribunal.  I express appreciation to him on my own behalf and that of the Government for agreeing to undertake this difficult task of major national importance.  I wish him every success in his task and I again assure him of the unstinting co-operation of my Department and the other statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to the Attorney General's recommendation to make provision for the appointment of three legal teams &mdash; the tribunal <Col N="520" /> team, the State team and a public interest team.  This is the first time that a team representing the public interest will be appointed. The tribunal has the power to authorise the legal representation of any person appearing to it to be interested.  It may also refuse such representation. It is a matter for the tribunal alone to decide who should be represented and the 1979 Act authorises the tribunal to direct that the costs of any person appearing before it should be paid by any other person, including the State.</P>
    <P>The work of the tribunal will get under way as soon as the necessary physical and support arrangements can be put in place.  Its cost will be a charge on the Department of Health Vote and will be met by way of Supplementary Estimate in 1996 and subsequently as necessary.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main features of the tribunal's terms of reference and the arrangements for the conduct of its task.  It is being asked to address difficult and sensitive issues surrounding one of the worst public scandals which has arisen for many years.  Many groups will look to it to provide explanations as to how this happened and to draw conclusions on the systems or other failures which led to such a sad outcome for so many innocent people.  I did not lightly propose its establishment to the Government, which took great care in finalising the scope of the tribunal's work.  If there had been an easier way of addressing the issues, which have concerned people within and outside the House, I would have chosen it but there was not an easier way to achieve the degree of certainty that was being demanded.</P>
    <P>It is no consolation that we are not alone in the difficulties which have arisen in the field of blood transfusion.  The measures I have proposed to my colleague Ministers in the EU to enhance blood safety and self-sufficiency within the Union have met with a ready and enthusiastic response not because they are especially innovative or radical but because every Minister for Health recognises he or she cannot take for granted a continuing and adequate supply of safe blood and blood products unless there is zero tolerance of anything other than the very best practice and everything relating to the harvesting, factoring, distribution and use of blood and all its derivatives. The principles and practices necessary to achieve this are generally known and agreed.  The challenge is to implement them rigorously and consistently, no matter how routine the operation may appear to the casual observer.</P>
    <P>As we establish this inquiry into past failures we must renew our commitment to support the implementation of the many measures which have been recommended in the Hederman-O'Brien and Bain reports with regard to the improvement of the blood transfusion service and of haematology in our hospitals.  The provision of resources to do this is essential but so also is the maintenance of public confidence and the reassurance of those charged with providing a high quality service that they have the support of <Col N="521" /> all in this House in doing their work.  I hope all Deputies will support this motion and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 9, to delete &ldquo;, in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 1 states:</P>
      <P>After paragraph 9, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Government decision be made:</P>
      <P>(i)  directing all persons employed by the Government Departments and State Agencies concerned to give their full co-operation to the Tribunal in its inquiries and</P>
      <P>(ii)  directing all Government Departments and all State Agencies concerned to fully co-operate with the Tribunal by providing all documents and information requested of them;</P>
      <P>That the Minister for Health should inform the person selected to conduct the inquiry that it is the desire of the House that the anonymity of the victims of Hepatitis C who come before the Tribunal be preserved if they so wish;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I also intend to propose a second amendment which states: &ldquo;In paragraph 9, to delete &ldquo;, in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult not to be emotional about this issue.  We must try to put ourselves in the position of the victims of hepatitis C.  It could have been any one of the women Members who are in such a position.  We must try to imagine what it must be like to live every day constantly reminded that we have been poisoned by a State agency, living with the dread of death, not knowing what time, when or where it will happen.  At the same time, we must look at the way in which those victims &mdash; men, women and children but mostly women &mdash; have been treated by the State agencies and by the person charged with political responsibility.  There has been stonewalling all the way, both by the Minister and agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>Many of the victims have not been brave enough to come out publicly and show their faces. All of us can understand that.  I compliment those brave victims of hepatitis C whose photographs appeared in this morning's newspapers.  The Minister accepts that many victims have not told their extended families, their children or employers.  They must be respected and those who have gone public must be admired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister once again proved that a week is a long time in politics.  Just over a week ago he told the Dáil there would not be a judicial inquiry, U-turns or an acknowledgment of a cover <Col N="522" /> up.  He also told us the expert group which had investigated the BTSB scandal had the full facts and there was no need to reopen the investigations. Yet one week later he did a U-turn.  A judicial inquiry was to be established and, in the terms of the motion establishing the inquiry, the Government at last recognised that the expert group did not have all of the facts.</P>
    <P>Reading the terms of reference one justifiably felt both gratified and surprised.  We are gratified because at last the means had been secured to uncover the truth behind not just the medical but also the political scandal arising out of this tragedy.  We are surprised, because these terms of reference were apparently proffered by a Minister who has consistently and resolutely opposed any attempt to uncover that truth.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are not without fault.  I will deal with the difficulties associated with them later, and having read my amendments, the Minister is aware of them.  However, Let us not allow him, as a consequence of his extraordinary U-turn &mdash; his first in the context of the terms of reference &mdash; to be exonerated of his disgraceful handling of this issue.</P>
    <P>When he announced his capitulation people said that at last the Minister had seen the light and was listening to the victims of this public health tragedy; he had at last recognised that wrong had been done and that the truth had to come out.  However, yesterday he showed this was the same Minister of a week ago.  The leopard had not changed his spots; he had merely altered them temporarily.</P>
    <P>In his comments yesterday the Minister emphasised that nothing has really changed in his approach to this nightmare.  He has learned nothing throughout the horrible saga of hepatitis C.  Despite his pretence of finally listening to the victims, the Minister is as deaf as he ever was to the calls of people who had been violated by a State agency.  He has reinforced in stark terms his lack of sympathy, compassion, and understanding of the hurt, anger and frustration of the victims of the hepatitis C scandal in general and the late Mrs. McCole in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an appalling attack on the late Mrs. McCole, her family and the victims in the course of his speech to the Dáil yesterday. Despite the fact that he mentioned the questions raised by Mrs. McCole's family in terms of the judicial inquiry, he had forgotten, just one day after he had drawn up those terms, that Mrs. McCole was not in this for the money.</P>
    <P>As the letter from her family pointed out, the reason Mrs. McCole chose to go to court was because she wanted to establish the truth.  She wanted those who put the sentence of death upon her to be made accountable in public.  Her name and her family's questions were deliberately included in the terms of reference of the hepatitis C judicial inquiry to make the Minister appear compassionate and to make the inquiry look honourable.  Her name was added to give the tribunal respectability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> Given the attack in the Minister's speech, one must conclude this was just window dressing by the Government and that Mrs. McCole's name was attached to the terms as a personal damage limitation exercise by the Minister.  Nothing had really changed except that the Minister needed to get out of a spot and the terms were honeyed with the addition of the name of the victim.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's comments were not, as I said this morning on radio, the words of some inexperienced Minister.  The Minister is no political lightweight. He is regarded as the Government's &ldquo;safe pair of hands&rdquo;.  He is a Minister whose political skills are legendary.  I told the House last week that people have always described him, as I would have, as being politically skilful, somebody who would get things done, would handle difficult tasks, would be a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; Minister and would fight for something that he believed in.</P>
    <P>However, two observations can be made in respect of his comments.  First, the bitterness and resentment the Minister feels for Mrs. Brigid McCole's legal team shone through and underpinned his comments.  His bitterness is due to the fact that the revelations forthcoming from the discovery carried out by Mrs. McCole's legal team provided the basis for the tribunal of inquiry, which will eventually bring the Minister and the State agency to book.  Second, his lack of sensitivity has been clear for some time.  This is now complemented and supplemented by a most fundamental ignorance of Mrs. McCole's nature and motivation.  The Minister is sadly mistaken in his belief that Mrs. McCole's motivation was money. If the Minister had spent less time stonewalling, blocking and barracking her claim and more time trying to understand her overriding concerns, he would not have made his comments in the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>It was Mrs. McCole's living and dying wish that the truth of this scandal should be uncovered and understood by everybody.  It was for this reason alone that she, and not her legal team, wished to pursue her claim through the courts.  Her decision was fully vindicated when the discovery documents arising from her claim in the courts revealed evidence of, at best, negligence and, at worst, impropriety.  The tribunal of inquiry would not exist if it had not been for Mrs. McCole's brave decision.  For the Minister to criticise that decision in the manner in which he did yesterday displays, on the one hand, a most serious lack of understanding and, on the other, a most unattractive bitterness.</P>
    <P>An episode of this magnitude requires a safe pair of hands, but the pair of hands dealing with this issue have not been safe for some time.  Every time the Minister met the hepatitis C victims over the past two years, he warned them that they could not have or get various things.  He never apologised for the terrible tragedy which has befallen these victims; instead, there was beneath the surface bile, a bare tolerance on the part of the Minister.  His attitude was that they should <Col N="524" /> accept the charity they were being offered by a Government which promised to treat them fairly.</P>
    <P>This lethal cocktail in terms of attitude was always just beneath the surface and the victims knew it.  Last night, the Minister could not hide it any longer.  He was boiling with resentment because the victims, their legal team and Opposition spokespersons had forced him to make a U-turn.  He let fly; Fine Gael's safe pair of hands lashed out.  The Minister, who people say is somebody who gets things done and handles the difficult tasks, publicly dropped the ball.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been on the offensive since by trying to present his comments as something out of character.  He wants people to feel sorry for him and to explain his comments by claiming that he did not &ldquo;sensitivity-proof&rdquo; his speech.  If an experienced Minister had come to the House without reading his script, it might have been possible to excuse him but an experienced Minister, the person regarded as the best performer in the Government, should not expect people to believe he did not read his script before he came to the House.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister's bungling is not just about last night because for 18 months he has done his best to ensure the full truth did not emerge.  This is the truth and answers that victims, such as the late Mrs. McCole, want more than anything.  Positive Action has graciously accepted the Minister's apology, but the attack brought to the surface a resentment which the Minister has harboured for a long time.  I hope the Minister will accept that it damaged his relationship with victims of hepatitis C.  There is a danger now that people will feel the Minister says one thing in public but feels something totally different in private.  Nobody should attack Mrs. McCole's memory or her motives in the manner in which they were attacked last night.  It is extraordinary that the attack was launched by the person whose first duty is to protect the lives and health of people in the State.  How could anybody have been so insensitive to Mrs. McCole's husband and family?</P>
    <P>The Minister belatedly apologised for his remarks but not until they had been brought to his attention for the third time.  Both myself and Deputy O'Donnell brought them to his attention but the Minister did not apologise until Deputy Tom Kitt raised them at the end of the debate.  I did not see the members of Positive Action walk out of the public gallery but the Minister must have because they were in his line of vision. However, he did not flinch or apologise for almost three hours.  It reflects his attitude to the controversy that he did not realise an apology was necessary.</P>
    <P>He believes, as he has from the beginning, that this matter is all about money.  This is why he made crass statements, such as comparing the position of a hepatitis C victim to somebody falling into a pothole or comparing the issue to the beef tribunal.  However, as I have repeatedly said, this issue is not about beef, export credit <Col N="525" /> insurance or cattle, but about 1,600 people, or more, who were infected by a deadly disease by a State agency for which the Minister ultimately has political responsibility in the House.</P>
    <P>His belief that this matter is all about money also explains his refusal to give full answers to parliamentary questions and Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea's willing participation in that regard.  Both Ministers have a blind spot.  They fail to understand that this affair is about getting the truth and answers, not money.  If they had acknowledged that from the beginning, they would not have allowed the type of cover-up which has been carried out by a State agency throughout.</P>
    <P>Last night, having attacked the legal team, the Minister made a sinister remark.  He stated that if Mrs. McCole had gone to the tribunal she could have received a significantly higher award.  How does the Minister know?  This is not the first time the Minister has made such a remark.  On a previous occasion he said that as soon as the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal started making large awards, the applications would start to flow in.</P>
    <P>At the time I asked the Minister if he was expounding a Government strategy.  I also asked him what contacts he had with the tribunal and how he knew it would make large awards.  His replies did not allay my concern and I asked him to assure the House that he was not interfering with the compensation tribunal.  The Minister gave that assurance, but he still made those remarks last night.  This raises serious questions and I am concerned that eminent legal figures associated with the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal are being used in this affair.</P>
    <P>The worst remarks made by the Minister were:</P>
    <P>Could her solicitors not, in selecting a test case from the hundreds of hepatitis C cases on their books, have selected a plaintiff in a better condition to sustain the stress of a High Court case?  Was it in the interest of their client to attempt to run her case not only in the High Court, but also in the media and the Dáil simultaneously?... If we are to review the conduct of the case by the State, have not the solicitors for the plaintiff a case to answer also?</P>
    <P>The questions posed are despicably rhetorical and a battery of people are defamed by them. Legal people, Positive Action, journalists and politicians, including myself, are impugned and tarred by them.  On yesterday's Order of Business it was curious that the Taoiseach accused me of abusing the privilege of the radio.  If the issues were not so serious, this would be laughable.  As I reminded the Minister during the debate yesterday, it was almost like an eminent predecessor of the Taoiseach saying: &ldquo;Forget about the practice, what about the theory?&rdquo; As the Minister and the Taoiseach are aware, there is privilege in the House and the Minister abused it last night to make a raft of unfounded charges.  If he had made them on the radio, he would have to be indemnified by the State for dozens of legal actions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> I understand that on radio last night the Minister tried to explain his speech by saying that, while he paid attention to the facts, he did not pay attention to the comment.  However, his remarks were not made off the cuff or off the top of his head.  They were carefully crafted and scripted.  They represent about 10 per cent of the speech and contain facts and the Minister said he checked the facts.  I find it very difficult to believe he did not read the speech in advance.  Anybody who reads the Minister's speech is immediately struck by its tone.  It is not something a Minister could have missed and I fail to see how this Minister could have missed it.</P>
    <P>For the past 18 months we have relentlessly pursued the Minister for the truth in the hepatitis C affair.  Throughout that time there has been an attempt at a complete cover-up, to the point of his claim last March that the expert group had the full facts surrounding the controversy.  On 26 September last, six days after the Blood Transfusion Service Board had admitted liability and two days after the Government had been informed, the Minister withheld that information in response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Walsh on the issue.  That forced many victims to go through torture to establish the truth and to pursue actions through the courts.</P>
    <P>I have argued that the handling of the controversy, and that the Minister has done so little to ensure that the truth comes out shows his political judgment is in doubt.  That argument was reinforced by last night's episode.  The Minister continually makes the point that he was not in office when these events happened.  We have accepted that from the beginning.  The Minister has been in office for two years, however, and he admitted here yesterday evening during Question Time that he is the first Minister to have all of the facts and the full information on this.  The Minister, therefore, is responsible to this House for the public interest and for protecting public health.  He is responsible to the victims who have always demanded the truth, an admission of liability, an apology and a statutory compensation tribunal. The political buck stops with him.</P>
    <P>There has to be a question over the judgment of anybody who would deliver a speech which contained such charges and not immediately recognise their impact.  The Minister's script was more the document of a defensive individual than of a person who is accountable to this House for what even he accepts at this stage is a scandal. This is the worst scandal in the history of the State and a public health tragedy.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised to give the facts known to him, but his speech and the answers he gave during the question and answer session yesterday, although he answered many questions, fell well short of that.  He is pressurising victims to go to the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal and he has done so throughout this saga.  He did so last June when he refused to extend the application deadline for the compensation tribunal.  He signals <Col N="527" /> that the State will continue to obstruct trials and there are many veiled threats to victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that when he told the other House on 20 June last that Mrs. McCole's case would not be a judicial inquiry, he did not give the full facts because he had received a letter from the legal team representing Mrs. McCole, warning him about references to her case.  He could have said that in this House or he could have said it in the other House, but he chose not to.  He also claims that Deputies on this side of the House have criticised him for taking measures to restore public confidence in the blood supply.  He is manufacturing those attacks in an attempt to win pity.  He has not been criticised, to my knowledge, by any of the Deputies on this side of the House for any measures he takes to restore public confidence in the blood supply.  He has been criticised for not giving complete disclosure in this whole affair.</P>
    <P>There are ten questions which still deserve to be answered.  Who authorised the legal strategy followed in the Mrs. McCole legal action?  Why has the Blood Transfusion Service Board admitted liability now?  What was discovered that led to that admission of liability and how was it discovered? Why has the Minister or his Labour Party Minister of State not looked at the crucial 1976 file which was discovered during the preparatory work for the Mrs. McCole case and which the Minister has acknowledged contains a great number of documents?  For an experienced person with a controversy raging for two years while he is Minister to say that he did not at any time during that controversy examine the basic file that deals with the controversy is incredible. If the Minister for Justice came into the House and said this, she would be berated from all sides of the House.  If I was a Minister or if Deputy O'Rourke or Deputy O'Donnell were Ministers and a controversy was raging, no matter what the issue was and we admitted on the floor of the House that we had neither asked for the file nor read all the documentation in it, we would deservedly be berated in this House.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not yet asked for the file and read it.</P>
    <P>Were duplicates made of any of the documents in the 1976 file at any stage, and if there were, were they found during discovery and where? Why have the Minister and his Labour Party Minister of State declined to acknowledge that important new information is contained in that file?  I suppose they cannot because they have not read the file.  Why has the State not admitted liability in this controversy, given the unique relationship between the Department of Health, the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the National Drugs Advisory Board?  In this regard I ask the Minister not to revert to constructing a Chinese wall.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister has acknowledged, both in the terms of reference of the judicial inquiry and in the media, that the expert group <Col N="528" /> did not have the full information, why does he still insist on making the report his Bible, as he described it yesterday?  Why does he not use his own source material, given that he has access to all the relevant information as Minister for Health and the expert group report has now, as he said yesterday, been undermined?  He continues to use the expert group report as his source for all the facts and quoted from it extensively in the House yesterday.  He has used the report as his explanation why he did not refer the files to the DPP, despite his acknowledgment that the group was not able to interview all the relevant persons and did not get all the documents.</P>
    <P>Why is it now in the public interest to establish a judicial inquiry when it was not last March or indeed two weeks ago?  What did the Minister for Health know when he accepted the resignations of the Blood Transfusion Service Board executives in 1995?  Every attempt to get the truth of this affair has been frustrated.  The expert group's work was frustrated and it was not given the full facts.  The DPP has not been given the files and was driven to make an unusual public statement in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has all the information but even now we cannot get answers to specific questions we have asked.  That is why a judicial inquiry is required.  It is now clear that it is the last resort, the only way of establishing the truth and of getting the State to disclose the information that has been withheld.  I welcome the Minister's U-turn on that.  It is clear from the terms of reference that he has capitulated.  It is obvious particularly in its reference to the expert group not having the complete information, in its acknowledgement that the political handling of this matter by the Minister has to be investigated and in its reiteration that the expert group did not have complete information, some of which, such as the 1976 file, for example, was only found after the group had reported.</P>
    <P>In our amendments to the tribunal we demand that a Government decision be made directing all persons employed by the Government Departments and State agencies concerned to give their full co-operation to the tribunal in its inquiries. I am conscious of the Minister's statement this morning that it is an offence if persons required to give evidence before the tribunal do not come before it.  It is important that the Government give a direction to all such persons.  We also demand in our amendment that a Government decision be made directing all Government Departments and State agencies concerned to fully co-operate with the tribunal by providing all of the information and the documents requested of them.  We want these demands to be explicitly included in the motion.</P>
    <P>The public light has not shone into all of the areas of this affair for various reasons including a lack of co-operation by agencies and individuals in the matter.  That lack of co-operation was highlighted by the Minister who has now also confirmed that the expert group did not get all of the <Col N="529" /> relevant documents and that not all appropriate people went before the tribunal.  He still has refused to say who was not interviewed and which documents were withheld.  The truth of this has to come out.  All persons, Departments and agencies must co-operate fully with the tribunal.  I know that is the wish of the Minister but I would like him to consider very carefully whether he can incorporate that part of our amendment into the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The second element of our first amendment is to ensure that the anonymity of victims of hepatitis C is maintained, if they so wish, when they appear before the tribunal.  These people have a right to maintain their privacy and it must be protected. In paragraphs 120 to 130 of the Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry 1966, it is unclear if this right to anonymity exists.  Paragraph 122 refers to the discretion of the presiding judge and states that anonymity exists only in cases where there is a threat to the individual.</P>
    <P>To avoid any difficulties down the line about this issue, we believe it must be explicitly stated in the terms of reference.  In this way, victims who go before the inquiry in the public interest will have the right to keep their name and address confidential if they so wish.  Some may not want to avail of that but they should have the right if they so wish.  The change we envisage will mean that the evidence will be heard in public but that reporting restrictions can be applied by the presiding judge to protect the anonymity of victims. Under our amendment, only the victims can avail of this privilege; no comfort will be given to those who must be accountable.</P>
    <P>Our amendment No. a1&mdash;I apologise that it was not ready prior to this morning&mdash;involves the deletion of the words in paragraph nine in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference.  Our intention is that all of the questions of the late Mrs. McCole's family deserve to be and must be answered so that there can be no picking or choosing among the questions.  Our fear is that with the current wording the Minister and the Government are attempting to limit the scope of the inquiry, not intentionally, and will try to limit answers to the burning questions raised by the McColes.</P>
    <P>We have a number of other concerns in relation to the terms of reference which we want the Minister to address.  These relate to the scheme of compensation and the State's admission of liability.  Will the scheme of compensation be amended?  The Minister indicated to the House that if he felt it was not operating in the interests of the victims he would consider such an amendment.  Another crucial question concerns the people who take final awards.  What is their position, for example, if the judicial inquiry makes a finding of full liability?  Any admission of liability is specifically excluded under clause eight of the scheme of compensation.  The State has not admitted liability for this affair and in the light of that, and what has happened since the <Col N="530" /> compensation scheme was set up, it is important that the Minister should seriously consider amending that scheme because the goalposts have changed in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I am happy that in the terms of reference of the tribunal the chairman will first present the Minister with a report after 20 days of oral hearings. That is important and I am glad it will be discussed in this House.  There is a slight concern, however, which I am sure is shared by the Minister, that this tribunal could go on for ever and a day.  We do not want that.  The Minister admitted in his contribution that much of the information is already on the record, including the report, all of the work done by the legal team for Mrs. McCole and so on.  I ask the Minister to indicate his concern that the tribunal should finish its work in as reasonable a time as possible while ensuring we get the full truth.  That is important and it would allay a level of public concern that may exist in respect of such tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we are all experiencing a statement burnout on this issue which has been before the House on more than 20 occasions.  The Minister gave offence in his scripted remarks last night but we should accept that he has withdrawn those remarks and apologised for them, as was correct.</P>
      <P>We support the terms of reference before the House today.  They indicate that many of the concerns voiced by Members on this side of the House, and by the women concerned, have been addressed.  The measures before the tribunal will be broad yet the terms of reference are specific as well as broad.  It is essential that the political handling of this matter be incorporated into the terms of reference.  That has been done and is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Hamilton said that had questions been adequately and comprehensively replied to in this House in the period leading up to the beef tribunal, there would not have been a need for that tribunal.  Whether the scores of questions put down to the Minister on this matter were comprehensively and adequately replied to is a legitimate concern of this House if we are to learn any lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that the tribunal should have a role in examining the manner in which the State conducted its defence in the Brigid McCole case.  The Minister's remarks yesterday contained the same harshness that was evident in the State's defence in the Brigid McCole case.  The Minister tried to defend that in his contribution yesterday.  He referred to the criticisms I made that the State had tried to use the statute of limitations against Mrs. McCole.  He said the fact that it used the statute of limitations would not necessarily have been reflected on the eve of trial.  I do not accept that.  It is well known that the use of the statute of limitations against a plaintiff is designed to intimidate the plaintiff.  The plaintiff faces a 20 per cent risk that the action will be lost on that technicality of the statute.  Its use does intimidate. <Col N="531" /> It introduces that risk to the plaintiff from the beginning of the case.  The statute is only considered if it is specifically pleaded by the defendants. It was specifically pleaded by the defendants in this case.</P>
    <P>Throughout the handling of the State's defence there was an insistence on this woman losing her anonymity.  The Minister explained yesterday that the judge made a decision on that matter, but if the State had not opposed her wish for anonymity the judge would not have had to make a finding on the matter.  The State could have allowed her retain her anonymity without challenging it in the court.  Questions must be answered in regard to how the State played hardball with this unfortunate woman.</P>
    <P>Paragraph nine of the terms of reference refers only to the defence of the BTSB, as distinct from the Department of Health or the State.  Will the Minister clarify that when he replies to the debate today?  Will it be in the remit of the tribunal to examine the manner and conduct of the State's defence?  That is important.</P>
    <P>In the past ten days further information has come to light in relation to this matter.  Listening to the radio while driving to the House this morning. I heard the current medical director of the BTSB going into great detail about the contents of the file.  We have been unable to get any information from the Minister on the contents of the crucial file discovered.  The medical director described the circumstances in which the file was found.  I got more information on that crucial file listening to Pat Kenny's radio programme this morning than I have every received from questioning the Minister.  I sometimes wonder if we are wasting our time in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been more forthcoming to the media than he has been to this House.  Now the current officers of the BTSB are talking very openly about the contents of this crucial file.  I find that amazing, and I reiterate that we are unable in this House to act in the public interest and extract information from the Government.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the official tendency to withhold information that very little of our information has come from official sources.  By far the most significant revelation made to me by a constituent is that there is positive proof that the condition of the six anti-D patients was considered, as early as 1977, to be linked to their treatment with anti-D.  It appears this information was passed at the time to the Blood Bank and the State agency with responsibility for infectious diseases. Many of the victims and their families have become so irritated by the bland, meaningless and self-serving statements from official quarters that they are themselves making public material from which a picture is beginning to emerge.  Last week, for example, the McCole family made public the harsh, narrow and threatening terms on which settlement was offered to them on 20 September. That harsh tone was still evident last night in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Since then the family of another victim have told me of their experiences and shown me certain documentation in the case which became available at various times right up to their recent appearances before the compensation tribunal.  I have read the transcript of the evidence before the compensation tribunal.  It was compelling reading because it outlined the individual tragedy not only of the woman, who has had the most significant symptoms since receiving anti-D in 1977, but of her entire family who have been damaged by that contamination.  She has been sick since the birth of her third child and this continues right up to the present.  She has had the most significant symptoms which have literally, as was said to the compensation tribunal, deprived her of her life plan.</P>
    <P>It is only when one reads individual cases that one sees the enormity of the scandal.  The difficulty right from the beginning has been that they were treated as a group, and the horror of the individual tragedy never really captured the public imagination until Mrs. McCole died, when her individual tragedy was brought home to the people.  By reading the transcript of the compensation tribunal's proceedings I was allowed, in a most intimate way, to read the detail of this woman's illness over the years, the terrible symptoms she had from the very beginning&mdash;nausea, ulcerated eyes, phenomenal fatigue, itch all over her body, total lack of energy; she could not lift her new baby to feed him but had to send him away to her family to be looked after.  She suffered headaches and was never able to take her family on a holiday.  She developed a defect in her immune system and a myeloma which is a form of cancer.</P>
    <P>Her husband's evidence was harrowing.  His life changed completely.  He said: &ldquo;My wife got tired after the baby was born, everything stopped overnight, my life changed like that.&rdquo;  Her eldest son had difficulty relating to his mother.  She said: &ldquo;My son grew away from me.  He resented me.&rdquo; He resented her persistent illness.  One can imagine what it would be like for three children whose mother is constantly in bed, unable to do anything, chronically fatigued.</P>
    <P>This woman is one of six women who was diagnosed as having hepatitis, who showed chronic symptoms of hepatitis, having received anti-D in 1977.  I have seen letters which were put forward to the tribunal which indicate that her own GP linked her hepatitis with anti-D, immediately followed it up and sent her to a consultant.  That consultant determined the link and passed the information on to the BTSB.  Another consultant to whom she was referred by her obstetrician when she went back for her six week check independently confirmed that her hepatitis was linked to anti-D.  The note from that consultant to the woman's obstetrician stated: &ldquo;Just a note to confirm our conversation.  I think this is serum hepatitis, probably associated with the anti-D serum which she had.  Its six week incubation period would fit and the function test would indicate a <Col N="533" /> hepatitis cellular type of jaundice.  I am sure this is the explanation&rdquo;.  At that point in 1977 senior consultants were in contact with the BTSB informing it of their concern that anti-D was linked to this woman's illness.</P>
    <P>One question I asked the Minister when we were being briefed and which he has not answered is whether the transcripts of all the cases which have come before the compensation tribunal will be available to the new tribunal of inquiry, because there is cogent and compelling evidence of early knowledge of the link between anti-D and the jaundice of six women who developed it having had anti-D.  It is important that they are available.</P>
    <P>From this it emerges quite clearly that when this woman's symptoms began within months of being administered anti-D her GP immediately connected it with that occurrence.  The doctor said: &ldquo;I was quite sure that she had acquired something from anti-D initially.  What it was I was not certain&rdquo;.  Still in the calendar year 1977 the GP referred her for specialist investigation, specifically raising the question as to whether her symptoms could be due to the anti-D injection. The GP continued to express his concern.  On 4 October 1977 he was told in writing that a named consultant had been in touch with a named doctor in the Blood Bank stating: &ldquo;we are following up your suggestion concerning the anti-D.&rdquo;  This is a letter from a separate consultant making the link with anti-D.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, no idea of what precisely was done by the BTSB or any other agencies in the course of this follow-up of this woman.  What is clear is that there exists irrefutable documentary evidence for the proposition that the symptoms of jaundice accompanied by crippling fatigue and other conditions had been specifically linked to anti-D at an extremely early stage. Despite this persons were still being infected 17 or 18 years later.</P>
    <P>These facts cry out for explanation.  That is why we are having a tribunal of inquiry.  The facts also underline the vital link between the events at the beginning of the saga in the mid and late 1970s and much more recent events in the mid 1990s. That is why I am glad that the inquiry covers the period up to the present.  It must do so if its work is to be convincing.</P>
    <P>In the case to which I referred, which was passed to me by my constituent, the symptoms have tragically continued right up to the present time.  They were also persistent throughout the period between 1977 and the present day.  This gives the lie to the suggestion that the first batch of women who developed jaundice recovered and became symptom free, which is the line advanced to the Hederman-O'Brien expert group.  At paragraph 3.15 on page 23 the expert group referred to this woman who was one of the six as follows:</P>
    <P>In 1977, the BTSB was notified of six women who had developed clinical jaundice some weeks after receiving Anti-D immunoglobulin. We were told that these cases were fully investigated <Col N="534" /> at the time, and that the women and the implicated batches of Anti-D tested negative for Hepatitis B Virus.  Hepatitis C Virus had not yet been identified as a separate virus (this did not occur until 1989) and the jaundice in these women was, according to the BTSB, attributed to environmental factors.</P>
    <P>That is completely at variance with the medical correspondence I have seen.  Those cases were not fully investigated.  Nobody contacted that woman after she went to her two consultants.  She has been receiving treatment since 1977.  Nobody from the Blood Transfusion Service Board contacted that woman until 1994.  In paragraph 3.43 the Blood Transfusion Service Board explains why it took no action on the Middlesex letter: &ldquo;No immediate action was taken as the index cases were originally reported as having fully recovered...&rdquo;. They could never have been reported as having fully recovered.  This woman has been sick since 1977.  Paragraph 3.49 of the report states: &ldquo;We could find no written evidence regarding the BTSB's conclusion that the six cases were attributable to environmental factors... &rdquo;.  Five of the patients live in a localised geographical zone on the northside of Dublin city but there appears to be no written evidence from that time that the BTSB attributed the cases to environmental factors.</P>
    <P>The transcripts from the tribunal will have to be available to the inquiry because there are so many inconsistencies in the expert group report, which is available to the inquiry, and the evidence I have seen in one case &mdash; one of those women who are referred to as the index cases &mdash; that it would not get the full story otherwise.  It is true that in the period upto 1989 hepatitis C had not been scientifically described.  Its full description in that year has made possible various associations with other symptoms and conditions which will, no doubt, eventually lead to a fuller understanding of the otology of the condition.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible and unreasonable to expect the present state of knowledge to have been available in 1977 or for many years after. None of this takes from the seriousness of the fact that a connection was established 19 years ago, not simply between anti-D administration and the symptoms which arose shortly after it but between specific administrations of anti-D from ascertainable batches and those symptoms in specific identified patients.  It is the failure to act on this connection which provides the gravest cause for concern.  In this failure lie the seeds of the enormous tragedy for many persons subsequently infected.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of the Minister being able to restore confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board until all these questions, and many others raised by the same facts, are fully and comprehensively answered.  The facts which allowed the GP, to whom I have referred, to make the connection with the anti-D treatment 19 years ago, were communicated both to the <Col N="535" /> blood bank and the State agency responsible for infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>It is of great importance that the subsequent actions of all State agencies involved are fully disclosed. It is not helpful to the obvious concerns raised that hepatitis C was not fully described until more than a decade afterwards, nor is it an answer to say that the jaundice which was the first symptom in most or all of these cases cleared or abated.  There was ample evidence of a pattern of symptoms which included what went far beyond jaundice.  That case raises in a uniquely tragic way the obligation of the State and all its agencies to make proper disclosure about their own doings. An article in a Sunday newspaper recently remarked that we live in a Civil Service culture of minimum blame and minimum disclosure.  That is absolutely true.</P>
    <P>There has been a complete reluctance and a resistance to be open with information on this matter from the beginning.  I hope the tribunal will be able to discover not only the medical facts but will be able to look into the cover-up of the medical facts which is at the heart of the scandal.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the public interest is represented separately.  This was an issue which arose in the beef tribunal and it was a matter of some concern that there was no separate representation in the public interest.  I am glad that the Minister informed the House that the public interest will be represented.  The public interest will ensure that all the facts come out and establish what went wrong, who was responsible and how a similar situation can be avoided.  There would be a clear conflict if the public interest was not separately represented.  The State has so many questions to answer that the Attorney General could not represent the public interest.  It will then be open to the team representing the public interest to challenge evidence that is put forward or rubbished by the other side.  That is what will happen in the tribunal.  If one side puts up some evidence the job of the other side in the adversarial system is to rubbish it or discredit it.  Because the public interest will be separately represented it will be able to make comments and ensure that at all times it comes to the fore and is represented.  I support the motion and the amendments put down by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  It is vital that anonymity is preserved, and I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister for Health set out in detail his position on the hepatitis C scandal.  He spoke about the deep distress and justifiable anger it had caused and the need to know and understand.  He outlined in detail his views on the legal and political issues and his responsibility in relation to them. In doing so, at one point in his speech he was grossly insensitive to the feelings of hepatitis C victims.  He is not the first man in this House to wound the feelings of women and, in the nature <Col N="536" /> of human discourse between women and men, it is unlikely that he will be the last.  He did wrong in what he said and he did right in apologising so swiftly and unreservedly.  Ultimately, a man must be judged on his actions.  In this regard the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has shown energy, commitment and intelligence in dealing fairly with what from the victims' point of view is a profoundly unfair and destructive force in their lives.  He has responded to their needs for treatment and compensation and is setting about establishing the tribunal to meet their need for truth.</P>
      <P>Nothing he does can rewrite history for the victims. Nothing he does can undo the tragedy and the terrible affliction the women are suffering. Nothing he does can undo the deep sense of betrayal felt by women who put their trust in an institution, the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which ended up destroying their health and well-being.</P>
      <P>He has inherited a complex and as yet not fully told saga of damage and neglect.  It extends back over 20 years and over the stewardship of many Ministers for Health.  None of these Ministers can be held responsible for the tragedy.  In meeting the needs of those so terribly affected the Minister has shown himself not just to be a good Minister but also a good man.  The tribunal which he is establishing is mandated to elicit the answers to some very specific queries and to address clearly defined issues.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the hepatitis C affair, a medical and human tragedy spanning two decades, should ever be used as a party political football.  It appears that no Minister for Health from 1976 to 1994 was aware of what was happening in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  That lack of accountability is at the centre of this issue and one of the results of the tribunal must be to prevent a recurrence, either in the health service or in any other area of administration.  As politicians and legislators we all bear responsibility for the proper functioning of the State and its institutions.  It is clear that the Blood Transfusion Service Board did not function properly for many years.  Rather than acting in the interests of public health, the negligence displayed by the board militated against the health of women.</P>
      <P>Medical science is a fallible discipline and is constantly changing.  No medical practitioner in any field would act in any given situation today precisely as he would have acted 20 or even ten years ago.  The changing and developing nature of medical knowledge is only one of the matters which will have to be taken account of not only by the tribunal but by all of us in trying to make sense of this tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what conclusions the tribunal of inquiry will reach but we must ensure that they are heeded and that any recommendations are fully implemented without delay.  We owe it to the women affected to discover not only what happened &mdash; we know that only too well &mdash; but why it happened.  We owe it to future generations to ensure that the errors made during the past <Col N="537" /> two decades are never repeated.  If at the end of its inquiries the tribunal finds that anyone acted in a way which was criminally negligent or reckless then we must ensure that appropriate action is taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions. We owe it to the women concerned and society at large to ensure that there is no hint of official or judicial tolerance of the events surrounding the hepatitis C affair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has never known a health scandal to match the one being presided over by the Minister for Health.  The health of citizens is of the utmost concern to society and while it is a scandal when the Government fails to provide adequate services for those who are sick it defies description when the incompetence of its agencies endangers the lives of people who are otherwise perfectly healthy.</P>
      <P>Given the extent of the scandal being discussed today, it is amazing and insulting in equal measure that the Minister should have shown such insensitivity in the House last night.  The Minister has apologised and Positive Action has accepted his apology, but his insensitivity has hurt all women.  A number of steps can be taken to rectify this and to restore confidence.  I support the points made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn about the insensitivity shown by the Minister and the Government.  Now that the Minister has apologised we should be able to move forward and adopt a more sensitive approach to a number of issues.</P>
      <P>It was bad enough for the McCole family to lose their mother but it was worse to know that the State was responsible and that her death could have been avoided.  These women expect the State to do everything possible to help them and their families and do not expect insensitive comments.  I am not referring only to the Minister's comments last night but also to the insensitivity shown by the Government earlier in the week when it compared the tribunal with the beef tribunal.  I plead with the Government and the Minister to adopt a more sensitive approach to this matter.  It is important to remember that we are dealing with women whose health has been affected as a result of the actions of State agencies. Deputies have referred to some of the difficulties experienced by these women.  Every time we refer to this matter we should remember that these women are listening to what is being said and that the matter needs to be dealt with in a sensitive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I spoke to women who will undergo the interferon treatment which has been described not as a cure but as a slowing down process.  These women know that the treatment will be difficult, yet they are prepared to undergo it in the hope that it will help them so that they and their families can live some kind of normal life.  Given the lack of confidence in the Department of Health, the BTSB and the NDAB, it is important for the Government to reassure these women and to recognise the real human concerns <Col N="538" /> being expressed by Positive Action and the people it represents.  The Government must ensure that the last offensive comment, which only serves to deepen the hurt felt by the victims, has been made.  It must also remember that it is dealing with women who have been made ill as a result of factors outside their control, women who expected to leave hospital as healthy as when they entered but who instead were very badly treated.  It is important that these women are dealt with in a sensitive manner in the future.</P>
    <P>On the question of anonymity, the Minister and his advisers must have been aware of the use of fictitious names in cases involving members of the Irish Haemophilia Society.  It is wrong to continue to fight these people and I hope the Minister's apology signals the end of the Government's insensitive approach.  These people must be treated for what they are, that is victims of the State, people who should have had their health protected by the Department of Health but who were made ill by State agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government further displayed its insensitivity on 17 June by trying to force the women to go to the compensation tribunal.  It now has an opportunity to show good faith with these women by telling them it will look again at those cases which are due to be dealt with within the next few months.  I join with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in calling on the Government to deal with this matter immediately.  It is unfortunate that those women whose cases will be heard in the coming months should be faced with the dilemma of withdrawing from the compensation tribunal and taking their case to court.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister referred to the areas with which the tribunal will deal.  However, the results of the inquiry could have a major bearing on cases taken to court.  If a decision is not taken by the Government immediately, there will be numerous requests for adjournments at the compensation tribunal.  For example, a person whose case is due to come before the compensation tribunal next week will regard it as worthwhile to wait for the results of the tribunal of inquiry and request an adjournment.  It must be obvious to the Minister and his advisers that this is what will happen and that a huge number of adjournments will be requested in the coming months until such time as the tribunal of inquiry has reported.  The date by which an award must be accepted or rejected should, therefore, be extended to one month after the tribunal has reported.  If the Government does not allow that, the compensation tribunal will grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to those who have already accepted awards.  Those cases will have to be reconsidered.  Under the new umbrella of apologies and promises to do better the next time, is it possible to extend the period for rejection or acceptance of awards already made until one month after the inquiry reports?</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister's expression last night when asked about a deadline for the inquiry submitting a report.  Under the circumstances he may <Col N="539" /> not wish to set an early date in that regard, but he must indicate a final date.  He stated the matter will be examined after the 20th day, but if he sets a final date for reporting and the tribunal is unable to meet it, at least we would have a report giving the reasons for that.  The dilemma of these women increases when they do not know when the inquiry will report.  Following yesterday's events, the Minister would show good faith by taking this line of action.</P>
    <P>Many of the women concerned receive assistance through the under-funded home help scheme, but this assistance will cease when their cases are finalised.  They will want to continue to receive assistance through the home help scheme from the personnel who took care of their children up to now.  That scheme should be considered in a separate context in terms of hepatitis C victims.</P>
    <P>Positive Action has made a great input to this issue.  Will the Minister provide adequate funding to enable it retain its office, co-ordinator and free telephone line?  The more coverage the issue gets, the more women will need to contact Positive Action.  Will he also ensure a proper comprehensive counselling service is provided?</P>

      <P>As I have spoken on this issue on a number of previous occasions.  I will try not to repeat what I have already said.  I will direct my remarks solely to the tribunal of inquiry whose establishment I welcome.  It is important that the former Chief Justice Finlay, who will sit on the tribunal, has the necessary terms of reference to allow all matters which are currently of public concern, and about which there is a great deal of confusion and conflicting allegations, to be resolved.  It is also important that the concept of accountability and responsibility over all the years of this tragedy is fully addressed.  In setting out the tribunal's terms of reference we should not divorce from its consideration the manner in which the State conducted itself in defending cases in the courts brought by victims of contaminated blood products who have contracted hepatitis C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a lawyer I hold a view that may surprise some Members.  On occasion people take lawyers and their advice far too seriously and do not question whether implementation of the advice given to say, a Government body, Department, a Minister or State agency, such as the BTSB, should result in the action proposed by lawyers whose job it is to defend the interests of the body concerned.  When lawyers advise the State or State agencies on proceedings, policy decisions should be made on whether the advice given will result in action which is justified and in the public interest or if the advice and the natural reaction to it will result in action that is not justified or in the public interest.  There should not be an unquestioning acceptance of legal advice given on the tactics to be deployed in defending court cases.  This should be a matter of concern for <Col N="540" /> Government, Government agencies and private individuals.  In doing their best to defend the position of clients, some lawyers may adopt tactics which are not appropriate to the circumstances to which they relate.  In the context of the special characteristics of the proceedings brought by the late Brigid McCole and others who have contracted hepatitis C, in particular the proceedings brought against the BTSB, greater consideration should have been given to the impact on victims of the legal tactics deployed in court cases.  That matter should fall within the terms of reference of the tribunal.  Lawyers acting for the State must be accountable for their actions, as must those who instruct them to act in a particular way.  I hate the connection between this and the background to the proceedings in this House which resulted in an inquiry into the behaviour of successive Attorneys General.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues raised by the McCole family fall outside the remit of the tribunal.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn drew our attention to this today in the context of paragraph nine of the terms of reference.  The words &ldquo;In so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo; may seem unduly obscure, but I understand &mdash; I would like the Minister to clarify this &mdash; they exclude from the remit of the tribunal the fifth question raised by the McCole family.  In their letter of 20 September 1996 they state that the Blood Transfusion Service Board admitted liability and apologised, but only in the context of a threat that were Brigid McCole to proceed with a case of aggravated or exemplary damages and not succeed it would pursue her for costs.  The McCole family asked about the justification for that.  The only justification for it was to put pressure on Brigid McCole not to pursue the issue of aggravated damages because it might have been to her financial detriment.</P>
    <P>The policy issue which resulted in the BTSB issuing that threat should be considered by the tribunal.  We are entitled to ask if it was justified or in the public interest to make such a threat in the context of the background to the awful tragedy which has befallen those who have contracted hepatitis C.  I do not believe we can regard it as lawyers operating in some sort of legal vacuum using legal mystique in their language and that none of this is relevant.  It is relevant for a particular reason.  Not only does that approach add a very serious financial threat to the other distress facing those proceeding through the courts, it fails to recognise that it is in the public interest to establish whether those seeking aggravated damages here are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>In all sorts of cases where defendants have lost over the years the courts have granted costs in their favour where the issues pursued have been in the public interest.  There have been cases where people who have lost in court have not only not had to pick up the bill for the State's lawyers, but the State has had to pick up the bill for their lawyers.  The most recent case that comes to mind in that context is that brought by <Col N="541" /> the former Senator, Des Hanafin, in which he contested the validity of the outcome of the divorce referendum and appealed his case to the Supreme Court and lost.  However, the Supreme Court did not order that he pay the State's cost of the Supreme Court hearing, instead it required the State to pay his costs on the basis that it was a public interest issue.  If the issue of aggravated damages must end up being resolved by litigation in the courts, as it is one of relevance to so many people it is one in which there is a genuine public interest to have resolved and that type of threat in relation to costs should not be left hanging in the air.</P>
    <P>There are a few other questions relating to the conduct of proceedings, one of which was referred to by a number of speakers and, in fairness to the Minister, dealt with by him yesterday, the reasons the late Bríd McCole was not granted anonymity.  It was not granted because it became an issue for the court to determine and the judge who determined it held that under the Constitution she was not entitled to anonymity.  I wish to refer to two issues in that context.  As a lawyer it has been my experience over the years that in a court case in the civil area in which there may be some particularly personalised matter about which the courts are concerned that on occasions the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant will jointly ask the judge to request the media not to publish the name of the person processing proceedings and that he or she be granted anonymity. That is not about the court making a judicial decision in a contested situation to grant anonymity, it is where both sides agree that the media should be asked to give a person anonymity and in my experience the media have always done so when they have been asked.  That could have been done here, but it was not.  That is a policy issue.  The lawyers could properly advise that based on our current law Bríd McCole was not entitled to anonymity as a right.  That was totally correct legal advice and proved to be so in the context of the court decision on that issue, but as a matter of policy it could have been agreed between the lawyers on both sides that the judge be asked to request the media to give her anonymity and that neither her name nor address be reported in the newspapers.  From my experience that would have happened in practice.  The policy behind the manner in which the cases have been dealt, particularly this case, in regard to the anonymity rule should be a matter for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is also another issue.  It has been rightly said that Article 34 of the Constitution requires justice to be administered in public, but Article 34.1 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law...&rdquo; If parties cannot agree on it and if the courts will not do it, this House has the capacity to pass simple legislation which would provide that any of those who issue or are involved in the proceedings seeking damages as a result of this awful tragedy in the civil courts shall be granted <Col N="542" /> anonymity or that the extent of which the case is open to the public shall be limited.  There are old provisions dating back to the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, in relation to family law proceedings and section 14 of that Act allows for reporting of general matters in court cases while keeping certain aspects of them out of the public domain.  That could have been done by agreement in relation to Bríd McCole.  The courts could not do it where there was a contest, but it could be done in this House by way of legislation. It should have been done and should now be done.  I assume I am right in the assumption that Members on this side of the House will not oppose one of the amendments proposed by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn which requests that the Minister should inform Chief Justice Finlay that it would be the desire of this House that the victims be granted anonymity.  They should be granted anonymity.  Is it not extraordinarily inconsistent that those who come before the tribunal of inquiry and the compensation tribunal should be granted anonymity, but that it should continue to be denied to those who come before our courts to resolve the issue of aggravated damages? That issue should be dealt with.  The policy issue as to what led to the making of those decisions should be dealt with by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have great difficulty in adopting an approach which would oppose any of the amendments tabled by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on this motion.  They all express sentiments with which everyone in this House should agree.  The Minister's extensive remit given to the tribunal covers nine-tenths of what must be dealt with and he deserves praise for that.  The House, in performing a legislative function, has an entitlement to add minor amendments to the terms of reference. I hope we will agree to the amendments proposed.</P>
    <P>I hope the message will go out from all sides of this House without political contention that we want relevant issues examined and resolved to the fullest possible extent by the tribunal so that when it reports no one will be able to say that the full background and full truth is not in the public. domain.</P>

      <P>This has been a bad week in politics for the Government.  The handling of the hepatitis C issue has raised the questions whether this is a caring Government and if it realises the sensitivities of the issue.  A grave injustice has been done to women.  It is bad enough to have erred in the medical field, but to compound that issue with a wrong in the political handling of the issue in a very insensitive manner leads one to believe that this Government has become too smug, too confident in itself, untouchable and does not know what is happening in the greater world, especially in relation to the hepatitis C issue.  Perhaps the Government came into office at a good time when there was plenty of money which had been secured from the EU by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> It was a bad week for women and their husbands and families.  The issue has been compounded by the handling of the farming issue by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. He has single-handedly divided the country North and South in his handling of the Russian beef deal.  This shows that the problem of insensitivity and the lack of ability to deal with issues in the manner in which they should be dealt is infectious.  I could give other examples, including the handling by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, of the transport section which has divided management and workers.  There was no proper consultation and perhaps this is the issue here also.  If there had been proper consultation with the women involved, this issue could have been solved long ago.  As if it was not bad enough that Ministers are in conflict with the people, backbenchers are also confused.  Deputy Crawford is trying to defend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in Monaghan and Deputy Ring does not know which side of the House he is on in regard to the deflector system.  He recently said one thing in Mayo in defence of that system and asked the Taoiseach to comply with what he stated in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making the point that the Government and its backbenchers do not know where they stand on issues concerning the people. The Government is insensitive to the needs of the people, as has been demonstrated by its reaction to the hepatitis C problem.  The problems have existed since 1970.  When a donor and recipients became jaundiced the bells should have rung and all the anti-D product should have been discarded. A thorough analysis of the procedures should have been undertaken, but unfortunately that was not done.  In the 1990s a Middlesex hospital sent out another signal, but that was not answered.  Between 1991 and 1993 improved tests came on-stream and at last the conclusion was arrived at that there was a real problem.  Yet again, however, the Blood Transfusion Service Board was slow in informing donors and recipients of what was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liability should have been admitted earlier.  It is now admitted case by case.  The women involved will be asked serious questions on the issue and each case will be dealt with separately in the courts.  The cases of those who have gone through the other system are not being heard swiftly enough.  There are many problems that have not been addressed.  The Minister has now done a U-turn and accepted responsibility in this matter.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, a Chinese wall has been put up between the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the medicines board and the Department of Health, but in the last <Col N="544" /> analysis responsibility lies with the Minister for Health who must deal with the issues.  Unfortunately they have not been dealt with compassionately up to now.  Let us hope the judicial inquiry will discover what went wrong.</P>
    <P>Procedures must be implemented to ensure the Blood Transfusion Service Board is reliable so that the same thing does not happen again.  It will not be sufficient to have self-regulation.  There should be international observers to ensure the Blood Transfusion Service Board is up to international standards.  A meeting of EU members took place in Adare to discuss blood transfusions and blood product, and I hope some of the proposals discussed there will be implemented.  I welcome the judicial inquiry and the 20 day report, which will give us an opportunity to examine what has been going on.  I hope the inquiry will not continue <i>ad infinitum</i> but will be concluded swiftly.  The women involved want an acknowledgement that mistakes have been made.  Compensation is not the primary factor in this whole saga.</P>

      <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry.  I would prefer to forget many of the events leading up to today's decision. With the setting up of the tribunal of inquiry to determine the facts, the deep wish of all the victims is being met.</P>
      <P>The unreserved apology by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, last night to Positive Action and the McCole family for any hurt caused by his comments was accepted by Positive Action.  It is a pity the Opposition parties cannot show the graciousness and understanding shown by Positive Action.  By accepting the apology it has proven that its primary purpose is to find out the truth, and I hope that will be done.</P>
      <P>We must not forget that during the coming months victims will have to endure deteriorating health because of this scandal.  We must not allow our minds to divert from the victims and their families.  On behalf of Positive Action and the applicants concerned I request the Minister to extend for one month beyond the report of the tribunal of inquiry, the time limit whereby those who have had their cases heard in the tribunal can decide whether they will accept their award. At present they have one month within which to consider the award offered, but in view of the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry the time limit should be extended.  I am delighted the Minister is taking my request seriously and I expect a positive response from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that victims continue to be looked after.  Sufficient funding should be made available by the Department of Health to health boards to provide a comprehensive home help service to those who are suffering.  Standards of <Col N="545" /> payment should be realistic.  It would be unfair to provide inadequate pay to those who help victims of hepatitis C with their domestic duties.  The existing rigid system of means testing in assessment for home help services should be modified to accommodate the special needs of hepatitis C sufferers.</P>
    <P>Facilities, resources and funding should continue to be made available to Positive Action which has done an excellent job to maintain its office and co-ordinator, to provide a free telephone line and to establish and develop a comprehensive counselling service for women infected with hepatitis C.  I believe the Minister will respond positively and generously to these requests.</P>
    <P>The victims want to know the truth.  The terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry allow sufficient scope to obtain the information they need. We look forward to receiving its report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the anger and outrage of a great many people that so many people have suffered for reasons beyond their control.  I also share the concern that we ensure that those who have been so injured are properly dealt with by the State and that this type of thing does not happen again.</P>
      <P>Not alone must justice be done it must be seen to be done.  For that reason I fully support the proposal by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that the Government should give a clear and explicit direction to people involved in State agencies and other relevant bodies to co-operate fully with the tribunal in its work.  This is implicit in its terms of reference but, not alone must justice be done it must be seen to be done.  Given the enormous emotional hurt people feel, apart from the dreadful physical damage being caused, making sure justice is seen to be done is as important now as making sure it is done.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully yesterday and today to Dr. Joan Power of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and this morning to its medical director.  It is a great pity what they said was not brought out much sooner.  It illustrated one unfortunate aspect of this matter, that political considerations have often been allowed to obscure problems and the need for remedies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn made a consummate political speech this morning in which she portrayed the Minister in the worst possible light and left hanging a series of questions which, quintessentially, the tribunal has been established to address. As a politician I have to admire her forensic skills but she did not add anything to her concern about the issue.  This is not in any sense to run down her very real concern about the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to Dr. Joan Power of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and its medical director this morning, it seems that part of the hurt people feel in this catastrophe derives from something which is part of the psyche of medical practice here &mdash; our medical practitioners need to <Col N="546" /> think about this in common humanity.  For far too long medical practitioners and those connected with medical practice seem to have taken the view that they should tell people as little as possible about what is affecting them, apparently, in the expectation that they will not be able to deal with the information.  That attitude has proven to be one of the most emotionally damaging things in the whole case.  Medical practice should finally catch up with the fact that when people are dealing with serious illness they need to be given the fullest possible information at the earliest possible moment.  In cases such as this, where any doubt arises the potential damage and emotional upset that may be caused to a patient by expressing a doubt early without being able to put a name on it is far less severe than the damage that may be caused by waiting for a long period and then telling people that it is much more serious than expected.</P>
    <P>I fully support the proposal in the amendment that the anonymity of victims should be protected in the course of the work of the tribunal.  I understand this would present legal difficulties in the context of a tribunal but we should not leave it at that.  If there are legal difficulties it is our job to overcome them.  Deputy Shatter suggested ways in which this can be done.  We are faced on the one hand perhaps with a legal difficulty and on the other with a deep human need which has to win out over the legal difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to establish a tribunal of inquiry and wish the former Chief Justice, Tom Finlay, all the best in conducting it.  I am glad the Government has decided to take certain steps to ensure a limitation on the cost to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I said some months ago that the victims of this dreadful condition want a degree of open government, the kind of open government provided in the Constitution by the proceedings and procedures of the High Court in which there is an exchange of pleadings, full discovery of written documentation and an oral hearing in a contested action in which the facts at issue can be established. For some reason the Minister decided this option should not be made available to plaintiffs.</P>
      <P>From the start the Minister, as a named defendant in various claims, was in a position to expedite the hearing of a particular claim and allow the victims of this condition make an informed decision on the best legal option open to them, but he was not prepared to take that route.  Instead, an attempt was made to coerce claimants into accepting the scheme devised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not want to criticise that scheme in great detail as it has many fine features but I object to the Minister's attitude which was to virtually compel victims to take this route.  This created a bad climate of opinion among the victims of this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the approach the Minister took and it culminated yesterday in his extraordinary <Col N="547" /> decision to condemn the legal advisers of the victims group.  I welcome the Minister's apology for that.  At the end of the day the people concerned feel isolated and are still not fully aware of the circumstances which led to this condition.  The Minister was purporting to give them legal advice on the best course of action for them to take and at the same time was a defendant in the claims being prosecuted on their behalf.  That is a contradictory position.  I am glad the Minister resiled from that contradiction and I welcome the fact that he has apologised to the House for his behaviour to date.  If Deputy Dukes was still in the House he would say I am engaging in political muck raking, but I am not.  This has a direct bearing on the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Our spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has tabled an amendment to delete the words &ldquo;in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo; in paragraph 9.  This may seem an arcane amendment but, as Deputy Shatter pointed out, it is material to the Minister's responsibility in this matter.  Paragraph 9 is an attempt to let the Minister out of the loop as far as this inquiry is concerned. The phrase, &ldquo;in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo;, means that the various issues in relation to the conduct of the State defence to the legal proceedings, which are issued on behalf of the hepatitis C victims, will not be examined by this tribunal.</P>
    <P>I question the involvement of a third legal team at this tribunal.  The issue of whether the Attorney General's role should be divided between his role as legal adviser to the Government and guardian of the public interest was discussed in the report of the constitutional review group.  I understand the Taoiseach said that the volume of work the Attorney General must perform in his function as guardian of the public interest was so limited it did not justify the establishment of a separate office.  Yet, a separate office is being established for the purposes of this tribunal of inquiry.  It is not clear who will retain these guardians of the public interest.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify who will appoint, retain and instruct these lawyers.  If they are guarding the public interest, they cannot march into the tribunal and seek an interview with the population of Ireland as their clients.  They must take instructions from some person or body as regards the conduct of their business before the tribunal.  I seek clarification from the Minister about what these guardians of the public interest will do at the tribunal.  Who appoints, pays and retains them and who tells them what to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference for the judicial tribunal will lead to the facts without delay. Positive Action, a group which has represented the women who have been infected with hepatitis C, has been committed to presenting its case and to getting the truth, which is what it wants more than <Col N="548" /> anything else.  Nothing will compensate the women, their families or children for this appalling illness they have contracted but it is extremely important to find out the reasons this happened.</P>
      <P>This is another scandal in a series of scandals related to women's health.  Women have fought to have their voices heard in the IUD scandal and the Diethylstilbestrol scandal in recent years.  It seems we still have a long way to go before an equitable partnership is developed between consumers and the health service, including the Department of Health.  There is a lot to be learned from this case about how partnerships can be developed and consumers' voices heard. It does not just apply to people receiving blood products.</P>
      <P>It is disturbing that a tribunal has been required. In many ways it reflects a lack of progress in the health sector in general to recognise and respond positively to demands from citizens that it should be able to know everything about their medical situation. People have changed but the system changes slowly, particularly when it must admit mistakes.  The health sector has found it difficult to accept the concept of making mistakes, which have terrible consequences.  There was a time when the patient accepted that the power lay with the medical professions or institutions.  However, ignorance, whether of our rights or our bodies, is a thing of the past.  Now we expect a respectful relationship which treats the individual as part of the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>This scandal will mark a watershed in relationships between the consumer and the State and between the consumer and the medical profession and the health service.  However, we have a long way to go before we have all the facts at our disposal.  There has been a drip feed of information which appears to be the way our procedures work, despite the best wishes of the Minister or the Department.  The problem lies in the interaction between politics and the legal system. Yesterday the Minister was accused of insensitivity for which he apologised.  I have asked many questions about the insensitivity of the legal system. Women's experience of the legal system must be examined in this regard.  Many of the same issues have come up in cases of sexual assault or rape.  We should analyse this problem more than we have done to date.</P>
      <P>The legal system has huge power in this country. We are lucky to have a democracy and a strong Constitution, but we should look at how legalities determine issues.  For those of us outside the legal system it can be extremely difficult to fathom why certain decisions are taken.  We should try to change it.  Positive Action is frustrated at the legal system and this causes difficulties in the health sector when people try to respond to these problems. The interaction between politics and the legal system is also complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister receives strong legal advice that patients cannot have anonymity at this tribunal, then we should question it.  From where has this tradition evolved and can it be changed?  If we <Col N="549" /> can protect anonymity in cases of child abuse, why not in a tribunal of inquiry?  The first two amendments about compelling people to attend and seeking documentation make a lot of sense. Although nothing will compensate these people for what they have suffered, we should learn from this case.</P>
    <P>It may have been common practice in the past to decide what was good for the patient and to determine whether they should be informed and how much information they should be given. However, expectations have changed.  It is interesting to note how little detailed discussion there has been about the health services for those affected.  What are their families' needs and how will the health boards respond to them?  We should ensure the health boards have the information they need to help these women and their families.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Theresa Ahearn's call for a month's extension to allow these women to decide if they will accept what is being offered to them by the compensation tribunal.  We should also support Positive Action.  The relationship between any lobby group and a Department will always be uneasy.  We should do the best we can to ensure an open approach to Positive Action's needs so that it can continue the work it has done so professionally.</P>
    <P>Let us also recognise that the actions taken and the health care services put in place by the Minister have been strong and pro-active, and probably mean that this country leads the way in Europe in dealing with people infected with hepatitis C.  We should not lose sight of the fact that in setting up a compensation tribunal, providing health care and doing research to understand hepatitis C, Deputy Noonan has been more pro-active than any other Minister for Health in Europe.  We should acknowledge that, while also stating that further progress must be made in creating a greater partnership in the health service between consumers, doctors, Departments, NGOs and voluntary groups.  The Department of Social Welfare has worked on a plan to analyse the roles and responsibilities of voluntary groups and Departments alike.  If citizenship and democracy are to mean what they should mean as we move towards the year 2000, we must address issues of gender democracy and the relationship between the citizen and the State.  This saga is a watershed in that regard.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The last occasion when this subject was discussed at length was when the Select Committee on Social Affairs considered earlier legislation. The issues still outstanding were thrashed out between the committee, the Minister and Positive Action and that legislation was passed.  When a decision was made on whether to have a statutory tribunal, the committee knew this issue would return when the first court case was heard and information became available.  Sadly, that information has come piecemeal and as a result of the death of one victim who had taken a case.</P>
    <P>In July, when the early information came about the nature of the documents now available and the new light they were throwing on the issue, the Select Committee on Social Affairs sought a meeting with the chairperson of the expert group to consider these issues.  I have sympathy with the Minister in that the reassurance we received in correspondence &mdash; which I presume the Minister received also &mdash; would have led one to believe that the advice and understanding which had informed all his actions to date were sound.  This would have been supported by the expert group, which categorically stated that there were no new issues of concern in a detailed letter which was issued publicity at the time.  It was therefore a major shock when the case came to court and liability was established in the announcement by the BTSB.</P>
    <P>As I said, the committee knew the issue would return but it hoped a tribunal of this kind would not be necessary because the issues and facts would be resolved.  However, it is now clear that this is the only way to answer all the questions to the satisfaction of those most directly affected and all political parties.  While some people have suggested the Minister had all the information available to him, given the climate created by the issues no one in the House would have been satisfied with anything other than a tribunal.  There would always have been more questions and this tribunal is the best and most appropriate means of finding the answers.  I welcome the fact that its terms of reference are broad, covering the full period of concern about which there might be questions.</P>
    <P>In common with the Minister and everyone else, I regret the accidental or unintended offence caused by some remarks last night, which added a new and unnecessary twist to what is already an upsetting political tale.  The fundamental work we are doing today, the establishment of this tribunal of inquiry, continues the process the Minister undertook of responding to the issues as they unfolded.  This was one of the most major tasks to face a Minister for Health in the history of the State.  In due course and, we hope, as quickly as possible, this tribunal will answer the most important questions about this matter, which arose when we debated this before.  Perhaps the critical central issue is why the question of culpability was not more soundly argued out and answered. The core facts are not yet clear, that is, who knew what when, and how and why they did not <Col N="551" /> act more effectively to protect more people, particularly in the later period when there was clear evidence of the dangers of the practices.</P>
    <P>No one is glad to be involved in this debate but everyone who has contributed has participated genuinely and wholeheartedly.  Today's work is sad but necessary.  I am glad the tribunal is being established and being given wide-ranging terms of reference.  We look forward to hearing its findings and, arising from them, taking whatever actions are appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  We have had a number of discussions on the matter but what we are doing today is a major step &mdash; we are establishing a judicial tribunal to see whether it can establish the full facts of the matter before us.  Deputies have asked many questions and I will try to deal with some of them in the time available.</P>
      <P>I will first deal with the amendments in the name of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  Her amendment No. 1 would provide that a Government decision be made directing all employees of the State and State agencies and the institutions themselves to co-operate.  The decision by the Government to set up the tribunal, like any other Government decision, in effect directs civil servants to co-operate in carrying it out.  There is also power similar to the power of the High Court, to call witnesses and procure documents under penalty.  The penalties are, on indictment, a maximum fine of £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>However, I will take on board the spirit of what Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has suggested but it will have to be slightly recast.  I presume we can do that.  I have already indicated my intent to the Bills Office, but it may be possible to proceed here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 reads: &ldquo;That a Government decision be made...&rdquo;.  This entails the Dáil directing the Government to make a specific decision which runs into old constitutional difficulties. I suggest that the wording of the amendment could be cast in the following manner:</P>
      <P>That it is the wish of Dáil Éireann that all persons employed by the Government Departments and the State agencies concerned should give their full co-operation to the Tribunal in its inquiries and that the Departments and agencies themselves should fully co-operate with the Tribunal by providing all documents and information requested of them...</P>
      <P>This would mean that if Dáil Éireann considered it was being thwarted in this matter at any time it could impose sanctions by way of debate in the Dáil or by calling somebody before a committee of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This meets the intent of the amendment.  I also suggest moving it so that instead of being inserted after paragraph 9 as paragraph 10 it would be <Col N="552" /> inserted after the miscellaneous section at the end.  My advice is that it would fit more easily here.  I have asked that my proposals be circulated.</P>
    <P>On the question of anonymity, section 2 of the Tribunal of Inquiry Act, 1921, allows evidence to be taken in private.  The manner in which the tribunal conducts its affairs is a matter for the most experienced judge in the country whom we now appoint to the tribunal.  I have been advised that I could accept this amendment provided the following words are added: &ldquo;so far as may be possible&rdquo;. The most experienced judge in the country, the former Chief Justice, would like to take into account the views of the Dáil, but rather than put it as it is, if the words &ldquo;so far as may be possible&rdquo; were added, it would again take the full intent of the amendment in the name of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    <P>With regard to the terms of reference, on which we are in agreement, the tribunal will report back to the House after 20 oral hearing days.  Part of that report will be on the adequacy of the terms of reference.  If we were to put this forward and it proved subsequently that it was not possible, the judge might report to us that he needed a slightly different term of reference to ensure that it was possible.</P>
    <P>On the other proposed amendment, my advice is that even though it refers to only one item, it would lead to constitutional difficulties.  All of the McCole letter, with the exception of the issue of the specific legal letter which caused controversy, comes within the terms of the tribunal and this would be included.  According to my advice, the separation of powers is in danger of being infringed if Parliament seeks to pressurise by inquiry as to how any party conducts its litigation in the courts.  Parties are free provided they stay within the law and within the rules of court &mdash; there is no suggestion to the contrary in this case &mdash; to defend their cases as they see fit and in accordance with their legal advice and not to have that legal advice the subject of scrutiny by the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It comes back to the difficulty arising from the separation of powers.  My strong advice is that, even though the request from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn appears to be moderate and in line with what many people require here, I must reluctantly refuse the proposed amendment because it would give rise to constitutional difficulties if we accepted it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn could indicate agreement on the formulations I have outlined. I know it is difficult in this kind of debate, when there is not a set formula in the Dáil for circulating amendments at this point.  However, I have indicated what I can accept.  I can provide the text of my formulations to the Deputy.  I have been working on them since I left the House and we are trying to get them into the format that would be the norm for the Dáil.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will give way if the Deputy wishes to intervene.  Deputy Lenihan raised the question of the public interest team.  It will be appointed by the Attorney General. However, because the Chief State Solicitor has been involved in controversy in the course of the debate and in the manner in which the trial was conducted, it is the intention that a private sector solicitor will be appointed to back up the public interest legal team.  It is a new role and concept and it would not be possible for me to fully prescribe the function we envisage for the public interest team.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Mary Wallace. She made a number of suggestions which I will try to take into account.  I know it is her intention, as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, to formally put her requests to me when I will have them considered.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked if I could assess the impact of this tribunal on the compensation tribunal.  The inquiry tribunal will establish the facts and there will be no immediate consequences for the compensation tribunal that I can foresee at present.  However, if there are consequences I will be prepared to amend the terms of reference.  It is an informal system and I can amend them.  In the meantime, I will take into account what Deputies have said regarding some intermediate steps if the fears they have about the progress of the compensation tribunal were to be substantiated.</P>

      <P>With regard to anonymity, am I to take it that the Minister is giving a commitment to the House that he will inform Mr. Justice Finlay that it is the wish of the House that anybody who wishes may maintain anonymity in the tribunal and that he expects him to agree to that wish?</P>

      <P>Lest there be any other impression, I am anxious to facilitate a full debate on this matter.  It will be taken today, the earliest opportunity, and again this day week, which will give adequate time to Deputies.  I will be quite happy to answer questions on an open-ended basis at the close of business next week.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to rehash what we have discussed in several debates since 20 March, but to concentrate particularly on the Russian situation. I will briefly outline the history of the importation of Irish beef into the former USSR and more recently Russia. The level of trade has varied substantially through the years depending mainly on production patterns in the USSR and Russia which, in turn, determined supply demands, price etc. For quite a period, sales to the USSR and Russia were sourced mainly from intervention stocks. Commercial sales took off in 1994 when the level of export refunds to Russia was increased thus making this trade economic.  It also coincided with the transformation of the Russian food market following the break-up of the USSR.  This fact, with a decline in Russian production following difficulties associated with privatising the agriculture sector, has resulted in a substantial steady increase in the export of Irish beef to Russia.  In 1995, some 100,000 tonnes of beef was exported to Russia valued at around 325 million, making it the largest market for Irish beef outside the EU. It continues to be the most important third country market for Irish beef in 1996.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of the first BSE cases in Ireland in 1989 caused difficulties for Irish beef sales to a number of third countries, including Russia.  In the autumn of 1990, the USSR authorities raised concerns about accepting Irish intervention beef.  The sale from intervention was only cleared following the visit of their chief veterinary officer to Ireland to inspect our health controls at first hand.  In July 1993, the Russian authorities suspended imports of Irish beef because of BSE-related concerns.  Again the ban was lifted following the visit of a high level veterinary delegation to Ireland and the negotiation of a veterinary certificate which included certain specific animal health assurances required by the Russian authorities.  Therefore, BSE related concerns in Russia are not new and it is only since 1994 that a consistent commercial trade developed in that market.</P>
      <P>The most recent and most serious BSE crisis commenced following the House of Commons statement on 20 March and we are all aware of the subsequent wave of consumer concern and market closures which followed.  However, the Russian market remained open during this period because of ongoing contacts with the Russian authorities and their satisfaction with the comprehensive series of controls in place in Ireland ensured the safety and quality of beef exports.  In addition, a permanent Russian veterinary official was assigned to Ireland to monitor contracts and loading ships for Russia.  His presence has facilitated continuing trade with Russia at a time when difficulties are being experienced in a number of other markets.  The Russian authorities have been updated on the incidence of BSE and are relatively familiar with the control system here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During recent months, the Russian authorities expressed concern regarding the increasing level of BSE in Ireland.  There have been 38 cases of BSE this year to date which is more than double the number of cases in 1995 and is higher than the level of cases in any year to date.  During the visit of a trade delegation to Moscow in mid-September, the Russian veterinary authorities raised the increasing level of cases in Ireland and a ban was threatened though not implemented at that <Col N="561" /> time.  Despite reassurances, the issue was raised again on the margins of a veterinary conference in Malta two weeks ago.  The Taoiseach contacted Prime Minister Chernomyrdin at that time, the Tánaiste spoke to the Russian Foreign Minister and I contacted the Minister for Agriculture.  The chief veterinary officer was invited to come here and following a review in Moscow it was decided he would come with a delegation of experts to study the situation at first hand.  This is the context in which the situation developed.  There was certainly no complacency on our part and what evolved last week was the culmination of a sequence of events spanning almost two months. I monitored the position on almost a daily basis but I saw no advantage in advertising to the world that we had BSE related difficulties in Russia or in talking about a ban where none existed.  I refer to my comments at the National Ploughing Championship which have been somewhat misrepresented. What I said on that day was that there was not a ban and no confirmation of a ban but there were concerns and there was continuing dialogue.  I had been advised officially that to say there was a threat of a Russian ban would invite one and it would damage our market there.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the chief veterinary officer of the Russian Federation, Dr. Avilov, and a delegation of veterinary experts visited Ireland from 7-12 October to review the controls in place and to study the epidemiology of the disease in Ireland. The Russian team completed a comprehensive programme of visits covering meat plants, rendering plants, ports and laboratories and also visited certain farms.  I met the delegation as did the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>At the end of the week the Russian delegation put forward a Protocol which set out the basis for the continued importation of beef from Ireland to Russia.  The Protocol included the categorisation of counties and the exclusion of up to seven counties from the Russian market.  They selected the counties based on their study of the figures. It was linked to the level of the disease in the counties in 1996.  The Russian side made it very clear that if the Protocol was not agreed an immediate ban would be recommended and implemented on all Irish beef with effect from 1 November.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the threat of a ban, the proposed categorisation was opposed very vigorously and it was argued in strong terms that there was no scientific justification for the measure.  The meeting ended without any resolution of the problem.  Following consultations at a high level the negotiations resumed later that evening.  The Russian side continued to insist upon categorisation but agreed to drop the number of counties to be excluded to three &mdash; Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan &mdash; and that beef for Russia could be sourced from any approved plant in any county. It was not a case of swapping counties.  It was also agreed that the restrictions would be temporary and would be reviewed every three months and <Col N="562" /> if the incidence of the disease improved in the counties concerned the restrictions would be relaxed.  These were important considerations. We continued to oppose the measure and it was only following further consultations at high level that a decision was taken very reluctantly to sign the Protocol.  The Protocol was signed in the departure lounge of Dublin Airport on Saturday, 12 October, at 1 p.m.  They stipulated other requirements such as age and labelling arrangements. These do not present a major problem.  A member of the delegation, an epidemiologist, stayed in Ireland to study the BSE disease further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision was taken on practical grounds and with the greatest reluctance. However, the stark choice we faced was the closure of the Russian market to all Irish beef or the exclusion of three counties on a temporary basis with an agreed mechanism to relax this restriction in due course.  In the circumstances, we made the only possible choice.  The closure of a market of the size of Russia would have been disastrous for the beef industry at a very difficult time.</P>
      <P>Enough thought has not been given to the reality of a ban and what it means.  A ban means our trade would be excluded from a market with an import requirement of almost 500,000 tonnes of beef.  Contacts would be lost and competitors would become established.  We all know that trade creates more trade and that the worst scenario would be for our traders to be cut off from the contacts and buyers with whom they have built a relationship in the past two years.  The loss of the Russian market would put us into safety net intervention and would mean a drop in producer prices of at least 4p per pound.  The consequence of a build up of intervention stock could undermine Russia as a commercial market.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that regionalisation will have an impact on other third country markets.  I do not accept this.  However, a ban in a market the size of Russia would definitely have an impact.  I reject the argument that it would have been better to accept a ban than a limited form of regionalisation.  The Russian market remains open and Irish traders can continue to exploit the very real opportunities in it.  While I was prepared to reluctantly accept limited regionalisation in respect of Russia, as it is our most important third country market, I do not propose to accept it in relation to any other third countries.  I will travel to Russia at an early date to seek relaxation of the restrictions for these counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the concerns of the farmers in these counties and accept that these measures are not justified on scientific or other grounds. <Col N="563" /> The meat from these counties is as safe to eat as from any other county.  I was faced with the stark choice of protecting the beef industry and, in the circumstances, I am satisfied I took the right decision and would take the same decision again. Neither do I accept that the negotiation could have been prolonged.  As I indicated earlier a ban would have been promulgated from last Monday and our beef trade needed to know its position with regard to entering into future contracts.  The filling of a contract particularly the high volume type supplied to Russia takes weeks to organise. It is naive to think this could be let run up to the end of October and trade could flow from that date.  Stalling the negotiations was not an option. My impression is that while the meat trade may not like the conditions or restrictions it is anxious to continue slaughtering and doing business in Russia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the only one here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to earlier expectations commercial sales of beef from Ireland have performed well.  This can be demonstrated by the fact that our usage of intervention has been less than expected, although it is increasing.  Since emergency intervention was opened we have put in 40,000 tonnes of beef which is a good deal less than original predictions when figures in excess of 100,000 tonnes had been mentioned.  Two points arise from this: first, we should do everything possible to maintain the momentum of commercial sales and, second, there is no basis for the fatalistic comments as regards animals and products from Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  We have a market in Europe for more than 200,000 tonnes of beef without any restrictions.  The EU has set down the guidelines for trade and we comply with these.  Other third country markets have the potential to take 100,000 tonnes and we have individual veterinary certificates and Protocols with these countries.</P>
      <P>The cliché about talking ourselves into a crisis holds true in this case.  The real culprit is BSE. Much of the comment seems to be based on the assumption that we do not have a BSE problem in Ireland and that it only exists in Britain.  We do have BSE and the present predicament arises from the upsurge in the number of cases during the summer.  I accept fully that the numbers are small and that it is not reasonable to draw conclusions from changes in low incidence figures. However, the discussions with third countries are held in a context that we are a country with BSE, albeit at a low level.  This highlights the need to ensure we have effective controls.  The Government and I will do everything in our power to ensure the controls are effective and properly enforced and I expect nothing less than full co-operation from farmers and the industry generally in their enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> At this juncture we need less recrimination about how we have arrived at this situation.  The Protocol is a reality but accepting a full ban is unreal.  We need to move on and support the trade in seeking new contracts.  I am prepared to work with the industry on the smooth implementation of these requirements.  I do not see any case for regionalising cattle prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate is to ensure that our BSE controls are effective and that we get rid of the disease.  BSE has led to many unpleasant decisions.  It was not easy to depopulate apparently healthy herds and valuable animals because of one case of BSE but experience has shown this to be the right decision.  Banning the feeding of meat and bonemeal caused disruption but it was the right decision.  In regard to the extra number of cases, there is a clear link between feeding meat and bonemeal and the incidence of BSE.  It is absolutely critical that the decisions coming into effect today are implemented throughout the country.  It has not been easy to accept regionalisation, even on a temporary basis, but experience will show it was the right decision.  I acted in the best interests of the agricultural sector and the beef industry, including farmers, beef processors and workers.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Iranian market, there has been some misrepresentation of the reports in this morning's newspapers.  There has been no new request by the Iranians in the past few days for 12 counties to be banned.  Last Tuesday week they offered me a Protocol, which excluded a province, to sign.  However, I refused to sign it and said I would not enter into any regionalisation arrangements for the Iranian market.  I wish to clarify that the Taoiseach was consulted at all stages and was aware of the decision before the announcement was made.  This morning the Leader of the main Opposition party asked if the Protocol would be laid before the House.  The Protocol is in the Russian language and it would be inadvisable to lay it before the House.  Having regard to their trading nature, I do not wish to create a precedent whereby Protocols would require the approval of the House.  Neither do I wish competitors to be aware of the details of Protocols signed by us.  However, if the Opposition spokespersons wish to have a translation of the Protocol this can be made available.  I do not wish to conceal the details of the Protocol but it would not be a good precedent to publish it.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a good word about the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The intervention terms obtained by us could indicate a higher market price than the one currently prevailing.  There has been an increase in the processors' margin and the <Col N="565" /> weights derogation will be in place until the end of the year.  This is well above the safety net level. The Russian market will provide a basis for consolidated prices not only in the three counties affected but throughout the country.  Last Tuesday I received confirmation that Saudi Arabia had lifted its ban on our dairy and beef products. Given that this country is a political leader in the Gulf region this is a significant move which will hopefully lead to increased sales.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that this temporary hiccup affects one market only.  People may say a dangerous precedent has been set but I assure them a much more dangerous precedent would have been set if the Russians had imposed a ban. There are people who are afraid that our markets in Europe and elsewhere will be disrupted but I would point out to them that a decision by the Iranians, Libyans and others not to buy Irish beef does not automatically lead to a similar decision by the French, Italians, Dutch, Germans, Algerians and Egyptians.  The Russians have taken their decision on the basis of their interpretation of science but this does not provide any justification to other countries to follow suit.  We have a legal basis to trade in Europe and I look forward to a growth in trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a member of the delegation, an epidemiologist, was staying in Ireland to study the disease further.  Will he liaise with the Department or will he lean on newspaper reports in forming his opinion on the BSE crisis?  I take it he will also be involved in the review.  What arrangements have been agreed between the Department and the Russians in regard to this veterinary surgeon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise implementation of the ban from 1 November and other issues are under active discussion with the meat industry and Russian vets.  The most likely scenario is that a herd tag number from a particular county will be required to have a preceding letter and all carcases exported to Russia will require an &ldquo;R&rdquo; stamp.  Departmental officials will be given the job of certifying that the requirements in the certificate are met.  Following discussions with the meat industry, I am confident that this requirement will not cause extensive disruption as consignments to new markets have been easily accommodated in existing branding schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My biggest fear is that the understandable anxiety, concern and anger in these three counties will serve to highlight this issue in the international media, a highly undesirable development. I am available to meet delegations from the three counties involved in an effort to be constructive and positive.  I do not want television stations such as CNN and Sky News or press clippings sent by embassies to their home countries to exaggerate the problem, given that I am not <Col N="566" /> prepared to sign further Protocols.  I am not casting any aspirations but there is a question of vulnerability and people should realise exactly what is at issue.  Vets, diplomatic staff and technical services staff respond to questions on an ongoing basis.  The nub of the problem is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is understandable, nobody likes hysteria.  The Minister said he was available to meet interested groups.  Would it not have been better to meet them last week before the decision was announced so that the hysteria could have been prevented?  The Minister should have explained the reasons for the decision before making the announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations of this type are not conducted in public.  From a foreign point of view, privacy is an integral part of the discussions.  It must be remembered that there are consumer and other politics within Russia, Teheran, and Egypt and there is an insistence that these discussions be held in private.  I did not sit in on the discussions but I understand that during the latter stages they dealt with technical, administrative, veterinary and health related matters.  The Russian delegation included a senior official from the Department, an independent scientist, Dr. Avilov, and a translator.  I do not wish to conceal anything but it is not possible to conduct these negotiations in public.  I can make the details of all meetings available at a later date.</P>
      <P>People from the three counties involved and other counties have made snide remarks about County Wexford.  I want to make it clear that I did not at any stage say anything about County Wexford to anyone from Russia.  If County Wexford was one of the three counties I would still have said it was in the national interest to sign the Protocol.  I assure the House that there was no political interference in the choice of counties and that the Russian delegation alone selected the counties.</P>
      <P>In two months' time there will be no price differential between the price of animals at Cahir, Mallow, Enniscorthy or Kilkenny marts and there will be no knock-on effect.  If I am vindicated in that opinion the hysteria will not have contributed anything to the debate.  I appeal to people to await developments in a cool and calm manner.  I urge caution on this matter because inflammatory remarks can only cause buyers elsewhere to have deeper concerns than are justified or necessary.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject, the development of the new tourism brand for Ireland is proceeding according to schedule under the direction of an industry advisory group led by Bord Fáilte.  The brand positioning proposals and communications materials are now virtually completed with a view to a formal launch by me on behalf of the board on 11 November.  The tourism brand concept was originally conceived by the tourism council established by my predecessor and I have continued to lend my support and enthusiasm for the project.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the development costs of the brand are expected to amount to around £2.3 million which will cover the production of TV advertising, other communication materials and the new visual identity.  The identity also involves the development of a consistent visual look which, over time, should be adopted on all published tourism promotional items.</P>
      <P>The roll out of the new brand is expected to take place on a phased basis over the next year or so.  The new TV advertising will be progressively introduced in all the key markets by spring next year.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy yesterday the chairman, Deputy Bell, indicated he would call Bord Fáilte before the committee.  The Minister intends to launch Bord Fáilte's brand image strategy on 11 November.  Will its representatives attend the committee before that date?</P>
      <P>There is some ambiguity about the shamrock symbol.  Aer Lingus spent £8 million devising what I would describe as a tipsy shamrock symbol for the tails of its aeroplanes.  What value will we get for the £30 million?  Will the shamrock be abandoned or used with another symbol?  What is the intention in that regard?  The Minister merely gave a generalised account of what Bord Fáilte intends to do.  Will he be more specific in terms of the value we will get for the £30 million.</P>

      <P>There is also some confusion about the £30 million mentioned in the question.  This was originally attributed to a comment by the international marketing director of Bord Fáilte who speculated that ideally one would need approximately £30 million annually to spend on a new brand.  Bord Fáilte estimates that approximately £60 million is spent on a broad definition of tourism marketing, including overheads, by Government, the EU and IFI sources as well as through matching industry contributions.  Therefore, there may be confusion about the amounts mentioned. The estimate for the development costs of the brand is £2.3 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy correctly referred to the issue raised in the media about the demise or otherwise of the shamrock.  On 17 September Bord Fáilte issued a formal press release stating that it has no plans to change the shamrock identity or its use in markets abroad.  It does not plan to change its corporate logo.  We will have to await the results of the analysis carried out on the perception of this country internationally before relating it to the new formal brand image.</P>

      <P>While I would not describe myself as innumerate, numeracy is not one of my strong points, but I have difficulty understanding what the Minister intends presenting on 11 November. Will it be a £2.3 million or a £30 million programme?  I tabled a question on litter to the Minister but, unfortunately, it was siphoned off to the Department of the Environment.  While that is probably the appropriate Department to deal with it, I thought I couched it in such a way that it would come under the Minister's umbrella. Does he agree that, because of our dreadful litter problem, a flying litter basket should replace the shamrock as a symbol of the country?  Will he explain what will be launched on 11 November and why a non-Irish company was given the contract for the presentation of visual strategy?</P>

I commend the tidy towns committees who have done a great deal of work to improve their lot.  Irish people in general are beginning to understand the necessity of presenting our country as a clean, green and attractive location.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the UK company which dealt with part of the brand development work.  Bord Fáilte's contract is with an Irish company who supply the necessary tax clearance documentation.  Discussions were held with the Revenue Commissioners so that complaints received could be referred to them.  Bord Fáilte's contract is with an Irish company who, of its own volition, selected a company from Great Britain to do some of the developmental work on the brand.</P>

      <P>Are we spending too much on image making and not enough on market strategy? Our image is set in the minds of the people who visit the country, 4.2 million this year.  I congratulate the Minister for the manner in which the tourist industry has taken off.  While there are little flutters beneath the surface that need to be addressed, in the main our tourism industry is booming and I commend the industry and the Minister in that regard.  We have enough image making, we should work on market strategy. What are the Minister's comments in that regard?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Andrews for his co-operation and general interest in the overall development of the tourism industry.  As he is aware, our image internationally has changed a great deal in the past ten years.  Because of the success of our artists and sports people on the international competitive fields, there is now a great interest in Irish culture and tradition.  This is not merely a question about creating an image, it is about sophisticated marketing using analysis on how we are perceived abroad.  That will benefit the country internationally, particularly the tourism industry.  In presenting an image of our country as being young, modern, committed, dedicated and vibrant, this developmental work is not just about image understanding and image creating, it is also about real substance in the sense of detailed and sophisticated marketing which I know will bring major results.</P>

      <P>I am aware of disquiet in relation to pay among some sections of the work-force in the tourism sector which was made clear to me when I met a delegation from SIPTU earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The whole area of industrial relations is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  In relation to a question from the Deputy on 9 October, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment indicated that in the absence of statutory regulation through a Joint Labour Committee, or otherwise, rates of pay are a matter for negotiation and agreement between employees and employers, and-or their representatives.</P>
      <P>Recent increases in demand for skilled staff, as a result of growth in visitor numbers and expansion in facilities, will inevitably put upward pressure on pay and conditions in those sections of tourism where the rate of improvement has been sluggish and out of line with developments elsewhere in the sector.  Ongoing consumer pressure for better standards and quality of service have also added to the pressure to improve staff conditions and perceptions of them among potential recruits.  I will be elaborating on the latter point in replies to separate questions today on recruitment to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is rightly entitled to rule in or out questions which he judges appropriate on these matters.  I am concerned about an ongoing difficulty in a hotel in O'Connell Street where there has been a strike for a number of months.  I understand the employees concerned have been treated extremely badly.  Like the Minister I had talks with SIPTU on that and other matters related to the tourism industry, particularly the hotel industry.  Will the Minister comment on that ongoing strike in that hotel in our fair city?  Has he done anything to intervene or to bring about a resolution?  I understand that a number of the employees concerned are paid a pittance, ranging from £2 to £3.50 per hour.  That is outrageous and the employees concerned have been on a picket line for the past number of months.  I have nothing but the greatest of sympathy for them but they are symbolic of a malaise in terms of low pay that is hitting the industry. Will the Minister comment on the recent statement made by a spokesman on behalf of CERT that the tourism industry will have a shortage of 16,000 trainees in the next three years?  Will he further agree that the reason for that is pay and conditions at a certain level of endeavour in that industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the dispute in the hotel mentioned by the Deputy.  I have not interfered in it.  As the Deputy is aware, hotels' joint labour committees do not cover the Dublin area and, therefore, rates of pay and conditions are matters to be dealt with between employers and employees.  It is not good for the industry in general to have that type of ongoing dispute.  I <Col N="571" /> understand that no application has been made to the Labour Court for the formation of a joint labour committee to cover the area in question.  It was brought to my attention when I met a delegation from SIPTU earlier this year.  A number of conciliation conferences were held without success.</P>
      <P>The comment the Deputy attributed to the chairman of CERT may have been misconstrued. The chairman said there will be a need to recruit 16,000 over the next number of years which will present a difficulty for the hotel industry in general in terms of numbers because of the decrease in population and the need to recruit workers for the sector because of the increasing number of tourists.  In that sense I welcomed the recent initiative by the Irish Hotels' Federation to introduce its own code of practice and pension schemes and a host of other proposals which will heighten the perception of the tourism industry as one that is not short-term, lightweight or without career prospects but one with long-term possibilities for young people.  In that sense I also welcome that initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister intervene in the dispute in this hotel, the name of which I cannot mention, for obvious reasons?  I am sure he is concerned about it as we all are.  I am not imputing that there is a lack of concern on his part, but I am seriously worried that this ongoing strike is becoming a symbol of a particular type of treatment of employees, not only in that hotel but in other parts of the industry.  We have an excellent industry and it is regrettable that such strikes occur.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killeen and I met and were very impressed by the chairman of CERT.  He and his colleagues are running an extremely impressive operation and it is appreciated by us here and by the industry.  Arising from the chairman's statement will the Minister agree that the lack of pay and proper conditions is a disincentive, particularly to young people entering the hotel industry? Is there anything we can do immediately to introduce a statutory minimum wage to give employees in that industry a decent break?  Has the Minister any proposals to ensure equality of treatment for men and women employed in the tourism industry in view of a number of complaints of discrimination against women in that area?</P>

As there is no application before the Labour Court for a joint committee in this regard, I hope that this matter might be <Col N="572" /> sorted out by another conciliation conference. Most of the complaints I get are not in respect of the hotel sector, they concern the public house sector and fast food outlets where lower wage rates apply.  In that sense the Irish Hotels' Federation is responding to this matter raised by me over 12 months ago which has been dealt with to some extent by the Tourism Council in a detailed paper to be worked out.  I commended the Irish Hotels' Federation for its initiative in that area. There are career opportunities for young people moving into the tourism sector.  This is a question of perception upon which the hotel sector, in particular, is working and must work in the future and I hope it will ensure that young people understand, by virtue of their career guidance teachers, parental guidance and their own observations, that there are genuine long-term career prospects in the tourism industry which now employs 102,000 people here and which is part of the fastest growing sector in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, official statistics on the number of overseas visitors to Ireland and their expenditure while in Ireland are collected and published by the Central Statistics Office.  I understand that this information is compiled from sample surveys conducted continuously throughout the year at each of the major air and sea ports and covering both arriving and departing passengers.  In 1995 the sample size was 394,000 passengers.  There were over 13.6 million passenger movements in 1995 of which the CSO, based on its surveys, estimated that 4.2 million were visitors.</P>
      <P>I would not be qualified to assess the relative merits of methodologies for the collation of statistical information and must be guided by the statisticians and experts in the CSO who have responsibility for such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the tourism industry is of major significance to our economy and that, therefore, there is an obligation on those charged with promoting tourism to garner as much accurate information as possible on that industry.  Tourist figures are valuable information from the point of view of planning future policy.  In view of the haphazard way in which tourist statistics are compiled, does the Minister consider it appropriate to introduce the card system mentioned in the question to ensure we have accurate figures of the number of tourists coming here.  The Minister is aware of the distinction <Col N="573" /> between visitors and tourists &mdash; there is a separate system of compiling those figures &mdash; but there is no accurate assessment of the number of tourists coming into the country.  An attempt is made by Bord Fáilte to extrapolate the number from visitor figures, which include people on a one day visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In an industry as important as this it is critical that numbers of visitors and tourists are as accurate as possible.  In the United States, for example, where international travellers must complete detailed questionnaires, the cost and complexity of the exercise is such that results are not available for a considerable time after the event, which does not lead to good planning or good presentation for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>While parts of Africa and Asia continue to use a census-based approach to the compilation of visitor statistics, Malta has recently discarded such a system.  The system operated by the CSO and Bord Fáilte is on a par with, if not better than, most other systems.  As Ireland is an island it is much easier to determine the number of people coming here because there are no land frontiers, as is the case in Europe where people cross borders on a regular basis on their way to work, business or holidays, thereby giving inaccurate statistics.  The Central Statistics Office is part of the Eurostat regime and experts in the compilation and methodology of statistics are in constant contact with a view to applying the best operational method.  The system is monitored on a regular basis to ensure the statistics are accurate, which is very important for the proper development of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office carries out a country of residence survey, which is the source from which Bord Fáilte establishes tourism numbers.  That survey is carried out at ports only in the Republic and account is not taken of overseas visitors who arrive and depart via Northern Ireland and spend at least one night in the Republic.  If the Minister studies this matter carefully he will realise that the figures are merely intelligent estimates which are inaccurate.  A requirement on all people coming into the country to fill in a travellers' arrival-departure card would result in the most accurate information possible, which would be of great benefit to the future planning of the industry.  Perhaps it would take some time to extract information from such cards, but at least it would be available in the near future.  Because of the extreme importance of this industry, we should seek to have the most sophisticated system of determining the number of tourists coming here as distinct from visitors and guests.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the country of residence survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office in which the question asked is: &ldquo;What is your country of permanent residence?&rdquo;.  In 1995, out of a total travelling population of 13.6 million, the figure given was 394,000 passengers, 185,000 inward and 209,000 outward.  The CSO also carries out a passenger card inquiry to identify expenditure by overseas visitors to Ireland and by Irish residents who travel abroad.  That survey is conducted at the major sea and airports in conjunction with the country of residents survey.  Based on the information on overseas visitor numbers and expenditure supplied to Bord Fáilte by the CSO, Bord Fáilte attempts to produce for publication the estimates of tourist numbers and expenditure.  Bord Fáilte receives information on same day visits from sea carriers and produces an estimate of same day visits by air-based travellers on the best available information.</P>
      <P>We project ourselves as a country of friendly, engaging people.  The survey conducted by the CSO is very detailed.  I doubt if the 4.7 million visitors to our country would be inclined to fill in a card as suggested by the Deputy, although I understand his point.  My information is that the methodology used by the CSO as part of the Eurostat regime is as good if not better than most others.  As an island, our figures are probably more accurate than those of countries with more than one land frontier.</P>

      <P>Minimising the impact on tourism of the current breakdown in the peace process is a priority for both the tourism industry and the various State bodies involved in tourism promotion and development.  However, it is important to acknowledge that even before the promising ceasefires in late 1994, the Irish tourism industry was growing at an accelerated rate, and continues to do so, and that recent events, regrettable and worrying though they are, do not represent a return to continuing and widespread civil disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The key strengths in the Irish tourism industry, built up over many years through major investments in the product, increased marketing resources, improved air and sea access and general improvements in the Irish economy, should prove valuable assets in the challenge to overcome present difficulties and expand our tourism industry further.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's plans for the overseas marketing of Irish tourism are continually reviewed with particular regard to factors which could affect travel prospects from specific foreign markets.  Their continuous monitoring of overseas markets indicates inquiry levels remaining stable to date and that 1996 should prove another record-breaking year for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's 1997 tourism marketing campaigns are now being prepared and will incorporate the launch of the new Tourism Brand Ireland. The brand launch will also involve extensive consumer advertising, and the largest single element will be TV campaigns in major overseas markets, including Britain, France, Germany and the USA. Much of this activity is taking place in conjunction with the ongoing industry-led Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative &mdash; OTMI &mdash; which is a partnership between the tourism industry and the State sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board continue to enjoy a good working relationship.  This manifests itself most significantly in the OTMI where both tourist boards are active participants.  Cross-Border co-operation in areas of common interest will continue to be a priority of my Department, including encouraging joint marketing activities wherever feasible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's confidence and hope it is well placed.  I think he will agree many people have invested large amounts of money in tourism projects, as has the State and the European Union, and they are concerned at events that took place, particularly since last February. Those people wish to be assured that specific plans will be in place in the event that activities in the North have a detrimental effect on tourism numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Killeen understands the importance of tourism and the implications of the activities in Northern Ireland.  The Government would like to see the ceasefire restored and inclusive talks taking place.  The tourism industry benefits everybody, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious creed.  Last year tourist numbers in Northern Ireland increased by 56 per cent.  There has been a considerable decrease from that high level this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period January to June this year the total number of visitors was 2.002 million, an increase of 15.5 per cent on the same period in 1995.  The number of visitors from North America increased by 17.7 per cent; from Britain, 17.4 per cent to 1.183 million <Col N="576" /> and from mainland Europe, approximately 15 per cent to 464,000.  This contrasts sharply with the position in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Despite the setback, the industry has continued to grow strongly and has the potential to grow further.  We will continue with enthusiasm to market and provide facilities of a standard and quality to attract national and international clientele.</P>

Can a case be made for special treatment as part of a marketing initiative?  On accessibility, is there scope to bring cruisers to Inishowen, without having to travel through the North, and to have the Derry-Dublin airlink restored to attract visitors to the region?  While the tourist figures are good, they do not stand up on a county-by-county basis.</P>

      <P>The establishment of airlinks is a matter for the airlines involved.  Marketing support is available.</P>
      <P>Cruise Ireland, the company established by Bord Fáilte a number of years ago, markets cruise liners.  A number were due to call to Derry where one in particular encountered difficulties.</P>
      <P>Inishowen is a lovely area.  As one of the Border counties, Donegal qualifies for funding under various programmes.  It benefited recently from the funds made available under the INTERREG programme.  Tourism interests in the region have combined to produce a huge marketing programme to encourage people to continue to visit the area which will complement the efforts of regional tourism organisations and Bord Fáilte in marketing Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the number of British visitors has increased I assume the decrease in visitor numbers in Inishowen can be attributed to the fall in the number of visitors from Northern Ireland who have traditionally crossed the Border on holidays and weekend trips.</P>

This will probably not result in new initiatives.  On the trade side, it proved to be an excellent conference with more than 500 head-to-head meetings between potential investors in joint ventures.  This should lead to a greater understanding of what the Border counties and the island as a whole have to offer.

      <P>As I am sure the Minister is aware, there is much dissatisfaction in the industry with elements of the Gulliver system.  This is reflected in the number of actions being taken.  Does the Minister propose to instruct Bord Fáilte to adopt a new system in place of the Gulliver system?</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte has been a pioneer in this area.  Although information technology is advancing at a rapid rate, the potential of the Gulliver system is enormous.  I would be the first to admit however that it has not been as successful as expected.  It is owned partly by Bord Fáilte and partly by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  Following the analysis of Bord Fáilte's performance by A.D. Little, and subsequent to that, progress has been made towards taking on partnership and outsourcing of the Gulliver system. For example, on 19 September this year the prospectus was issued in respect of this and a number of companies have been shortlisted, representative of which are now having discussions on taking on partnership in the system.  I hope to have the results of that in due course.  There is enormous potential for this system and while it has not lived up to its initial reputation, I hope that can be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the Gulliver system has enormous potential which it has not reached.  I understand one of the reasons is that sufficient funding is not available to develop the system to the standard required.  I am disappointed the Minister has no intention of providing additional State funding for the system. Will he encourage Bord Fáilte and other interests to accept one of the other systems which have some attractions for people in the trade?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director General of Bord Fáilte will be before the Committee of Public Accounts to discuss this and other matters and he will be able to give details about the Gulliver system.  The total expenditure on the project between 1990 and 1995 was £10.2 million. Additional funding was not provided for it in the Department's Vote.  Bord Fáilte's allocation came from its own annual grant-in-aid.  Following the analysis of Bord Fáilte's performance by A.D. Little and the current position as far as Gulliver being outsourced is concerned, I am anxious to reform and progress this into a first class system, which was the initial intention.  This was a pioneering technological concept and I hope everyone will recognise it for what it is worth.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The World Equestrian Games are scheduled to take place in Ireland in August 1998.  As I indicated previously in the House, the allocation of the World Equestrian Games to Ireland and their organisation are matters in the first instance for the Federation Equestre International, the FEI and World Equestrian Games (Ireland) Ltd. or WEG.  The policy of both this and the previous Government has been to encourage and assist WEG (Ireland) Ltd. in its work, where appropriate, to ensure a commercially successful games that would reflect well on this country in equestrian and general promotional terms.</P>
      <P>Exchequer assistance is being provided through Bord Fáilte to WEG (Ireland) Ltd. to facilitate the holding of the games and to date an amount of £750,000 has been paid to the company.  Provision for a further £250,000 will be made in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees it is important that these games are properly funded because they can be used to promote Ireland. How many visitors will they bring to Ireland?  Are other Departments, such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of Defence and the sports section of the Department of Education, providing sponsorship as well as Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern is correct in saying these games are important for Ireland.  I would like to see them in the context of a banker event in that not only would people come here for the event but would return for a second vacation.  It is difficult to estimate the number who will come here in 1998.  It could be in the range of 30,000 to 100,000.  While it had some teething difficulties initially, the commercial sponsorship from Nissan and the revamped WEG (Ireland) Ltd. will, I hope, make these games a commercial success for Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The original estimate was over £10 million expenditure.  However, this has been reduced following Nissan's decision to fund the games.  It carried out a serious revamp of the costs involved.  I do not have the figures with me but they are greatly reduced.  For that reason the Government decided to continue funding to the level I outlined.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any direct funding by any other Department.  However, I assume it will provide an opportunity for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and An Bord Bia to present the best of Irish food to our international visitors.  Other Departments or semi-State bodies could also become involved in presenting Ireland to our visitors.  While there may not be direct assistance from other Departments, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which has responsibility for equestrian matters in Ireland, would have an intense interest in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 23, 41, 45 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gulliver reservation system has been developed by Bord Fáilte on a joint basis with the <Col N="581" /> Northern Ireland Tourist Board as part of its day to day ongoing marketing activities.</P>
    <P>As I indicated previously, and most recently on 24 January last, the Arthur D. Little consultants, as part of their overall review of Bord Fáilte, examined the operation of this system.  The consultants recommended that the management of Gulliver should be outsourced.  Following more detailed study, the consultants recommended that a third party specialised operator-investor should be sought who would take responsibility for adapting and developing the system and for management of accommodation supplier contracts.</P>
    <P>A steering group has been established to oversee the securing of new partnership arrangements for Gulliver.  I understand that work on this task is progressing.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure on the project in the period 1990 to 1995 was £10.2 million.  Taking account of membership and transaction fees of £1.6 million, the estimated net cost of the project up to the end of 1995 was £8.6 million.  Funding for the net expenditure on the project came from EU development grants, £2.9 million, BFE's own resources, £2.6 million, International Fund for Ireland development grants, £1.6 million, and NITB's own resources, £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>Regarding the percentage of reservations made through the Gulliver system, the Deputy will appreciate that this is commercially sensitive information, particularly at a time when discussions with potential new partners are taking place relating to the day to day operation of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the steering committee established?  The Minister informed the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on 29 May that this steering committee was then in existence.  Nearly five months have passed but it seems from the Minister's reply that no decision has yet been arrived at in regard to a partner for the two tourism boards in the Gulliver system. What is the cause of this long delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a complex matter.  The steering group consists of representatives of the two tourism boards, the advisory board, the Department of Tourism and Trade and the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development.  I do not have the date on which the steering committee was set up but I will send it to the Deputy.  The A.D. Little report was presented in early 1994 and at the end of that year it was recommended that this be outsourced. On 19 September this year the prospectus seeking a joint partner for Gulliver was issued.  This has been narrowed down to a small number of companies with which discussions are taking place with a view to becoming partners in the system, as recommended by A.D. Little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister realises that Opposition Deputies rely on ministerial statements for their information.  We were told last May that the <Col N="582" /> steering group had been set up to find a partner, yet the prospectus was not issued until recently. There must be a reasonable explanation for this long delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the end of 1994 A.D. Little recommended that this be outsourced and following that a steering group was set up.  The prospectus was issued on 19 September and we have narrowed down the number of companies having technical and detailed discussions about becoming partners in the system.  I cannot put a date on it but I hope it will be concluded as soon as possible because I am as interested as Deputy Molloy in seeing that this is up and running properly.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the criticism that not enough is being done to promote Ireland as an all-year round tourist destination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal objectives of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999 is to encourage significant growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods.  In 1995, the number of off-peak tourists is estimated to have increased by 18 per cent, a full three percentage points ahead of overall tourist growth for that year.  The addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in 1996 and future years, together with substantial investment in <Col N="583" /> marketing, is geared towards achieving further increases in tourist numbers and revenue in the shoulder and off-season periods.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan's domestic tourism marketing initiative will provide an added boost for business in the autumn and winter periods this year.  Co-operative advertising on radio, television and in the press over the period September to November and again in the early part of 1997 will heighten the awareness of Irish consumers to the attractions of holidaying at home.  The overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative, promotes Ireland on a year round basis and many of its campaigns are conducted outside the traditional high season. This initiative is acknowledged by the industry to be particularly successful.</P>
      <P>Seasonaility is a major concern of the Tourism Council which I chair and the issue has been discussed at each of the meetings of the present council to date.  At the last meeting in Ballintubber Abbey on October 11 the Council agreed on a special seasonality programme for the spring of next year.  This programme will have a musical theme and is expected to include activities in Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork.  The event is scheduled for the first two weeks in March and will act as a lead in to other events such as the St. Patrick's Day festival.  In terms of target markets the council envisages that Britain, Northern Ireland and the home market offer the best prospects for the festival.  I agreed to the allocation of £125,000 to Bord Fáilte specifically to support the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, in the context of tourism today, it is outdated to talk of tourist season and of extending it in the shoulder and off-peak periods?  Surely our tourism product is now of such a high standard that we should promote Ireland as an all-year tourist destination?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are well recognised by the practitioners in the industry.  These people are on the Tourism Council and have recognised that we should do more in certain months to achieve what the Deputy and I both want &mdash; to make Ireland an all-year tourist destination.  The Tourism Council comprises people who are practitioners in the industry and they know what is required. They have come up with this initiative to build on the international recognition of all forms of Irish music as a wonderful European attraction.  Currently no international events of any great significance take place in early March of any year so we <Col N="584" /> want to establish a new foundation for musical ventures in Ireland in the four centres I mentioned. The centres chosen may feature country music, Irish music, etc.  We want this to lead into the other festivals in St. Patrick's week in order to build up what has traditionally been a slack period.  I share the Deputy's view and am anxious to promote Ireland as a year-round destination for tourists from all over the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an experiment and one cannot choose every area.  We chose four major urban areas and while the events may take place there the intention of the Tourism Council is to link that to an expansion in the region of each centre.  It would be a rather big region that included both Inishowen and Galway but we hope the experiment can be built on and will pay dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for a venue in Inishowen, just remarking that Galway is in the far west but Donegal is in the far north and there are no venues near it.</P>
      <P>Also in regard to seasonal tourism, does the Minister think we should develop marinas and cruise centres in ports and harbours all over the country?  The Minister knows Carrickarory pier in Moville, which cruise liners pass on their way to Derry.  We could have a year round cruise stopping point there to enable many visitors to come to our area but we cannot get money for repairs to the pier.  Would the Minister consider working with the Minister of the Marine and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to provide funding for the pier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point about developing cruises is important.  This concept only came to Ireland a few years ago but it has paid huge dividends and it is now expanding into Galway and other areas.  However, I recognise the cost of developing proper points and landing points.  Under the Operational Programme for Tourism money is available for the development of marinas and a number have been assisted financially in various parts of the country.  One never has sufficient funds to deal with them all, much as one would want to, but it is possible to have marinas with anchoring points, which are must less costly and would provide the same benefit to people pulling into a port for a night or two.  The Deputy made a valid point about co-operation between the European Regional Development Fund programme, local authorities and the Department of the Marine for pier and port development.  I have placed emphasis on the &ldquo;Cruise Ireland&rdquo; concept.  Those who disembark from such cruise liners can have joined them anywhere in Northern Europe.  While Ireland was off <Col N="585" /> the route it is now firmly on it and we intend to keep it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister look at places, such as Carrickarory Pier, in the context of this initiative?  At present we are watching cruises travel to Derry, where people there have taken the initiative to ensure they come.  In the meantime we talk about forthcoming initiatives. We need action so that we can get our tourists into Inishowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy needs to have discussions with the regional tourism organisation, the local authority and the Department of the Marine in respect of landing points.  Those involved in the cruise business are anxious to have as many landing places as possible to show their passengers the uniqueness of this country and its wide and varied attractions.  The Deputy must keep working at it.  I do not have a magic wand to resolve it overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Ballintubber initiative, the amount of funding available is hardly over generous.  What plans does the Minister have to improve access in the off season which he and others have recognised as being a major deterrent? It is a chicken and egg situation because the level of access is to some extent dictated by the number of people who want to use it, and <i>vice versa.</i> This has been raised with him on previous occasions.  Has he taken it into account with regard to developing all year tourism, especially to the west?</P>

      <P>When one considers the European Regional Development Fund programme under the Operational Programme for Tourism, the money is being spent and allocated for the provision of facilities which deal with all year personnel. The provision of leisure complexes, hotel accommodation and other tourism facilities are very important in this context.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is dealing with the domestic tourism market, which is worth over £600 million per year.  I have succeeded in having £500,000 allocated for the promotion of this area. When one considers the position of those who leave the country on their holidays every year and those who visit the country and spend their money, it would be a much more lucrative operation if everybody at home was persuaded to take their holidays here, which is not possible.</P>
      <P>The European Regional Development Fund funds are important, with private investment, for creating facilities that last, available all year and of the necessary standard.  There is then the home holiday marketing initiative which is the responsibility of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money allocated for the Ballintubber initiative, as the Deputy correctly calls it, will not deal with the provision of the events; it is only as an assistance and promotion for them.  A detailed timetable and agenda have been worked out for <Col N="586" /> this on which I place great emphasis because when we asked the tourism council and the practitioners in the tourism industry to give us a range of ideas and initiatives that they would see as important for the tourism industry, the music theme was a common denominator to many of them.  I hope that it will prove successful as an experiment and that it will become established on the Irish market as being an international musical month leading up to the St. Patrick's day festival when it can come to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 28, 32 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is concentrating on three main areas during the Presidency of the EU &mdash; the internal market, EU external trade policy and tourism.</P>
      <P>With regard to the EU internal market I will chair two meetings of the Internal Market Council on 25 October and 26 November.  My priorities for these remain first, to review the functioning of the internal market and to initiate any action required in the light of the Commission's report on the effectiveness of the internal market which is due to be published later this year; second, to oversee the completion of the &ldquo;Citizens First&rdquo; initiative, which is designed to inform EU citizens of their rights in the internal market; third, to oversee progress on the Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market, SLIM, initiative on simplification of legislation; fourth, to progress and if possible secure agreement on the remaining priority internal market legislative measures and fifth, to progress the work being carried out to assist the countries of central and eastern Europe to align their legislation to that of the EU as part of their preparations for accession thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SLIM initiative will be reviewed at the November Council on the basis of studies which have been carried out to date in four areas: construction products, ornamental plants, INTRASTAT <Col N="587" /> and the recognition of diplomas.  The &ldquo;Citizens First&rdquo; initiative is expected to be launched before the end of November.</P>
    <P>In the external trade area I will, with the Commission Vice-President Brittan, represent the EU at the first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore on 9-13 December.  My objective for the December WTO conference is to ensure a strong EU contribution and an outcome reflecting the EU priority of consolidating and developing the multilateral trade system.  In preparation for this conference I hosted an informal meeting of EU Trade Ministers in Dublin on 18-19 September which has greatly helped to advance this objective.</P>
    <P>In the tourism area the priority has been to make progress on the Commission proposal for a Council decision on a first multiannual programme to assist European tourism.  This is known as the Philoxenia 1997-2000 programme. While considerable progress has been made at working group level on the text of this proposal, there are, I believe, reservations regarding subsidiarity issues which may well manifest themselves at the meeting of deputy ambassadors &mdash; Coreper &mdash; in Brussels tomorrow, 18 October.  Whether we are in a position to consider the proposal at the tourism council planned for 5 November next may well depend on the outcome of the Coreper meeting, although I hope colleagues will ensure that we will be able to deal with this at the Council on 5 November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason to be confident that the introduction of, for example, the SLIM initiative will have the effect of reducing European intervention in people's lives?  I am sure the Minister agrees that the level of European intervention is not welcomed by many people.  As a result of this will there be less intervention for people in the marketplace involved in trade and for citizens generally?  With regard to &ldquo;Citizens First&rdquo; initiative, what will be the effect of the introduction of this measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised on a number of occasions at European ministerial meetings.  There is a clear understanding and a recognition with our colleagues in Europe that legislation should be simplified to the greatest extent possible.  For this reason the Market Council of 28 May adopted a resolution which mandated the Commission to undertake a review of the internal market relating to the matters I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Florence European Council conclusions require that a report be submitted to Council before the end of the year on the initial results of that initiative and it is intended to take steps to further progress the work being undertaken in this area at the November internal market council. The intention is clear to make the legislation simpler and not to have it as bureaucratic as heretofore. There will be a report on this at the November <Col N="588" /> meeting and one, required by the Florence Council, before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Citizens Initiative&rdquo; is designed to inform citizens of the EU of the benefits created for them by the Single Market.  Some citizens within the EU believe they know enough about the Single Market; others do not.  A publicity campaign, which will involve promotional leaflets and television and radio commercials will be launched in November.  This initiative should have been under way by now but queries were raised by the European Parliament regarding the proposed financial plan for the campaign, which was approximately 35 million ECU.  This resulted in the startup being delayed until November.  I hope that when it does take place it will prove positive and will make the real benefits of being European citizens and the advantages of the Single Market more clearly understandable for people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Philoxenia programme, to which the Minister referred to and which would benefit from simplification of its name and pronunciation, will its effect be to assess the effect of EU funding on tourism, or what is its long-term intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term intention is to have a multiannual programme for overall tourism development within the EU.  There are differences among colleague members on this as to whether it should be included.  I would like to see a situation where our colleague countries understand the importance of tourism in a general sense and that, without interfering with national or regional development plans, we would have an overall umbrella organisation or operation which would not cost that much but which would make tourism a priority which it should be.  As I pointed out earlier, our colleagues have some reservations and it requires unanimity so I cannot say if the Philoxenia Programme will reach a conclusion.  I hope this will happen but we must await the outcome of the meetings between now and November.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 64 and 135 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> As I indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject, the development of the new tourism brand for Ireland is proceeding according to schedule under the direction of an industry advisory group led by Bord Fáilte.  The brand positioning proposals and communications materials are now almost complete, with a view to a formal launch by me on behalf of the board on 11 November. The tourism brand concept was originally conceived by the Tourism Council established by my predecessor and I have continued to lend my support to the project.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the development costs of the brand are expected to amount to approximately £2.3 million, which will cover the production of television advertising, other communications materials and the new visual identity.  The identity also involves the development of a consistent visual look which, over time, should be adopted on all published tourism promotional items.  I understand from Bord Fáilte that expenditure to date by it in respect of the development costs amounts to approximately £2 million.</P>
    <P>The roll out of the new brand is expected to take place on a phased basis over the next year. The new television advertising will be progressively introduced in all the key markets by spring next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of my question, which was excluded because it was more the concern of Bord Fáilte than the Minister, related to the future role of the shamrock, which is the current Bord Fáilte logo and corporate image.  Will the Minister confirm it is not intended to do away with the shamrock logo?  Will he indicate the future role of the shamrock <i>vis-á-vis</i> the new tourism brand and the ideas of the international consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion arose as a result of the international analysis carried out by Bord Fáilte.  This was a sophisticated project regarding how others view us.  Irrespective of whether we like it, the conclusion was that, while the shamrock was important to some people, others had not heard of it.  In order to deal with the confusion, Bord Fáilte issued a news release on 17 September which stated:</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte wishes to correct recent media and political speculation that it has any plans to drop or interfere with the use or design of its existing shamrock logo and corporate identity. The Bord Fáilte shamrock logo is currently used by the organisation as its corporate identity here in Ireland and in all overseas markets where Bord Fáilte has an involvement.  Bord Fáilte has no plans to change that identity or its usage in any of these markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's second point relates to the use of the shamrock in the new brand which is being developed by the board.  However, I cannot supply that information until the launch on 11 November. <Col N="590" /> Nevertheless, one must draw certain conclusions when one takes into account what the board said about its corporate logo and its intention to continue using it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of recent research by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on developments in overseas tourism markets.  One of the findings was that the level of repeat business in Ireland is disappointing and should be addressed.  Does the Minister consider a conflict exists in that a huge amount of money is being spent to create a new image for the country to attract more tourists while those who have already visited the country appear reluctant to return?  Would it not be in our best interests to ensure that the experience of those who visit the country is much improved in terms of encouraging them to return and in the hope that they will encourage others to visit Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope that people who leave Ireland would do so as ambassadors and encourage others to visit.  However, given the facilities which exist for travel, the time available for leisure and the economic boom in many countries, people want to travel to as many places as possible. This matter could be considered in detail at the relevant committee.  We must continue to market the country and present it as an internationally attractive location with high standards and quality.  This is the type of thumb print I wish to see on everything that is done.  We want to heighten standards throughout rather than draw people down.</P>
      <P>The ITIF report, which is welcome, highlighted this matter.  However, I receive reports from a large number of people who continually return to Ireland.  On some occasions they make valid comments about possible improvements on what is on offer in Ireland.  There is a high level of repeat business and we must continue to work on this in an environment which is constantly changing.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the stagnation in tourism revenue from Italy in each of the years from 1994 to date, following record growth in the previous four years; and the action, if any, being taken to revive the market.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism traffic to Ireland from Italy grew dramatically from the mid-1980s to the early-1990s, increasing sixfold over this period with a corresponding increase in revenue.  The market peaked in 1994.  However, in the past two years, the general weakness of the Italian economy, and in particular the devaluation of the Italian lira, has made Ireland a more expensive destination to visit and resulted in a corresponding decline in numbers and revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> While we cannot rely on an up turn in the Italian economy to revive this market, I am confident the new tourism brand for Ireland, which will be launched soon, will boost the promotional awareness of Ireland in our overseas markets, including Italy.  Under the new brand initiative, intensive marketing campaigns are planned for our main markets, including the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.  These markets will receive the maximum marketing and promotional support to ensure that numbers and, in particular, revenue from these markets will grow steadily over the coming years and that the full potential of these markets is achieved.</P>

      <P>At the end of 1995, ABT carried out a survey of indigenous firms exporting to Britain.  The results indicated that a small number of firms, with exceptionally high UK market dependency, were experiencing difficulties.</P>
      <P>In response, ABT established a special task force in that market, consisting of marketing specialists, which is focusing on exporters experiencing particular difficulties.  The task force is currently working with 22 companies to help them increase their overall export sales.  It is also helping selected companies replace loss making or marginally profitable business with new sales opportunities in new market segments at better margins.</P>

      <P>The advice of the ABT to its task force concentrated on companies which fulfilled the criteria of over 25 per cent of turnover sold to Britain and turnover of over £500,000.  It contacted 369 companies, of which 171 requested meetings.  Work is either completed or under way with 71 companies and I am advised that from the original list of 21 companies which regarded sterling as a significant factor, only five now do <Col N="592" /> so as a result of changed circumstances and ABT assistance.  However, a further 17 companies which recently met the task force indicated that sterling is an issue in their areas.</P>

Visitors from countries outside these areas were down 9 per cent and represented the only market to show a drop.  Bord Fáilte's current forecast is that visitor numbers will increase by about 10 per cent to 4.7 million this year and that revenue will increase at a broadly similar rate.</P>
      <P>The forecast for the tourism industry in 1997 is for continued growth although this will be dependent on a number of factors, such as economic conditions in our main markets, and the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>

Bord Fáilte made estimates in the number of tourists that come into this country based on the Central Statistics Office results of their surveys on visitors.  There is a clear difference between visitors and tourists.  In future when the Minister is replying to these questions as Minister for Tourism and Trade, could he give us the estimated tourist figures, because it is very confusing?  To use overall visitor figures bloats the tourism figures.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is in possession and he has seven minutes speaking time remaining. This includes time added on which was expended on interventions.</P>

      <P>I did not know I got injury time for interventions; that is most welcome.  I will summarise some of the comments I was making before the break.</P>
      <P>Every possible step was taken politically at the highest level, with the Russian Prime Minister in Moscow, the technical delegations, and my opposite number over two months to avert a ban. We were shown media reports within the Moscow media depicting Irish mad beef to be a possible risk to human health and showing the real public concerns that exist there.  This culminated in an agreement to defer any decision pending the most senior veterinary and health officials coming to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That process concluded in an arrangement and an agreement containing the regionalisation proposal was put to us late last Friday night on a take it or leave it basis and we left it.  We pressed again on Saturday morning, seeking a further mitigation <Col N="656" /> and exemption from the regionalisation categorisation.  I was not present.  We asked whether it was obligatory for us to sign this and we were told that it was not, but that the consequences of not signing it would be that the delegation would return to Moscow and advocate a ban to the Prime Minister with effect from 1 November. He was quite angry that there was not an agreement on Friday night.  He then told us we had five minutes to make our decision.  That is my recollection of what happened and there are witnesses to verify its accuracy.</P>
    <P>This circumstance in my view would have led to a really serious situation because of our dependence, rightly or wrongly, on the Russian market. Not only is it the most important market in terms of volume, but it takes forequarter beef, the cheaper cuts which have proved the least easy to sell in the European market in terms of mince and burgers.  There is a strategic fit as well as a volume and money factor worth more than £325 million.  It was outlined to me that beef from the three counties in question can be sold as part of the 170,000 tonnes of sales to continental Europe or part of the 50,000 tonnes that we are selling to Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and South Africa and that this, therefore, was a confinement factor within meat plants.  The lots could possibly be simply bought in the normal way.  Some meat would be stamped for sale in Russia and other meat would go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Before agreeing to this I discussed the matter with some of the largest exporters of beef to Russia and they indicated to me that it was manageable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I met with and spoke to representatives of the meat industry yesterday.  All representatives were spoken to yesterday at a meeting in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to add one further comment to those I made earlier.  Since June of this year, I have been working intensively with the Department to try to put in place a traceability scheme that would chart the entire movements in one file of an animal over its lifetime.  It is the new passport scheme.  It will include information on where the animal is born, every county it was in when a premium was claimed in respect of it and everywhere it was TB tested.  We produced these details to the Russians.  They were not acceptable to them. It is my intention to look at the affected counties <Col N="657" /> to try to implement a pilot scheme early and, perhaps, to bring specific proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>For some months now I have been pressing that the computer related issues, the financial and personnel issues be accelerated.  I cannot indicate a precise date at this time, but it is my intention to move in the direction of guarantees in this regard. There may be questions to do with flagged herds, as is the case with Northern Ireland, and other assurances may be sought as a consequence of this.  They would be far more preferable, specific and reassuring, however, than the approach taken by the Russian veterinary authorities.  I intend to report to the House as soon as I have detailed practical proposals in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, may I ask the Minister if he has the matching resources in his Department to deal with the financial implications of purchasing equipment and providing adequate personnel to do what he has just outlined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since 16 September we have already spent money on computerised facilities.  Every female animal that has to be slaughtered must check against the records in the herd.  Additional resources would be required for the measures I outlined and I will have to put a proposal to Government in that regard.  There is not provision in the existing Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to meet the leaders of all the farm organisations this evening and tomorrow evening to brief them fully on the position and to outline to them the importance of taking a calm approach.  This problem is disease and incident led and we must work together to reassure our customers, particularly the Russians, that there is no need for further concern arising out of this decision.</P>
      <P>This debate will not change the Protocol nor will any amount of protest.  We must proceed on the basis that the Protocol is a fact of life and ensure that there is both price stability and consolidation. The most important issue is that farmers' incomes are fully protected.</P>

      <P>The Minister maintains that nothing can be done at this stage.  Will he not accept that the Taoiseach should intervene personally in this matter and travel to Russia?  Such action was taken formerly by a Fianna Fáil Minister when a similar problem arose and the then Taoiseach spoke to his counterpart by telephone. This is a serious problem but the Minister does not seem to accept it is serious in the three counties affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy, who is from one of the affected counties, that not only do I fully appreciate it but I appreciate it more than anyone else.  This morning I had a report from our Ambassador in Moscow which indicated that <Col N="658" /> it would be counterproductive for me or anyone else to go to Russia this week or next week.  The Ambassador is of the view that it would be better to let the dust settle.  His diplomatic assessment is that the best deal that can be done has been done. I assure the Deputy that in the arrangement of any political visit, I will have close contact with the Taoiseach and the most effective political visit will be planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come to discuss this latest debacle in the handling of the BSE problem and I assure the Minister that I will not involve myself in hysterics, nor will I be making a prophecy of doom and gloom.  As Opposition spokesman it is my job to scrutinise closely the actions of the Minister and his Minister of State; the inadequacy of the political response since 20 March; the failure of the Minister to give this matter top political priority; the level of total disinterest in this industry on the part of those sitting around the Cabinet table, many of whom are there because they made unsubstantiated allegations subsequently proven to be so at a tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry, and who are not prepared to represent an unrepresented industry, the food industry.  Those are the political facts of life as the Minister sits around the Cabinet table.</P>
      <P>We have reached this debacle today because there has been an abject political failure to recognise the magnitude of this problem and to put in place a political response to the problems that have arisen since the announcement on 20 March. This Administration has failed abysmally to defend our national interest and an economy that depends on this industry 20 times more than any other economy in the EU.</P>
      <P>The Minister's strategy, which he has outlined to us since 20 March, was so good he had to use demeaning terminology to describe how a gun was put to his head by a veterinary inspector of the Russian Federation on an airport tarmac.  We have now had the dramatic revelation that the Minister, as the political head of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, whose brief is to protect, maintain and uphold the integrity of our product throughout the world, was forced to sign on the dotted line in Dublin Airport last Saturday. That is the strategy being used to protect thousands of farm livelihoods and PAYE workers who are dependent on a vibrant beef processing industry.  The Minister's strategy led us to that political cul-de-sac in Dublin Airport last Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>The Minister expects me to congratulate him and the Taoiseach on the great job they have done to protect the integrity of our product.  The Minister's contribution today is proof positive of the tardiness with which this matter has been dealt, even if we were to confine it to the Russian market alone, as the Minister sought to do in his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first debate on this crisis following the announcement on 20 March I told the Minister I was appalled at his statement to the House <Col N="659" /> because not one political decision had been taken by the Government.  A decision was not taken to form a Cabinet sub-committee under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach which would monitor the crisis on a weekly basis.  A decision was not taken to co-ordinate all our resources and decide what needed to be done to reassure all the customers who are now questioning the quality of our beef because of the perception that in some way we are associated with the British market.  A decision was not taken to direct the Minister for Finance to give the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the resources he required to ensure we not only maintain our current position, but improve on it.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question from my colleague, Deputy Smith, the Minister told the House this afternoon, with a straight face, that he still does not have resources available to him to put in place a proper traceability system to ensure quality assurance for the national herd.  The Minister has the gall to come into the House, having disowned the farmers of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, and suggest he will consider a pilot traceability programme for those counties.  What good is that to them now when the harm has been done?</P>
    <P>The Minister claims he has been doing all he could since 20 March, but why did the Taoiseach not tell the Tánaiste, who has done nothing as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Finance to give the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the resources he requires?</P>
    <P>When I came back from my visit to Iran I was ridiculed.  The Minister's spindoctors said there was little point in going to Iran because this was only a technical problem and it would be resolved in two or three weeks.  I have the data and the newspaper cuttings to prove it.  We were told the matter would be settled in a couple of weeks and that Fianna Fáil was involved in showmanship. Having met the Iranians face to face, I told the Minister that a joint trade commission meeting should be held under the chairmanship of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring.  He was not interested.  I told the Taoiseach during Question Time that if the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs was not prepared to go, it would be sufficient for his junior colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to go &mdash; I knew that from my contacts with the Iranians at the time.</P>
    <P>There is a political agenda here, just as there is a technical agenda.  On the Minister's analysis this was a technical problem which could be dealt with by the technical people and that there was no point in him, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or anybody else becoming involved.  He said we should not worry about it, that it was under control. That was the line taken by the Minister, the Taoiseach and everybody involved in this Administration, and the outcome of that strategy is that last Saturday a decision was taken to exclude three counties from the Russian market.  The <Col N="660" /> Russians demanded this.  They put a gun to the Minister's head and he had to sign.</P>
    <P>Why is it that in a country which is the biggest beef exporter in the northern hemisphere, producing 550,000 tonnes of beef, consuming only 50,000 tonnes at home, more dependent on the trade than anybody else, with a Government that came in on top of an economic boom of record trade surpluses and exports, it is regarded as unsophisticated or crass to suggest, when we have a problem with the biggest component of our food industry, that the Ministers or political heads of the relevant Departments should go to those countries to ensure that those with whom we are trading understand the political significance of this product to us and that we are prepared to do everything possible to assuage any fears they have and deal with them promptly and unreservedly? Times out of number I have spoken on this during Private Members' Business.  This is only the second time since the issue of BSE arose that the Government has given even its own backbenchers an opportunity to discuss this issue, as they and backbenchers on this side of the House have been asking to do.  It is only now, on foot of this debacle, that we are to have a debate that the magnitude of the problem merits.  Everyone in this House is agreed that this issue is far more important than many of the issues we have debated during the past few months.  Now we have the opportunity to have a debate, dragged out of a Fine Gael Taoiseach, a man who knows and is as dependent upon the rural constituencies as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept that there was an inevitability about what happened last Saturday. As far as I can see there were no negotiations. Let me take the Minister through his speech, which is an indictment of his tardiness.  It is probably the longest suicide note, in political terms, it has been my displeasure to have to listen to in this House in a long time.  I expected the Minister to come through with a detailed analysis of the Russian situation.  He said in July and August there was an increase in the incidence of BSE which brought the annual rate this year to 35, double last year's incidence.  Between 16 September and 20 September a Bord Bia trade mission went to the Moscow Food Fair under the political leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  That must be the only time the Department of Agriculture in this Administration failed to get anything into the newspapers.  Perhaps there was a reason for there being no publicity, a reason the Minister did not go into detail on the outcome of the trade mission led by Deputy Deenihan.  Reading between the lines and from inquiries I can make as an Opposition spokesperson, it is clear that far from assuaging concerns, there were bigger problems in relation to the Russian trade after that delegation returned from Russia than there were before it went.</P>
    <P>We waited until the issue was raised on the margins of a veterinary conference in Malta two <Col N="661" /> weeks ago and were told that the Taoiseach had written a letter to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin about the matter.  Russia is our biggest market outside the EU, and there has been a problem with that market since July and August. However, nothing happened until two weeks ago. In the agricultural press it was hailed as a great coup that, instead of the Minister going to Russia, Mr. Avilov and the Russian veterinary people were coming here.  Mr. Avilov came here last week and was brought on a programme of visits during which the hammer hit us on the back of the head.  The Minister says he was left with no choice and could not prolong the negotiations any longer; he did what he had to do and it was in the interest of the country.  How could something be in our national interest when it is a national disaster? According to the Minister, he ran out of time.  In his speech he suggested that he did not come on the scene until the Protocol was to be signed, and was not involved on Friday night or on Saturday morning.  Even if he was, and wants to change the account of events again to suit his argument and claim he ran out of time and had to sign last Saturday or we would have lost our market, there was a problem since July and August and nothing was done.  There was a problem when the Minister of State went to Russia from 16 to 20 September, and there was still a problem when the conference took place in Malta in early October, but nothing was done.  Then two weeks ago a letter was written by the Taoiseach which it was supposed would solve everything.  It did not, and what happened last week was the result of a tardy and complacent performance by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister's analysis of the situation is that this is not a political but a technical issue.  Now the farmers of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan are excluded from the Russian market, and not for any technical or scientific reason.  To quote the Minister's words on radio yesterday, this is a farce.  The Minister has come here to defend it and says it is beyond his control.  The Minister's political epitaph will be: &ldquo;I have created a farce which is not of my making&rdquo;.  That is how the farmers perceive what has happened.  That is how Government backbenchers see it also, although they will not say it.  Those are the realities, and he will have to face the political consequences.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister regionalisation will apply in Russia.  He said that the Russians told him that was the way it would be and he had to accept it.  He says this will not be acceptable in relation to any other market.  How can he reconcile those two statements?  Is he saying he will not accept it if the Iranians say exports to them will be subject to similar conditions?  The Minister has already acceded to the principle and has no credible position left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to listen and he can reply when he gets his opportunity.  I would make sure we would not have got into this position in the first instance.  Even if I found myself in this position I would not decide in five minutes what would happen regarding the disease status of the national beef herd.  The Russians have been moved to a higher subsidy zone as regards the price of beef and the level of subsidy it receives from export refunds.  The European Union organised that for Russia.  Where was the political leverage of the President of the Council of Ministers which spoke to Mr. Avilov about that matter?  That is not a veterinary matter, it is a political matter.  If the Presidency of the Council of Ministers meant anything it would have been used as leverage at a time when it was considered we would lose our disease free status of the national herd.  There was no political contact on a person to person basis on this matter at any time.  One cannot expect to have friends in court if one is not prepared to knock on the door.</P>
      <P>In another capacity I was faced with a deadline. As Minister for Transport I was told by the civil aviation authorities, during the negotiation of an air transport agreement between Ireland and the US, that if I did not accept certain proposals the Irish would not be able to negotiate with the US until the following March, by which date the summer schedule of Aer Lingus would be in chaos. It was something we could not even contemplate given the circumstances and the difficult situation in Aer Lingus at the time.</P>
      <P>I told the Taoiseach that the authorities were making an offer which was totally against our political position in relation to maintaining the status of Shannon and ensuring it was not ignored in respect of any future US transport agreements we might make with them.  That was against a background of everyone telling me there was liberalisation on the global market, that the US do not make any exceptions, that the US would not contemplate any further suspension of a deal in this matter.  We rejected that offer.  Subsequently at a political level I met my counterpart, Mr. Péna, the Transport Commissioner, and we did a deal which ensured that for every plane that went into Dublin, a plane went into Shannon.  That was a political decision motivated by political heads of Departments which ensured we got an agreement with which we could live.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach to this matter from 20 March has been that of a powerless politician, that nothing can be done and that he has to leave it to the veterinarians.  Then he wonders why he has arrived at this débâcle.  There has been no effective political input from the Minister or his superiors in Government to carry out what was needed.  That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will explain how these things work.  The higher subsidy status secured for Russia by the European Union was worth something to them.  Its subsidy status was even lower than that of the African market and perhaps the Middle East at one stage.  The Minister is President of the Council of Ministers.  If ever the Irish Presidency was to mean something, this was the time to show that card but not to Mr. Avilov, who is in charge of the veterinary services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In July and August when there was an indication that Russia was about to impose conditions on our exports the Minister should have gone to his political counterpart in Russia and made him aware of the position.  On that basis he should have been prepared to accept the Minister's assurances.  If the Minister or the Government had been proactive on the traceability issue and able to show improvements in terms of filling in the gaps, which had appeared as a result of the BSE crisis, the Minister would have been able to assure our customers that in respect of every beast moved we had a record. The Minister made all the right noises but the reality is that he has not got one extra penny to deal with the largest animal disease problem that has hit this country since the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is coming from a country which is a beneficiary of the Common Agricultural Policy. I am being asked why I am pushing this political boat out.  I am pushing it because 15 people who are supposed to defend the interests of farmers meet every Tuesday morning in Government Buildings.</P>

      <P>My apologies, 15 and a half.  A dummy sits beside the Minister who chatters all the time outside the door.  No political decision has been made by this Administration.  Because of all the resources available to it, the Government has been able to overtax the electorate as it prepares to give back money next year.  Tax packages of £700 million and £300 million have been talked about, yet on the Minister's figures, we do not have £14 million to install a computerised movement permit system which would deal with the position, rendering operation Matador totally unnecessary.  Will we have another operation in Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan and if so, what will be its name?  Will it be operation sell-out? One-third of our national herd is left outside the door.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out three or four examples of what could have happened but did not happen.  Those are the facts and no one can walk away from them.  The Minister said he was the first man to get into Libya since Kubla Khan.</P>

      <P>He was the first man to get into Libya since Lockerbie.  The Minister said he would have the veterinarians over here having spoken to various people and that there would be no problem.  There is no sign of them.</P>
      <P>I have told the House about the Iranian situation time out of number but the Minister feels he should not listen.  That is his decision but he must take the political consequences when it goes wrong.  If the Minister wishes to put up a defence that this was inevitable, the only way he can convince anyone that that was the case is that he should have done everything possible at a political level in the interim.  His flank is now wide open to attack because he has done nothing at a political level.  He is so communitarian as President of the Council of Agricultural Ministers that when it comes to the Fischler proposals, he says: &ldquo;we are the European surplus, we are the problem, so we had better take what medicine is going because there are very difficult people out in the foyer.  I will talk to them through the microphone and see whether I can assuage them&rdquo;.  That is the attitude and there is no recognition of a special position.  Is the Minister suggesting we will have a 15 per cent <i>pro rata</i> cut across the European Union?  Why should we take a 15 per cent cut since we are far more dependent on it than any other country?  The special position of Irish agriculture has always been recognised within the European Union when much more difficult problems arose, such as the CAP reform issue, for the then Minister, Mr. O'Kennedy, and his successor, Deputy Joe Walsh.  We saw what could be done by having the political competence to deal with the issue.  The Minister is an innocent abroad.  His political niavety has to be seen to be believed, he called a press conference on Tuesday last before having worked out the details.  He said that unfortunately he had to exclude three counties but he saved four and that that was the best he could do. In reply to a question on the details, he said he did not know yet, that he was working on them. That was the Minister's press conference.  We are supposed not to heap confusion on confusion and not to get hysterical but to say well done to the Minister who is doing his best.  Our economy is going down the Swanee.</P>

      <P>When I asked the Department how this would operate it said it was still being worked on.  I acknowledge there are technical and other issues which must be dealt with, but there is little point in giving us half the story.  The Minister will probably say that a beast bought by a <Col N="665" /> County Meath farmer from a County Tipperary farmer 12 months ago is regarded as a County Tipperary beast as that was where he was first tested.  It is a nonsense to think that all cattle in counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan will be kept inside the county boundaries and that there will be no movement of cattle throughout the country.  The Minister knows this is a nonsense, yet he agreed to it.</P>
      <P>We need to move this issue to a different political level.  Despite his good intentions and working from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. the Minister is not able to deliver and does not know how to do the job.  As I have been saying since 28 March, until such time as the Taoiseach and Tánaiste take responsibility for this huge problem it will not be solved.</P>
      <P>The first breach of our defences has been achieved as a result of the consistent failure at political level since March to build up allies in our markets on whom we could call when we needed them.  The Minister failed to build up allies and regarded the problem as a technical and veterinary issue.  With all due respect to that profession, vets do not run the country or make political decisions; they help the Minister in whatever way they can at a technical level.</P>
      <P>This Administration &mdash; many of whose members made unsubstantiated allegations over the years &mdash; must realise that it has to represent what it terms the &ldquo;unrepresentables&rdquo; and fight on behalf of the farmers, producers and PAYE workers who depend on this industry.  All the resources necessary to deal with this problem must be put at the Minister's disposal.  The Minister has yet to convince the Minister for Finance that a £14 million investment in a traceability system is a good investment.  This sum is peanuts when one is trying to save a £1.7 billion industry, yet the Minister cannot get it because no one around the Cabinet table gives a damn.  The Minister said he would deal with the problem, but we now see how far he has got.  To use his own demeaning terminology, he has acceded to blackmail and a gun to his head.  Never before have we been required to meet a deadline of 1 November on 17 October.  Yet the Minister is still saying he can sort out the problem.</P>
      <P>This issue is beyond the control of the Minister and it is time the Taoiseach and Tánaiste faced up to their political responsibilities, made the resources available and sent someone else to Russia. It was sad to hear the Irish Ambassador tell the Minister not to go to Russia as he was not welcome and the dust had not settled.  There was much dust kicked in the Minister's face at Dublin Airport and he did not have much to say about that.  If this débâcle is not sorted out soon the Minister's career in this portfolio will come to an end and he will be sent to greener fields elsewhere.</P>

      <P>My party utterly rejects any attempt by the Russians or anyone else to create beef exclusion zones.  The Minister stands condemned for his failure to confront that decision with scientific <Col N="666" /> evidence and statistical data.  By conceding to the Russians on this issue he has opened the floodgates.  I challenge him to explain the basis on which the decision to impose a ban on these three counties was arrived at and accepted by him.</P>
      <P>The agricultural statistics published by the CSO give details of livestock numbers in each county in 1995 and the incidence of BSE during 1996.  The statistics confirm that BSE is occurring at a rate of one case for every 17,000 cows in County Monaghan, one case for every 39,000 cows in County Cork and one case for every 49,000 cows in County Tipperary.  These statistics do not suggest that there is a BSE epidemic in any of these counties, least of all in counties Cork and Tipperary.  It is difficult to discern the justice in including these counties in a banned list.  No county should be included on a banned list but if there is such a list then these three counties should not be included on it.</P>
      <P>The statistics give rise to some interesting questions. To date this year there has been one case of BSE for every 22,000 in County Wexford.  This is much higher than the infection rate in either counties Cork or Tipperary.  On the basis of the information publicly available, there is no scientific justification for subjecting any county to a ban on beef sales.  However, if such a ban were to be imposed then counties Cork and Tipperary would be among the least suitable candidates for inclusion given the low incidence of disease in both counties.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister as a matter of urgency place before the House all the relevant information on which the Russians based their decision to ban the importation of beef from counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan?  There is no reason the scientific evidence and statistical data made available to the Russians should not also be made available to this House and the public.  We have heard much from this Administration about openness, transparency and accountability.  The Minister now has an opportunity to practise what his Government preaches.  If he has nothing to hide then he has nothing to lose.  I am highly sceptical that there is anything in the publicly available data which would provide a scientific basis to support the Russian ban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the crisis facing us was summed up aptly yesterday by the President of the Irish Butchers' Federation when he described the latest debacle as, &ldquo;the final nail in the coffin as far as the beef industry in this country is concerned&rdquo;. The farming community is well aware of the damage wrought by the BSE problem.  Cattle prices have fallen by more than 20 per cent compared with a year ago, the value of the national herd has fallen by up to £1 billion, exports of beef to continental Europe have plummeted and prices for cull cows have collapsed, causing major knock-on problems in the dairy industry.  Cows due for culling are now being retained on farms and their milk output is pushing the dairy industry into a very serious super-levy.  When we reach <Col N="667" /> the stage where farmers have to sell their cattle at a loss and dump milk in fields then it is no exaggeration to say that we are dealing with a problem on the scale of the economic war of the 1930s.  It is not only farmers who will suffer if the current crisis is allowed continue or deteriorate further.  The beef processing industry, already seriously underdeveloped, will lose any chance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The beef processing industry, already seriously underdeveloped, will lose any chance of becoming a modern food industry generating substantial employment.  Agribusiness will suffer and those supplying fertiliser, animal feed, veterinary products and other materials to the farming industry will be hit by the knock-on effect on every county.</P>
      <P>Farming is the lifeblood of thousands of rural communities.  In hundreds of small towns pubs, shops, merchants, garages, banks, post offices, doctors and solicitors depend for their existence on the spending power of farming families living in their immediate hinterlands.  Farmers in my constituency are already suffering greatly due to the crisis and the Russian ban is the last thing they needed.  I want to leave the Minister in no doubt as to the seriousness of the problem and the ruinous implications of this unjustified ban on the beef farmers of Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are major political questions to be answered about the degree of urgency with which the Government has handled the BSE problem in recent months.

      <P>He did not consider it worth his while to turn up for a Seanad debate on the BSE issue on 21 March last.  It was left to the junior Minister, Deputy Durkan, to give full voice to the smug and complacent attitude the Government has adopted in this entire episode.  Pressed, as he was in the Seanad, on whether our system of controls is credible enough to preserve the reputation of the beef industry on the export or home markets, the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, stated, &ldquo;I think it is widely accepted that the measures in place have protected the reputation of, and market access for, Irish beef, which is accepted in 80 countries internationally&rdquo;.  The Minister should tell that to the Russians.</P>
      <P>We had further evidence of that complacency yesterday when an unnamed Fine Gael handler said Ireland had not lost one ounce of beef sales as a result of the Russian moves.  Does Fine Gael really believe the Russian ban has no implications for our beef industry?  Does he really believe Irish consumers will not be influenced by the decision of the Russians?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part and parcel of Government policy to transfer certain issues which require long-term planning to special bodies to consider and report on.  In doing so the Government recognises that persons outside its political and administrative spheres can make a significant contribution to public policy development. One such area which was given to a special review group to consider is health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. However, the treatment of that group's work in the Department raises serious questions about whether it is being used to forestall action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four and a half years ago the Review Group on Services for People with Sensory and Physical Disabilities was appointed.  In its first two years of existence it met on 16 occasions and conducted a consultation exercise to draw on the experiences and attitudes of individuals and groups intimately concerned with the problems facing people with physical and sensory disabilities. Since mid-1994 many obstacles have been put in the way of the group finalising and publishing its report, which was almost complete when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, took office.  All that was needed was administrative support, but that has been consistently withheld and a pattern of <Col N="669" /> delays and promises has been forthcoming from the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's appointment the review group did not meet for 11 months and a meeting was called then only because I tabled a Dáil question on the issue.  Subsequently the group met on four occasions and it held a consultation meeting on its draft report.  At that meeting the secretary of the Department stated publicly that the report would be published shortly and that there would be substantial additional funding made available to commence implementation of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue on the Adjournment on 30 May last but the Minister did not attend &mdash; I note he is not present tonight either.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who responded to the debate on 30 May, assured the House that he was committed to publishing the report and that it was being treated as a matter of urgency. I have received more than two dozen replies to questions from the Department this year stating that particular issues are being delayed in expectation of the report, which will be published without delay.  All those promises have been broken and the greater the delay the more disability organisations are of the opinion the Department is deliberately trying to avoid having to fund its recommendations in next year's budget.  This seems all the more likely following the Minister's decision to take physical and sensory disability services off his list of priorities.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give a commitment that the report will be published immediately.  I do not want another promise that will be broken.  I want him to ensure that the promise made by the Department's secretary to immediately begin implementation of its recommendation is fulfilled. If he fails to give these commitments he will undermine credibility in a Government response to the imminent report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure the Deputy and interested parties of my Department's commitment to publish the report of the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory disabilities.  As stated in a reply to a parliamentary question, it is intended that the review group report should have the same status and impact on persons with physical and sensory disabilities as the Needs and Abilities report has had on services for people with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The review group has a broad remit and is anxious to ensure its report will provide a blueprint for the more efficient and equitable provision of services in the future and deal with the major issues of concern to service users and their carers.  The draft report was discussed at the final scheduled meeting of the review group in July. Changes in the draft agreed at that meeting are now being made and some additional material is being provided by a number of voluntary agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> The revision is almost complete, the report is expected very shortly and it is intended that it will be published soon thereafter.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the delay in the publication of the report, it should be noted that the last few years have seen significant developments and improvements in the provision of health and personal support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Since 1993 additional revenue funding has been provided each year to develop these services.  A total of £1.5 million was provided in 1993 and 1994, £2 million was provided in 1995 and £1 million in 1996.  This means that the cumulative amount of money available for physical disability services in 1996 is £6 million more than that available prior to 1993.</P>
    <P>The additional funds have been allocated to each health board on the basis of the relative population.  They have been apportioned with particular emphasis being placed on the provision of day and residential care and the development of home care and care attendant schemes. Priority has also been given to developing respite care, speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, language disorder units, psychologist services and the provision of technical aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>In addition, capital funding of £3 million in 1995 and £1.55 million in 1996 has also been provided for the provision of new residential and respite facilities, the refurbishment and upgrading of some existing facilities and the provision of essential equipment for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As part of the operational programme, for the first time capital is being provided for the upgrading of vocational training centres for people with disabilities.  A total of £33.58 million is being provided during the period of 1994-99 of which £18.2 million is European Regional Development Funds and £15.38 million is Exchequer funding. Capital funding under this programme is being made available for the provision of new training centres, upgrading existing workshops, the provision and upgrading of associated support facilities which will result in improved workshop standards, and the purchase of new and replacement items of equipment.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group will make recommendations for the further development of those services.  It will also make recommendations on the future development of the personal assistant service for people with significant disabilities, the subject last year of a separate report by an advisory group.</P>
    <P>I again confirm my Department's commitment to the publication of the report of the review group and to the further development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

      <P>Tá buíochas liom freisin leis an Ceann Comhairle cead a thabhart dom an abhar seo a phlé sa Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The Clare Haven House Project is a voluntary organisation set up to provide accommodation, information and support to women and children who are being physically, emotionally and sexually abused in their homes.</P>
    <P>The project workers have sought funding from the Minister through the Mid-Western Health Board over a number of years.  In the first year they wish to provide their current services as well as a public office, advice visits, workshops and one permanent member of staff.  The amount requested for that year is £41,700.  In 1995 the project was allocated £5,000 through lottery funding by the Mid-Western Health Board, but from the start of 1996 to date no money has been provided. The women involved are devoting a great deal of their time to setting up this important service and they cannot continue to provide the service from voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>In case anybody might think that there is not a need for the service being provided, it is interesting to consider the relevant figures for County Clare.  In 1993-94 50 protection orders and 81 barring orders were granted in the county, in 1994-95 56 protection orders and 79 barring orders were granted and from 1996 to date 51 protection orders and 60 barring orders were granted and eight new safety orders have been put in place under the recent legislation.</P>
    <P>Despite the alarmingly high numbers of orders granted, it is estimated that no more than 10 per cent of women in abusive relationships go to court.  In September 1996 20 women sought the support of Clare Haven House and the need for it has been clearly established.  The cost of funding it are substantial and there are many claims on the Minister's resources, but the project workers have put forward an excellent submission for the funding required to the Mid-Western Health Board, which presumably it will pass on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Services of this nature were not available to women in County Clare until 1993 when the project workers got together and set up Clare Haven House.  The work being done on a voluntary basis by these women is extraordinarily successful. Unfortunately it is necessary and requires State support.  At a time when wrong signals have been sent out to vulnerable women from this House, I urge the Minister to carefully consider their case for funding and deal with it in accordance with the resources available to him.  Since a major part of the project is the provision of a safe refuge for a number of women and children, he should ensure that sufficient funding is made available to enable that project develop in an effective manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House and I would like to assure all present that I am fully aware of the <Col N="672" /> excellent support services provided by Clare Haven House to women and children who are the victims of domestic violence in County Clare.  The project is in ongoing contact with the Mid-Western Health Board and over the last number of years has received financial assistance from the board.  In November 1995 a grant of £6,000 was paid to Clare Haven House from the national lottery block grant through the Mid-Western Health Board.  In April 1996 further funding was paid to it by the board in connection with initiatives concerning women's health and in June of this year funding was provided to it to cover the cost of public information material.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain to the House that the principal emergency residential care and support service for victims of domestic violence in the mid-west region is provided at Adapt House, Rosbrien, Limerick.  Each year over 100 families are provided with a residential service, including an average of 12 families from County Clare.</P>
      <P>Officers of the Mid-Western Health Board are in ongoing contact with Clare Haven House and have encouraged the development of locally based services in County Clare which are complementary to the regional residential service provided at the Adapt refuge.  Such services would include counselling, public education and information and post discharge support services.  I have been assured by the board that proposals for further service developments at Clare Haven House in 1997 will be considered by the board in the context of available funding for the development of child care and family support services.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of appropriate services within the health area for victims of domestic violence.  The discussion document, Developing a Policy on Women's Health, launched earlier this year identifies services for victims of domestic violence as one of the priorities for the further enhancement of services to protect women's health.  The document is the basis for consultation with all those interested in improving the health and welfare of Irish women, including those involved in the provision of services to victims of domestic violence.  I fully recognise the essential role of women's refuges as a key element in the range of support services required to address the problem.  I am particularly conscious of the fact that while comprehensive information on the number of women who are unable to obtain accommodation in women's refuges is not available, there does appear to a shortfall in the overall provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, across a range of Government Departments, the Government is making determined efforts to address this perceived need.  The Department of the Environment provides considerable financial assistance towards the development of women's refuges under the capital assistance scheme for voluntary organisations.  In so far as <Col N="673" /> my Department is concerned, provision has been made in recent years for a sum of £450,000 in capital grants towards the development of women's refuges in Dublin, Kerry, Galway and Dundalk.  This year a grant of more than £100,000 has been made available to the Eastern Health Board towards the running cost of the new Bray women's refuge.  In addition, increased financial support has been made available for counselling and telephone helpline services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>I recognise that all those working with victims of domestic violence, women and children, in whatever capacity, are doing a superb job in what are often difficult and demanding circumstances and they fully deserve society's gratitude, respect and support.  The provision of emergency refuge accommodation and other family support services, while necessary, deals only with the symptoms and does not confront the issue of violence. This is a much more complex issue and one which no Government Department or agency can tackle in isolation.  The nature of the problem calls for a wide-ranging inter-agency and inter-disciplinary approach.</P>
    <P>The Government, in response to recommendations made by Women's Aid concerning the need for an integrated response to problems associated with domestic violence, has decided to assign responsibility for co-ordinating policy on women and violence across Government Departments, to the office of the Tánaiste.  The office has established a working group on violence against women, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, on which the Department of Health and health boards are represented. The working group is due to report to Government in February 1997.  The Department of Health and the health boards are co-operating fully with the office of the Tánaiste to ensure that the health services play a full role in protecting women and children from violence and in providing services for victims of violence.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Protection of Listed Buildings.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of the need for proper measures to be introduced to protect listed buildings in light of what I can only describe as a scandalous development in regard to No. 16 Parnell Square.  Yesterday, 16 October 1996, the Dublin city architect, Jim Barrett, issued a registered letter to Anne Walsh, the tenant of the Garden Bistro restaurant on the ground floor of No. 16 Parnell Square, Dublin 1, which she received today.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>Dear Mrs. Walsh, I refer to the above matter and to the dangerous building notices dated 11th July and 15th August last served in respect of the above premises.  It is now proposed to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> demolish the remainder of the premises on Friday next, 18th October at 9.00 a.m.  It is imperative that you vacate the premises by then.  I am satisfied that the building in its current state is dangerous and the only way in which to make the premises safe is to carry out further demolition.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 15 October the Planning and Development Committee of Dublin City Council agreed unanimously to my motion that an urgent inquiry be made into the circumstances surrounding the removal of the roof of No. 16 Parnell Square, a listed building, and that immediate measures be taken to restore and protect the fine features of the building.  No response to the councillors' wishes has been received from the corporation. That is a flagrant flouting of the authority and the expressed wishes of the local councillors.</P>
    <P>The matter goes back to 11 July and 15 August when the then owner was instructed by the dangerous buildings section of Dublin Corporation &ldquo;to demolish No. 16 to a safe level and remove all consequent debris&rdquo;.  This crude and sloppy order was not acted upon until Mr. John Byrne, a notorious property speculator and developer who has been in Dublin for more than three decades and is well known to those who read <i>The Destruction of Dublin</i>&mdash; an erstwhile friend of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey &mdash; bought the property and removed the roof, leaving the building open to the elements and allowing the fine ceiling and various features, particularly on the second and ground floors, to be destroyed, thereby rendering the building dangerous.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Walsh employed structural engineers who examined the building and found it not to be structurally unsound, apart from the rear return where there was a fault and a small fire had occurred last week.  Mrs. Walsh succeeded in getting an injunction to enable her to continue her business on the ground floor without interference. An Taisce further inspected the building and also found it to be structurally sound.  The owner, Mr. Byrne, whose company is registered in Georgetown in the Cayman Islands, wishes to demolish the entire building, irrespective of the fact that it is 250 years old and is a listed building, and in its place build a modern development.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that the corporation facilitated Mr. Byrne by producing a sloppy and unspecific dangerous building order, to be executed at his discretion.  There was no communication between the dangerous buildings section and the planning section of Dublin Corporation on planning and conservation matters.  The corporation cannot require a private owner to maintain the building so that it does not become derelict and dangerous, neither can it enter and maintain a building when it becomes dangerous; it can only demolish it.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Report on the Preservation of the Country's Architectural Heritage, <Col N="675" /> published last month, contains 64 recommendations to amend the Planning Acts to protect listed buildings.  In the absence of statutory protection, there are people in the dangerous buildings section of Dublin Corporation who take perverse pleasure in demolishing listed buildings &mdash; time does not allow me to list other such buildings. I ask that this matter be dealt with, although I do not know what the Minister can do at present.  The least that is expected is that a period of time will be allowed to explore the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As you said, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was asked to comment on the need to ensure effective protection of listed buildings, but in the spirit and urgency of the matter raised by the Deputy I will convey to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, such matters as are appropriate for his consideration in terms of the function of the local authority.  I will also ask the heritage services section of my Department to liaise with the Heritage Council and consider its appropriate action as a matter of urgency to see if we can be of assistance in dealing with the specific case raised.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter and agree with him that there is a need to ensure effective protection measures for listed buildings and for the architectural heritage in general.  It was for this reason that the policy agreement for Government of December 1994, entitled, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contained a commitment to improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis and introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings, and to undertake a full national architectural audit.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my previous replies to questions in the House, a working group, made up of officials of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works, was established in February 1995 to examine these issues further and to report back with recommendations to me and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In examining the issues arising from its terms of reference, the interdepartmental working group engaged in broad consultations with a wide range of interested parties, including planning authorities. As the Deputy will be aware, the interdepartmental working group reported to me and the Minister for the Environment in June this year <Col N="676" /> and its report, entitled, Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage, was published, on 17 September and laid before the House on 25 September.</P>
    <P>The report contains 64 recommendations. Acknowledging the existing listing system as part of the planning process, the report recommends that this be built upon by addressing legislative and administrative weaknesses, to one of which the Deputy drew our attention.  It is proposed that &ldquo;listing&rdquo; remain a responsibility of planning authorities but that it become a mandatory statutory function supported by a centralised co-ordinating and advisory service.  It is proposed that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht nominate a central authority with responsibility, <i>inter alia,</i> for establishing and publishing national criteria and guidelines for listing and for making recommendations to planning authorities regarding buildings which should be included on the list for preservation.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that new legislation oblige planning authorities to have due regard to guidelines prepared by the central authority in relation to listing or works to listed buildings, to have due regard to any recommendations by the central authority with respect to buildings which should be included on the list for preservation and to have due regard to the recommendations of the central authority regarding proposed works to buildings which have been listed on the basis of central authority recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that financial incentives for the preservation of the architectural heritage should be achieved through a dual approach of providing fiscal relief through personal income tax, corporation tax relief or direct grant aid where such tax incentives are not appropriate provided that all works which benefit from such support are subject to control and monitoring.</P>
    <P>The report states that the successful implementation of the recommendations will require architectural conservation expertise at all levels and, in particular, that the services of a conservation officer should be available to each planning authority. It also recommends that an advisory service should be available to the owners of listed buildings through the planning authorities and the central authority.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, with the Minister for the Environment, to bring forward to Government without delay a package of specific financial, administrative and legislative proposals based on the recommendations in the report and taking into account any observations received on those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the implementation of such proposals will have considerable resource implications. However, the benefits of preserving our architectural heritage are already borne out by the fact that, as pointed out in the report of the <Col N="677" /> working group, it is possible to identify towns such as Kilkenny, Killarney and Kinsale where intact built heritage gives them a strong advantage in terms of benefit from the tourism economy. Investment of additional resources will increase those tourism benefits as well as creating additional employment in the building conservation sector.</P>
    <P>I will try to communicate the urgency of the specific case raised by the Deputy to the appropriate authorities.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Blanchardstown (Dublin) Regional Technical College Establishment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a good week for Blanchardstown with the opening of the new town centre, a remarkable commercial development which provides a commercial and retail hub in what is now one of the largest satellite towns in suburban Dublin.  As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, there has been a substantial population increase in the outer rim of the city in recent decades.</P>
      <P>In the 1986-91 intercensal period Fingal County, in which Blanchardstown is the largest built-up area, recorded the largest population growth of any county in the State.  As the Minister of State will recall, there was a considerable decline in the population of many counties.  In the more recent census completed this year this trend has continued and is reflected in the census figures.</P>
      <P>The county has the largest landbank zoned for residential development in the State.  It is clear that a disproportionate percentum of the younger age cohorts in the State will be concentrated in this general area for some decades to come.  A similar population pattern has developed in the Lucan and Palmerstown areas which are adjacent to Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>The logic for locating a regional technical college at that location is a compelling one and has been accepted in part by the steering committee which has advised the Higher Education Authority on this topic.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the Exchequer, there is another important aspect to this equation. There is a 31 acre site adjacent to the Blanchardstown Town Centre complex on which the Minister for Education has an option to purchase at pre-1990 prices.  The difficulty is that the option to purchase expires in March 1997.  Plainly, the matter should be under consideration in the context of the preparation of the annual Estimates.  I urge the Government not to lose this opportunity to acquire a site for the development of a regional technical college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA has had tremendous success in securing inward investment in the western suburbs of Dublin.  Major industrial sites have been developed at Leixlip, Blanchardstown and <Col N="678" /> Swords.  A statutory coalition has been formed with the local area partnership, comprising elected representatives and the many and varied industrial interests in the Dublin west region, to secure the establishment of a regional technical college.  Given the envisaged population growth and the huge investment the State has already made in local facilities, it is essential that the momentum of inward investment is maintained.</P>
    <P>The community is calling for the establishment of a regional technical college with teaching and research facilities in close co-operation with the varied industrial interests in the region to establish a spur for inward investment given the enormous anticipated growth in the younger age cohorts.  The essential case for such a college is based on demographic grounds, the need to provide a research focus for local industrial development as well as transportation grounds.  In a few weeks time the Northern Cross Motorway will open linking this area with Dublin Airport. This will give ease of access to the site for a large population in the growing greater Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to advise the House of the up-to-date position.</P>
      <P>In 1987 negotiations for the purchase of a 20.36 acre site for a new regional technical college at Blanchardstown had reached an advanced stage when the then Government decided to defer the provision of the new college with a number of other third level projects.  As a consequence the site was not purchased at that time.</P>
      <P>The report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, which was published on 11 July 1995, makes a series of recommendations in relation to the future development of the higher education sector.  In particular, it recommended that an regional technical college be located in Blanchardstown to serve the north, north-west and north-east Dublin regions, as well as growth areas in Meath and Kildare.  The current position is that the Government has approved in principle the recommendations of the steering committee as a benchmark for future planning in the higher education sector.</P>
      <P>The capital provision for third level education in the current year is £36.1 million.  Within that provision, there is an allocation of £20.4 million to meet the capital requirements of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical college sector.  Among the projects being funded from the allocation are major extensions to Cathal Brugha Street College of Catering and Limerick, Athlone, Letterkenny and Waterford regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> A decision in relation to the site purchase must have regard to major works of this nature, as well as other priorities and overall resource constraints within the capital provision.  The matter of the site purchase is being kept under active <Col N="680" /> review in that context.  As I have already indicated, the option on the site is open until the early part of 1997.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 October 1996.</P>

      <P>CERT, the agency for training and recruitment for the tourist industry, actively encourage, by way of national publicity, unemployed people to train for employment in the tourism industry.  They run a range of training programmes specially for the unemployed which offer excellent opportunities to obtain worthwhile employment.  For example, placement rates on completion of CERT training are over 80 per cent and in some regions are as high as 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1995 CERT trained more than 1,600 unemployed people: their target for the lifetime of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 is almost 10,000.  The adequacy of this target will be re-assessed in the context of the upcoming mid-term evaluation of the operational programme, having particular regard to developments in the industry since the launch of the programme.</P>
      <P>Cert advises that in order to make training more attractive to the unemployed, from this year on certification at elementary level is being provided by the National Tourism Certification Board for those following training programmes for the unemployed.  This will allow those who successfully complete elementary training to register for craft level national certification and thus create a career ladder for themselves.  In a separate development, elementary certification for those who train `on-the-job' will also be available from 1997.</P>

    <P>The Government recently agreed to provide up to £2 million over a three year period should the <Col N="594" /> current efforts by Sport for Television (Ireland) Limited succeed in securing the hosting of the initial stages of the 1998 <i>Tour de France</i> in Ireland, which the promoters estimate would cost in the region of £2.35 million.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed financial package is made up of contributions totalling £1.1 million from my own Department's Vote; £0.4 million from the Vote of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, £0.2 million from the Vote of the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport and £0.3 million from funds to be provided by local authorities through specific arrangements to be made by the Minister for the Environment.  The moneys would be paid out by Bord Fáilte and I understand that Sport for Television (Ireland) Limited, which would be responsible for organising the tour while in Ireland, expect, to raise an additional £350,000 from local interests.  The company is currently awaiting a formal decision by the Societie <i>Tour de France</i> as to whether Ireland will host the event.</P>

      <P>While tourism numbers and revenue from the US have grown significantly since 1993, studies carried out for and by Bord Fáilte have shown that there may still be potential for further growth especially from western and southern states.  Under the new initiative launched by Virgin Atlantic, passengers travelling to London with them from gateways in several key states will now be able to travel on to Ireland free of charge with British Midland.  This initiative extends the range of gateways and services available at very competitive fare levels from the US market and creates marketing opportunities in potentially important new areas of that market.  The initiative will operate from November 1996 to March 1997, and Virgin's own projections are for approximately 1,500 extra passengers who will arrive during the off-peak season.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the article on the Aran Islands to which the Deputy refers and I fully appreciate that tourism development must be <Col N="595" /> sensitive to and take account of the needs for preservation of our unique island culture.</P>
      <P>The local regional tourism organisations &mdash; RTOs &mdash; which are responsible for managing tourism flows within the country, help deal with any consequent problems that might arise in close conjunction with all other interested local groups. Measures to combat such problems will normally also require a high level of consultation between local groups and the local authority involved and are primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>In the case of the islands, the RTOs are encouraging a higher level of longer stay tourism traffic particularly outside the peak season.  The issues of sustainable development, seasonality and a wider dispersal of tourists throughout the country feature prominently in the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  One of the major aims of the programme is to concentrate a significant proportion of growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods.  Grant assistance for marketing activities is weighted in favour of proposals that aim to achieve this objective, while all capital projects assisted under the programme are required to comply with the best environmental standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 22, 27, 34 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be built in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The position is that, following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, I have been pursuing since January last, as recommended by the independent Product Development Management Board, an alternative strategy for a major international conference centre under the current Tourism Operational Programme.  In accordance with this strategy, Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the aforementioned product board, has been examining an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society, RDS, which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under operational programme for public and similar bodies.  The RDS has been advised, <i>inter alia</i>, that its proposed centre, which will be located at its headquarters in Ballsbridge, would have to operate without annual operating subsidy from the State or revenue from casino gaming.</P>
      <P>The possibility of a second proposal, involving a public-private joint venture, was also explored during the year but I was informed by Bord Fáilte, which is responsible for assessing such proposals, that the promoters were not in a position to submit the necessary outline details within deadlines set to allow assessment of suitability for inclusion in the alternative strategy.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and the product board have now completed their examination of the RDS proposal and have recommended a separate independent cost/benefit analysis.  This analysis is being undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm, selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.  Bord Fáilte informs me that it has been told by the consultants that they expect to be in a position to furnish the report in the next few days.  Once available, I will consider their finding, with those of the product board, with a view to referring the RDS proposal, if appropriate, for decision by Government as to possible submission to the European Commission which must individually approve major projects of this magnitude under the operational programme.</P>
      <P>In regard to planning, I have no function in this process and hence it would be inappropriate for me to speculate as to the prospects of any application to the relevant authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A timeframe for commencement or completion of the national conference centre cannot be finalised until a specific proposal has been formally approved by Government and the EU, and matters such as financing and planning permission are in place.  Consequently, the occasion to even give consideration to seeking an extension <Col N="597" /> of the funding deadline does not arise at this time.  European Commission Decision C(94) 1972 of 29 July 1994 in relation to the Operational Programme for Tourism provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that money committed at national level before the end of the programme period may still be spent after that period has expired.</P>
    <P>I have also no function in relation to the marketing of the proposed national conference centre. This will be a matter for the successful applicant and operator who will, be able to draw on the support of Bord Fáilte and its convention Bureau of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>There is an extensive programme of research activities under way.  In relation to Structural Fund expenditure, there is a programme of research being undertaken by the external evaluator to the Operational Programme for Tourism; a mid-term evaluation of that programme which is also under way, and an <i>ex post facto</i> evaluation of the programme which will, probably, take place in late 1999.  Additional studies such as a visitor attitude survey and survey of overseas visitors by Bord Fáilte, a national tourism manpower survey by CERT and a study of regional tourism trends by ITIC have also been supported under the operational programme.</P>
      <P>Sub-programme 5 of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 provides for some £3 million, or up to a maximum of 1 per cent of the total European Regional Development Fund allocation, in respect of technical assistance.  The objective is to ensure the effective administration of the programme and includes provision for expert advice, consultancy and research.  Expenditure on research in the period of 30 June 1996 amounted to 40 per cent of expenditure to date on technical assistance.</P>
      <P>Independently of this work the Tourism Council has undertaken research, funded by the Department of Tourism and Trade, into areas such as tourism branding, product development, manpower training and domestic tourism marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, Bord Fáilte, as part of its marketing and promotion activity, carry out ongoing research into various aspects of the international <Col N="598" /> tourism market.  The areas, markets and competitors to be studied would be a matter for it.</P>
    <P>Overall, I consider that sufficient research is being undertaken by my Department and the tourism State agencies but I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The IBEC survey on barriers to trade, which was carried out last year at my request to determine if the Single Market was working for Irish companies, found that one third of respondent exporters had experienced difficulties in gaining market access to other EU markets.  IBEC was subsequently requested to further analyse the survey results to ascertain the nature of the problems concerned so as to enable my Department to pursue these problems with the EU Commission and other member states concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late November 1995 IBEC confirmed that almost all cases of difficulties reported by Irish <Col N="599" /> exporters had been successfully resolved.  Efforts were still being made to settle the small number of unresolved cases and, if these proved unsuccessful, the assistance of my Department would be sought.  Because of the progress made through other channels, the need for representations to the EU Commission and other member states regarding difficulties experienced by Irish exporters in EU markets has not arisen to date.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, in accordance with a Resolution of the Internal Market Council of December 1992, is required to present to Council before the end of 1996 an analysis of the effectiveness of the measures taken to create the single market.  I have been informed by the Commission that it will formally present its analysis to the Internal Market Council on 26 November which I will chair.</P>

      <P>The report, Developments in Overseas Tourism Markets, prepared by Fitzpatrick Associates for the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and referred to by the Deputies, was unveiled at the forum run by the confederation on Tuesday last, 8 October.</P>
      <P>I understand that this is the first of a two phase research project, and that the objective of the first report is to highlight specific areas for more indepth research which would benefit the tourism industry.  The priority areas for further research as suggested by this report include the higher spending and repeat visitor categories, the fast growing middle income category and what converts potential into actual visitors.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is reviewing strategic marketing priorities, in consultation with the industry, with a view to achieving maximum revenue from all segments of the market, while particularly targeting those segments with an identified high yield potential.  The issues raised by the ITIC report and, in particular, the results of phase II will provide a significant input to that review.  The completed project will also constitute a valuable input into the development of a longer term strategy for Irish tourism post-1999, which marks the final year of the current six year strategy set out in the <i>Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The US Conference on Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the Border counties took place in Pittsburgh on 6-8 October.  Fifty Irish companies from both sides of the Border attended and participated in some 400 matchmaking meetings with representatives from 125 US companies.  A number of these companies agreed contracts with their US counterparts and others will be following up closely on opportunities identified at the conference in the weeks ahead.  The question of a trilateral business council for US, Northern Ireland and Border county initiatives was raised with me by the US Commerce Secretary, Mickey Kantor, at a bilateral meeting during the course of the conference.  The purpose of the council, as envisaged by Secretary Kantor, would be to engage the private sector more fully in future cross-Border trade and investment activities.</P>
      <P>Secretary Kantor and I agreed that the proposal required further elaboration in terms of the role and composition of the council and its relations with existing trade and business organisations. It is my understanding that the US Department of Commerce intends to explore the proposal further in the weeks ahead with the appropriate bodies on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly from the private sector, that are best placed to continue the business-to-business contact which was the central focus of the Pittsburgh conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions, the provision of tourist accommodation is a matter for the tourism industry and depends primarily on individual operator's commercial judgement as to the manner in which to respond to levels of demand.  The industry has responded well to market forces and there has been a steady expansion in tourism accommodation, especially in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism provides assistance for accommodation in very specific circumstances, that is, for specialist accommodation at recognised outdoor pursuits centres, branded walking routes and at approved residential <Col N="603" /> equestrian centres.  In general, in keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new developments. I should add that the funds provided under the programme for tourism development projects are generally over-subscribed and, unfortunately, those available for specialist accommodation related developments are fully committed. These and other aspects of the programme's operations will be considered fully in the context of the mid-term review of the programme currently under way and due for completion early next year.</P>
    <P>Other EU funded programmes such as the Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the Leader II Programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme provide support for smaller tourism initiatives.  In the Border counties assistance may also be available under the IFI and INTERREG Programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, again on a limited basis.  This includes limited provision for accommodation projects on a basis compatible with that in the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    <P>All registered and approved tourism accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Some £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country. However, I understand that virtually all of the funds available under the scheme have been committed at this stage.  A similar scheme, especially for the Border counties, was introduced in July 1995 under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  I understand, however, that all the funds available under this scheme have also been committed.  Investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied, on the basis of my contacts with the agencies and other interests administering the programmes and schemes to which I have referred, that adequate support mechanisms are in place to stimulate tourism development, including the provision of tourist accommodation in the Border region but will of course review these arrangements as necessary.</P>
    <P>In July 1996 the Government decided, on foot of the report of the Task Force on Funding Arrangements in the Border Regions, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, that there was a need to ensure that people generally were aware of the specific programmes available in the Border counties and the focus of these programmes. Responsibility for implementing the specific <Col N="604" /> measures agreed, such as production of a pre-application form, a guide to funding under the programmes aimed specifically at the Border regions and a newsletter including information of projects funded in the region rests with the Department of Finance.  The arrangements will be monitored by the Task Force.</P>

      <P>The small business expansion loan scheme announced in the 1994 budget made a £100 million loan fund available to small businesses in the manufacturing, tourism and international traded sectors, £25 million of which was allocated specifically for projects in the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>The scheme, which was administered by ICC Bank plc, provided low fixed interest, 6.75 per cent, long-term loans up to ten years, of between £40,000 and £500,000 to eligible businesses employing less than 50 persons.  Eligible tourism projects included Bord Fáilte registered accommodation and Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development approved tourism products and services. New projects and significant extensions/ improvements to existing projects were eligible.</P>
      <P>The success of this scheme is evident from the fact that the £25 million allocated for tourism projects was fully approved at end September 1994. All of the funds were drawn down at the end of April 1996.  A total of 120 tourism projects &mdash; borrowers &mdash; were assisted and over 2,000 associated jobs maintained or planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> Following the success of this scheme, the Government introduced a new subsidised loan scheme, the access to finance scheme, on 12 September 1995.  This fund is being administered by the AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank. A minimum of £52 million 25 per cent of the fund is reserved for the tourism sector.  The loans are for a fixed term of seven years at a fixed interest rate of 6.5 per cent.  This fund provides a minimum loan size of £20,000 while the maximum loan size is £500,000.  Projects are eligible on a similar basis to the small business expansion loan scheme.  The banks have indicated that they expect all the funds will be drawn down by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a further small business loan scheme would be a matter, in the first instance, for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who has assured me that, should another scheme be devised, the importance of the tourism sector to the economy, which was recognised in the small business expansion loan scheme and the access to finance scheme, will not be overlooked.</P>

      <P>Maintaining and strengthening business and consumer confidence continue to be a priority for all those, particularly in Northern Ireland, who are involved in developing cross-Border <Col N="606" /> business in the tourism and trade sectors. The difficulties in the current phase of the peace process do, undoubtedly, present a challenge in this regard.  Nevertheless, it is clear that, irrespective of political developments, the pragmatic business-to-business relationships, which are typified by organisations such as the IBEC/CBI Northern Ireland Joint Business Council, are continuing to flourish and that business people on both sides of the Border are united in their determination to strengthen and deepen cross-Border economic co-operation.</P>
      <P>Exports to Northern Ireland increased by almost 8 per cent to over £333 million in the first five months of this year while imports also increased by 11 per cent to £272 million.  An Bord Tráchtála continue to work with companies seeking out new business opportunities in Northern Ireland and to build on the range of initiatives already in place.</P>
      <P>As regards tourism, the Deputy will be aware that tourism to the South has been growing at a very fast rate for a number of years prior to the ceasefires of autumn 1994.  All the evidence points to 1996 being another record breaking year for our tourism industry.  The latest CSO figures indicate that total visitor numbers were up by over 15 per cent in the first six months of this year with particularly strong performances in Britain, up 17 per cent, and North America, up by almost 18 per cent.  The main consumer marketing campaigns in our overseas markets continue to be carried out under the aegis of the overseas tourism marketing initiative which is a partnership between the tourism industry and the State sector, North and South.</P>

      <P>It is estimated on the basis of CSO statistics and Bord Fáilte surveys of overseas travellers that revenue from French tourists in 1995 was about £84 million, an increase of 129 per cent over the £36.7 million achieved in 1989.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the informal meeting of EU Trade Ministers, which I hosted in Dublin Castle on 18 and 19 September, was to advance the preparation of the EU's position for the first <Col N="607" /> ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Britain and I will represent the EU at the conference, which will be held in Singapore in December next.  There was a full and open discussion among Ministers and Commission Vice-President Brittan, based on a Presidency paper which I had circulated in advance. This paper focused on the key issues on which the EU will need to take a position at the Singapore conference.  At the end of the informal meeting, we had already agreed on key EU priorities for the Singapore conference: a full, timely and comprehensive implementation of the Uruguay round as an essential bedrock of the WTO system, including the completion of the unfinished services negotiations; the full respect of the built-in agenda of the Marrakech agreements as the core of a comprehensive 1997/98 work programme for the future activities of the WTO; the definition of concrete actions in order to underpin the involvement in and commitment to the WTO system of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries; the necessity to ensure the strict compliance of regional integration initiatives with the multilateral trading system as a means to ensure their complementarity; the support for the accession of new members to the WTO in accordance with its rules and on the basis of significant liberalisation commitments by the applicant countries; a better integration of environmental concerns into the WTO rules, and the need for the WTO to broaden at Singapore its work programme to adapt itself to new realities of the world economy in particular on investment and competition.  We also discussed trade and labour standards and agreed that discussion will continue in the Community framework.</P>
      <P>I also circulated to my colleagues a &ldquo;non-paper&rdquo; suggesting more detailed guidelines for the EU position at the Singapore conference and which took account of their comments during the Dublin meeting.  This &ldquo;non-paper&rdquo; is currently being discussed at official level within the EU and is expected to form the basis of a document to be approved by the General Affairs Council at the end of October.</P>
      <P>The meeting was very successful in advancing the preparation of the EU position for the WTO conference.  I am satisfied that the EU can continue to play a leading role in the lead-up to the conference and at the conference itself.  It is important for the EU &mdash; the world's largest trading bloc &mdash; that the Singapore conference carry out a full review of the implementation of the agreements reached during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations and agree on a work-programme for the organisation for the next two years which will carry forward the process of multilateral trade liberalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a small country like Ireland, which is so dependent on international trade, it is vitally important that our exporters have guaranteed access to markets on the basis provided by the <Col N="608" /> WTO's rules.  The lowering of tariffs agreed during the Uruguay round, and the further liberalisation measures being developed within the WTO, will assist our exporters to consolidate their existing markets and extend into new markets.  The informal meeting of Trade Ministers has helped ensure that the Singapore conference will carry forward the WTO's work in these areas which are of such vital interest to this country.</P>

      <P>While primary responsibility for the administration of both the Ireland-Northern Ireland and Ireland-Wales INTERREG programmes lies with the Department of Finance, my Department administers the tourism measures for each programme.  The procedures for applying for assistance and the criteria used for selecting projects are outlined in the respective programmes which were circulated to all members of the Oireachtas subsequent to their launch in 1995.</P>
      <P>Application forms for both programmes are issued by the Department of Finance and should be completed and returned there for registration. Tourism-related applications are then passed on to my Department which arranges for their evaluation by Bord Fáilte.  In the case of the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG, my Department and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board co-chair the tourism and culture working group which approves tourism projects.  In the case of the Ireland-Wales INTERREG, my Department is represented on the economic development working group which considers tourism projects and which is co-chaired by the Department of Finance and the Welsh Office.</P>
      <P>Apart from the overall eligibility criteria which need to be adhered to, tourism projects must be consistent with the stated objectives of the tourism measures in each of the programmes.  For the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme, the primary objective is to develop and market the eligible region as a quality tourist destination. Priority is given to projects which develop products or market the area with the aim of promoting or developing increased visitor revenue. Particular emphasis is placed on projects which contribute to extending the tourism season, improving visitor satisfaction and creating additional employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism and culture measure of the Ireland-Wales INTERREG is aimed at developing the eligible area as a quality visitor destination by means of joint marketing efforts and co-operative development of products on both sides of the maritime border.  In particular, <Col N="609" /> this measure seeks to promote the activity, heritage and cultural tourism sectors in the eligible area.  All projects funded under the Ireland-Wales tourism measure must involve participation on both sides of the border.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism projects approved for assistance, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar written parliamentary question by Deputy Brendan Smith answered yesterday.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Overall ministerial responsibility for the administration of the special programme for peace and reconciliation lies with the Minister for Finance.  The House will be aware from the Adjournment debate last Thursday that the Minister for Finance is confident that the budgetary reduction proposed by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets will be rejected at the November meeting of the Budget Council.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific tourism programme in the special support programme for peace and reconciliation and my Department has a limited involvement in this area, tourism-related projects are eligible for funding under a number of measures.  These include urban and village renewal and tourism using European Regional Development Fund Funds; village renewal and tourism with EAGGF funds, community-led development using European Regional Development Fund funds and co-operation between public bodies using European Regional Development Fund and ESF funds.  In addition, the productive investment and industrial development measure includes a scheme for providing subsidised loans for which tourism projects are eligible.</P>
      <P>In general terms, tourism related projects are eligible for up to 75 per cent grant assistance under the programme.  Specifically in relation to tourism accommodation, I understand that assistance is available under the first and third measures mentioned above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace programme operates by placing a particular emphasis on a bottom-up approach to development.  Under the terms of the programme, the work of initiating and approving projects for grant assistance is carried out at local level by the county council-led task forces (in the <Col N="610" /> case of the urban and rural regeneration measures) and by the specially appointed intermediary bodies, ADM Ltd. and the Combat Poverty Agency, in the case of the Community-led Development Measure.  The role of my Department is limited to simply responding to requests from those bodies to confirm that projects under consideration for assistance conform with overall tourism policy.  However, I understand that a significant proportion of the total grant assistance approved in 1996 by the county tasks forces is destined for tourism-related projects.</P>
    <P>In relation to the interest subsidy scheme, I am advised by the Department of Finance, who are responsible for its implementation, that the scheme is now fully subscribed and that a significant number of the projects approved to date are in the tourism sector.</P>

      <P>The development of certain categories of privately owned tourism facilities is eligible for assistance under Sub-Programme 2, Product Development, of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  Up to the end of June 1996, it is estimated that a total investment of some £103 million has been committed to the development of such facilities.  Of this amount, the EU will contribute £27 million in European Regional Development Fund grants and the private sector will generate the balance of £76 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main aims of the operational programme is to extend the tourism season in order to concentrate, where possible, growth outside the peak tourism period and this aim is reflected in the category of facilities prioritised for assistance under sub-Programme 2.  Consequently private investment under the operational programme <Col N="611" /> is being steered towards putting highquality tourism facilities in place which will attract international visitors throughout the year.</P>

The Regulation empowers member states to request a statement of end-use and to impose other conditions concerning the end-use and/or the re-export of goods for which an export licence has been requested. Such powers are already contained in the Control of Exports Act, 1983 and the orders made thereunder, together with provisions for penalties for non-compliance with export licensing requirements. This national legislation continues to remain in force pending the making of amending orders designed to bring our national controls into full conformity with the EU system and with more recent developments in other international export controls fora.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.  CERT, the agency with responsibility for training and recruitment in the tourist industry, has recently commissioned a number of studies to gauge perceptions, including school-leavers' perceptions of employment and career prospects in the industry.  The results of these studies showed that teachers, parents and pupils all considered tourism highly important for the economy, <Col N="612" /> for employment and for regional development. Tourism was considered a good industry to work in by the vast majority of those interviewed.</P>
      <P>However, the study also highlighted that a significant proportion of pupils lacked awareness of training requirements and career prospects. CERT and the industry are conscious of the need to address this information gap and are promoting a visible and attractive career path for prospective entrants.</P>
      <P>CERT mounts nationwide publicity and promotion campaigns to attract school leavers and unemployed adults into training.  Initiatives include media campaigns, including weekly updates of training vacancies on Aertel; workshops for Career Guidance Counsellors; raising of public consciousness regarding job opportunities through radio, interviews, press releases, etc. career talks in schools and career exhibitions.  In addition, in 1995 CERT set up a national recruitment committee representative of industry bodies to co-ordinate and implement local promotion campaigns by industry.  The work of this committee is ongoing and these promotion campaigns are being extended countrywide.</P>
      <P>CERT also assists employers to promote employment and training opportunities by allocating training places to employers who wish to nominate staff for training.  In addition, CERT encourages employers to provide quality industrial experience for young people who aspire to careers in the industry.  As part of the transition year curriculum at second level CERT provides a Tourism Awareness Module.  Allied to this is their hotel, catering and tourism programme which is now part of a number of post leaving certificate programmes. This year, for the first time, hotel, catering and tourism studies are included as a subject on the applied leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>All these initiatives are designed to focus the future workforce on the benefits of a worth-while career in the tourism industry.  I can also inform the Deputies that at the meeting of the Tourism Council in Ballintubber last week, the Irish Hotels Federation informed the council of a proposed programme to highlight the attractiveness of careers within the hotel and guesthouse sector which the federation will launch later this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue in his question says that a spokesperson for CERT stated that the tourism industry will have a shortage of 16,000 trainees in the next three years.  I have been informed that Deputy O'Donoghue is referring to an apparently inaccurate report of a statement made by the Chairman of CERT, Mr. Jim Nugent, at the launch of CERT's 1995 annual report.  What Mr. Nugent actually said was: &ldquo;The challenge facing CERT and the industry is to recruit an additional workforce of 16,000 in parallel with the massive ongoing investment in accommodation, catering facilities and in tourism's expanding range of cultural, activity and information projects.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the industry and CERT recognise that these numbers must be attracted at a time when the school leaver population is falling and when <Col N="613" /> other high profile service industries and third level institutions are competing in the youth market. CERT is confident that with its own comprehensive national recruitment campaign and with the support of the industry, the challenge of recruiting the additional workforce required can be achieved.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 is the primary vehicle at present for grant aiding tourism projects.  The programme was agreed with the EU Commission in 1994 following an extensive consultation process during which demand for resources created the need to prioritise those areas most in need of financial assistance, in terms of achieving programme targets. Full details on targets, eligibility, grant criteria, aid rates, etc. are set out in the programme and do not include provision for a grant scheme such as that outlined in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is already contributing to the presentation of the aspect of Ireland's heritage through the provision of grants for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of houses.  While thatched public houses, restaurants or other commercial premises are not eligible for these grants, the private residential portion of a premises such as a public house is eligible.  The Heritage Council also operates a scheme for grant aiding vernacular buildings which includes thatched premises.</P>

      <P>Although statutory responsibility for the specific areas mentioned in the question rests with other ministerial colleagues, I can assure the Deputy that the Government continues to take full cognisance in its policies of the importance of maintaining competitiveness in our export markets. Pursuit of policies which have led, for example, to low inflation, moderate wage developments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, interest rates close to historically <Col N="614" /> low levels and unprecedented levels of investment in infrastructural developments, have all served to considerably enhance the competitiveness of Ireland as an exporting base.</P>
      <P>State agency support for innovation programmes, training, product development and marketing also helps to strengthen the competitive position of individual firms and their ability to respond to change in the marketplace.  As a result, exports constitute an increasing share of the economy's total output, going up from 60 per cent of GDP in 1985 to an expected 81 per cent in 1996.  In 1995, the value of exports grew by 20 per cent to £27 billion and our trade surplus climbed to £7 billion, which, in relative terms is the highest in the OECD.  This spectacular growth has been achieved in the face of ever increasing competition and despite the fact that economic growth in some of our main markets was sluggish.</P>

      <P>The tax treatment of people can, as the Deputy is aware, vary depending on individual circumstances. However, on the basis that the average industrial wage in 1996 will be of the order of £14,500 and assuming that only the basic personal and PAYE allowances are availed of, the take home pay, after deduction of income tax, PRSI and levies, of the categories of people referred to would be as set out in the following table:</P>
      <P>Single Person: £10,275;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" />Married Person: £11,337;</P>
    <P>Separated Person: £10,275</P>
    <P>The married person example assumes no dependent children and that only one spouse is in employment.  The separated person example also assumes no dependent children and that he or she is assessed for tax as a single person.  Obviously, if these assumptions were to change, it may result in different levels of taxation and consequently of take home pay to those indicated above.</P>
    <P>In relation to future tax reform I remind the Deputy that the Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the <i>Programme for Renewal.</i> The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes and especially those with families.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.  The Deputy may be assured that all relevant options for tax reform are examined in the context of budgetary preparations.</P>

    <P>In addition, I have also received a small number of general representations on the issue together with ongoing telephone inquiries.</P>
    <P>As I recently explained to the House, IMPACT on behalf of environmental health officers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>
    <P>A meeting was held on 25 June 1996 between management and union, under the auspices of the local government staff negotiations board.  On Wednesday, 26 June 1996, I personally met with IMPACT and a delegation of environmental health officers to explore whether the provisions of the joint Government/ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>On 5 July 1996, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission, an informal meeting took place between management and the union.  This meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides and as a result negotiations are continuing.</P>
    <P>In view of the complexity of these negotiations it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this point, other than to say that I am confident of a mutually satisfactory resolution to this issue in the near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 October 1996 is in the range of £205.92 &mdash; £218.01 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services to Group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest available details of the rate of gratuities applying to part-time home helps and the numbers in each board are given in Table 1 overleaf. With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues and my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of this service.  It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within <Col N="620" /> the scope of the PAYE system.  Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help (or the spouse of a part-time home help) is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>In response to previous questions in this House I stated that my Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
    <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers formed the basis for this examination. Following on from these discussions, my Department has decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help service carried our by an independent body which will advise on how the service can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other services supporting the dependent elderly and their carers at home.  Tenders for this review have been invited and it is expected that the review should be completed in three to four months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that a review of the Nurses Act, 1985, which gives An Bord Altranais its statutory basis, is currently under way.  Submissions on the review of the Act were sought by the Department from interested parties. The submissions which were received recommended a number of changes to the 1985 Act and these are being considered in the context of the review.  I am keenly aware of the issues relating to the representation of nurses on An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>The review of the Act is now nearing completion and in finalising proposals for amendment, there will be an opportunity for further consultation with representatives of the profession on the question of representation and any other issues which may be of concern to them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Eligibility for orthodontic treatment is not determined by reference to medical card entitlement. However, eligibility for other dental treatments, such as fillings, scaling and fissure sealants, is determined by whether or not a person is covered by a medical card.  It is, therefore, necessary to inquire as to the eligibility status of patients, so that they can be referred appropriately to either the public or private dental service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any necessary dental treatments must be provided before orthodontic treatment is commenced.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of orthodontic treatment services for the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board. Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to review the cases of the persons named by the Deputy and to inform the Deputy of the outcome of this review.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has provided a new orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital under the consultant orthodontist who took up duty with the board earlier this year.  The setting up of this unit with the assistance of funds provided by my Department under the dental health action plan and the successful recruitment by the board of a consultant orthodontist on a full-time basis considerably enhances the orthodontic services provided by the health board.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the consultant orthodontist to ensure that orthodontic treatment services are provided to those who will benefit from such treatment and are provided in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department to health boards for the provision of orthodontic treatment services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Guidelines in relation to the provision of orthodontic services were issued to health boards by my Department in 1985.</P>
      <P>These guidelines were introduced to ensure that resources would be used to the best advantage and for those most severely affected. Patients are assessed for treatment in accordance with these guidelines and placed on waiting lists as appropriate.  These guidelines are still in force. It is the responsibility of the health board's consultant orthodontist to ensure that the Department's guidelines are implemented in a uniform and equitable manner throughout the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the provisions outlined in the Health Strategy, the dental health action plan and the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years for developments in the orthodontic services I have asked my Department in consultation with health boards and their consultant orthodontists to review the 1985 guidelines.  This review is directed to ensuring equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment <Col N="623" /> throughout the health boards and that those placed on waiting lists for treatment actually receive treatment within a reasonable period of time having regard to the resources available to the boards.  This review is at present under way.</P>
    <P>The development of the orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan is leading to improved service provision and shorter waiting periods for treatment.  However, as matters currently stand there can be long waiting periods in some areas.  Many children can, therefore, be advanced in their teenage years before treatment is provided.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I have been aware for some time of the United Kingdom waste plan which, with some exceptions, seeks to prevent the importation of clinical waste for incineration in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the matter of the continued export to the United Kingdom, on a temporary basis, of healthcare risk waste arising in Ireland with the Secretary of State for Health in the United Kingdom.  In addition, the Department of the Environment has made a written submission <Col N="624" /> to the United Kingdom Department of the Environment seeking an exemption to the imports ban in respect of healthcare risk waste from Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the waste management contractors exporting waste to the United Kingdom for incineration have recently been unable to obtain new licences.  Arising from this development, further representations have been made to the United Kingdom Department of the Environment, and outlets for this waste are also being sought in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department has advised the health agencies that healthcare risk waste should be stored in refrigerated conditions until such time as alternative disposal facilities are available.</P>
    <P>The longer-term solution lies in the tendering process for the transportation, treatment and disposal of healthcare risk waste.  This process is being managed by an expert group representative of the health services, here and in Northern Ireland, and I am satisfied that their proposals are well founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the acquisition of Rathfarnham Castle by the State in 1987 the following works have been carried out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  conservation/restoration of the roof, replacement of defective timbers and treatment of rot;</P>
      <P>(2)  demolition of two wings added on earlier this century;</P>
      <P>(3)  mechanical, electrical and security services, restoration of kitchen wing providing reception, tearoom and toilet facilities, provision of car park, provision of a model of the original estate, conservation of the ballroom ceiling and repairs to windows and floors.</P>
      <P>Expenditure of £1,032,000 was incurred under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93 of which 25 per cent was borne by the Exchequer. A provision of £1.2 million is included under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, 25 per cent of which will be met by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of expenditure (in £'000's) each year is as follows:&mdash; 1989 - 3; 1990 - 85; 1991 - 164; 1992 - 39; 1993 - 253; 1994 - 488; 1995 - 178; 1996 - 27 (to 30 September).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the allocation under the Operation Programme for Tourism 1994-99 will ensure that the <Col N="628" /> major elements of restoration works are completed substantial additional funds will be required in future years to complete the full programme of proposed works, a major element being the provision of suitable furnishings.</P>
    <P>Conservation/restoration of its nature is a highly specialised, time consuming task particularly in the case of Rathfarnham Castle where there is little or no documentary evidence available on the architectural history of the castle to provide guidance.  Painstaking research and investigation are necessary to ensure that the highest standards are maintained in the faithful conservation and restoration of the castle.  Having regard to all factors involved I am satisfied that good progress is being made with the restoration work.</P>
    <P>Plans are now well advanced to proceed with the next phase of works and it is proposed to invite tenders shortly.  These works will include re-rendering, stonework repairs, internal structural repairs together with investigative and conservation work in preparation for decoration of certain rooms.</P>
    <P>There have been communications between the local authority and my Department in relation to the outbuildings (which are owned by the local authority) and I understand that the local authority intends to invite submissions regarding outline development proposals for these buildings.</P>

      <Quest>the current position in relation to the essential repair grant as laid down in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 107 of 10 October 1996, in which he stated that authorities may pay grants up to the full approved cost of the repairs, then qualifies this by putting a maximum level of £5,173 on such a grant and authorities can recoup half of their expenditure but places a limit of £900 per individual case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>As set out in the earlier reply, essential repairs grants are payable by local authorities for houses which cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost in circumstances where, with the carrying out of the essential repairs, the house can continue to meet short-term accommodation needs.  The maximum grant limit reflects the fact that essential repairs rather than full scale improvement works are envisaged under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered by local authorities and it is a matter for each authority to determine, subject to the conditions of the scheme, the level of grant payments in individual cases.

    <P>The working group reported earlier this year and concluded that the co-ordination of the delivery of education services for travellers could best be addressed by establishing a special committee in my Department to oversee the delivery of education services for travellers.  Arrangements are currently under way for the establishment of this committee.  The committee, which will be representative of all areas of my Department involved in the delivery of education services to the travelling community, and which will consult with the various interest groups, including traveller organisations, will be responsible for drawing up and overseeing a comprehensive plan for the implementation of the task force recommendations approved by the Government and the White Paper proposals relating to travellers.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools. The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the combat poverty agency and the <Col N="634" /> education research centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The studies also concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged area scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>Under the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative, a targeted programme of special supports is being made available to selected urban and rural schools.  In the case of urban schools, the focus was on schools which already had disadvantaged area status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The second element of the initiative focused on schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and which have concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the school system.</P>
    <P>All eligible schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, were invited by the education research centre to complete a detailed, questionnaire devised by the centre and aimed at identifying the relative levels of disadvantage between applicant schools.  In particular, every school was requested to provide data relating to the pupils in its intake class under a range of objective criteria.</P>
    <P>The education research centre reviewed all applicants and selected schools for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of the data submitted by schools.  Unfortunately, based on the data it submitted to the education research centre, the school in question did not rate high enough on the priority list to be selected for inclusion under the new initiative.</P>

      <P>The filling of vacancies for chief executive officer in vocational education committees, in an acting capacity, had its origins in the Green Paper &ldquo;Partners in Education&rdquo; proposals in 1985 for the regionalisation of education and the establishment of local education councils.</P>
      <P>I am informed that this decision was not the subject of a general circular as decisions to appoint acting chief executive officers were communicated to vocational education committees on an individual basis as vacancies for chief executive officers occurred.  Twenty acting chief executive officer appointments have been approved to date.  Sixteen vocational education committees have acting chief executive officer posts.  Sections 23 (1) and (2) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, provide for the appointment of a chief executive officer by a vocational education committee subject to the approval of the Minister. The following table shows the vocational education committees where acting chief executive officer appointments have been approved, the dates of approval and the Minister for Education in office at the time of approval.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to different areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. They have informed me that the policing requirements of the Dublin metropolitan area are continually monitored by the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the area with a view to ensuring that Garda resources are deployed to optimium benefit.  The Garda authorities report that at present he is satisfied that all resources in the Dublin metropolitan area, including uniform, detective and specialist units, are deployed effectively and are sufficient to meet current policing needs.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the current strength of the Dublin metropolitan area is 3,977 gardaí, all ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have reviewed their operations in regard to combating the drugs problem in Dublin city and the Garda Commissioner announced a new strategy, Operation Dóchas, which came into effect on 7 October 1996.  The new strategy will operate in all Dublin districts and will involve the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain-clothes gardaí. Uniformed gardaí will adopt a high profile through both foot patrols and mobile patrols and will work to forge greater links with local communities, both community leaders and individual <Col N="640" /> families.  Backup will be provided by specialist mobile units and other units.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the support of the community, this strategy will tackle drugs related crime and in particular that it will bring an end to the unacceptable practice of open street dealing. The Garda authorities inform me that the above strategy will be kept under review for an initial period of three months and that any changes necessary will be made to ensure its success. It should, of course, be noted that while the predominant emphasis of this operation is drugs it also extends to crime and all policing matters.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, one of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which I announced in July of this year was the recruitment of a further 400 gardaí to the force over the period July 1996 to October 1997.  This is in addition to the 350 gardaí already being recruited this year and another 350 planned for in 1997.  The anti-crime package also provided for the recruitment of an additional 200 civilians to facilitate the release of an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.</P>

As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 235 and 238 on 15 October 1996 there are 153 members of the Garda Síochána on temporary transfer to the Border divisions at present as part of the BSE operation.  The Garda authorities inform me that the overall garda strength in those divisions, supported as necessary by the Defence Forces in their role as an aid to the Civil Power, will continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The deployment of the Garda Síochána is the responsibility of the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the territorial area covered by a Garda juvenile liaison officer is defined on the basis of a Garda district or division as appropriate.  This does not always conform to county boundaries. The current deployment of juvenile liaison officers is set out, by Garda Division, in the following table:</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources and I have been informed by them that the operation of the Garda juvenile liaison scheme is kept under constant review by the Director of the National Juvenile Liaison Office.  However, I should point out that in 1991 major reforms of the Garda juvenile liaison scheme were implemented to improve its effectiveness and to ensure its availability for all suitable young offenders.  These reforms included the establishment of the National Juvenile Liaison Office to monitor and co-ordinate all matters relating to juveniles on a national scale.  Other measures also introduced at that time included reform of the reporting and supervision arrangements under the scheme, variation of the duration of the period of supervision and improvements in both training and flexibility of working arrangements for juvenile liaison officers.</P>

    <P>Until recently the role of Director at the National Juvenile Liaison Office was fulfilled by the Superintendent, Community Relations Section. However, in March 1996, an additional superintendent was appointed specifically to take charge of the National Juvenile Liaison Office, the Garda schools programme and Garda community based projects.  Consideration is also being given at present to augmenting the existing juvenile liaison officer supervisory structure within the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
    <P>With regard to future legislative developments, the forthcoming Children Bill, which will deal primarily with juvenile justice matters, will place the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory basis.  In doing do, it will widen the scope of the programme by incorporating into it a family conference in suitable cases.  I expect to publish the Children Bill within the next few weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, empowers the Minister for Justice to provide by way of regulations for the issue of age cards on a voluntary basis to persons of or over 18 years of age.  As I am satisfied that the most acceptable <Col N="643" /> and effective way of complementing the comprehensive set of provisions in the 1988 Act aimed at curbing under-age drinking is through the continued development of voluntary local age card schemes, I have no proposals at present to make such regulations.</P>
    <P>The question of making an order under section 47 of the 1988 Act prohibiting sales of drink by self-service methods in outlets such as supermarkets is kept under continuing review.  Central to any decision is whether such a provision would supplement the measures already in place to curb under-age drinking.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the sale of drink at supermarkets has not posed a particular problem in relation to under-age drinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have. Different methods of assessment are applied in the various social assistance schemes.  For example, in the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.  For old age pension purposes, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, I made it known that I was taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one-parent family payment and the new disability <Col N="644" /> allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all the various social assistance payments. Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The extension of these provisions to other social assistance payments will be done progressively over a period of time in view of the significant administrative implications involved.  There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment at present and the means of all those with capital will have to be reviewed on the introduction of any changes in this area.</P>
    <P>The substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rate for most recipients and will mean that claimants are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.  The cost of extending these arrangements to other social assistance payments is in the region of £9.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to old age contributory pension requires the applicant to have a yearly average of not less than 20 contributions paid or credited from 1953, or from the date of entry into insurance &mdash; whichever is the later &mdash; up to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  Alternatively, an applicant may qualify if there is a yearly average of 48 contributions from 1979.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has a total of 801 reckonable social insurance contributions in the 43 year period from 1953 to 1996.  This gives her a yearly average of 18.6 contributions in this period which is not sufficient to qualify her for pension. She has a total of 699 contributions over the 17 year period from April 1979 and this gives her a yearly average of 41 in that period.  This is insufficient to qualify her for pension under the alternative average test.</P>
      <P>The person concerned may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension, which is a means tested scheme.  An application form and information leaflet have been issued to her.  If she considers that she might be eligible, she should return the form duly completed, and her entitlement will be determined.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension, a person must have entered social insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961, and its objective is to link entitlement to pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund.</P>
      <P>All persons who enter social insurance for the first time after age 56 are entitled to a refund of the old age pension part of their contributions provided that they do not qualify for such a pension either contributory or non-contributory.</P>
      <P>The 217 contributions mentioned by the Deputy in the question is equivalent to a total of just over four years paid contributions which is considerably less than the 22 years which is also mentioned in the question.  If a person worked in insurable employment for 22 years they would be virtually certain to qualify for a minimum old age contributory pension.  Accordingly, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind he may wish to give me the details so that it can be investigated to ensure that the claimant is in receipt of his-her full entitlements.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 130, 132, 133 and 134 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increasing divergence between the estimates of unemployment levels emerging from the <Col N="646" /> labour force survey and live register has been a matter for concern to the Government for some time.  It was in an effort to elucidate the reasons for this divergence that the CSO was asked to carry out the recent special survey.  While the survey was not undertaken directly to identify the level of fraud in the unemployment payments system, and while the divergence between the labour force survey and the live register figures can be to a significant extent accounted for by factors other than possible fraud, nevertheless the findings of the survey give rise to concern in relation to the possible extent of fraud in the unemployment payments system.</P>
    <P>In the light of the indications emerging from the survey I am arranging for a further examination to be carried out to make a better assessment of the level of fraud and to enable the Department to deal more effectively with it.</P>
    <P>A package of enhanced measures to tackle social welfare fraud and abuse, of the unemployment payments system is already being implemented.  This package which I have already outlined in replies to early questions is designed to intensify our existing efforts and introduce new procedures.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>The Carers' Association, which represents the interests of carers in the home, has estimated that there are in the region of 30,000 full-time carers in the country, but higher estimates are given by some organisations.  There are no reliable statistics to indicate the number of full-time carers who are caring for disabled people.</P>
      <P>At the end of August this year there were 8,006 carers' allowances in payment from my Department of which 3,066 were in respect of persons caring for recipients of the disability allowance &mdash; previously know as the disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; or an invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of allowances in payment, some 6,198 are being paid at the maximum weekly rate of £67.50.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to bring forward the date of payment of the special beef premium as against the date on which it was paid in 1995 in view of the substantially reduced income of farmers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU Regulations advance payments under the EU special beef premium scheme and the EU suckler cow premium scheme are not normally payable until 1 November each year.  In 1995, however, the regulations allowed advance payments under the special beef premium scheme to commence on 16 October 1995. Ireland commenced payments on that date.  This year, for budgetary reasons, the EU has amended the regulation to allow commencement of advances at 80 per cent of entitlement on 1 October under both the EU suckler cow premium scheme and the EU special beef premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is, however, that over the past number of weeks my Department has been concentrating on making payments to beef farmers under the special package of measures introduced to compensate farmers for loss of income as a result of the BSE problem.  This entailed making <Col N="649" /> almost 200,000 payments valued at close to £70 million.  This money simply had to be paid by 15 October 1996.  In addition, payment under the 1996 cattle headage and sheep headage schemes commenced on 26 September last and to date £28.205 million has been paid.  Payments under those particular schemes are continuing.  Given the additional logistical problems this year, associated with making payments under the special BSE compensation package, my Department will not be in a position to commence advance payments under the 1996 special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes until 1 November 1996.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that in the period since 1 January 1996 to date some £317.427 million has been paid to Ireland's beef farmers under the various EU bovine headage and premia schemes.  In addition, payments totalling £97.365 million have been made to Ireland's sheep farmers in the same period under the EU ewe premium scheme and the EU sheep headage scheme.</P>

      <P>The legal proceedings in which four Dundalk residents have sued not only British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., BNFL, but also the State is the subject of an appeal by BNFL on questions concerning the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  Although the State is named as a co-defendant in the substantive case, the State has supported the Dundalk residents in resisting British Nuclear Fuels' application in both the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Judgment has been reserved on the appeal which was heard in the Supreme Court on 24 and 25 January last.  Depending on the decision of the Supreme Court, the substantive claims of the plaintiffs concerning Sellafield may be heard subsequently in the Irish courts.  My Department and a number of other Government Departments and State agencies are currently making available to the plaintiffs, on a voluntary basis, files relevant to the issues to be raised in the substantive case.</P>
      <P>I have only recently dealt with the Government's general approach to legal proceedings in relation to Sellafield &mdash; see my reply of 15 October 1996 to Question No. 299.  As to requests that the plaintiffs should be indemnified in respect of their costs of pursuing the proceedings. I am advised that it is considered appropriate to await the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal taken by BNFL before reaching a decision one way or the other upon those requests.  However, it is the intention of the Government to positively respond to the request if it is legally possible to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Full details of existing air services to Shannon and the regional airports are available from the relevant airports.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.  A very liberal framework is in place in relation to access to and from our main markets i.e. UK, mainland Europe and the US.  However, the question of whether any airline wishes to exercise traffic rights available to them is entirely a matter for the airline on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> In relation to access from Europe, all European Economic Area, EEA, airlines are free to operate on any international route within the EEA without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  Outside the EEA access is governed by the relevant bilateral air agreement. A liberal policy is generally adopted by my Department in regard to traffic rights granted under these agreements particularly in relation to Shannon.</P>
    <P>In relation to access from the US I should point out that under existing policy enshrined in the Ireland-US Air Agreement, there are no restrictions whatsoever on US airlines operating services, either scheduled or charter, from any point in the US to Shannon.  In addition, US airlines may operate any number of direct non-stop charter services from any point in the US to Knock Airport.  Similarly Irish airlines can operate an unlimited number of charter services to Shannon and Knock from any US point and unlimited scheduled services to Shannon from four US points i.e. New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>In addition under the agreement, US airlines have fifth freedom rights at Shannon to all points beyond i.e. the right to carry local traffic to a third country.</P>
    <P>In relation to access to the regional airports, as the Deputy is aware these are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408-92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
    <P>So far operating contracts have been awarded for Kerry-Dublin, Galway-Dublin and Donegal-Dublin routes.  This programme applies to routes within Ireland only.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, in order to assist the regional airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airports during 1993 and 1995.  Furthermore, arising from financial and other difficulties being experienced by most of Ireland's privately owned regional airports, a review of policy relating to these airports was carried out by my Department earlier this year.  As a result of this review the Government approved a strictly time limited scheme of Exchequer grants totalling £2.35 million over the four years 1996 to 1999 for the six regional airports to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> In relation to marketing of Shannon Airport, the Government agreed in 1994 to approve the payment of special grants for the marketing of Shannon Airport for a three year period covering the years 1995 to 1997.  Since October 1995 responsibility for marketing Shannon Airport has been transferred to Aer Rianta and a grant in aid amounting to £1.8 million is available for that purpose in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of such patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drugs smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such taskings. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 will also increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
      <P>As I outlined previously to the House the EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  In this context the question of the resources required by the Naval Service to ensure effective enforcement of the various regulations taking account of the control measures agreed in December 1995 is being examined.  The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Ireland will derive the maximum benefit from the available EU support including support for the purchase of additional patrol vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission will consider Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and will decide before the end of the year <Col N="653" /> on the level of funding to be made available in 1997.  Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels, a number of which, it is expected, will be refurbished under the five year programme.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 166 on the 10 October 1996, provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced with effect from 1 June 1977.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.</P>
      <P>Concurrently with the introduction of the contributory scheme, a special <i>ex gratia</i> scheme was introduced to provide for the dependants of soldiers who had either died in service or had retired on pension to the 1 June 1977 and were thereby outside the ambit of the contributory scheme.</P>
      <P>The contributory scheme was extensively revised in 1985 and, in that context, both serving personnel and pensioners who had opted out of the original scheme on its introduction in 1978 were given a second opportunity to provide for their dependants by joining a revised contributory scheme.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the widows of soldiers who had opted out of the original scheme and had died either in service or on pension in the intervening period were also given the option of joining the revised scheme and thereby qualifying for pension benefits.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the revised scheme in 1985, pension benefits have been granted in a very small number of cases where an option to join the revised scheme was given to a soldier/pensioner but was not exercised by him and where there was medical evidence to indicate that the soldier/pensioner was incapable of managing his own affairs during the option period.</P>
