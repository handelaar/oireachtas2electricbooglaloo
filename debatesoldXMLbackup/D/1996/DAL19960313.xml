      <P>May I respond briefly to what the Tánaiste said?  The Taoiseach told the House that a Bill would be introduced in the autumn, now we are informed it will be introduced before the summer recess.

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter yesterday.  It is clear the Minister for Justice is considering the implications of the legislation necessary to deal with some issues.  With regard to the statement which was made yesterday, the Government is seriously concerned about any statements emanating from <Col N="7" /> Northern Ireland which threaten a return to violence.  Our priority has been to achieve a restoration of the cessation of violence.  As Deputy O'Rourke knows, meetings are continuing between the Secretary of State and various parties and between myself and those parties and these meetings will culminate today.  The Secretary of State and I hope to meet tomorrow.  We will then be in a far better position to outline what conclusions we can arrive at from the discussions which have taken place.  The priority is to ensure that everything which needs to be done prior to 10 June will be done efficiently and effectively so that all-party talks can take place per the communiqué.</P>

      <P>We are heading towards the beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference.  A White Paper on foreign policy has been promised.  What is the precise date on which it will be published?  We should have reasonable time to have a proper debate on it and its implications for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the White Paper has gone to the printers.  I do not have the exact date on which it will be published but I will find out and communicate with the Deputy. I too would like a debate in the House on the implications of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste seems to agree with me.  This is an important matter of concern to the public.  Those who benefited from irregularities in the beef industry and those who were negligent in the performance of their duties are not being held accountable but innocent taxpayers are.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who is present, I emphasise that the Minister should examine the position of the middle income groups in relation to social welfare.  The manner in which small farms and businesses are being treated is unfair.  They are being assessed on grossly exaggerated incomes.  That results in people being deprived of their social welfare entitlements which is a serious problem, particularly for small farm owners.  If the Minister or his Ministers of State could earn an adequate income from 30 acres of land in Cavan, Teagasc and many agricultural advisers would like to know how it is done.  It is not possible and we must become realistic about this problem and ensure people get their social welfare entitlements.  Social welfare payments are generous and I do not believe there is any real poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister and the Ministers of State for the excellent job they are doing in social welfare.  I thank the staff working in social welfare offices throughout the country for their understanding approach; other Departments should take lessons from the Department of Social Welfare on how to deal with people and their problems.  The staff of the Department of Social Welfare are prompt in their replies to queries and are understanding when dealing <Col N="13" /> with public representatives and the general public.</P>
      <P>Many people believe social welfare recipients get too much money.  That is not my view.  People on social welfare are entitled to a fair income from the State and in that regard I welcome the 3 per cent increase this year.  Some people are of the opinion that is too large an increase but I believe it was not enough.</P>
      <P>The £2 increase in child benefit is welcome also.  In the past two years there has been a 45 per cent increase in child benefit which is an indication of the Government's thinking on benefits for women.  Child benefit is paid directly to the mother each month but the Minister might consider paying it on a weekly basis.  Mothers use this benefit to buy new shoes, school books or uniforms for their children and to increase it by 45 per cent in two years is a record for any Government.  I hope there are further increases in this benefit.  It is vitally important that we care for women in the home and young children.  Child benefit helps women and children and I will support any future increases in it.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the means testing of the carer's allowance which I believe is wrong.  A woman who recently returned here from England, where she lives with her husband and two young children, to care for his elderly mother attended my clinic six weeks ago to ask for help and I told her she might be entitled to the carer's allowance.  Because her husband's income in England was taken into consideration, her means were assessed at approximately £82 or £83 and she was deemed ineligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that somebody living outside this State must pay to care for an elderly person living in the State.  This problem must be addressed and I ask the Minister and his officials in the Department to examine the whole issue of the carer's allowance.  Not subjecting the first £50 of a carer's income to the means test is one way to begin to deal with this problem, but a woman or man who stays at home to care for an elderly <Col N="14" /> relative should not be subjected to a means test.  The means test limit is so low, many people are ineligible.</P>
    <P>It costs much more for the State to care for an elderly person in a hospital than it does to a relative to care for that person at home.  Elderly people prefer to be at home in their own surroundings and, in many cases, they prefer to die at home.  Will the Minister and his officials consider this problem and how it can be addressed?</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Health is proposing co-operation among the health boards on the question of home helps, but to pay home helps in the Western Health Board area at a rate of £1 an hour is a disgrace.  It is vital that the Minister meets the chief executives of the health boards and devises a common policy on payment for home help work.  The health boards might consider paying more towards the cost of a home help in the case of elderly people living alone.  It should pay the home help to clean the house, light the fire and perhaps prepare a meal for the elderly person. To pay a person £1 an hour in 1996 is disgraceful and the Minister should consider paying a reasonable salary to people who do this caring work on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>Both these issues relate to the care of elderly people and I welcome any improvements that can be made in this regard.  The least we can do for people who stay at home to care for elderly relatives is pay them a reasonable price for their time.  No amount of money, would compensate for the time and effort they put into caring for the elderly and the way they are treated by the Government is wrong.</P>
    <P>In the past the health boards were responsible for paying disabled person's maintenance allowance but that will now be the function of the Department of Social Welfare.  I take this opportunity to compliment the staff in the health boards who dealt with the payment of this allowance, especially community welfare officers who have been the subject of much bad press over the years, particularly from politicians. <Col N="15" /> There are good and bad people in every organisation.  Community welfare officers have a great understanding of what is happening on the ground and I have no doubt they did an excellent job in this scheme.  I hope the staff in the Department of Social Welfare will adopt an equally understanding and caring approach.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the payment of the supplementary welfare allowance will remain the responsibility of the health boards because when emergencies arise for our constituents, we try to get them immediate assistance.  I am glad the payment of this allowance will remain at the discretion of the community welfare officers.  I am pleased there will be an independent appeal system, via the social welfare offices, which will have nothing to do with either the health boards or the Department of Social Welfare and will judge cases on their merits.  I have no doubt this system will work.</P>
    <P>As a public representative I wish to raise a matter that upsets me.  I may be leaving myself open to criticism but I do not mind.  It concerns the abuse of the rent allowance scheme.  This matter has not been dealt with in the Bill before the House.  There are two abuses, one by the people who own the property in that if they know a person is seeking a rent allowance from the health board they double the rent; then there are those who ask the landlord to write down more than they are actually charging so that they can recoup it from the health board and have something out of it.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>The rent allowance bill has been increasing in every health board and the Minister should examine it.  I am not saying to the Minister and the Government that this scheme should not be in place.  It is a good scheme but it is being abused.  I support the scheme but I ask the Minister to set up a system whereby it can be investigated in an effort to stop the abuse.  It is not right that taxpayers should pay for landlords' profits and for some people who are abusing this <Col N="16" /> scheme.  The health boards are paying out huge sums of money under the scheme and I ask the Minister to examine it.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister.  This is his third social welfare Bill since he became Minister.  There is no doubt that the Government has a great understanding of people who are unemployed.  I welcome the changes in PRSI and the new regulations whereby unemployed people will be able to take up employment without losing all their benefits.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the one-parent family payment.  This is particularly beneficial for spouses, particularly wives, who in the past had to prove they were deserted.  I am pleased the Minister has taken this out of the Bill.  It was very difficult for a husband or a wife to prove desertion.  It was degrading, difficult and upsetting.  People leave for different reasons.  It is not easy for people to say they are deserted.  The Minister has a great understanding of the position and he is removing the desertion element. This will prevent much embarrassment for those persons who will be applying for this payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In his press release launching this Bill, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, as is usual, gave himself a large pat on the back.  With warm words and earnest clichés he hailed what he described as a major and radical Bill, adopting much the same tone that the Government's legions of publicly-funded spin doctors had used about this year's budget.  What we are supposed to be witnessing in the Social Welfare Bill is a huge effort against unemployment and promoting social solidarity.  As with just about everything this Government does, there is a gulf between its rhetoric and the reality of its actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the dust has settled on the budget debate, it is possible to see clearly that it fails to meet either of its chief objectives.  After adjustments for inflation, the sum total of all budgetary concessions amounts to little more than <Col N="17" /> £100 million.  Because of the piecemeal distribution of this injection over various ministerial pet-projects, its only macro-economic effect will be to give the impression of a Government which has no clear fiscal policy.  On a more basic level, the social welfare package is representative of a gradualist and essentially conservative approach which is devoid of any originality on any of the major social welfare issues.  Deputy Joe Walsh has already dealt with a wide range of issues arising from the Bill.  I wish to make a few general remarks about certain aspects and to concentrate on two specific areas which are of particular interest to me, the new disability allowance and the support of in-home carers.  I was pleased to hear the previous speaker, Deputy Ring, concentrate on these areas also.</P>
    <P>The protection of incomes of the economically weaker sections of our society should always be the central element of any social welfare package. Fianna Fáil has always appreciated this and has never failed to award increases at least in line with projected inflation figures.  The Government's decision to reverse its widely condemned precedent of last year and to allow benefits to keep pace with inflation this year is welcome.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act last year I introduced, with Deputy Joe Walsh, an amendment which sought to remove terms from the social welfare code which were demeaning of women because of the use of words implying dependency.  The Minister opposed our amendment saying he would shortly bring forward his own Bill to deal with it.  The Bill was included in the list of measures he promised to bring forward last session and he stated in the Dáil that it would be introduced before the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the nominal changes which estabish the new one-parent family payment, I ask why it has taken until now to introduce it.  The changes involved are simple and could have been introduced any time last year.  If the Minister was genuine when he agreed with our contributions during <Col N="18" /> the earlier debate that the terms were demeaning and should be removed speedily, why has it taken a year to produce this Bill?  Surely there were enough advisers around to produce a simple technical Bill which could have put this matter straight a long time ago. Deputy Walshe also introduced Bills to deal with the changes to the appeals process which are belatedly proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest failures of the Irish public sector is that, though motivated by good intentions, it works to accentuate dependency and marginalisation. This is an area that needs to be examined in detail.  In particular, I believe this is the case with the treatment of people with disabilities.  When they are young they and their parents are denied basic choices and they become used to exclusion and segregation.  When they are older, they are faced with widespread and inflexible bureaucracy, an inaccessible environment and frequently inappropriate support services.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities and their families encounter a range of extra costs which arise from the nature of their disability. There are obvious costs which can range across areas such as health care, transport, heating, housing and special diets.  There are also other areas involved.  For example, research has suggested that people with limited mobility spend more on everyday shopping because they frequently cannot get to cheaper stores.  All the evidence suggests that, in spite of major State spending, people with disabilities are significantly more likely to be poor than other members of the community.</P>
    <P>Some 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed, 63 per cent are obliged to borrow money at some stage to meet a disability-related cost, 56 per cent are sometimes or always in debt, 27 per cent believe their accommodation is unsuitable for their needs and 47 per cent describe their standard of living as poor or very poor.  An equally striking figure is that 80 per cent are in receipt of one or more State allowance.  In all, the State spends <Col N="19" /> roughly £150 million a year on income support schemes for people with disabilities and their families.  In the light of the obvious failure to ensure that their spending assists and promotes individual empowerment, the need for a radical re-evaluation of the running of these schemes should be obvious to all.</P>
    <P>The key needs are to recognise the unique cost of disability, to give security to people with disability and to move towards a non-means tested payment. This would slash unnecessary bureaucracy and give a secure financial base to people with disabilities.  I do not believe that such a move would be prohibitively expensive.  The overwhelming majority of people with disabilities are wholly dependent on State support.  Any change which would assist even a small number to gain employment would more than pay fiscally; this is not to mention the many cross-sectoral savings which come from empowering individuals.</P>
    <P>During his innovative and productive time as Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods argued for and succeeded in achieving agreement for the transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  This move represented a first tentative stage towards placing the concerns of people with disabilities in appropriate hands and away from the medicalisation of social issues. It was intended that this move would represent the end of its frequently arbitrary and inflexible operation.  In particular, it was intended that the move would allow the growth of the type of flexibility which has been developed in the rest of the social welfare code to encourage participation in education, training and, crucially, employment.</P>
    <P>Shortly before he came to office, Minister de Rossa presided over the production of a Democratic Left document on disability.  This document explicitly called for the establishment of a guaranteed minimum income for people with disabilities of £150 per week <Col N="20" /> so when he was appointed to the Department of Social Welfare much could surely have been expected.  Since his first ministerial question time I have repeatedly asked him about the transfer of the scheme and the implementation of the changes.  His first response was that it would be transferred shortly but he admitted subsequently there was a delay and then postponed the move. Finally, after ten months in office, he met groups representing people with disabilities but no major action has resulted from these meetings.  His current position is that he wants to wait until he has assessed the administrative operation of the scheme before deciding any significant reform.</P>
    <P>The Bill finally achieves the transfer of the scheme.  Its rechristening as the disability allowance is a welcome replacement of the cumbersome title of its predecessor, the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  However, despite some small changes, the Minister is seeking to specifically re-enact the old scheme in its entirety.  In addition, the set rate will be £64.50 or only 43 per cent of the rate he proposed shortly before he took office.  If the Minister continues to fail to take any radical action to reform the scheme, what has been the benefit of the transfer? Administrative efficiencies are important but all they mean is that the State is now more efficient at administering its scheme while the fact that the scheme is fundmentally flawed is not being addressed.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister used the excuse that he is awaiting the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Diabilities before taking action.  Over the last year, the commission has become the all purpose excuse for inaction on disability issues and this is just another case of it.  The commission is there to advise the Government.  Its report will be a landmark for people with disabilities and will set out a comprehensive agenda for the future.  However, it does not absolve the Government from facing up to decisions.  There are many issues where <Col N="21" /> the need for action is apparent and the remedies are obvious.  This is one such issue and the least that could be done is to begin necessary quantitative research on the costs of disability which should underpin any new allowance.</P>
    <P>To at least prepare for some action, the Minister does not need to wait for the commission to report but can prepare the costings to have the system in place.  This is long overdue and we should not have to wait for the commission's report.  The Minister should take immediate action on the matter.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, to which the previous speaker referred was introduced by Deputy Woods as Minister for Social Welfare and was the first recognition of in-home carers.  These people, 80 per cent of whom are women, provide a huge service to the community and underpin much of what is best within it.  We are all supportive of carers but the allowance is flawed in many ways and the significant majority of people who provide 24 hour care do not qualify for it.</P>
    <P>Before the budget, a number of representations were made to Government on areas of concern to carers.  The most comprehensive submission was the excellent document from the Carers' Association.  Through the work of that group and others, such as the Soroptomists who also concentrate on this area, many innovative ideas and suggestions were put forward to improve the development of a caring community. The areas which need to be addressed include training, income support and respite care.  The latter is important.  It is disgraceful that last year's respite care fund was administered in a ramshackle manner which seriously undermined the work of the experienced service providers. In fact, I had to raise the issue in the House on four separate occasions.</P>
    <P>While the Bill proposes a welcome 8 per cent increase in the allowance as well as some other small measures, a range of fundamental issues have not been addressed.  These include problems with social insurance, means testing and <Col N="22" /> the use of the free travel pass.  The previous speaker referred to the case of a constituent and there are many such cases where carers through the country are caring for elderly people on a 24 hour basis.  These people must be recognised. The savings to the State in terms of the move from institutional care to community care as well as the time, effort and commitment which they provide to elderly people must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Before we can accept the Minister's description of his own actions, we need to see some genuine innovation and commitment to change.  This is not a simple argument about rates of payment. It involves the very structuring of schemes and the need to focus them on empowering individuals and meeting the most acute needs.</P>
    <P>With regard to disability, it is important that we address the issue of how we empower individuals.  Instead of restricting young people with disabilities and their parents as they grow up and learn to look after themselves, we must cut out the bureaucracy.  Adults as well as children with disabilities &mdash; and their parents &mdash; must have a greater say in their own lives in future.  We must empower them and one way to achieve that is through the disability allowance.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails in a number of important regards and demonstrates a cautious, gradualist and ultimately conservative approach to reform.  We expected more and are disappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill is one of the most important Bills to come through this House each year but I am sorry that we continue to have debates to which nobody listens. Nobody, not even the Minister, attends. In general, I wonder about the efficacy of this sort of debate.  If nobody is here to listen, what point is there in Members spending time preparing for Bills and making known the concerns of their constituents?  It is a matter which the House must address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the mission of the Department of Social Welfare?  It is supposed <Col N="23" /> to be there to alleviate poverty and help people out of poverty.  With regard to the former, the Department has had limited success but it must be deemed to have failed in helping people out of poverty.  One of the most common features of schemes presided over by the Department of Social Welfare and analogous schemes in other Departments is the poverty trap.  Well intentioned schemes introduced to help alleviate poverty end up trapping people in poverty.  This is not an issue I am addressing for the first time, I have preached on it for at least ten years in this House.</P>
    <P>On the sensitive and vexed question of unmarried mothers and the escalating number of claimants for unmarried mother's allowance or, as it is now known, lone parent's allowance, in the past three weeks a single parent with three children came to see me at one of my constituency clinics looking for a transfer to larger accommodation.  In highlighting her plight she revealed that the father of her three children had been her common law husband for the preceding seven or eight years.  She indicated they wanted to get married, but could not because if they did they would lose her unmarried mother's allowance, medical card and differential rent subsidy for her corporation dwelling.  She could not, therefore, be honest.  Not only is there a poverty trap, but a morality trap.  Because of the way the social welfare system is administered, people who want to live honest lives are forced into immorality and to live a lie.</P>
    <P>The following day at another clinic in my constituency an unmarried mother with four children who found herself in almost precisely the same situation came to see me.  She revealed that no one in the Department of Social Welfare has ever asked the identity of the father of her four children with whom she has been living happily &mdash; a responsible, loving and committed father &mdash; for more than ten years.</P>
    <P>In both cases the father is working.  It is not right to do this, but these two <Col N="24" /> specific cases can be used to illustrate a general problem.</P>
    <P>I am director of elections for the by-election pending in the constituency of Dublin West.  I attended a number of meetings in branches in working class areas there and in my constituency of Dublin Central, at which deep anger was expressed about the social welfare system.  The feeling was that politicians must be crazy, stupid or insane not to do something about the absurdities and inanities of the social welfare system which is seen as trapping people in poverty. If people are honest or make an honest effort to find employment, they lose their benefits.  Instead of being the main agency in combating poverty, the Department of Social Welfare is the main agency in trapping people in poverty.</P>
    <P>When unmarried mother's allowance was introduced, by the late Frank Cluskey, it was seen as a compassionate step and a move in the right direction to help young women in distress.  It was designed to help women with unplanned pregnancies, possibly using the rhythm method, but, because of the way it has been administered it now helps women who have planned pregnancies using the social welfare method.</P>
    <P>A married person with children, will not receive one extra penny by way of a tax free allowance.  This is absurd and one of the root causes of the poverty trap whereby one can be worse off in employment, if one has children.  A person on social welfare receives a weekly allowance for each child, but no child allowance is payable under the tax system. Because of the way the means-tested social welfare and tax systems are administered, a person may not be better off in taking up a job.  This is one of the main reasons few jobs have resulted from the magnificent economic growth in recent years.</P>
    <P>When will we do something about this?  We have to be angry.  Many Deputies have preached on this subject for many years in this House, but the Department of Social Welfare and politicians on all sides have been ineffective. <Col N="25" /> They have not faced the obvious by changing the system to alleviate poverty.</P>
    <P>Well intentioned provision was made for the introduction of the living alone allowance and associated benefits but if one of the children of an elderly parent decides to move in, out of concern for the elderly parent so that he or she does not feel insecure or uncared for, the parent will lose the free television allowance, free telephone allowance, living alone allowance and so on.  This is another trap with the result that the elderly are living alone in fear.</P>
    <P>On the differential rent subsidy, many houses in my constituency are being transformed into multi-occupied dwellings &mdash; there are far too many tenements in some &mdash; because the scheme is highly lucrative for landlords.  The cost of this subsidy which is paid by the Department of Social Welfare through the health boards has increased from £3 million a year about six or seven years ago to about £55 million this year.  Large tracts of the city, particularly in Dublin Central and Dublin South Central, are being destroyed in the process.  A subsidy of as much as £60 to £70 per week is being paid in respect of one bedroom tenement flats at a time when young couples can buy a house for around £40 per week.  This is incredible stupidity.</P>
    <P>Why is the Department of Social Welfare continuing to preside over such a system given that the environment is being destroyed and planning regulations breached?  The one question the health boards will not ask landlords is whether they have building by-law approval and planning permission because they believe it is not their function to do so.  In the meantime they continue to pay subsidies in respect of hovels, often at twice the cost of a mortgage for a three bedroom house.  This is an outrageous waste of public money.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the increased demand for rent subsidy is that the Minister for Social Welfare will not pay unemployment assistance at the full rate to young unemployed persons living at <Col N="26" /> home, either of whose parents is working. They must leave home and apply for unemployment assistance at the full rate, a medical card and rent subsidy of £50 to £60 per week.</P>
    <P>We all know this is happening &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is nodding in agreement.  Someone must call a halt.  We must do something about this absurd situation which is costing the State a fortune and, has anti-social consequences, the reverse of what the Department of Social Welfare is supposed to be about.  I am angry about this because I have been highlighting it for years.  The people, particularly those in working class areas, are also angry, and will rebel against the social welfare system because they know it is absurd. They do not want to be caught in a poverty trap.  The system must be amended.</P>
    <P>When Ray MacSharry was Minister for Finance ten or 12 years ago he told me an interdepartmental committee had been established to consider having one means test for all social welfare benefits. At that time there were 17 different forms of means test and when people became unemployed six or seven means tests, with different criteria applying to each, were carried out before they received their entitlements.  Despite raising this matter on numerous occasions since then we still do not have an agreed definition of means.  Different criteria apply to means testing for medical card purposes, local authority rent allowances, unemployment assistance and civil legal aid.  We are told that the embargo on recruitment in the Civil Service is causing grave difficulties but hundreds of civil and public servants &mdash; even in different sections of the Department of Social Welfare and health boards &mdash; are duplicating work and inconveniencing and degrading vulnerable people.  A form that could be filled in at a local health centre for the purpose of assessing a person's net means should be produced.  That would not cost a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>Means testing should be a simple matter and should not be centralised. People should be able to go to their <Col N="27" /> local health centres and have their means assessed by a community welfare officer.  A person's means is made up of gross pay and benefits-in-kind less tax, PRSI, the cost of travel to and from work and, what might be termed, liabilities-in-kind. We are good at assessing benefits-in-kind, but we ignore those liabilities.  People who live in Mulhuddart, Clondalkin or Tallaght are at a disadvantage in terms of transport costs compared to those who live near the city.  People who live in Ballina, Navan or Clonmel can walk to the doctor's clinic or the shops whereas people who live, say, five miles outside those towns and do not own a car must hire a hackney car to avail of those facilities.  Those liabilities-in-kind should be taken into account by local health centre officials. When a certificate of means is granted it should be acceptable to all statutory authorities for the ensuing year.  Why is this not possible?  I have been pleading for years for a single definition of means.  The system is degrading, inefficient and the opposite to what should be in place.  The Department of Social Welfare is degrading those in the anti-social mire rather than lifting them out of it.  As the agency with responsibility for helping people get out of the poverty trap, it is a failure and the sooner that is recognised the better.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that I am chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs which, following its pre-budget hearings last year, recommended that special consideration be given to widows over 50 years of age. At present many people who are widowed and whose children have left home live on a meagre allowance and, as well as being lonely, are among the poorest sections of our community. Many widows and widowers are waiting anxiously to reach 66 years of age when they will qualify for free travel, a free television licence, the electricity allowance and free telephone rental.  Why will the Department not recognise the special plight of such people?  I make a <Col N="28" /> special plea for the provision of a supplementary payment in certain circumstances for those who are widowed, especially those over 55.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter which is dealt with in the United Kingdom's social welfare system.  Far too many people resort to moneylenders.  We should introduce a system of supplementary welfare interest free loans so that people who are desperate do not have to resort to them.  If they do not qualify for a supplementary welfare grant, they should be able to qualify for an interest free loan which could be deducted from their weekly payments.  This would go a long way towards helping the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>Having deemed the Department of Social Welfare a failure in terms of assisting people who live in poverty, I have the utmost respect and admiration for the way the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, conducted himself as Minister for Social Welfare in the past 15 months.  He is an intelligent man and he will reform the social welfare system. The Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, is one of the most hard working Members of the House as well as one of the most knowledgeable on this issue. We can expect change from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually address the House on social welfare legislation but I chose to do so on this occasion because I wish to comment on section 12 of the Bill.  My party spokesman, Deputy Joe Walsh, and I will address the issue further on Committee Stage by way of amendment.  Will the Minister make available to Opposition Deputies the advice given by the Attorney General on section 12 as it applies to Telecom Éireann?  Section 12 (2) proposes to amend section 11 (1) of the Principal Act by the insertion of a new paragraph (aa) which states: &ldquo;in such cases as may be prescribed by persons employed in Bord Telecom Éireann, or&rdquo;.  The Government has slipped this major change into this Bill at the last minute instead of dealing with it in separate legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> This provision could cost the taxpayer £40 million-£50 million in any one year in the event of Telecom Éireann being partially privatised.  It has been publicly stated that the Government has decided to sell off one third of the shares in Telecom Éireann.  However, it is not intended to change the rate of PRSI paid by the employer.  If, for example, Danish Telecom or Swedish Telecom buy one third of the shares in Telecom Éireann they will be treated to the reduced rate of PRSI.  Why should a foreign private company be treated to the lower rate of PRSI at the expense of the taxpayer?  This is a very dangerous precedent to create.  Despite the presence of Democratic Left in Government, it has been decided to sell 35 per cent of the shares in Telecom Éireann.  I do not need to tell the Deputies opposite what the decision to treat foreign companies to the lower rate of PRSI will mean.  The standard rate of PRSI for employers is 12.2 per cent while the reduced rate is 2.2 per cent, which represents a 10 per cent gain for whatever company buys the shares in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>This provision, which will mean a saving of millions of pounds for whatever private company buys a stake in Telecom Éireann, is buried in section 12.  It is devious of the Government to have slipped this provision into social welfare legislation in the hope that Opposition Members and the media who have an interest in it would not spot it.  On 21 February last the headline in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated, &ldquo;Semi-State firms will not have to pay full PRSI&rdquo; while another headline stated, &ldquo;Telecom staff in PRSI boost&rdquo;.  The journalists who said that legislative changes were on the way were waiting for the introduction of legislation which would deal with the part privatisation of Telecom Éireann.  They were aghast when they discovered that no such legislation would be introduced because the committee dealing with the part privatisation of Telecom Éireann had persuaded the Minister for Social Welfare to include the provision in section 12 of this Bill.  No announcement was made, <Col N="30" /> journalists were not informed and the Government hoped that the provision would not be noticed.  That is dangerous but, unfortunately, it seems to be the way semi-State companies are dealt with at present &mdash; everything is done behind closed doors, there is no public debate and consultants' reports are not made public.  The sale of one third of the shares in Telecom Éireann is being done in secret, no Dáil committee is dealing with the matter and no debate has taken place in the House.  This change should have been highlighted and a separate debate held in the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make available to us the Attorney General's advice on this provision which will allow Telecom Éireann to retain its public authority status for PRSI purposes even though it may be part privatised.  Regardless of the benefits to the employees, this should not be of benefit to the incoming employer.  We may be creating a dangerous precedent.  Incoming private employers who take up a stake in State companies should compensate the workers and the State for the reduced rate of PRSI awarded to them.  I will table a parliamentary question to ascertain the full cost of this provision.  When I did so previously I was told that as legislation was being considered it was not possible to cost it.  However, at the time I was given that reply this provision was being slipped into the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The State will have to pick up a tab of approximately £50 million per year for private companies or investors which buy shares in Telecom Éireann.  Why will the incoming companies not be made liable for the costs?  Why did the Cabinet subcommittee, made up of four Ministers, not make it a condition of the sale of the shares that the full rate of PRSI should be paid by the employees and employers and that the employees should be compensated by the incoming company?  In other words, why are they not required to bring the status of the workers in Telecom Éireann up to that <Col N="31" /> of other employees in the telecommunications industry and give them the full benefits.  If the company is moving into the private commercial world then the full rate of PRSI should be paid by the purchaser and the full benefits should be made available to the employees in the same way as they are made available to employees working in competing telecommunications companies. It is disgraceful that this point has not been properly addressed and that the State may have to pick up an extra bill of £50 million per year on the part privatisation of Telecom Éireann. This issue should be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how this provision is consistent with our membership of the EU and competition legislation?  There is a very strict barrier &mdash; when I was on the other side of the House I experienced this on many occasions &mdash; to the provision of State aid to public companies.  The granting of the reduced rate of PRSI to a company which buys shares in Telecom Éireann will be deemed by the EU to be a State aid.  I predict that the EU will question this issue when the shares are being purchased. What legal advice has been given on the EU aspect?  How is this provision consistent with competition law?  No Deputy holds a brief for any company but what will be the position of other telecommunications or electronics companies which compete directly with Telecom Éireann?  Phone-watch, which Telecom Éireann operates, has direct competition in the market at present.</P>
    <P>Section 12 must be amended because it contravenes not only EU law but Irish competition law.  This could happen once someone buys a share in Telecom Éireann, for example, and another company decides to operate in the telecommunications business.  A company was recently given a licence in the mobile telephone area.  A company could take a case to the Competition Authority or to the High Court which it would win on the basis that different PRSI rates applied in the private and <Col N="32" /> public sectors.  This section could be unconstitutional.  I am not a lawyer but I was involved in the competition law area when I was in Government and I know when a basic principle is breached.  A private company could own a substantial slice of Telecom Éireann, which would make it a part private company, yet there could be different rates of PRSI for private companies. No court would stand over a different rate of PRSI for companies in the same business, all of which have private sector involvement.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Department officials to examine this section again, to consider any amendments which are tabled and to ask the Attorney General if what they are doing is right.  It might solve a political problem but this section will be a headache for the Department officials long after this Minister has gone.  This anomaly, particularly in relation to other private players in the business, will leave the State open to legal actions.</P>
    <P>This solves a problem for Telecom Éireann but what happens in relation to An Post or other non-commercial State companies?  I am aware that commercial State companies pay the full rate of PRSI.  Will the same type of situation arise if, as has been recommended, part of Bord Fáilte is sold?  A journalist in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 21 February said that the change will save semi-State companies, such as Telecom Éireann, the ESB and Aer Lingus, hundreds of millions of pounds.  This suggests that anyone who owns a part of those companies will also save.  Why should we save the purchasers of parts of these companies millions of pounds?  We should think this measure through properly because such a precedent will cause a lot of trouble in the future.</P>
    <P>The workers in Telecom Éireann are entitled to the full benefits, therefore any incoming company should make up the difference in their PRSI.  We should not allow a second-class PRSI situation to continue in that company.  Perhaps <Col N="33" /> the Minister could tell us what discussions have taken place in Brussels on this matter.</P>
    <P>What is the position in Irish Steel and in Greencore in this regard?  As Greencore was a commercial State company before it was privatised, it probably had the same rate of PRSI.  Did Irish Steel pay the full rate of PRSI before privatisation and what is the position now?  I would like to know if this is part of the now failed Telecom Éireann strategy. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, in a reply to my parliamentary question on PRSI, stated that &ldquo;the question of changing the current PRSI status of other companies operating in the telecommunications sector does not arise&rdquo;.  How will other telecommunications companies respond to that?  The Minister is saying that one telecommunications company can have one rate but its competitors must have another rate.  We are introducing legislation to ensure that the purchaser of one third of Telecom Éireann does not have to pay the difference.  This is a handout to the incoming purchaser which is unnecessary and sloppy.  This decision was not thought through like a number of other decisions in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Attorney General's advice is made available, the Brussels discussions are unveiled, separate legislation on PRSI is introduced, an assessment of the constitutionality of the section is undertaken and a full costing of the implications of this decision for Telecom Éireann and for future disposals of parts of State companies is carried out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996.  This is wide-ranging legislation which reflects the twin aims of the Government in the area of social welfare.  It gives effect to the general increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget which ensure that the standard of living of those dependent on the social welfare system for some or all of their income is maintained and improved; and, second, it introduces a range of positive measures designed to assist in the transition from unemployment to employment, with particular emphasis on meeting the special needs of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa said he believed that it contains some of the most significant changes ever proposed to our social welfare system.  I agree fully with his assessment.  While the various measures contained in the budget are given a legislative basis in the Bill, other far-reaching reforms of the social welfare system are also included.  The timely introduction of two new payments &mdash; the disability allowance and the one parent family payment &mdash; is indicative of the extent of the reforms being carried through.  The budget introduced earlier this year was widely welcomed for its emphasis on the development of an integrated approach. across a range of Government Departments and agencies, which sets out to address effectively the most pressing social and economic problem facing us today, that of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>That budget was framed against a background of a successful, thriving and well managed economy, with an increased level of job creation, low inflation rates, low interest rates, and a newly confident business sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to look first at the general increases in social welfare which are contained in the Bill &mdash; in section 3 to 5.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for improvements, in real terms, for all weekly payments <Col N="35" /> and all adult dependant allowances. While inflation this year is projected to be 2.25 per cent, all payments will go up by more than this &mdash; on average, by about 3 per cent.  In practical terms, there will be at least an extra £2 per week on all personal rates and at least £1 extra on adult dependant rates.</P>
    <P>These increases represent real progress towards achieving the target rate set some ten years ago by the Commission on Social Welfare.  That target rate, updated from 1986, is now £68.10 per cent week.  The increases provided for in this Bill bring more groups up to that target rate.  Indeed, for the first time, widows, widowers and deserted wives have reached the target rate; while contributory pensioners continue to be well ahead of it.  Carers and invalidity pensioners are now on 99 per cent and 97 per cent of the rate, respectively; this is in contrast to references made by Opposition speakers last evening and all other groups are either at 92 per cent or 95 per cent of the target rate.  These improvements represent real progress and will ensure that the standard of living of all social welfare recipients will increase in 1996.  This does not, of course, give grounds for complacency and I share the hope that it will be possible next year to complete the process of bringing all groups up to the target rate of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In the interim, the Minister for Social Welfare, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, has commissioned the ESRI to review the minimum adequate income rates that were recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and I look forward to examining its views on what the new target rates should be in the light of all the changes since the commission first reported.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for further substantial increases in child benefit, consolidating and further developing the policy direction initiated last year, which aims to tackle poverty effectively by targeting resources at those families most <Col N="36" /> in need.  Child benefit this year is being increased by £2 per child per month from next September, bringing the monthly payment to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  Taking the last two years together, a 45 per cent increase has been provided in respect of the first two children and a 36 per cent increase for other children.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of child benefit as a means of tackling poverty is beyond question.  The advantages of the payment are manifold.  It is a universal payment; it is not taxable; it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment; and it is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents and medical cards.  It cannot, therefore, act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.  On the contrary, it provides a secure and well-targeted income support to those rearing children.</P>
    <P>The last speaker and others seem, over the past couple of days, to be proposing an attack on child benefit which I am sure will be watched very carefully by women.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill also contains another innovative measure which is to be welcomed &mdash; I refer to the increase in allowances for the parents of twins. This recognises the significant extra costs involved for the parents of twins. The current grant of £200 payable on the birth of twins is being increased to £500 and a new grant of £500 is being introduced which will be payable on the twins reaching the age of four and the age of 12.  These new grants recognise the particular financial pressures which arise for parents of twins when the twins enter primary and secondary school.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Bill, in section 4, provides for a substantial further increase, over and above the general increase for all social welfare recipients, for those in receipt of the carer's allowance.  The weekly personal rate will now amount to £67.50 which represents an 8 per cent increase on the current rate.  Over 8,000 recipients will <Col N="37" /> benefit from this special increase.  Allied to the various improvements in the allowance since it was introduced back in 1990, this substantial increase demonstrates the willingness of the Government to recognise the special position of carers on low means who are undertaking what is often an extremely demanding and indeed, in some cases, a lonely role.</P>
    <P>Having welcomed the substantial increases in social welfare rates of payment, I would now like to turn to an equally important aspect of the Social Welfare Bill &mdash; the strong focus on pro-employment measures.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the labour market has undergone significant change with different patterns emerging in terms of both the hours people work and the type of work being undertaken.  The challenge for those of us working in the area of social welfare reform is to ensure that the system is sufficiently flexible to accommodate these changes. In short, the system of delivering income supports and social services must ensure that no one can be fearful that they will be worse off as a result of taking up any form of work, however atypical or unorthodox it might be.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important reform in this area contained in the Social Welfare Bill relates to the fundamental changes in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance.  Hitherto, this has been a hugely complex area, both for the staff of my Department and, most notably, for the people in receipt of the payment.</P>
    <P>The reform of the unemployment assessment scheme set out in section 22 of the Bill will have two immediate consequences. First, it will greatly simplify the system, thus making it far easier to calculate the real value of any earnings gained from casual or part-time work. Second, it will provide a positive incentive to take up any opportunities which may arise for casual or part-time work by ensuring that people will be better off if they do.</P>
    <P>This reform arises directly from the <Col N="38" /> work of the Expert Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, which has been working intensively over the last couple of years to find the best way of removing unemployment and poverty traps arising from the interaction of the two systems.  The work of that group is now nearing conclusion and I understand that it will submit its final report to the Minister for Social Welfare within the next few months.  In the meantime, the group made a number of valuable recommendations in advance of the 1996 budget which were adopted and which are now being implemented through this Bill.  I pay tribute to the integration group for the long hours they gave to their task in the past few years, and particularly during the past 12 months when I had an opportunity to observe them more closely.</P>
    <P>A further vital area of reform is set out in section 7 of the Bill.  This section provides for the retention of child dependant allowances for up to 13 weeks for people in receipt of full-rate social welfare payments and who have been unemployed for 12 months or more when they take up full-time employment which is expected to last for a minimum of four weeks.  This reform will remove a significant disincentive to taking up employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed with families who would previously have faced the immediate loss of these allowances.  This reform is precisely the type of thing I was speaking of earlier when I referred to the need for the social welfare system to be flexible enough to facilitate the transition from unemployment to employment.</P>
    <P>The reforms of the PRSI system, as set out in section 8 to 12 of the Bill provide more evidence of the Government's desire that employers should be assisted to make jobs and the unemployed should be assisted to take jobs. Most notably, the Bill provides for a substantial increase, from £50 to £80, in the weekly PRSI-free allowance for employees.  It also introduces a reduction in both the lower rate of <Col N="39" /> employers' PRSI &mdash; from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent &mdash; and in the higher rate &mdash; from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with specific responsibility for customer relations, I welcome in particular the provisions in sections 30 to 32 of the Bill which deal with appeals procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 30 makes provision for an independent appeals system for people whose claims for supplementary welfare allowance have been turned down by the health boards.  I have been aware of the criticisms of the existing supplementary welfare allowance appeals system for some time now &mdash; and many Deputies will have heard complaints from their constituents about the adequacy of the current arrangements.  I am delighted, therefore, that people who have appealed unsuccessfully to the health board against an adverse decision on a claim for a social welfare allowance will now have a further avenue of appeal through the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
    <P>This right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office will be provided initially in respect of claims for basic social welfare payments and for the rent, mortgage and other supplements available under the scheme.  When we have ensured that the administrative arrangements for appeals against adverse decisions in respect of the basic social welfare payments and supplements are working efficiently and satisfactorily, the question of extending the right of appeal to include the main remaining entitlement under the SWA scheme &mdash; the exceptional needs payment &mdash; can then be considered. Because of its discretionary nature, the exceptional needs payment is quite different from the other SWA payments.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for regulatory powers to specify the procedures to be followed on appeals decisions relating to claims for both social welfare payments generally and for supplementary welfare allowance.  Regulations will be made under these powers which will <Col N="40" /> require that claimants will receive in writing the reason or reasons for an adverse decision.  That is in keeping with our policy to provide as much information as possible.</P>
    <P>These provisions will significantly strengthen the rights of those who are in contact with the social welfare system. They will ensure that people have a clear understanding of the basis of adverse decisions and assuage any fears that decisions are being made in an arbitrary fashion.</P>
    <P>A further amendment to the existing provisions which must be warmly welcomed is contained in section 32.  This amendment relates to revised decisions by deciding officers, appeals officers and officers of the health board in the case of supplementary welfare allowance where a new fact comes to light which results in a revised decision being made which reduces a person's entitlement. Under the revised provisions the deciding officer will have discretion to decide that the reduction in entitlement should only take effect from a current date where, for example, he or she concludes that the person concerned could not reasonably have been expected to know the relevance of the fact.  This measure is designed to improve and strengthen the rights of those who have contact with the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>During the debate the Department received some bouquets and some brickbats.  I listened with interest to my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, who raised the issue of standardisation of means tests.  That matter must be viewed in the context of the integration of the social welfare and taxation codes.  That was a recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts which the Deputy chaired and of which I was a member. If we adopt a sticking plaster approach to amending the system further difficulties will be created.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that there should be a check on lone parents and deserted wives.  Such a measure is already in place.  I have as much experience as any Deputy of dealing with queries and I know there are two sides <Col N="41" /> to every story.  The system must be caring and compassionate but we must also ensure that everybody complies with the law.  People will try to circumvent the system but that is not peculiar to the social welfare code.  However, applications will be received from vulnerable people who have no resources and little advice available to them.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers under the age of 66 years do not benefit from free schemes and so on and that matter must be examined.  As regards the UK system and the activities of moneylenders our system is considerably more compassionate that that in the UK.  The Department has made every effort to ensure that advice on money lending is made available to as many people as possible thus obviating the need for recourse to moneylenders.  That service is being extended throughout the country. Before Christmas the Minister made a special award to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  While the amount may not have been as great as people would wish it was a recognition of the difficulties faced by voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The pro-employment approach adopted by the Department is fully supported by the parties in Government. The Department operates the back-to-work scheme which resulted in 6,000 new businesses, employing 10,000 people, being created in 19 months.  The enterprise magazine of Forbairt stated that the success of the scheme was nothing short of outstanding and the fact that more than 6,000 businesses in the self-employment sector were created indicates the enormous potential that exists for further job creation. That accolate is well deserved by the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>We owe a debt of gratitude to the officials in the Department, especially those who serve in the Minister's office and the Minister of State's office, for their tremendous work in pursuing the schemes operated by the Department, the benefits of which are enjoyed by the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system is a major achievement of modern society designed to provide support and assistance for the weakest and most disadvantaged. It is essential to look at the structure of the system as we approach the year 2000.  Social welfare accounts for one-third of Government spending. In 1996 more than £4,000 million will be spent on the system.</P>
      <P>The changing role and status of women in society presents a challenge which the system has to meet.  Married women participate to a greater extent in the labour force and the system must be adapted to take account of this.  It must recognise women's independence and move away from the concept of dependency. Wives should be entitled to half of their husband's entitlements, particularly if they have families.  Equality for women, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups must be a key objective of Government policy.  This was emphasised in a report published by the National Economic and Social Forum last week.  It sets out a range of sensible measures to ensure equality for women, people with disabilities, travellers and others.  The sooner its main recommendations are implemented the better.</P>
      <P>How does this Bill measure up to tackling the problem of unemployment? In fairness to the Minister for Social Welfare, the cuts in PRSI contributions are positive and are welcomed by employers who wish to take on staff. There are proposals to change the means test for those on unemployment assistance who take up part-time work. The details have yet to be announced but presumably it will be an improvement on the current chaotic system. Unemployment is rising rapidly in areas where one would least expect.  For example the number on the live register increased dramatically in the past six months in Killarney.  In early February, the figure was 1,900 whereas at this time last year it was only 1,400.  This is a matter of serious concern not only to the local community.  The additional cost to the Exchequer should be of concern to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> The Government's response to the unemployment crisis is not correct.  The Department of Social Welfare, FÁS and the local employment service are supposed to provide information, advice and assistance directly to people seeking work.  Other bodies including IDA, Forfás, Forbairt, county enterprise boards are involved in job creation.  One may ask how does an employer or someone seeking work find his way around this maze?  Instead of adopting a coherent plan to tackle unemployment the Government is relying an old structures that need to be modified.</P>
    <P>How did the Bill respond to the recommendations of the most recent task force report on unemployment? The task force recommended that a range of schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare, including the back to work allowance and the part-time job incentive scheme should be examined in the context of other income supports for people on low pay such as family income supplement and PRSI exemptions and other measures to address the interface of tax and social welfare.  Its report outlined the complexity in the range of income support measures in place for those in low paid employment.  It considered that the roles and objectives of individual measures need to be clarified and streamlined to ensure they complement one another.  There is nothing specific in the Bill that provides for the implementation of the proposals in the task force report.  I would like to see a special task force being set up by other Ministers in towns such as Killarney where unemployment is increasing, and there is a corresponding drop in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>A range of measures to assist the elderly should have been introduced in this Bill but the Government introduced a totally inadequate proposal to grant tax relief in respect of the installation of burglar alarms for those aged 65 and over who live alone and pay tax.  The vast majority of people over 65 years in receipt of social welfare do not pay tax. <Col N="44" /> The response from a wide range of bodies indicated the need for a much wider level of support for elderly people.</P>
    <P>The Minister set up a task force to examine this issue.  The solution is clear, there should be a social welfare payment to assist elderly people to make their homes secure.  This would cut out many obvious problems.  A problem created by the social welfare system is where a son or daughter lives at home and applies for unemployment assistance or benefit and the family income is taken into account.  If he or she rented accommodation he or she would get a rent subsidy from the health board. These subsidies cost a considerable amount of money.  Another problem created by the system is that at a time when interest rates are at their lowest in living memory, the Department of Social Welfare assesses capital at the rate of 10 per cent in estimating the means of elderly people and it is proposed in this Bill to assess it at 15 per cent for some claimants.  Does the Minister intend to extend this to old age pensioners? Does he realise it is totally counterproductive as people will be afraid to lodge their money with the credit union or any other financial institution. Now is the time to reduce this percentage to reflect the current interest rates.  The interest on deposit accounts is low and in addition DIRT and service charges are deducted.  Pensioners are really afraid to lodge their money with financial institutions and this gives rise to other problems.</P>
    <P>In April 1988 the PRSI system was extended to the self-employed but those aged 56 and over when the scheme was introduced, find they are ineligible for the old age contributory pension although they are required to pay PRSI contributions up the age of 66.  This qualification criterion is totally inflexible and penalises many thousands of self-employed people, including farmers. Surely the Minister could have introduced flexibility into the scheme, for example by allowing these people to buy additional contributions, to continue to pay contributions beyond the <Col N="45" /> age of 66 years in order to meet the qualification requirements or to provide a <i>pro rata</i> pension payment based on their contributions.  I received a great many complaints and requests for information on this matter from farmers aged over 66 years who are very concerned about it.  Will the Minister be prepared to introduce a scheme whereby retired farmers could make additional payments so that they would qualify for a contributory pension? Those who were 63 and over when they joined the scheme in 1988 do not qualify for a pension.</P>
    <P>The extension of the PRSI system to the self-employed with effect from 6 April 1988 brought in £91 million to the Exchequer in 1994.  Having regard to that large amount of revenue collected, the Minister should address the plight of farmers and other self-employed people.</P>
    <P>This Bill performs badly in dealing with women.  The 1993 report of the Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the term &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo; should be substituted for the term &ldquo;dependent&rdquo;.  It also recommended that social welfare payments should be divided between the recipient and the qualified partner, the dependent spouse.  Qualified partners should be issued with their own allowance book and the Government should work towards establishing a system of individual rights and payments under the social welfare and social insurance systems by 1997.  None of those recommendations are addressed in the Bill.  While the Minister may say he introduced a benefit for lone parents, I hope he will state why that payment will be means tested when more than a year ago he specifically announced such a test would not apply to this scheme.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of entitlement to contributory old age pensions of applicants over 66 years of age who paid contributions in their early working life but did not pay any for a long period and later took up insurable employment for say, 16 to 18 years before reaching the qualifying age for a contributory old <Col N="46" /> age pension of 66.  The reckonable assessment period for qualification for contributory pension for such applicants is either 1963 or the first date they paid contributions.  There is an anomaly in the scheme.  I know of a person who paid less than 12 contributions in 1961 and was not in insurable employment until the early 1970s.  That person was granted a substantially reduced contributory old age pension in the early 1990s because the period from the date of the earlier contributions to the date of application was taken into account for the purposes of determining the average number of contributions paid. This system is unfair, particularly in regard to people who have a lapse of contribution payments in excess of ten years, and it should be changed.  The Minister should take special note of this, given that it does not involve many people.  By addressing the matter he would help many people who have given this country good service in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>The decision not to give an additional payment to people in residential institutions was a tough measure.  How does that fit in with the Government's commitment to equality?  As a result of this measure many people with disabilities in residential institutions are expected to live on a weekly pittance. This has been heavily criticised by the Ombudsman and it is time this archaic measure was dropped.  I received numerous complaints about it from people with a family member in institutions and from people in institutions.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party will introduce amendments on the measures I mentioned on Committee Stage.  I intend to introduce amendments to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and the National and Economic and Social Forum to establish a charter of rights for all claimants.  I acknowledge there are many provisions of significance in the Bill which will help the less well off in the community, but much more could and should be done having regard to the <Col N="47" /> large sum of money spent on social welfare annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill is one of the most important brought before the House annually.  Its provisions impact on a large number of citizens. Approximately one million people, including those totally dependent on it, benefit from social welfare. In most cases those people are among the less well off.  I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, on a number of the provisions in this lengthy and detailed Bill.  It is impossible in the time allocated to comment on all of them.  I will confine my remarks to areas where there has been fundamental change.</P>
      <P>The Bill puts on a legal footing many of the changes announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day and it must be considered in that broader context. I welcome the general increase in social welfare insurance and assistance rates.  It is also welcome that the 3 per cent increase in benefits is significantly higher than the expected rate of inflation.  In conjunction with the package for the long-term unemployed announced in the budget, these provisions will go a long way towards tackling the problem of marginalisation in our society.  Despite the remarks of some Opposition speakers about social welfare payments, I do not, and I am pleased the Minister does not, support the concept of a reduction in unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit payments as an incentive to encourage people to return to work.  From my experience I am not aware of anyone who does not want to get back to work, even by way of the community employment or CORI schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government adopted the correct strategy, that of offering positive inducements in this area.  This is a far superior way to address the sensitive issues of dealing with the needs and demands of families.  Some of those measures are included in the Bill such as the reduction of employer's and <Col N="48" /> employee's PRSI contributions, the maintenance of child dependant allowance for the long-term unemployed when returning to the labour force and the increase in the income allowed for qualification for family income supplement. Those entitlements are a great incentive for the long-term unemployed to take up employment.  For too long because of poverty traps and disincentives the unemployed have been reluctant to take up employment, or even participate in community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on these matters.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan who has attempted to unravel some of the complications in the system and has been successful in finding solutions to some of the problems highlighted by our representations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit. That benefit has been increased by more than 85 per cent since my party come to power in 1992.  This will help prevent further poverty traps.  I am pleased the Bill continues the good work done in this regard in recent years. The increase in the threshold for PRSI payments is particularly welcome.  We must continue our efforts to make progress in this area.  I have no doubt about the Minister's commitment in this regard.  He is aware of the problems that exist, as are many Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system is very complicated. Not only are there difficulties in operating it but there is lack of awareness of entitlement.  Many people do not understand the implications involved, for example, in transferring from long-term unemployment to disability benefit.  People whose disability benefit is discontinued following a medical examination often find they are entitled to very little unemployment benefit &mdash; payments in some cases are as low as £28 per week.  People in those circumstances are forced into the supplementary welfare system, and some are even driven to commit suicide.</P>
    <P>Many of these problems are not <Col N="49" /> unique to Ireland.  In Britain, for instance, there is an ongoing debate about reform of the social welfare system which was devised about 50 years ago and is no longer deemed to satisfy modern requirements.  Fundamental reform must be undertaken.  Although this Bill has not been generally accepted by the Opposition, it goes a long way towards bringing in fundamental reforms.  However such reforms must not be introduced at the expense of those who depend on the State for their survival.</P>
    <P>In the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on means testing there is specific mention of the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and the Environment.  The Minister shares my view that means testing is an odious practice.  The cost to the State of this unpopular and manifestly, unnecessary system is very high.  In his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that current arrangements in the Department are in many cases costly and unnecessary.  Means testing costs the Government £15 million and up to 600,000 people have been investigated.  At times false accusations are made against the unemployed as a result of rumours or complaints.  I am sure the money spent on means testing could be better spent on those who need it.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states that up to 40 per cent of people examined were found to be legitimate or had been already means tested by another agency.  For example, where a person, who has been means tested by the Department for social welfare payments, applies for a medical card another means test is undertaken by the health board, thereby incurring further expense.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister initiated reform in this area.  I am aware that this is not a simple matter, but it is a cause of concern that so much money is spent chasing people on the lowest levels of income.  I hope the expert committee on the integration of tax and social welfare, which is due to report soon, will address some of the points I made and <Col N="50" /> that the Minister will be in a position to make the changes necessary in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to simplify some aspects of the system.  For example, responsibility for payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance, now called disability allowance, is to be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  I compliment the Minister on taking this long overdue step.  Most Deputies are familiar with the delays surrounding the processing of payments by health boards.  I am aware of applicants for disabled person's maintenance allowance who had to wait two or three years for a decision.  When I brought these cases to the attention of the then Minister for Health by way of parliamentary question I discovered that there was a go-slow in the offices investigating this matter.  The applicants, who were obviously unhealthy and incapable of working &mdash; some were mentally handicapped &mdash; were in need of payments.  I had to resort to the Ombudsman's office to ensure payment was made from the date of application. I welcome the transfer of this scheme from health boards to the Department of Social Welfare which, through the Minister and Minister of State, is accountable to this House.  This measure represents the logical transfer of a matter that should always have come within the remit of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides that the regulatory powers for supplementary welfare allowances be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, although these payments will continue to be made by health boards through the supplementary welfare officers.  I look forward to the day when that scheme will be transferred fully to the Department as that will provide for a much better service.  The announcement of the transfer of these schemes to the Department is welcomed by everybody.  Whatever we may say about the Department of Social Welfare, it is accountable to this House, unlike health boards that operate with self-structured autonomy.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that those in receipt <Col N="51" /> of supplementary welfare allowance will be given the right to appeal to a departmental appeals officer, a right which has been lacking for too long.  Under section 33 the Minister is also correct in providing direct access to the Social Welfare appeals office in the case of workers engaged in a trade dispute without the requirement of having previously appealed a deciding officer's decision.  I hope this will eliminate many of the difficulties experienced in industrial disputes, particularly those in the course of the closure of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>Despite much initial criticism the summer jobs scheme for students has been extremely successful.  I have already tabled a parliamentary question and discussed some anomalies in the scheme with the Minister of State, particularly an additional payment to students whose families are in receipt of social welfare benefits on termination of their participation in that scheme.  I came across one glaring anomaly in the case of a large family where the father earned a few pounds as a shoemaker. The family was in receipt of means tested social welfare benefits.  While the father's total income was similar to that of another family in receipt of social welfare benefits, because he had been sufficiently motivated to engage in such work, about which the Department was aware, two of his children were disallowed additional payments under the summer jobs scheme.</P>
    <P>The back-to-work scheme providing a minimum weekly payment of £40 should be examined.  There should be no embargo placed on those who want to be omitted from the live register and be reinstated in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Last November I participated in a delegation from the constituencies of Tipperary North and Tipperary South which discussed with the Minister a major problem which had festered for the past 20 years or so.  I refer to the Ballingarry miners who, unfortunately, contracted the dreaded miner's disease leaving them incapacitated.  Since they worked for an employer who had <Col N="52" /> become bankrupt at a time when ordinary employment insurance cover was in existence, before the occupational injuries scheme came into operation under which they would have qualified, they were excluded.  Many of them have died already but some at least would have qualified for disability benefit or occupational injuries allowance.  In this Bill the Minister has wisely provided under the constant attendance allowance that, subject to a medical examination, those remaining men will qualify for additional non-means tested constant attendance allowances which will address their dilemma.  I commend the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, mentioned widows, agreeing with other Members that those below the age of 66 are particularly vulnerable.  Their late husbands perhaps qualified for free electricity and other allowances, of which they are deprived at a traumatic time.  Their level of payment is one of the lowest and warrants examination to ascertain how we can improve their benefits, particularly in the case of those to whom I have just referred.</P>
    <P>I might also alert Members to the present currency fluctuations between sterling and the IR£.  I am glad the Minister has confirmed that, in the course of reviewing non-contributory payments, he will examine their augmentation.</P>
    <P>The announcement of a tax free allowance for old people who instal an alarm has sent the wrong signal since many of them would not feature in our tax code and, therefore, would not benefit unless through such an allowance being transferred to a relative who might incur the cost on their behalf.  I am glad the Minister has initiated an inquiry into this issue to ascertain how such installations could be funded by the State, through local authority assistance or whatever.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a major step forward on legislation in this overall area, tackling some unemployment traps which have dogged our system for so long and containing a number of meaningful reforms guided by the need to <Col N="53" /> simplify and clarify the system overall. The Minister is to be congratulated in that he has demonstrated an amount of ingenuity in effecting these necessary changes.  For far too long there has been a tendency to effect piecemeal improvements of the system which, while welcome in themselves, merely added to its overall complexity.</P>
    <P>I look forward to further improvements in next year's Bill.  I have no doubt that some of the legitimate points raised in the course of this debate will be addressed by the Minister when replying.  I commend the Bill and have pleasure in supporting it.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil regards social welfare as one of the most important of our departmental structures.  Indeed, Fianna Fáil has a record of social advancement.  It is a top priority of our party to give priority to the care of the less well off, deprived and disadvantaged. Our record speaks for itself, one of caring and compassion to ensure all citizens enjoy a reasonable standard of security and comfort in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that this Bill will do much in caring for and showing compassion for those in need and in receipt of social welfare payments.  It ignores the real problems of those entirely dependent on social welfare. Despite what the Minister or other Government speakers have said, it does not attempt to come to grips with real poverty traps.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which gives effect to the social welfare budgetary provisions, contains no innovative measures.  There is continual mention of the one parent family payment and disability allowance. The first represents a step in the right direction but the second merely involves the transfer of administration from health boards to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that this Bill has been introduced against a background of widespread lack of public confidence in the achievement of this Government.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is nothing which warrants a seal of approval. There was an increase of 2.5 per cent in social welfare payments in 1995 and a 3 per cent increase this year.

      <P>The year 1995 can only be described as a black one for social welfare recipients.  The cruel reality is that, notwithstanding all the promises which were made, nothing has been achieved.  The Minister talked freely when in Opposition about what should <Col N="55" /> be done for recipients.  He now tells us of his difficulties and the hard decisions he must take as Minister and as a party leader.</P>
      <P>On 14 December I asked the Minister about the number of personnel in his office in the Department.  He informed me that he has 17 staff in his ministerial office, including a private secretary, a programme manager, three executive officers, seven clerical officers and two clerical assistant typists.  He went on to inform me that the staff incur travel and subsistence expenses.  He stated that to support his role as party leader in Government a small research unit had been recently established to provide him with advice and analysis on policy proposals which arise on the general Government agenda outside his Department. After he replied to this question we heard about the famous advertisement in the Democratic Left magazine, <i>Forum</i>.  If the Minister were in Opposition, what would his reaction be if a Minister for Social Welfare had 17 staff and five additional advisers politically associated with his party?  I think he would scream to high Heaven and his colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, would talk about information which would rock the foundations of the State.</P>

When I first came to the House I listened to all contributions, particularly the Opposition viewpoint.  I heard the Labour Party and Democratic Left say that farmers should be taxed because the PAYE sector is paying too much.  I <Col N="56" /> heard soap box lines which sounded good.  Improvements in free schemes were advocated.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister took office I tabled many questions but I do not think it is appropriate for me to go over them. However, the Minister's answers to questions on developments in the free schemes, such as the minor alteration of hours in the free travel scheme, have been sad.  He keeps using the old rhetoric about the financial implications. People expected better from him because of the arguments he made in Opposition.  He has allowed himself to be browbeaten by the rhetoric coming from the Department such as &ldquo;this can only be considered in the budgetary context&rdquo; and &ldquo;this cannot be achieved because of the financial implications&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The pattern of change which reflects modern society and affects over 1.5 million people who benefit from social welfare warrants special focus.  As we approach the 21st century, most Members support the view that the existing structures require a radical alteration.  There are many <Col N="57" /> challenges facing the social welfare system. I do not have time to deal with all of them but I will touch on a few.</P>
      <P>The group referred to as the ageing population is huge and many reports have been published on it.  We recognise that this will lead to significant additional expenditure in the years ahead.  There are many simple measures which should have been introduced in the Bill but were not.  I already dealt with some of them, such as the free schemes.  My party spokesman, Deputy Joe Walsh, spoke about the crazy situation with regard to the 10 per cent assessment by the Department of people with nest eggs of a few pounds. I understand that a simple regulatory order or instruction issued by the Minister could result in this matter being assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Ministers have had blinkered visions with regard to the carer's allowance.  The Departments of Social Welfare and Health should put their heads together.  If Deputy Connor reads my contributions in previous debates on social welfare, he will see that when my party was in Government I also asked for this to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Sadly, this was not achieved.  It is about time the Ministers for Health and Social Welfare came together, not just to introduce payment of another benefit but to achieve what the carer's allowance was intended to achieve when it was first introduced. The Minister was a member of the Eastern Health Board and he knows the demand for care for the elderly.  He is familiar with the cost of providing beds for the elderly and the lack of accommodation in both Eastern Health Board and private residential homes.  He knows also that the Eastern Health Board, and the other eight health <Col N="58" /> boards, spend huge amounts of money on nursing home subvention.  There are three levels of payment for nursing home care; approximately £75, £90 and £120, depending on assessment, to people who can make a contribution of their own.  Health boards around the country have purchased beds in private nursing homes to accommodate people who can no longer remain at home and who require some nursing care.  The Minister should inquire from the Meath Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, which serves part of his own catchment area, and James Connolly Memorial Hospital about the number of beds being occupied as a result of social rather than medical problems.</P>
      <P>We should introduce a payment to people to allow their relatives to live with them or to encourage others to provide the same level of care as that provided by hospitals and nursing homes.  As the Minister is aware, the cost of a bed in a nursing home is approximately £250 per week while the cost of an acute hospital bed is far greater.  It is wrong for people to occupy acute hospital or nursing home beds or to avail of subventions simply because of social problems.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance does not go any way towards addressing this issue which is not totally the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It warrants the involvement of both the Departments of Health and Social Welfare which should devise an innovative package to address the needs of the elderly. When the Tallaght Hospital is up and running in a matter of months, the problem that exists in all other hospitals in the Dublin and other areas will arise there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of this problem relates to other issues such as the 10 per cent assessment of people who have put away a small amount of money as a nest egg to be used by their families for burial and other expenses.  That nest egg is crucial to elderly people and often they do not wish to disclose it.  As a result, many elderly people have suffered severe beatings in recent months in country areas <Col N="59" /> because the gurriers carrying out these attacks know that money is hidden in the home and not in the local bank or post office.</P>
    <P>The problems of carers can be addressed by way of innovative measure and without the need for major resources.  The money currently being used for the carer's allowance moneys and the other moneys being spent by the Department of Health and the health boards could be utilised.</P>
    <P>Like most people, I am concerned about the increasing unemployment figures. We have had many reports and recommendations, such as that from the task force on unemployment, on how to deal with this problem but I am not satisfied that the Minister took the opportunity in this Bill to implement some of those recommendations.</P>

I want to refer also to the army of people involved in the excellent delivery of various services in the voluntary and community sectors. I salute those people who do trojan work for which they are not properly recognised.  I tabled questions to the Minister on putting in place a formal structure and we have been promised a White Paper.  I look forward with enthusiasm to the publication of the White Paper as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this major debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  I represent a constituency where approximately 60 per cent of the adult population benefits from social welfare payments in one form or another.  This is a major political issue, therefore, for me and other politicians who must deal with these issues in our constituency work.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill with all its reforms and innovation.  Our social welfare system is weighed down with regulations, some of which are archaic and do not take account of modern day realities. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has tackled problems in the system which, unfortunately, costs a great deal of money but we applaud him for what he is doing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the new one parent family allowance and the elimination of the concept of desertion with all the pain and embarrassment it caused for women having to prove desertion.  I and others have raised this issue many times in the House and I am delighted this fundamental reform is included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the new disability allowance which replaces the disabled person's maintenance allowance operated by the health boards.  Its payment, which will be means tested, will now be the function of the Department of Social Welfare, which is welcome, as I know from my experience of the Western Health Board that health boards were incapable of properly determining the means of an applicant for disabled person's maintenance allowance.  One found the Department <Col N="61" /> of Social Welfare had a greater knowledge of means, the proper assessment of means and was able to take all circumstances into account.  No two cases are quite the same.  Certainly, Department of Social Welfare officials are the most competent to deal with that type of means testing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that reform in the area of unemployment assistance does away with the concept where a person who worked more than four days out of six-consecutive days lost entitlement to unemployment assistance in that week. I am pleased that every day of unemployment in a week, so long as a person qualifies for unemployment assistance, is recognised and a payment is made for it.</P>
    <P>I represent many farmers, including a large number of small farmers.  In County Roscommon alone about 1,600 small farmers qualify for unemployment assistance or what is called small farmers' assistance.  From my reading of the Bill, it does not appear the reforms, disregards for income and so on, extend to them.  I have long been a critic of means-testing for unemployment assistance for small farmers.  In the mid 1980s means-testing was based on the income arising from the small farm, not on a notional system as it had been up to then. However, we still find in the means test many elements of notionality.  Under the law, the social welfare officer is allowed make a notional assessment of livestock sales and can state the amount of gross income in any operational year &mdash; it may not necessarily be average &mdash; and increase it by applying a notional figure.  That is not fair and it operates unjustly against many small farmers.  It is fashionable to be critical of farmers and their claims, but small farmers by definition, are well within the poverty trap.  We know from all those who have studied their circumstances that their income is well below the national average. As people who have fallen below the poverty line they are among some of the poorest in the country.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the Conference of Religious in Ireland examined poverty trends <Col N="62" /> among small farmers and found that as a single economic group they were more pervasively poor than any other.  EU interventions may have improved the position since then, but it would make an interesting study.  Will the Minister consider extending the reforms of unemployment assistance with provision for disregards and so on, to small farmers where it is applicable, as small farmers' assistance is effectively unemployment assistance?  Any objective examination of it should result in additional benefits to small farmers.</P>
    <P>The various provisions have been dealt with by all speakers but in my ordinary day to day contact with clients of the Department of Social Welfare I find a number of irritating aspects of the system.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the difficulty with medical referees.  Six years ago a man on disability benefit who had been declared fit to work called to me.  He suffered from a heart complaint.  Three weeks after he had been declared fit for work &mdash; his disability benefit was taken from him on the basis of the medical referee's report &mdash; he died from a heart attack.  Many hundreds of people who are brought before a medical referee are declared fit for work.  I understand the most cursory examination is done by the medical referee who, it appears to me, is not a co-operative or helpful person. It appears the medical referee does not have to report in detail the reason he decides a person is fit or unfit for work. There must be included in the system a requirement whereby medical referees are obliged to state to a client the reason he is found medically fit or otherwise, especially where a person will lose benefit in the event of being declared fit for work.  The medical referee should be obliged to give the medical reasons &mdash; when evidence suggests the contrary &mdash; he has found the person fit for work.  The appeals officers who deal with these cases afterwards restore benefit in a high proportion of cases.  I recall asking a previous Minister for Social Welfare a question in the House about that and was amazed to hear that <Col N="63" /> something of the order of 65 per cent or more of persons who were disqualified for benefit by medical referees had their benefit restored by appeals officers at oral hearings afterwards.  That points to major flaws in the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister did much to make the operations of the appeals office transparent but we need to do more.  Appeals officers conduct oral hearings and so on and make decisions.  Some of the constituency work from time to time involves attending oral hearings with constituents and helping to put the case before the appeals officer.  It is similar to being with a client in court.  Generally speaking, I have found appeals officers fair and well informed but there have been cases where one would disagree with the decision.  The difficulty is that the client or the client's advocate or public representative cannot discover from the appeals officer why he ruled against the client when the evidence, in the opinion of the client or in the opinion of the advocate, might be to the contrary and there might be obvious reasons for thinking and saying that.</P>
    <P>We need to bring out in the open the decisions of appeals officers.  Especially in the case of adverse decisions they should be able to say why they were unable to accept certain arguments at an oral hearing, where evidence may have been presented to strengthen a case being made.  Will the Minister introduce something along those lines?</P>
    <P>Will he examine the issue of savings which has cost implications?  Many Deputies referred to the savings of elderly people.  I agree with Deputy Callely that an elderly person's attachment to a saving of £500, £5,000, or £10,000 is very great.  He or she sees it as covering their funeral expenses.  They worry about the dignity of their burial and provide for it.</P>
    <P>When assessing means &mdash; this only arises in means-tested or in non-contributory payments &mdash; where the value of capital has to be assessed, the Department disregards the first few pounds and assesses the first £500 at a low rate of interest.  For sums in excess <Col N="64" /> of £500 interest is calculated at the rate of 10 per cent per annum.  There are no savings in any institution here, except some long-term savings, which make anything approaching that amount of interest.  It is unfair to determine that a saving of £10,000 in the bank which is not a huge sum of money nowadays, can accrue an income of £1,000 to a social welfare or pension recipient and that that sum can be deducted from the maximum amount to which he or she would be entitled.  As the Minister is aware I am referring to means-tested or non-contributory pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the number of jobs created under the local development programme.  The Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development comprises sub-programmes on local enterprise, the integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas and the urban and village renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-programme one of the operational programme, local enterprise, 2,887 full-time and 815 part-time jobs were created in 1995.  Figures for jobs created under sub-programme two, integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas, are being compiled at present and it is expected that the figure will be available in early April.  Under sub-programme <Col N="65" /> three, urban and village renewal, the figures available are based on man year job equivalents.  Much of the works undertaken to date have been carried out by existing local authority workforces.</P>
    <P>A local employment service is being established initially in 14 areas, including the original 12 area partnership companies.  Its objective is to provide a more co-ordinated and client centred service to the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed.  In doing so, it seeks to deliver a more streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed by statutory agencies operating locally, especially FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare and the vocational education committees, as well as the important outreach services for the unemployed provided by community and voluntary organisations, including the ICTU centres for the unemployed. The local employment service is being established on a partnership basis because of the critical importance of the active support of employers in developing an effective placement service.</P>

      <P>I have not much information about displacement.  The breakdown between full-time and part-time jobs created in 1995 is 2,887 and 815 respectively.  In 1994, 1,776 full-time and 263 part-time jobs were created.  With an overall job creation target of 8,000 for sub-programmes to the end of 1999 and having created 4,663 full-time and 1,078 part-time in 1994-95, I believe the programme is on course and the job creation target will be exceeded.  I do not have any information about displacement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House during the Adjournment debate on 7 March, the report of the investigation into the tragic case of the child Kelly Fitzgerald was commissioned by the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board.  The terms of reference of the inquiry team appointed by the chief executive officer were: to inquire into the circumstances of the late Kelly Fitzgerald and her family and, having regard thereto, to examine the Western Health Board's child protection practices and procedures and to make such recommendations as were deemed necessary; to make such other recommendations as were considered relevant; and to report to the chief executive officer of the board in the matter as soon as possible for presentation by him to the board.</P>
      <P>The inquiry team submitted its report to the chief executive officer on 14 November 1995 and he then sought legal advice in relation to the publication of the report.  The opinion of the board's legal advisers was received on 6 February 1996.  Further clarification of certain aspects of the legal opinion was sought from the legal advisers and this was received on 5 March 1996.  I did not consider it appropriate to seek a copy of the report pending the outcome of the consultations between the chief executive officer and the board's legal advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In anticipation of a special meeting of the board copies of the report were issued to members of the board, together with the legal opinion received and a report to the board from the chief executive officer on 6 March 1996.  Parts of the report were published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 7 March 1996, in <Col N="68" /> advance of the special meeting of the board.  In the light of this development, the chief executive officer of the board provided a copy of the report to my Department together with a copy of the legal advice in relation to the report. This was received in the Department on 8 March 1996.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that at the special meeting of the Board on 11 March 1996 the board decided, having considered the legal advice from senior counsel, to publish the general recommendations of the report.  The board also decided to refer the recommendations to the community care committee and the child care advisory committee of the board for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the difficult task undertaken by the inquiry team in good faith.  There are valuable lessons to be learned from this tragic case and these are reflected in certain recommendations of the report.  My Department is studying the report in detail and will consult with the Western Health Board on actions that need to be taken on foot of the report.</P>
    <P>The other major child abuse investigations which involve the publication of reports concern Madonna House and the west of Ireland farmer case.  The investigation into the operation of Madonna House was commissioned by the Religious Sisters of Charity.  As I have previously indicated to the House, I have received legal advice that substantial parts of the report of that investigation cannot be published without running a serious risk of committing grave contempt and defamation.  In accordance with the express wish of my colleague, the Minister for Health, and myself that as much as possible of that report should be published, a report on the investigation is being prepared by my Department.</P>
    <P>As regards the west of Ireland farmer case, I have been informed by the health board concerned that the work of the group established to review that board's involvement in the case has been suspended on legal advice pending the outcome of civil proceedings instituted by <Col N="69" /> the victims concerned.  Therefore no report has been completed in this case.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Health and I are extremely concerned about the difficulties impeding the publication of reports of inquiries into child abuse cases.  It has been our unequivocal position since we took up office that as much information as possible should be put into the public domain.  Above all, we are most anxious to avoid suggestions of a cover up in any case involving a health board or child care agency.</P>
    <P>There is sufficient experience at this stage to determine that the current format of inquiries into child abuse cases is unsatisfactory.  It has become increasingly clear that a change in the law is required to overcome the difficulties encountered in publishing recent reports of this nature.  It is for this reason we have decided to establish, on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social services within the Department of Health.  This is not the only initiative that needs to be taken and I will be making an announcement in due course on an additional range of measures.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that this inspectorate should have responsibility for quality assurance and audit of child care practice. It would be charged with undertaking inquiries on behalf of the Minister. It is our firm intention that the enabling legislation will provide for the privileged publication by the Minister of any report made to him by the proposed inspectorate.</P>
    <P>My primary objective is to ensure that all the lessons that can be learned from this and other unfortunate cases are taken on board and that our policies, priorities and management arrangements are influenced positively by these lessons, now and in the future.</P>

      <P>One specific part of my question asks if the Minister will seek the immediate publication of the full findings of these investigations. Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to this in his reply as he failed to do so in his initial answer.  Will he agree that, unless there is openness, transparency and accountability about the mistakes of the past in this area, there will never be a way to ensure that the genuine efforts of Members of this House and officials of various Departments and health boards to improve services will be successful and that the only way to ensure this happens is to foster and strengthen the principles of openness, transparency and accountability? Is he concerned that the inquiry chairman who gave so much of his time and did so much hard work has expressed grave concern publicly about the fact that the full report is not being published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made it clear that this is not my report, but that of the Western Health Board.  It was initiated by that board which selected the members of the inquiry team.  It has responsibility for its own report.  It took the decision, based on legal advice, not to publish.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether I agreed that openness, transparency and accountability were necessary if we were to come to terms with all these problems.  I hope the Minister and I have made it very clear that it is our wish that there should be the greatest degree of openness, transparency and accountability.  We have made it clear from the very beginning that we wish to see all these reports published and debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three reports are not ours, but as a result of this experience we now <Col N="71" /> intend to take action to try to ensure that in the future there will be openness and that these reports will be published. I cannot give any greater assurance to the House than that.  If it were possible for me and the Minister to publish these reports, we would most certainly do so.</P>
    <P>I have already stated my attitude to the report mentioned.  I have seen some comment in relation to the position of the chairman who has written asking if he can come to see me.  I replied immediately that my door most certainly will be open to him and that I will listen to any representations or anything else he wants to say to me.</P>

Are he and the Minister prepared, therefore, to overrule the decision of the Western Health Board not to publish this report and lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas so that it can be debated in full either in this House, the Seanad or the Select Committee on Social Affairs?

I have had discussions with my opposite number to ensure there will be no hiding place on this island.  The standard procedure is that the chief executive officer of the health board here would be informed.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has not answered the question on standard procedure.  When a child on <Col N="73" /> an &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; register in the UK comes to live here, do the health authorities follow a standard procedure?  The Minister of State indicated that a standard procedure is not followed and that only some type of willy-nilly procedure operates between health boards.  I am not on a witch-hunt against anybody.  I merely want to know the standard procedure &mdash; if there is one &mdash; set down by the Department in conjunction with health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Following the rejection of an earlier offer and subsequent intervention by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the nursing unions agreed to the request of the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission to defer a planned ballot on industrial action, to allow negotiations to proceed with a view to achieving an agreed negotiated settlement.  Negotiations recommenced, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, on Monday, 4 March 1996.</P>
      <P>The latest round of negotiations is being conducted on a confidential basis and is scheduled to conclude by Friday, 22 March 1996.  With commitment and goodwill on both sides, it should be possible to arrive at a mutually acceptable settlement.  That is the frame of mind in which both sides have entered the most recent set of negotiations and on this basis I am hopeful about settlement being reached within the agreed time-frame.</P>
      <P>Given the delicate balance to be struck in these negotiations, the Deputy will appreciate that any more detailed comments or statement by me would not be appropriate or helpful in bringing the talks to a successful conclusion.</P>

Is it intended to resume the talks on Monday next, the bank holiday, or will they take place on only Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week?  In his Ard-Fheis statement the Minister said he would be flexible in the nurses' dispute?  What did he mean by that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy knows, the talks are being carried out under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and facilitators are available to both sides.  The management side &mdash; my officials and other public service officials &mdash; with the <Col N="76" /> four nursing unions and the Labour Relations Commission, have set out a timetable which they believe is sufficient for negotiating.  I understand they met earlier this week and are meeting again on Friday.  They believe they have sufficient time to complete their work programme.</P>
      <P>At the Ard-Fheis I said I would approach this matter in a flexible and imaginative way.  Some of the nurses' grievances have arisen during the past 15 years but were impossible to address when bargaining was centralised in the past seven years.  Under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work's</i> 3 per cent clause it is possible to deal with outstanding matters.  Flexibility and imagination are required to ensure that one stays within the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> while at the same time devising strategies to meet grievances that have arisen over a long time.  It is not possible to simply import a solution that solved a problem in a different professional or public service sector.  While we can learn from some of the strategies adopted in the teachers' settlement they would not apply in this case.  Other measures need to be introduced to solve the nurses' dispute.  That is what I meant by flexibility and imagination.</P>

    <P>Each of the centres can be accessed by the board's social workers and community child care workers.  In the case of Parkview House, Sherrard House and Crosscare, two of the 14 beds in each centre are set aside for the exclusive use of the board's out-of-hours social work service.  In addition to residential places, the board also has 23 emergency carer families which care for adolescents in crisis.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, requires health boards to take such steps as are reasonable to make available suitable accommodation for homeless children up to 18 years.  Health boards are developing a range of options to enable them to discharge their responsibilities under this section. These include: emergency hostels and other forms of residential accommodation; day care programmes for adolescents who are currently homeless or at risk of being homeless; out-of-hours social work services targeted at homeless children; and special foster care services for out-of-home adolescents.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the problem of youth homelessness is mainly concentrated in the Eastern Health Board area.  One of the board's most recent initiatives in response to this problem has been the establishment of an emergency short-term care facility which can cater for up to 14 young people who are temporarily out of home or are awaiting a more long-term placement.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the 1995 child care action plan provided for a further range of important new child care developments including the provision of additional hostel and other residential places and an expansion of the board's out-of-hours social work service into a 24 hour crisis intervention service for all children.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Health Estimate for 1996 includes provision for a further investment of £5 million in the child care services.  This brings to £35 million on an annualised basis the total additional funding that has been provided for these services since 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> I am satisfied that these measures greatly strengthen the capacity of the health boards to provide appropriate accommodation and services for these vulnerable children.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, whom I thank for his comprehensive reply, said there are 50 emergency beds available for homeless children in the Dublin area and that the resources had been strengthened.  However, he did not say whether the resources are adequate. Is he aware that during the week the Goldenbridge affair was highlighted in a television programme Focus Point, street workers encountered 15 children between the ages of 12 and 17 who had nowhere to sleep?  Although it is not his fault, will the Minister of State accept responsibility for this problem?  Is he aware that homeless children are exposed not only to the elements but also to people who prey on their bodies in terms of prostitution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware but if this is the case then I very much regret it.  I agree that children in this position are very vulnerable and this is the reason we strengthened the resources. In the ordinary course of events, what we have done seems to be sufficient.  We do not encourage the placement of children in bed and breakfast accommodation as it is not an acceptable response to the problem of homelessness. However, in cases of emergency &mdash; and the 15 children to whom the Deputy referred are in this category &mdash; the Department has advised health boards to take immediate steps to secure appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for children.  Such accommodation could have been provided for the children to whom the Deputy referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

What preventive work &mdash; this should be undertaken together with the provision <Col N="80" /> of emergency places &mdash; is being carried out to ensure that children do not become homeless?  Will the Minister accept the importance of this work? Will he agree it is unacceptable in a modern and civilised society that children should have to sleep on pavements? Will he meet urgently with Focus Point to discuss its requirement for additional resources?</P>

      <P>It is unacceptable in a modern and civilised society that children should have to sleep on pavements. I am prepared to meet with any person or organisation with proposals which would eliminate this problem.</P>
      <P>On the timescale for the plans, the Health Estimate for 1996 includes provision for a further investment of £5 million in the childcare area.  Much money has been invested in this area since 1993 and the emphasis on it will continue.  We want to do everything possible to ensure that the number of children in this category is reduced.  The implementation by me of the provisions of the Child Care Act has gone a long way towards eliminating some of these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I wish to emphasise that individual patients' medical records are kept in hospitals and not in the Department of Health. My Department issued letters to all health boards and voluntary hospitals regarding access to medical records for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C on 31 May 1995, 26 June 1995 and 5 February 1996.  The hospitals and health boards have undertaken to make records available when requested once clearance has been received from the consultants and save only in cases where it is considered that it would cause serious harm to the patient's physical or mental health.  To date the hospitals have issued medical records on request and currently a number of requests for records are being processed.  I am not aware of a backlog in any hospital.</P>
      <P>Transfusion Positive have expressed concerns in relation to access to medical records.  My Department recently offered to give all necessary assistance to its members who were encountering difficulties in locating past medical records.  Transfusion Positive subsequently wrote to all of its members and details of eight persons who were encountering difficulties were forwarded recently to my Department.  My Department has made inquiries of the hospitals involved and will be in touch with Transfusion Positive in due course.</P>
      <P>Discovery orders have been made in two cases before the courts in relation to hepatitis C infection.  Every effort is being made to trace all relevant files in the Department of Health.  This exercise has not yet been completed and I am, therefore, not in a position to state if any relevant files are unavailable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The search is being conducted by officials in the Department of Health on the request of the High Court.  I wish to distinguish between the two types of records.  The first type of record establishes at hospital level the connection between infected blood product or infected blood and hepatitis C.  In the case of members of Positive Action, these records are readily available because the screening process, which covered more than 58,000 women, established the connection.  In the case of members who received infected blood rather than infected blood product, we have had discussions with Positive Action who have indicated that eight members are experiencing difficulty in establishing records of blood transfusions.</P>
      <P>The other type of record is completely different and there are cases before the High Court &mdash; reference was recently made to one case.  In the course of the proceedings in the High Court a discovery of documents order was secured and this has led to the search in the Department of Health.  The search, which goes back as far as the 1950s and 1960s, is ongoing.  I know some of the records are in Hawkins House and some may also be in O'Connell Bridge House.  We are doing everything in our power to comply with the legal obligations to provide the documentation. However, it is not central to the issue which is frequently debated in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compensation tribunal wrote to the Irish Kidney Association and to Transfusion Positive in response to concerns expressed by both groups about medical records from hospitals and the BTSB.  The tribunal informed both groups that it made awards where the claimant had received a blood product but was not in a position to match the blood given, to a batch supplied by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The tribunal also advises that medical reports submitted to the tribunal should, in cases of doubt, deal with the <Col N="83" /> exclusion of other possible causes of the condition.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is familiar with this issue. The onus of proof required at the tribunal is the balance of probability that one got hepatitis C from blood or blood products.  However, the tribunal is not rejecting people who cannot establish a written record to make the connection and it has made awards where such a document was not available to make the link.  I understand the Deputy is aware that members of Transfusion Positive are pleased with that statement of practice by the tribunal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is at least one case in which a woman got the Anti-D product in 1993 and 1994.  A set of files is available for one year during which the virus or infection did not occur.  However, a set of files for the other year, during which her medical people think the infection <Col N="84" /> occurred, is not available.  There is a problem for some people who got Anti-D products.  Is there a problem as regards hepatitis C victims getting batch cards from the Blood Transfusion Service Board?</P>
    <P>What is the connection between Mr. Bill O'Herlihy's publicity company and the tribunal or the firm of solicitors representing victims before the tribunal? The Minister might be able to confirm or deny if there is a direct link between that PR company and the tribunal or between it and the firm of solicitors. There seems to be publicity surrounding the tribunal at present, something the Minister assured us would not happen. He also assured us that the people are entitled to privacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I cannot give legal advice at any time in the House.  If anyone has difficulty finding records they need to pursue a case before the tribunal or the courts, it is the Department's policy to do everything possible to find them.  Where those records are unavailable, the tribunal has issued a practice statement indicating it will be prepared to take a lesser level of evidence and adjudicate on the balance of probabilities that a person had contracted hepatitis C from infected blood or blood products, although there was no documentary evidence of that.  The tribunal has made awards without that documentary link.</P>
      <P>I do not know the answer to the question about batch cards.  However, I have instructed the health boards, hospitals and the BTSB to supply everything required.  If the Deputy has an individual query in this regard, perhaps she could raise it with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the first time I have heard Bill O'Herlihy's public relations company mentioned.  Drury Communications are the PR consultants for the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  They were employed when I became Minister and I decided to continue their contract because they seemed to be doing a reasonably good job.  I would be amazed <Col N="85" /> if the tribunal employed a company of that nature.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that when a big award like £251,000 was made it would attract a great deal of publicity.  As I understand it, one solicitor, who block booked the tribunal in the early weeks of the hearings, has the permission of his clients to state the amount of awards, but he is not revealing their identity.  I have not communicated with him because I do not know him.  He indicated on the first day of the tribunal that three awards were made and he specified some information about them. On the second day of the tribunal he gave the amount of the award for one, but in today's newspapers he states he does not have the permission of his clients to reveal either the amount or the identity.  There is not a contrived publicity campaign; this is only a solicitor giving interviews with the permission of his clients after the hearings. Information is not coming from my Department or from the tribunal about any individual case.  I reaffirm that as far as I am concerned everything will be conducted privately and confidentially and information will only be revealed if the clients or their legal representatives do so.  It will not be done on a third party basis.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;or a person with legal qualifications, she <Col N="86" /> should know what search means in the legal context.  This search is taking place on the direction of the High Court.  It is not just a simple thing of finding a particular file.  The people involved are working overtime to go through the files to see if there is a relevant document because the instruction is to produce a relevant document.  There is nothing untoward happening; it is a normal search on the instruction of the High Court.  A great deal of material must be examined and that work is progressing. I do not know if everything will be found but there are no indications so far of a difficulty.</P>
      <P>As I said in my initial reply, we had correspondence and meetings with Transfusion Positive.  We offered help if there was a difficulty in establishing documentary evidence of the link between infection and the blood received.  We received a reply stating that eight persons were having difficulties. The Department is now trying to establish that documentary evidence. The tribunal has taken this matter up independently of me and has indicated that, as far as it is concerned, the balance of probability does not mean that documentary evidence must be available in all cases.  It has made awards where the documentary evidence was not available to establish the link because the onus of proof required is the balance of probability.</P>
      <P>They have advised that medical reports submitted to the tribunal should, in cases of doubt, deal with the exclusion of other possible causes for the contracting of the condition of hepatitis C. Deputies will see the relevance of that to the proofs required.  The best I can do is to supply copies of the two letters of practice which the tribunal has issued which deal with this matter and other matters which are relevant to the members of Positive Action.  I would like the House to have the fullest information on these matters.</P>

      <P>The Minister said at the Ard-Fheis that an accord was close, meaning an accord between himself and those infected with hepatitis C from both groups, Transfusion Positive and Positive Action, who have concerns about the long-term fairness of the compensation tribunal.  Everyone in this House, certainly on this side, shares that concern.  What did the Minister mean by saying that an accord was close?  There is a particularly sensitive outstanding issue, that is, the power of the tribunal to compel witnesses to attend, which has been a sore point with both groups representing hepatitis C victims.  Does the Minister intend to give that power to the tribunal or is the tribunal prepared to take that power unto itself?  The Minister said on 8 February last that as soon as some very large awards were made by the tribunal there would be a rush of applications to it.  Can he indicate how many more applications have <Col N="88" /> been made to the tribunal since the one large award was announced less than a week ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Before any large award was announced the number of applicants had risen to over 200.  I do not know what rush has occurred since.  The word was only out in yesterday's papers.  The tribunal is independent and I do not keep in day-to-day contact with it.  Applications are coming in, as one would expect.  As additional evidence is required to back up claims, it is clear there will not be a rush because the forms have to be filled in by solicitors and the kind of evidence we have just been talking about must be obtained.</P>
      <P>Regarding what I said at the Árd-Fheis, I would very much like if Positive Action were fully satisfied with the terms of the tribunal.  It is a fair and just tribunal presided over by excellent people under the former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice Egan.  Many of the fears of members of Positive Action arise from a misconception about how the tribunal will conduct its affairs.  I have been communicating with the registrar of the tribunal to get him to clarify procedures.  He has already clarified that each applicant will be allowed to give evidence before the tribunal and a number of other matters, thus narrowing the information gap.</P>
      <P>The solicitor to which the Deputy referred in terms of publicity said in one interview he thinks that the question of provisional awards, for example, will be conducted on the basis that they will be available on application.  I can give assurances that the provisional award will be communicated in writing and will have a contractual legal base to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many outstanding items that were causing concern are being addressed as the tribunal clarifies its procedures.  In due course I will be seeking further clarification from the registrar of the tribunal about items on which Positive Action would like clarification.  Effectively what it comes down to is whether <Col N="89" /> the practice statements issued by the tribunal will allay concerns.  I believe they will.  I believe and hope the tribunal will work very well because persons infected by hepatitis C have enough stress in their lives without having further stress because of this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know how big or small the awards will be.  Individual cases vary, but the level of compensation will be measured in the same way as it would be measured before the High Court.  I have been asked if £60 million is sufficient. I am on record as saying that that was simply the budget provided on our best guesstimate for 1996 but that we expect the tribunal to go into 1997. It was never intended that £60 million would be the charge on the Exchequer; it is the 1996 charge on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Whatever about past deficiencies in terms of record keeping, which can now be minimised in relation to the subjective needs of the persons going before the tribunal by way of a practice statement, can the Minister assure the House that the procedures in place are optimal in relation to transfusions which may be given today or tomorrow in the current system of hospital care?  Can the Minister assure the House that there has been every possible improvement in record keeping and administration in relation to blood products to restore very bruised confidence in the blood product which is in use currently in the State?  Does the Minister accept that it is vitally important to learn from the past and to ensure the greatest degree of confidence in the current system of giving, taking and storing blood among members of the public who are receiving blood transfusions?  Will he assure the House that new standards have been put in place?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Whatever the criticisms of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, its records were accurate.  They stood up to real scrutiny when one had to trace a donation of blood through different transfusions <Col N="90" /> given.  We thought initially there might have been some inadequacy in the hospitals, but when we probed the matter most of the hospitals came up with full records.  I have only been notified of eight people encountering difficulty, and we are working on those to see whether the difficulties are owing to absence of records or lack of co-operation.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Blood Transfusion Service Board itself, the Bain consultancy dealt with many of these issues.  Deputies may have read in the newspapers that Mr. Liam Dunbar, who was acting in a temporary capacity, has now been appointed chief executive, and that Mr. Sean McCann, who was acting in a temporary capacity as chief medical officer, has become the professor of haematology in Trinity College. His post will be vacant and we will be putting in a full-time professional haematologist as soon as we can recruit an appropriate person.  Such upgrading and reform is ongoing.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board recently had difficulty with blood supply because of what they thought initially were defective bags.  It transpired that the bags were not defective, but there was a great rally by donors.  There is huge donor confidence again and very high recipient confidence.  It is essential to maintain an adequate blood supply if we are to operate an effective health service.</P>

As I stated in reply to Deputy McDaid one can apply in respect of a <Col N="91" /> dependant.  It is a non-statutory tribunal and if any anomaly, inequity or unfairness arises the terms of reference can be changed by referring them to Government.  I do not want to exclude anyone who has a legitimate claim.  If legitimate applicants are being excluded we will change the terms of reference in due course.  The big advantage of the arrangement is that it can be tailored to meet legitimate cases as time goes by. As it is not embedded in Statute I do not need amending legislation to change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Minister for Health and I have decided to establish, on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social services in the Department of Health.  The inspectorate will, <i>inter alia</i>, be responsible for quality assurance and audit of child care practice and will undertake inquiries on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991, responsibility for monitoring standards in children's residential centres rests with the relevant health boards in the case of centres operated by voluntary bodies while responsibility for monitoring standards in centres run by health boards rests with the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social services inspectorate will be associated with the Department of Health which is also the approach which has been taken in Northern Ireland.  I <Col N="92" /> intend to ensure that the inspectorate is sufficiently empowered to perform its task in an effective and efficient manner. My intention is that the proposed inspectorate will function with at least the same degree of independence as the inspector of mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the Focus Ireland study on residential child care published recently recommended that a national child care authority be established with statutory powers.  It is not true to say that I have not met representatives of Focus Ireland, I met them on this issue on 21 February.  At that meeting I explained in some detail why the establishment of a national child care authority is not currently justified.  I also outlined my thinking on this issue in my opening address to the Focus Ireland conference on 5 March.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the establishment of a national child care authority is justified having regard to the substantial progress being achieved in the development and implementation of national policy on child care services.</P>
    <P>First, 61 of the 79 sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, are now in force including the key provisions of Parts III to VI of the legislation which deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  The implementation of these provisions involved three sets of new regulations in relation to the placement by health boards of children in residential care, foster care and with relatives.  The regulations require health boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis than before.  The remaining 18 sections of the Act are to be brought into operation by the end of this year including Part VIII which relates to the registration of children's residential centres.  The Child Care Act represents a major reform of the law on the care of children.</P>
    <P>Second, the report, in calling for a national child care authority, failed to take account of the impact of my co-ordinating role as Minister of State at <Col N="93" /> the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  Powers have been formally delegated to me in these Departments for the co-ordination of policy and services on child protection, young homeless, truancy and juvenile justice.  One of my first initiatives on taking up office was to establish a co-ordinating committee representative of senior officials of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.</P>
    <P>Tangible evidence that this co-ordination mechanism has been successful is illustrated by the fact that agreement has been reached on a draft scheme of the Juvenile Justice Bill.  This Bill was the subject of intensive debate between the three Departments involved because of disagreement on core issues which would not have been resolved so easily if my office did not exist.  The Bill is currently with the parliamentary draftsman and I am pleased to report it should be published well before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Education, I have also attached particular importance to addressing the problem of school truancy and legislation to deal with this problem is currently at an advanced state of preparation.</P>
    <P>Third, as already mentioned, a social services inspectorate will be established and this will have major implications for the implementation of child care policy, including the development of national guidelines and codes of good practice.</P>
    <P>In view of the substantial progress that has been made, much of it due to my co-ordinating role as Minister of State, I have come to the conclusion that the establishment of a national child care authority is not currently justified. It is only if existing structures fail that an alternative structure such as an authority might be contemplated. However, I note that it was recommended that a national child care authority should, <i>inter alia</i>, have a research function.  I am aware of the lack of research on child care policy in this country at present.  I have a particular interest in promoting research and will <Col N="94" /> announce a number of initiatives in this regard later this year.</P>

      <P>I understand Sr. Stan requested a meeting with the Minister for Health.  That was driven by the absolute frustration at the lack of progress following Focus Ireland's meeting with the Minister of State.  Perhaps he might arrange to meet Focus Ireland.  Why has the Minister set his face against an independent inspectorate? I am disappointed that he has decided to locate it within the Department. With the best will in the world the public perception will be that it is not independent.</P>

My officials were present over the course of the two day conference and explained my position on the matters mentioned.  At the end of the conference our positions were understood.</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure that the inspectorate is sufficiently empowered to perform its task in an effective and efficient manner.  The proposed inspectorate will function with the same degree of independence as the inspector of mental hospitals.  Its independence to carry out the task it has been set has not been called into question.  It has been successful. It is quite a good model and if we can improve on it we most certainly will.</P>

Does he accept that as long as there is no <Col N="95" /> national child care authority or independent inspectorate outside the remit of the Department that will continue to be the case and people will not have confidence in relation to the child care area?

Will it be able to discipline persons who are found to have breached their duty and to fire such persons?  Will the situation be different in future?

If it was urgent in October it is more urgent now.  This urgently needed legislation will be passed with the support of all sides of the House.  What is the timescale for its introduction?  Does he agree that in the interests of protecting children it is not morally possible to postpone this legislation?</P>

      <P>No time will be lost in bringing this inspectorate into being but we have to do so in a way which will achieve the stated purpose, that is that the reports of such an inspectorate will be available to the public and will be presented in such a form that there will not be the threat of legal action which has prevented the publication of the three reports we discussed earlier.  That means that the reports will have to be privileged.  Problems have arisen with that in the past.  The problems go back as far as to the 1970s on the question of the privilege of committees of this <Col N="97" /> House.  It is our determination that the reports will be privileged and that we will avoid the frustrations of the past.</P>

      <P>I asked earlier whether it was possible for the Minister or Minister of State to overrule the decision of the Western Health Board and to publish in this House the Kelly Fitzgerald report.  The Minister of State seemed to indicate that it was not possible to do so, but while he was on his feet the Minister was shaking his head vigorously.  Has the Minister the power to overrule the Western Health Board and go ahead with the publication under privilege of this report where there is no danger of a legal threat?  If that is the case will the Minister please publish it? Second, the Minister of State stated in October that he was consulting the Attorney General urgently on this matter but I do not think the passage of five months indicates any sense of urgency.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without <Col N="99" /> undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers. A working group has been established by the chief executive officers to examine the manner in which eligibility for medical cards is determined in each board and to make recommendations as to how procedures might be improved in the interests of efficiency and service to the public.  The question of travelling expenses incurred in travelling to work is among the matters being considered by the group.  It is expected the group will have completed its report shortly.</P>
      <P>I will keep in mind Deputy Deasy's views on travelling expenses.  Under the general guidelines costs over £13.50 per week are reckonable for an allowance covering expenses incurred in travelling to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for indicating the matter is being examined. It seems punitive that a person who may incur costs of £30 to £40 per week in travelling to work is allowed only £13 travelling expenses.  Some people find that a disincentive to work.  I am sure we all know of people who have given up jobs because the fringe benefits are better if they choose to stay on the dole instead of incurring this type of expense which cannot be fully recouped.  Will the Minister issue instructions to the health boards that the guidelines should be more flexible and ask them to change them to enable people who can vouch <Col N="100" /> for their expenses to claim the full amount?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I will take account of what the Deputy said when I consider the report of the chief executive officers on revising eligibility for medical cards.  The amount of travelling expenses over £13.50 may be claimed.  If a person incurs travelling expenses of £40, he or she may claim an allowance of £26.50.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all five Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>As a result of the need to balance production with demand, Apple Computer in Cork has laid off 70 temporary workers.  Separately, Apple Computer Incorporated has announced in recent months its intention to lay off 1,300 of its 14,000 employees as part of a rationalisation programme.  This rationalisation programme has not to date affected Apple's facility in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> As I indicated to the House, I am in constant touch with the situation in Apple and continue to review the question of meeting Apple's US management. In this regard, I assure the House I am anxious to respond in whatever way would best assist Apple in Cork. Some time ago I arranged to visit Apple management in Cork and this meeting will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>The Apple facility in Cork has progressively strengthened its competitiveness and, with the help of IDA Ireland, has added additional functions in the areas of software, quality assurance and research and development to its operations.  These undoubtedly will be positive factors in any assessment of the future role of Apple's facility in Cork.</P>
    <P>Mitsumi Ireland Limited has been in operation in Mallow since November 1990.  The company manufactures computer keyboards and distributes floppy disk drives and CD-ROM units.  Due to price competition the market for the company's keyboard products had declined.  As a result the company has decided to make 82 people redundant over the next three months.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland will continue to work with Mitsumi Ireland with a view to maximising employment at the Irish operation.  IDA Ireland and Forbairt will continue to support the electronics sector in Cork with a view to maximising employment in the sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister will soon meet the management of Apple Computer in Cork.  As he said, 70 temporary jobs have been lost.  There are about 1,200 jobs dependent on the continued employment of that workforce.  The Minister set up a special early warning unit in the Department when problems arose with Packard recently.  Did officials in that unit contact Apple headquarters or any of its service industries to enable early action be taken in the event of job losses or job shedding in the Apple plant or other plants that serve it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The early warning mechanism in the case of Apple would be primarily the IDA.  Perhaps what the Deputy is referring to is a group in the Department which is working on industrial adaptation and which is primarily aimed at smaller companies trying to reposition themselves in the market, not at large companies of the scale of Apple.  I have been in very regular contact with the IDA with a view to finding the best way for Ireland to be supportive of Apple.  One must be very sensitive to the advice of the IDA, which is at the front line in this field, and I am ready to act on that advice at all times.  I will meet with Apple management in the very near future so as to be fully appraised of its view.  The IDA is the key adviser in terms of early warning and will stand ready, as it has done in the past, to assist Apple in its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is time he adopted a hands-on approach to the issue?  While accepting the very important advisory role of IDA Ireland in the future of the Apple computer company and the electronics industry generally, given international speculation on Apple does the Minister agree that rather than simply reviewing whether he should meet with worldwide management, he should be proactive in that regard?  Does he agree he should personally intervene to seek a medium to long-term strategic approach to the future of the electronics industry in the Cork region, given its incredible importance to the employment infrastructure of that region?  A pyramid structure is being built up in a number of industrial estates of which that industry forms a core part.  Everybody in Cork is aware of the downstream impact of difficulties in this sector, which justifies a proactive, hands-on interventionist approach by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that not only am I taking IDA advice in this matter but I will also take the advice of local management.  I will be <Col N="104" /> available to do whatever is necessary to assist Apple in ensuring that what is a quality performing plant with additional strengths in software and research and development will remain a key player in this area.  No decision has been taken by the company on future strategic plans. The Deputy will accept it would be foolhardy for a Minister to act in a way that is not in tenor with the approach and strategic thinking of local management and the IDA on when it is timely and in what way to assist.  While I share the Deputy's anxiety about being active in every way, I will be active in a prudent way, taking account of the best advice from local management and the IDA on the steps I should take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Prudence is one thing, bolting the door when the horse has gone is another.  Two months ago during Question Time I asked the Minister if he would meet Apple here and in the United States.  He now says that he hopes to meet that company in the near future, but that is not good enough. There were early warning signs in this case.  I am very conscious that the Cork Deputies have the most rightful say in this matter but, since my portfolio is Enterprise and Employment, I am concerned about this matter.  I hope that the early warning signals we are all receiving do not come true.  I fault the Minister for not being more active in this regard.  I accept he must take advice, but there is a clear signal that something is wrong and he should do something about the matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to Mitsumi, something has obviously gone very wrong.  As a result of its decision, half of its workforce will have been let go in five years.  Will the Minister say what meetings he has had with that company and what measures are being put in place by the employment protection unit of the Department to offset this catastrophe &mdash; the loss of 70 jobs in a town the size of Mallow is a catastrophe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo the views of my colleague, Deputy Martin.  The electronics industry has been hyped up beyond expectations, <Col N="105" /> with a resulting downturn in terms of redundancies.  The very valued role of the electronics industry must be considered in a common sense way rather than a way of attracting more companies only to find after a short time that they have come adrift.  That industry should be considered not in terms of immediate short-term gains, with glitzy announcements, but in a longer term strategic way, with a view to achieving permanent jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the perception is that the electronics industry is hyped up &mdash; it is very much the buzz industry at present &mdash; one must be aware that this is an area with very good core skills and competitive strength, and our strategy must be to increase that competitiveness. It is instructive that in the case of Apple, for instance, we have been very successful in terms of research and development and attracting strategic elements of the electronics sector to locate in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Inevitably in an industry such as this which changes so rapidly there will be casualties.  The difficulty with Mitsumi is that its product, keyboard manufacturing, is no longer cost competitive with some of its competitors in the Far East. In reviewing the electronics sector we must ensure we are well placed.  Mitsumi plans to develop further the distribution end of its business so that it will not only secure the remaining jobs but build a stronger base for that aspect of its activity.  It is inevitable in an industry such as this that at times certain elements will experience difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lay-off of 70 people at Apple, is in no way linked to the strategic restructuring being considered by Apple senior management.  The lay-off of long-term temporary staff is related to a downturn in the speed of growth in the market, and Apple has assessed that its inventory levels are sufficient to meet forthcoming market demand.  There has been a slight deceleration in the pace of growth in this as in other areas, but growth is still enormous in this sector. The lay-offs in no way signal problems <Col N="106" /> for Apple in terms of the quality of production or capabilities of the plant in Cork in the long-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had any discussions with Mitsumi at international as well as local level because the company has been experiencing this problem for quite some time past?  As product development is the key to the maintenance of multinationals here, what are his Department's plans in this area?  It is obvious from the lack of product development in the Minister's Department that its industrial policy is a shambles, especially in the electronics and computer sector.  Will the Minister spell out his departmental policy for product development to save the multinational segment of our computer industry?</P>

      <P>None of those companies is laying off workers but recruiting and expanding on the basis of the very best technology.  Equally, within the Irish owned electronic sector, some of our software companies have been outstanding in developing product and many have formed strategic partnerships to develop Irish-based and developed product to be sold internationally. Therefore, the Deputy's criticism is wide of the mark.  Because of its vibrancy and capability of producing strong new products for the future, our electronics sector is the envy of very many countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>Will the Minister state whether, within the terms of the operational programme for which some £22 million were allocated to cater for industrial readjustment and early warnings systems of impending problems within the industry, in the case of Mitsumi if the IDA or the Minister's Department had any dealings with the company or made any funds available to assist it?  I find it very strange that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, had nothing to say on this matter, especially since his colleague in Mallow, so vociferous over many years, had nothing to say about the overall reduction in jobs in Mallow and the Cork East constituency.  The Minister should convey that message to his Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Michael Ahern that the Minister of State is part of a very effective team working within our Department but he does not have responsibility for the specific questions tabled.  Indeed, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be the first to tell him to desist from speaking on such an issue.  Nonetheless I assure Members opposite that the Minister of State shares my concern for the development of a strong industrial base in Cork in which there were significant recent developments, one in Youghal, demonstrating our strong commitment to Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> I also assure the Deputy that the IDA has been working with Mitsumi to ensure that any assistence that can be given will be made available.  In this instance the difficulty is that the company assessed its position and decided that the particular product line in which they have been engaging is no longer competitive in the market place.  We are not in a position to contradict its assessment. The company knows the commitment and support of the IDA will continue throughout its future operations within which we foresee its capacity to develop further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall on the occasion of the Minister's visit to the plant there was an announcement of some 600 additional jobs, demonstrating how the position has changed within a very short period.  Since the Apple plant at Holly Hill represents a crucial part of the industrial life of Cork city, particularly on its north side &mdash; which has suffered more than most communities from the scourge of unemployment &mdash; it is vital that everything is done to ensure its short and long-term future.  I assure the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues of my full suport in so doing.  In addition to putting the full weight of the State job creation agencies behind the Apple plant, it is important that the company is given every opportunity to win its fair share of the computer market, especially from State and semi-State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a number of parliamentary questions recently to various Government Ministers on the level of business given to this company by the State.  The replies I have received to date, from the Departments of Finance and Education, do not indicate a high level of State purchases from Apple, further emphasising the importance of Apple winning its fair share of future State business in computer supplies.  While the net value of such purchases may not be huge in international terms, such State business would substantially reinforce a message of support for Apple.  I stress that point since Apple did not feature recently <Col N="109" /> within the top ten computer companies. I tabled similar parliamentary questions to other Ministers but have been given no reason to be confident in relation to them.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to become directly involved in Apple as there is no point in waiting until the horse has bolted before closing the stable door.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Wallace that I shall not be in any way dilatory in taking appropriate action but I want to be sure that whatever I do will be helpful to the company.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of public bodies purchasing products from Apple. I have been briefed in that respect but I know that public bodies operate fair contracting systems and would examine all companies that tender fairly.  Indeed the very many Irish-based companies that tender is evidence of the success of our electronics sector.  Because Apple produces such quality products, I am sure it will be given equal opportunity, particularly in the case of its new development activities beyond its traditional manufacturing one.  I am totally committed to working with Apple to secure its future.</P>

      <P>It appears that the Minister received an early warning in relation to difficulties at Apple, which he did not heed.  Since there have been layoffs at the plant recently, can the Minister understand workers' fears of further redundancies, bearing in mind especially that, when it came to Hewlett Packard, any microphone or television camera available to the Minister and his Minister of State was availed of to announce good news?  I envisage those workers now saying that when such favourable events took place in the backyard of the Minister or Minister of State, they were not slow in coming forward. Does the Minister agree it is inexcusable for him to say today that he will endeavour to arrange a meeting with <Col N="110" /> the Cork management of Apple, especially since he would have known of impending difficulties at that plant for some considerable time past?  He neglected to take any action to stave off difficulties within that extremely important industry and any reduction in its workforce would have massive consequences for the city of Cork.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Dan Wallace said here is also important because, at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, Members ascertained that in the Valuation Office £800,000, almost £1 million, worth of high-tech computer equipment was sourced from the United Kingdom and the USA.  Sourcing of equipment is part and parcel of many decisions to locate in such countries.  In the interests of the people of Cork and the workers in this company, the Minister should meet the firm's international management while he is on his travels over St. Patrick's weekend to ensure these jobs are saved.</P>

      <P>The two companies are not related.  Hewlett Packard is in the electronics sector and Packard Electric is in the harness sector.  Their difficulties are unrelated.  The latter's problem was essentially one of industrial relations when we were actively involved with it.  Apple's problem is not related to its restructuring plans.  The early warning is in relation to restructuring and there is concern that as Apple reassesses its position we must ensure that its strong plant in Cork is successfully protected.  The present lay offs are related to an inventory build-up within Apple.  A slower pace of growth in the market than the company anticipated is behind the present problem.  There is a slight blip in the pace of growth in this sector, with which other companies have <Col N="111" /> also had to deal.  I assure the Deputy I will meet with local management.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Currency fluctuations affect means tested pensions.  Thousands of people here are in receipt of UK pensions.  The rate of these pensions is not as much as the maximum rate of Irish non-contributory pensions and thousands of pensioners receive top-ups because of this.  Currency fluctuations often change from day to day but at present we are operating as if the Irish pound is worth approximately 92p or 93p sterling whereas IR£1.03 or IR£1.04 is needed to buy one Irish pound.  People are being put at a huge disadvantage because of this.  This has been the situation for several months.  Parity was reached in 1995.  Currency fluctuations are addressed in November but this does not take into account the reality of <Col N="200" /> today.  British pensioners living here are at a serious disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister should urgently look at this and put in place a new system which will be more responsive to currency fluctuations between the Irish pound and sterling.  People who watch the money markets say that the value of the Irish pound will stay ahead of sterling for the foreseeable future due to economic performance and confidence.  The Department should pay pensions on the basis of the Irish pound's present value against sterling, which will probably remain the same for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a new system of disregards under unemployment assistance which provides an incentive for people to return to work.  Since 1972 or 1973 there has been a disregard system for old age pensioners and this has not been changed since.  The first £7 of income is disregarded before the means test applies.  That disregard figure should be increased to take account of the cost of living increases in the interim since its introduction.  The Minister might consider giving pensioners on a non-contributory old age pension an increase of perhaps £5 per week.  I acknowledge that we must be aware of the cost implication but there have not been any increases in old age pensions above the cost of living increase in recent years.  It would be a gesture to pensioners if we were to seriously examine the question of the disregard.  I said earlier that the disregard system now being introduced does not necessarily apply to small farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance or, as it is sometimes called, small farmers' assistance but what I am referring to now is distinctly different.</P>
    <P>I do not wish my contribution to be a tissue of complaints but I am raising questions about the system which have been brought to my attention and which need to be addressed.  Widows under the age of 66 whose husbands qualified for free electricity and telephone allowances before their deaths have had the allowance restored in some cases.</P>
    <P>Widows under the age of 66 do not <Col N="201" /> qualify for allowances such as the living alone allowance.  A living alone allowance should be introduced for widows under 66 years of age.  Perhaps we could start by stipulating that it would not be paid until the woman was, say, 56 years of age.  The current supplement of £4 for old age pensioners is quite generous and justice demands that it be given to this category of widow who lives alone and who may find it extremely difficult to make ends meet on the fixed income of a widow's pension.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to take on board the points I made in relation to the problems I and other Deputies find in the system when doing our constituency work.  It would not cost any money to address some of those problems and they should be addressed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister when he was in Opposition, we expected more radical reform and a greater emphasis on the work ethic.</P>
      <P>The PRSI employers' contributions were reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent, that is £20 in every £10,000. We were then told by the Minister that we should be happy with the Bill for social welfare this year.  Where is the radical reform we were promised?  It would be much better to target the available money on some specific area rather than tinkering with the system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the disability allowance which was a long time in gestation.  In his contribution last night the Minister referred to this as a major step forward but it is not.  He is merely transferring the responsibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance from one Department to another, and that is not a major step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for administering this allowance should lie with the Department of Social Welfare; I recommended that when I was Minister for Health.  It fits neatly into the social welfare system.  Under the section dealing with disabled person's maintenance allowance, the State will not pay this allowance to people in institutions. Am I right in assuming that persons residing in an institution who are not <Col N="203" /> supported by the State will be entitled to receive the allowance?  That would have serious implications for many institutions such as convents, where there are elderly nuns.  It is vitally important that they be entitled to this allowance if they are under the age of 66 and not receiving an old age pension or any other support from the State.  I understand persons in nursing homes are treated similarly to those in any long stay institution.  Section 16 deals with the commencement order.  I would like to know when it is intended to introduce this allowance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new appeals system for supplementary welfare allowance.  That system will only deal with rent allowances and other supplements and not cases of exceptional need, but appeals are frequently necessary in such cases. Decisions on supplementary welfare allowance often depend on the community welfare officer and there seems to be a lack of consistency in how that scheme is applied.  Will the Minister ensure there is some mechanism whereby people who need money urgently and who have been refused it by the community welfare officer can gain quick access to a proper appeals system.  It is necessary to expedite the appeals mechanism in regard to all claims.</P>
      <P>I welcome the development of the household budget scheme initiated by Deputy Michael Woods.  The scheme is working effectively and I compliment the Department and the officers who are implementing it.  I also welcome the new provision for credits for homemakers to ensure that women particularly will be entitled to credits in assessing their claim to pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to read the small print to see how the new one-parent family allowance will work in practice.  One of the difficulties &mdash; and the Minister identified it last night &mdash; is that women under 40 years of age who do not qualify for an allowance, because they have no children, would qualify at present for an allowance when they are over 40 <Col N="204" /> years of age.  Under the new arrangement that will not happen.  The Minister is making provision for women between the ages of 38 and 40 so that they will benefit when the time comes.  What will be the position of women between the ages of, say, 35 and 38 years of age who, presumably, will not benefit?  It is a retrograde step to introduce a scheme that will disadvantage people who might otherwise have expected it to be to their advantage.  The real issue in regard to the one-parent family allowance is the number of one-parent families.  The women I see with two, three or four children who do not have a constant income &mdash; perhaps the court in a settlement allocates a maintenance allowance to them from their husband &mdash; are either paid the maintenance intermittently by the husband or he does not pay.  The obligation appears to be on the lone parent to pursue the husband for that maintenance.  It is totally unrealistic to ask a woman with two or three children, who has no income of her own &mdash; or even maintenance income &mdash; to pursue her husband for maintenance.  The State must seriously address that issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to see &mdash; I do not know how practical it may be &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare pay the one-parent family allowance to the woman and her children and pursue her husband.  It is unrealistic to expect a woman with no income to go to court and pursue her husband.  An issue that needs to be addressed is the unfortunate women with a number of children who does not have a regular weekly income.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement of the 5 per cent increase in the carer's allowance. This excellent scheme, which recognises the role of carers of the elderly, was introduced by Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare. Despite improvements over the years the scheme still has one major anomaly, that people who look after the heavily dependent are not eligible for the carer's allowance if they do not qualify under the means test.  For people who are caring for persons in need of full-time care and attention, the means <Col N="205" /> test should be examined with a view to a larger sum being disregarded.  There are many instances where a wife, whose husband happens to earn a little more than the entitlement, does not qualify even though she may have to stay in the house 24 hours a day with, perhaps, a person who is bedridden, recovering from a stroke, while her neighbour, who is looking after an elderly person who is able to move around the house and look after himself or herself to a large extent, qualifies.  The carer who is looking after the heavily dependent person is ruled out because of the means test.  That issue should be addressed and a much larger sum should be disregarded depending on the dependency of the person being cared for.  There is a precedent under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act where a larger allocation can be given to the nursing home depending on the degree of dependency of the person being looked after.  There is a good case to be made for disregarding a large amount of money for people caring for the heavily dependent.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Social Welfare, Health and the Environment should come together with a view to catering for the needs of the elderly in future. Because of the reduced number of births from over 74,000 in 1980 to 47,000 last year there will be a major increase in the number of elderly in society in the years to come.  Now is the time to address how to care for them.  Ideally people like to live in their own homes and, if not, they like to live in their own community.  The three aforementioned Departments should come together because they have a key role to play. They do not always play their role in tandem.  There is not the degree of coordination and co-operation one would like to see, for example, between the local authorities and the agencies of the Department of the Environment and the health boards, in regard to the care of the elderly.  Through the carer's allowance the Department of Social Welfare has a key role to play.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the assessment of applicants for non-contributory old <Col N="206" /> age pension should be reviewed.  I raised that matter here by means of parliamentary questions with the Minister on a number of occasions during the past year.  There are a number of aspects to it.  There is a notional assessment that money in savings yields 10 per cent of an income.  Everyone in this House knows that is not so.  The other aspect in which the Department should interest itself is the behaviour of the banks.  If an elderly person sells a farm and lodges the money, invariably it will be put in a demand account and they will end up with less than 1 per cent interest.</P>
    <P>I had an experience where a man who had £60,000 came to me with a view to appealing the refusal of an old age pension. He had been assessed by the Department of Social Welfare on its notional assessment as having £6,000.  I accepted that he would not have £6,000 but suggested he might have £3,000 which would leave him somewhere near qualifying for the non-contributory old age pension.  He told me he did not have that amount.  I asked him to get a certificate of interest from the bank and this came to £345.  The State and the Department of Social Welfare must interest themselves in that aspect of the income of the elderly, particularly when they apply for a non-contributory old age pension.  It is usual for the banks to treat the elderly in that way, to put their money in a demand account, without discussing with them the benefit of putting it in a deposit account and earning higher interest.  The Department must ascertain people's income rather than a notional assessment that perhaps rules them out for an income and leaves them below the breadline.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement in the budget that there would be an £800 tax relief for old age pensioners who installed an alarm system.  Interestingly, the only constituency I can think of where that might be of any benefit would be the Minister for Finance's constituency in Dublin 4.  Certainly it would not have any application in Deputy Byrne's constituency or in mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would not have any application since the old age pensioners would not be paying tax in the part of the country from which Deputy Nealon and I come.</P>
      <P>The Minister established a task force to examine the proposal regarding alarms for the elderly.  I never heard anything as nonsensical as establishing such a task force.  The people of rural Ireland are afraid for their lives because of the present level of crime and everybody knows what needs to be done.  A former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Charles Haughey, introduced innovative schemes, both as Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Finance, which have served the people well. For instance, free telephone rental, television licence, electricity and travel were introduced because the Minister had imagination, saw a need and addressed it.  If he had set up a task force, it could be still sitting and the people would not have these services.  Why was it necessary to set up this task force?  The Minister should give people who live alone in the countryside a grant to install alarms.  That would be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised a number of times with the Minister by way of parliamentary question the issue of the surprising discrimination against blind people who have spent their life working.  I put a question down about a contributory pensioner who is recognised as blind both by the Department of Social Welfare and the health board since he has a blind allowance.  When he sought a companion travel pass to travel to the hospital in Dublin, he could not be given one because he was a contributory pensioner.  If he had been a non-contributory pensioner, an invalidity pensioner in a wheelchair or in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, he would have been entitled to a companion pass but, since he spent his life working and is now blind, he is not entitled to it.  It defies logic, as does a reply to a parliamentary question to the <Col N="208" /> effect that the Minister would have to examine the cost involved.</P>
    <P>Another change which I would like to have seen in the Bill relates to the death grant.  Anybody who was insured after 1971 is entitled to a death grant when he or she or a dependant dies.  The contribution for a death grant was introduced that year.  However, anybody who retired from work or did not pay a contribution before 1971 is not entitled to this grant.  The time has come to give a death grant to the few remaining people and their dependants who happened to retire before 1971.  I do not think the cost to the Exchequer would be great but it would make a lot of difference to many old people who are mainly in their 90s.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister and his staff in the Department of Social Welfare, particularly those who work among the people.  I find them extremely helpful. The Department has improved almost beyond recognition over the past ten or 20 years and it is an example of how high technology can be used to create a consumer friendly service. Great use has been made of information technology to solve the problems of people at local level.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to the improvements in the social welfare rates announced in the budget.  My first duty, therefore, is to compliment the Minister on these improvements.  It is well known how strenuously he fought at Cabinet to protect and improve the living standard of those not in the labour force, the people for whom he has a special responsibility.  He is, in a way, their Minister.  I also congratulate his Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, whose major input in fighting for the people <Col N="209" /> for whom he is responsible is well known.</P>
      <P>We all have an obligation to ensure that if things are going well within the economy, as they are undoubtedly at present with the exceptional rate of growth, all should share in these improvements.  Many of the people who have reached old age have come through exceedingly difficult times and if we can afford improvements now, they should be the first to benefit.  They do not have the luxury of time on their side.</P>
      <P>The next budget, the first of two in 1997, will be in an election year.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure the emphasis will be on those who most need assistance and that the Government will not yield to the temptation, as too often happened in the past, to provide election sweeteners to what might be regarded as more influential groupings.  That is the kind of thing that gives politicians a bad name.</P>
      <P>During this brief contribution, I want to bring the attention of the Minister to a number of areas where further changes are urgently needed.  I would like to see some of them introduced immediately, either through amendments to this Bill or by way of legislation. Take the question of savings which a non-contributory old age pensioner has and the manner in which these impinge on his or her pension entitlements.  Let us consider a person with £5,000 in savings, a sum which was probably built up over a lifetime.  The first £200 of this is disregarded entirely in assessing the amount of the pension and the next £375 is assessed at an interest rate of 5 per cent.  The balance is then assessed on the assumption that the pensioner can avail of an interest rate of 10 per cent.  The Government, through the Department of Social Welfare, is stating that the normal interest rate of which a pensioner can avail on savings of a few thousand pounds is 10 per cent at a time when interest rates have been at an exceptionally low level over a long period and are still falling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is exceptionally <Col N="210" /> proud of the present low level of interest rates.  We heard the Taoiseach speak of it at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis when he made the point that a person with a £40,000 mortgage is now paying £130 less per month than he or she was paying a few years ago.  We have heard the Minister for Finance speak of low interest rates and the likelihood that the situation will continue.  It forms part of the State's plans to keep within the Maastricht guidelines for economic and monetary union.  Bank and building society rates are still falling but what is the Government doing for the old age pensioner?  Absolutely nothing.  The Government is suggesting that it is possible for every non-contributory old age pensioner to get 10 per cent on every little scrap of saving above £575.  If a person with such savings could get that kind of interest rates, he or she would not be on a pension &mdash; that person would be head-hunted by the financial institutions.  The Minister should decide as a matter of urgency that changes should be made here.  This should be done in all fairness and equity.  I believe the Minister is a fair-minded man.  He must accept the logic of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The Minister has commenced a process in this Bill to provide for a new method of assessing capital in the case of the new disability allowance, which will replace the disabled person's maintenance allowance administered currently by the health board, and the new one parent family payment.  The Bill provides that the first £2,000 will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £20,000 will be assessed at 15 per cent.  I ask him to apply himself immediately to the non-contributory old age pension as the way in which it is handled at present is scandalous.  When we know the best financial consultants cannot achieve anything near that figure, how is a pensioner expected to achieve that rate with a small sum?</P>
    <P>The Minister should greatly increase the amount of money which is totally <Col N="211" /> disregarded.  This matter is also tied to the question of criminals who seek out elderly people living in isolated rural areas in the west, in particular, because they think the savings may be retained in pensioners' houses.  Savings are retained in houses because of this excessive notional interest rate which is being computed and the low level of the amount to be disregarded.  Is it right that these people, after working hard and living frugally all their lives, should be treated in this fashion?  They are anxious to put away a certain amount of savings in case some unforeseen difficulty arises, such as an unexpected illness, accident or, as in most cases, so that they will not be a burden on anyone and will have a decent burial.  It is all to give them some sense of independence. They should be allowed &mdash; I am being generous to the Minister here &mdash; a ceiling of at least £10,000 without it impinging on the way their pension rights are decided.  It would not break the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave a tax allowance for the purchase of house alarms by elderly people in rural areas. In an otherwise excellent budget, this was an aberration.  I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare has set up a task force to consider what can be done for these people to help them combat criminal assaults and robbery.  As a Deputy from County Sligo, where there have been horrific examples of the activity of these criminals, I welcome this decision and I have made a submission to the task force.</P>
    <P>The alert system should first be based on neighbours rather than gardaí in a town ten miles away who have no knowledge of the terrain.  I suggest the installation of a simple push button panel to trigger the alert system &mdash; using number or codes would be too complicated &mdash; and an alarm transmitted first to their immediate neighbours, preferably those with a telephone who could then alert the Garda and take action in safety.  It would not be beyond the capabilities of modern technology to produce such an <Col N="212" /> alert system for £70 a unit, for example, that would carry a signal up to half a mile.  This at least would ensure that no one would be left tied up or injured for too long.  It would also ensure there would be a good chance of getting a description of the vehicle used by the criminals, which may force the attackers to leave on foot across fields.  All of this would make the task of the Garda for a successful apprehension of the criminals as they made their getaway, that much easier.</P>
    <P>Those who know the kind of terrain and isolation of the areas where the most vulnerable of the elderly live &mdash; nobody knows this better than the Minister of State, who originally hailed from Kilsallagh should see the need for the involvement of people who know the terrain and how to block off a road.  This is where the neighbours can help.  I hope the Minister's task force will examine this suggestion and that he might consider subsidising the cost of whatever alarm system is recommended so that every pensioner at risk would have some protection and sense of security as they go to bed at night.</P>
    <P>I again refer to the outrageous notional 10 per cent interest to pensioners; something should be done about it.  No one can gainsay the logic that it is not reasonable for pensioners. Perhaps the Minister or the Minister of State &mdash; they seem to be the only members of the Cabinet who will be around this weekend &mdash; could change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what has been agreed by all Members to be a consumer friendly Bill designed to streamline the social welfare provisions and eliminate some of the anomalies which have bedevilled the system in the past.  I especially welcome the decision to allow people disqualified from receiving unemployment payments, because they happened to be involved in an industrial or trade dispute, to appeal immediately to the social welfare tribunal, that is a very progressive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for the fact that my contribution to this debate will be <Col N="213" /> partisan.  My party leader, the Minister for Social Welfare, has introduced what I believe is radical and reforming legislation which will make a substantial difference to the way our social welfare system is both administered and perceived. The Minister dealt comprehensively yesterday with the range of specific changes in the Bill and I intend today to highlight some of the issues which have not received the public attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>Developments in our social welfare system have, in the past, lagged behind social changes.  In this regard, I especially welcome the decision to introduce a new one parent family payment, replacing what was known as the lone parent allowance and the deserted wive's benefit.  In the past, many women have been forced to prove desertion. The onus of proof and the stigma which accompanied it reflected prevailing social attitudes regarding the position of women.  By doing away with the whole concept of desertion, this Bill reinforces the individual dignity of women.  I hope it will ensure they will no longer be regarded, certainly by the social welfare system at least, as second class citizens wholly dependent on their husbands for both financial support and social status. In removing this obligation.  Women have a lot to be thankful for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, this most progressive legislation is of little use unless citizens can have unbureaucratic access to information and, where necessary, redress. The Government has made a concerted effort in many areas to redress the past imbalance between the role of the State and the needs of the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces two very important reforms in this area.  First, it provides for an independent appeals system for those whose claims for supplementary welfare allowance have been turned down and, second, it provides for unemployed people to have access to the social welfare tribunal at an earlier stage in trade disputes.  The latter change is especially significant.  It arises principally from the experience with the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute last year <Col N="214" /> when the Minister gave a commitment to review the procedures; he has lived up to that commitment.  Section 33 provides that people who are disqualified from receiving unemployment payments because of their involvement in a trade dispute will be able to appeal immediately to the social welfare tribunal without first having to appeal the deciding officer's decision to the chief appeals officer.  That problem was very highlighted during the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute and many complaints were made about having to take that long route.</P>
    <P>This is a significant change and in recent years, the rights of workers involved in trade disputes have been eroded, most notably on foot of the Industrial Relations Act.  I would welcome a review of that Act with a view to ensuring that our industrial relations procedures do not militate against workers.  In the meantime, I am delighted the Minister for Social Welfare has decided to provide workers who find themselves in trade disputes with a quick and unbureaucratic means of sorting out their entitlements.  The changes in appeals system, together with the streamilining of various provisions, will help make our social welfare system more consumer friendly.</P>
    <P>As we head towards the 21st century, there is a realisation that our welfare system does not, or at least should not, provide charity to supplicants but a service to citizens, to which they are entitled, and we should develop that concept.  Sadly, unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is the single greatest challenge facing the Government and society as a whole.  I do not believe that poverty and unemployment are unavoidable or that unemployment can be tackled by market forces alone.  The experience in Ireland and throughout the European Union demonstrates conclusively that markets forces alone cannot address the area of long-term unemployment.  Therefore, a new strategy involving targeted intervention measures is required if we are to ensure that the fruits of economic <Col N="215" /> growth do not bypass the marginalised communities.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year the Government introduced a work-friendly budget and I believe that the provisions in the Social Welfare Bill go some way towards eliminating many of the remaining poverty traps.  They also ensure that those who wish to take up work are not dissuaded from doing so by our welfare system.  In the past, the tradition of moving from the dole to the workplace was made almost impossible by the myriad poverty traps confronting job seekers. People coming off the live register to enter employment lost a range of benefits, particularly those taking up low paid employment.  Much of the work available to those previously unemployed is, sadly, low paid.  These people often found themselves significantly out of pocket.  In effect they were penalised, not rewarded, for entering employment.</P>
    <P>In the past this was the only point on which I found myself in agreement with the Progressive Democrats.  Fortunately that small piece of common ground between Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats has been swept away by the Government.  For the first time a concerted effort has been made to ensure that those taking up employment will not lose out by doing so.  In future the long-term unemployed will retain their child dependent allowances for 13 weeks after taking up employment. That provision, in addition to the retention of the medical card, will make a substantial difference to those making the transition from the dole to employment. It will ensure that people are not deterred from taking up employment for merely financial considerations.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to simply provide work.  People in employment must be guaranteed an income sufficient to maintain an acceptable standard of living. Democratic Left believes that the only way to ensure this in the long-term is through the introduction of a statutory minimum wage.  However, in the short-term, the Social Welfare Bill provides significant improvements which <Col N="216" /> will impact on families in particular. Family income supplement, a scheme designed for the lower paid, has been improved and this year's budget included another significant increase in child benefit.  During the past two years child benefit increased by 45 per cent in respect of the first two children and by 36 per cent in respect of other children. This represents an unprecedented increase and is further evidence of the Government's commitment to ensure that support for families is improved. This Government is determined to be pro-family and the proof of this is in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I fear the Social Welfare Bill will not receive the attention it deserves from the media and other commentators. Sadly, many people will view it as another technical Bill, which it is not. The legislation will have far-reaching consequences for those dependent on social welfare.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the changes and improvements he introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, should carefully consider the final report of the National Pensions Board which is entitled &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System&rdquo;.  This report made a large number of recommendations for changes to the pensions system.  In relation to the survivor's pension it recommends the introduction of a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions paid during an insured's lifetime.  The formula outlined by the National Pensions Board requires that a person will qualify for maximum pension if their average contributions per year number between 45 and 52.  This is followed by a <i>a pro rata,</i> structured pensions scheme, which would cater for people down to those with an average number of yearly contributions numbering between ten and 14 who would qualify for 30 per cent of the pension.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Social Welfare is considering this report and its recommendations on an on going <Col N="217" /> basis, in due course proposals will be brought forward on the issues addressed in it.  I appeal to the Minister to look favourably on the report on the grounds that, at present, a very small number of people would be entitled to payment. The resultant costs to the State would be very small.  The lives of the very elderly people involved would be tremendously enhanced by the receipt of 30 per cent of the maximum pension.  I hope that the Minister will take this on board.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill which provides Members with an opportunity to discuss aspects of the social welfare system which they might wish to see changed.  They can also table amendments and discuss with the Minister the issue of social welfare on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system has worked reasonably well in the past.  Different Governments have made changes which improved the lives of those claiming social welfare benefits.  However, many of the changes over the past number of years, particularly those in this year's budget and in the Bill, merely tinker with the system.  As Deputy Joe Walsh stated yesterday, over £4 billion will be spent on the social welfare system. Much of this money is paid to those who require it, but we must consider how different aspects of social welfare payments might be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, unemployment is the largest problem with which the country is faced.  In the region of 70 per cent of people living in some housing estates in our cities and smaller towns are unemployed. This very high rate of unemployment is prevalent in areas where people depend on the social welfare system to help them to survive.  The Government made many statements <Col N="218" /> about action for the unemployed but the chances of people living in such housing estates obtaining employment are very slim.</P>
    <P>Quangos seem to be operating throughout the country.  The IDA, Forbairt, the county enterprise boards, the partnership programmes and the Leader programmes all have their own offices and staff and are building their own little empires.  In my county there are ten different offices which are supposed to provide opportunities for people to obtain employment.  Those people would need to earn £100 per week to cover the expense of buying petrol, renting a car or travelling by train or bus to visit the offices in question. I do not blame this Government any more than the previous one, but these agencies were established with different responsibilities and I question whether they are achieving much with regard to the creation of employment or helping people to obtain jobs.  It is time to consider amalgamating some of these agencies.  There should be one-stop shops in major towns, and some of the smaller ones, where people can obtain the information or help they require. People should not have to go to the enterprise board to be informed that they should have consulted the partnership programme which in turn informs them that they should visit the offices of the Leader programme.  Much confusion is caused and many people will not seek employment possibilities as a result. The Government should seriously consider amalgamating these agencies. They should be encouraged to help people create jobs rather than looking after their own interests and creating well paid jobs for their employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined many of the proposed changes to the social welfare system.  I welcome some of them including the new disability allowance, which will be administered by the Department. This replaces the old disabled person's maintenance allowance.  I hope the Minister will be more flexible than were the health boards in the payment of disability allowance.  The health boards <Col N="219" /> operated a very strict means test which did nothing to help families increase their standards of living.  If a wife or husband was on a small income of £20, £30 or £40 per week, the person claiming the disabled person's maintenance allowance only got the difference between that and the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The means testing was very strict and did not work in the interest of the family.  I hope the Minister will ensure it will be operated on a flexible basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new one parent family payment which will amalgamate the existing lone parent's allowance and the deserted wife's allowance.  Many social welfare payments, made under different headings and names, could be amalgamated rather than have them confuse people.  I would welcome such a development.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not consider improving other areas.  Will he examine the free fuel system for next winter?  Free fuel payments have remainted static for many years although the cost of fuel has increased.  The time has come to look seriously at the system, how it operates and the payments made.  There is certainly a need for a substantial increase in them.</P>
    <P>I raised a related issue with the Minister on a number of occasions during the winter months.  A severe, cold winter spell puts pressure on old age pensioners and the sick to provide adequate heating.  If the temperature drops to a certain level during a cold spell, it should trigger an increase in the free fuel allowance.  People are afraid to use their units or their free gas allowances in case the fuel runs out too soon.  Many of them do not get out of bed during cold spells.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at that area.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the alarm system proposal. The idea behind the provision of alarms is good but it baffles me that the vast number of people employed in the <Col N="220" /> Departments of Social Welfare and Finance as well as the 14 members of Cabinet agreed this system without one person saying it would not work.  A tax relief of up to £800 at the standard rate of income tax for persons aged 65 and over living alone to purchase alarms would benefit very few old age pensioners most of whom do not pay tax. This would be of no benefit to them.</P>
    <P>Setting up a task force usually represents delaying tactics.  We have enough task forces to take on the Chinese army.  Most task force reports lie on shelves in Ministers' or Departments' offices gathering dust.  I hope the Minister of State will ensure that, as soon as this task force reports, we will implement a policy to provide some type of alarm system for old age pensioners. As Deputy Nealon said, many of them particularly in rural areas are living in fear.  As the Minister is aware, a number of systems operate in different parts of the country.  Some of the best systems available should be taken on board and introduced immediately.  A once off allowance or an allowance payable over two years should be available through the social welfare system to enable people to purchase an alarm system. The tax allowance proposed by the Minister will not benefit many people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appeals system for supplementary welfare allowance.  The supplementary welfare allowance seems to operate differently in each health board area.  Even the supplementary welfare officers in any given county do not operate on the same basis.  It is time we had a proper supplementary welfare appeals office where people will get a fair decision.  Up to now, the appeal was to those who made the original decision which was neither fair nor workable.  I welcome the change and ask the Minister to ensure that supplementary welfare officers will be fairer and more equitable in their dealings with people. It is difficult to fathom how they reach some of their decisions which are unfair and unwieldy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy <Col N="221" /> Browne for sharing his time with me. The Social Welfare Bill is probably the single most important set of Government proposals to come before the House each year since it represents the most genuine indicator of the State's commitment to those who are most economically dependent in our society. It allows the Government of the day to express its understanding of a variety of social situations.  These affect the short and long-term unemployed, deserted spouses, single parents, people with significant illness or disability, widows and widowers, the elderly and their carers and orphans.  On a daily basis each of these sectors faces the depressing challenge of surviving on the lowest possible level of weekly income.</P>
      <P>I will refer to one simple social welfare scheme to put in context the current level of our support to our most disadvantaged citizens.  The weekly personal rate of unemployment benefit is just £62.50.  What standard of living does this sum provide to the unemployed single man or woman?  In many cases this sum must pay for accommodation, heating and electricity before one even considers the basic essentials of food and clothing.  It does not take a financial genius to establish that little or nothing is left for luxuries.  In this social welfare category, I note the Minister is proposing a weekly increase of £2.  If such an annual increase is maintained in future it could take until the year 2010 or so before a single unemployed person can obtain the princely sum of £100 per week.  For people who complain that our social welfare system is far too generous, I draw their attention to that simple stark fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anyone with any degree of decency or compassion begrudge a level of State support that only offers a single unemployed adult the possibility of a basic weekly income of £100 within the next 15 years?  I have no doubt the majority of single adults today would be horrified at the prospect of having to survive on such a level of weekly income.  As a representative of the constituency of Cork North Central which <Col N="222" /> has suffered more than most from the curse of growing unemployment, I believe it is time to put an end to any notion that our social welfare system is over generous to those who are most in need.  The example I outlined shows clearly that the level of social welfare support is, in real terms, quite modest.</P>
    <P>This does not mean the system of social welfare is not abused.  On the contrary the most recent statistics on fraud indicate a relatively high level of illegal claims.  It is vital that the elimination of such activity be a priority within the Department since it is damaging on two fronts.  First, it deprives the system of much needed resources and consequently reduces the amount available for the vast majority of beneficiaries entitled to State support.  Second, abuse of the system can lead to a certain degree of blame being attached to everyone dependent on the social welfare system.  This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Two facts are generally agreed in relation to the context in which the Minister has prepared his proposals. Last year's Social Welfare Bill was a major disappointment for the vast majority of recipients despite some positive aspects such as the increase in child benefit payments.  The basic increases provided by the Minister were seen as minimal and were mainly concerned with matching inflation.  It was felt, therefore, that the Minister would more than compensate this year for his miserly 1995 Bill.</P>
    <P>The second factor was that a number of financial indicators suggested that the national economy had recovered from the disaster created by the 1983-87 coalition Government.  While this vital recovery was led by successive Fianna Fáil Governments, the current rainbow Administration has not been shy in highlighting the rosy nature of the State's finances.  It has been happy to claim credit for a situation it inherited at the end of 1994.  There is no doubt the time has come to tackle the problems of the most deprived sections of our society in a systematic, determined and generous manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> It is against this background that the Minister's proposals must be assessed and I am amazed at what he has produced. At a time when many film makers attempt to build on one successful movie by bringing out second and third versions, there is little evidence that a similar strategy is adopted when dealing with productions which are a failure at the box office.  This simple but sensible practice seems to have been totally ignored by the Minister.  While his 1995 Bill could be described as a lost opportunity, this Bill could be described as the second lost opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a unique opportunity to give real meaning to his often expressed commitment to the poor and socially deprived sectors of our society. However, he has delivered a mixed bag of minor adjustments and changes to the status quo.  Could anyone suggest that the Minister could have given less than the 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments, which will not come into effect until June?  The Minister has stuck like a limpet to the lowest possible levels of increases in a number of key social welfare schemes, such as unemployment benefit, retirement pensions, deserted spouse benefit and survivor's pensions.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair to suggest that the Bill does not contain some positive proposals. I welcome, for example, the increase in the grants payable to mothers of twins at birth and at the commencement of primary and secondary school education.  Approximately one in every 80 pregnancies results in twins.  I have no doubt that these happy mothers will benefit from the proposed increases.  While the minor changes in threshold levels for family income supplement and a number of other measures are welcome, it must be stressed that the vast majority of changes are either minor or involve fine tuning the administration rather than representing real reform.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to express my disappointment at the Minister's proposals. As a public representative, I <Col N="224" /> seek to possess an acute awareness of the extent and nature of social deprivation, injustice and poverty in certain sections of society.  However, the Minister's work in the Department of Social Welfare has been a major let down.  It would be generous to concede that no change has taken place in the proportion of people living below the poverty line since January 1995.  The Minister's performance is not good enough at a time of growing national wealth. Our most vulnerable people must have their case heard at the Cabinet table. That this has not happened is evident in the 1995 or 1996 Bills.  Responsibility for this failure does not rest solely on the shoulders of the Minister for Social Welfare.  His Cabinet colleagues are also to blame for the appalling shortcomings of the Government in dealing with inequality in our society.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's proposals.  There is little doubt that the challenge of fighting inequality in our society must await a change of Government. It is reassuring that our social welfare spokesman, Deputy Joe Walsh, is currently involved in an intensive programme of policy development with the overall objective of addressing social inequality and injustice in our society as we approach the next decade.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It is difficult to understand how a social welfare system which was regarded as perfect has in the past 15 months become an instrument of poverty.  This Bill helps to correct many anomalies, particularly in the area of unemployment, which <Col N="225" /> created poverty traps and were a disincentive to work.  This Bill will help to reduce unemployment.</P>
      <P>Social welfare has changed over the years.  In the past the only social welfare benefit people expected was the old age pension.  That is no longer the case. Social welfare should be everyone's concern.  Existing schemes start at birth and continue until people leave school which could be, under the provisions of this Bill, 23 years of age.  They could then be in employment for 30 or 35 years before they retire.  Social welfare is available during the lifespan of a person. This is a big change from the days when unemployment exchanges were regarded as temporary buildings which, like rural schools and post offices, would be phased out in time.</P>
      <P>The improvement in the economy has not brought the type of employment prospects for which we had hoped.  This country is not unusual in that.  The number of years people spend working will decrease while years of retirement and of education will increase.  Consequently, dependence on social welfare will increase because it is now accepted, in even the most progressive economies, that years of employment will be much shorter than heretofore.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure proper systems are in place for all eventualities.  There are gaps in the system.  I agree with the previous speaker that it is a severe hardship for a single person who is unemployed or out of work through illness to survive on £62.50 per week but that did not begin in the 15 months reign of this Minister. Some years ago help was available for such a person through pay related benefit but that was done away with.  There has rightly been an emphasis on the family in the past few years, through an increase in children's allowance and other benefits.  Perhaps the next budget will pay more attention to single people who are expected to live on a low income.  Many of them live alone and pay the same rent or mortgage as a family would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I will refer to some points made earlier. Perhaps this is a matter for the Minister for Finance but it should be possible for the £800 tax relief for alarm systems to be claimed by a relative of the elderly person.  Most pensioners living alone do not have taxable incomes but if a relative were to pay for the installation of an alarm, he or she should get the relief provided.  That would go some way to easing the position.</P>
    <P>I could go through the various schemes but I am conscious of the time and that my colleague wants to contribute. Information is extremely important in all these matters and the regionalisation of the social welfare administration has been a tremendous success. It has helped in getting quicker results, obtaining information and dealing with cases.  I include information centres in that.  We should also compliment the local print media, which provide weekly question and answer columns and local radio stations, which provide information slots.  This has helped to make people aware of various schemes.</P>
    <P>I referred in the past to the many elderly people who cannot avail of free travel. There should be a way for them to barter the free travel for another scheme they might need more, such as free fuel or electricity.  Free travel is of no value to a number of people.  There should be closer co-operation with health boards in the operation of the mobility allowance &mdash; it should be tied into social welfare.  The £100 death grant was mentioned; it is now so insignificant in terms of funeral costs that it should be seriously examined.  Perhaps it should be abolished for administrative reasons and instead two to three weeks' extra payments should be made after the death of a social welfare recipient, on top of the current six payments.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the changes in qualification for the long-term unemployed, changes relating to part-time and casual work, the introduction of the new appeal system and the alterations of the disabled person's <Col N="227" /> maintenance allowance.  These all constitute progress.</P>

I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, for his work during the year.  The annual Social Welfare Bill is important.  Many employed people probably do not realise that other people are totally dependent on it.  For many it is the difference between being warm or cold, homeless or housed, healthy or unhealthy, even between being hungry or fed &mdash; it is as stark as that.  The Bill makes a basic difference to people's lives and its significance cannot be over stated.  Many items have been progressed in the Bill and there have been welcome improvements in the way the Department of Social Welfare deals with those dependent on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1986 progress has been made towards bringing social welfare payments in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare. Some payments now exceed the minimum recommended by the Commission and others come close.  An extra effort should now be made to bring the remaining payments up to par.  A previous speaker said that social welfare payments in this country are relatively generous.  For example, in many cases we have closed the perceived gap between levels of payment in Britain and here and in cases like unemployment benefit and old age pensions our payments exceed those in Britain.  We should be proud of this achievement and the proposed increases this year of 3 per cent for general payments should improve the position even further.  It was often said in the 1960s and 1970s that one of the main obstacles to reuniting Ireland was the difference between social welfare payments here and in the North and that we would never see the day when payments were on a par.  This <Col N="228" /> is a step in the right direction, not just for the people who receive them.</P>
    <P>A number of areas merit special attention.  Child benefit has been transformed into a substantial payment to bring families out of the poverty area. Since 1992, the base payment has risen by over 80 per cent.  I welcome the further £2 increase promised by the Minister for this year and hope further progress can be made in this area next year.  This comes on top of last year's substantial increase in child benefit.</P>
    <P>The relaxation of rules on employment, concerning disregarding unemployment assistance, are also welcome. As the Minister said, the existing system is complicated and I am pleased he has been able to make some changes aimed at simplifying it.</P>
    <P>Part-time work has become a fact of life and for many unemployment assistance has become an income supplement. This is not what it was intended or designed for but the Minister has taken the right decision.  He could have tightened the rules governing the system but he has chosen to make it more flexible, thereby preventing people falling completely on the resources of the State.  The Minister has taken the right course of action in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Social Welfare and Health have been operating the disabled person's maintenance allowance. The new disability allowance transfers the responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare, a significant development which will be of great benefit to many.  There is an overwhelming case for transferring the remaining welfare functions of the health boards to the Department of Social Welfare.  It has been well made by the Minister in transferring disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the one parent family allowance is also a step towards further simplification of the system.  In recent years giving advice on welfare problems has become an industry in <Col N="229" /> itself and that should not be the case.  I support the Minister's proposal for further increases in the income threshold for family income supplement.  This scheme is important for the many who live on the margin between employment and unemployment.  Once people take advantage of the benefits available their lifestyle can be improved.  There is insufficient information available on the scheme and the take-up is not as great as it should be.  Hopefully, further advertising of the scheme will improve its take-up.</P>
    <P>One of the six major unemployment blackspots is in my constituency, Dublin South West and a substantial number of one parent families live in local authority housing in a part of it.  Many of those families make the best out of the means available to them.  However, because of the intimidation, violence and antisocial behaviour rampant in many areas the security of those families is endangered.  In many cases, in order to ensure the safety and protection of the family, the mother brings a male into the household.</P>
    <P>The unmarried mothers usually have no other means of securing their families and property, but taking this course of action may endanger their lone parent's allowance.  They can also be obliged to declare the arrangement for rent purposes.  In many cases these families need some form of protection urgently and they take this course of action although in fear of being found out.  The Minister should examine this matter sensitively.  Although it is a difficult problem to which there is no simple answer, perhaps some action can be taken to assist those involved.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare Bills are technical instruments but the business they transact is humane.  It is often the difference between people having the means to sustain themselves.  The amount of technical information contained in the many information leaflets issued has been simplified.  The language used in those leaflets should be as basic as possible because many of the most vulnerable <Col N="230" /> are the least able to get access to the system.</P>
    <P>Many of the drug addicts who try to break the heroin habit do so in community based programmes.  They often spend some of their meagre resources on going to their doctor for a prescription of methadone and may then have to pay for the methadone.  They do this voluntarily in the knowledge that it is the only way to improve their lives through ending their addiction to heroin. Perhaps they could be compensated in some way, with food vouchers for example, for the money they spent in trying to improve their lives.</P>
    <P>In the light of new developments taking place in the community in this regard will the Minister consider taking some such action?  Many drug addicts find when they try to come off drugs they are short of the means to sustain themselves and to give themselves a quality of life which will enable them to form a positive attitude to deal with their drug problem.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department on progressing social welfare. I look forward to the next budget which I expect will contain further improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system is a tremendous achievement.  It is designed to provide support and assistance for the weakest and most disadvantaged members of society.  The social welfare system accounts for one third of Government spending and in 1996 more than £4 billion will be spent on it. Approximately 1.5 million people benefit from social welfare payments at present, almost 1.5 million workers are insured under the social insurance scheme and almost 500,000 families receive child benefit for more than one millon children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI has predicted rapid economic growth over the next decade.  The major challenge facing us is to turn this growth into employment and to reduce the present unacceptable levels of unemployment.  Major policy changes are called for and if they are not made <Col N="231" /> unemployment will decline only slightly from its current levels by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems facing the social welfare system is the ageing of the population.  We are informed that 11 per cent of our population is over the age of 65; this will increase to 13 per cent by 2011 and to more than 20 per cent by 2036.  This will lead to additional expenditure on old age pensions and related services.</P>
    <P>With the present excessive levels of unemployment every Government Department, in particular the Department of Social Welfare, has a political and moral responsibility to do everything in its power to help people into employment.  The cancer of long-term unemployment cannot be allowed to continue.  If it does politicians will have failed.</P>
    <P>We live in a society which has brought about different changes for an increasing population, in particular the elderly.  Average life expectancy continues to increase, mainly as a result of improved health care facilities.  It is a deeply satisfying pattern since much of the progress in Irish society since the 1950s is due to people who are now categorised as elderly.  In this regard a serious situation exists in rural areas whereby many elderly people cannot get health care beds, especially long stay beds.  The Minister should consider introducing a subsidy for genuine cases. He has shown himself to be caring.</P>
    <P>Ensuring equality for women, people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups must also be a key policy objective.  The importance of equality was emphasised in a report published a few weeks ago by the National Economic and Social Forum, which set out a range of sensible measures to ensure equality for women.</P>
    <P>Does the Bill measure up to the objective of tackling unemployment? To be fair, the Minister has cut PRSI payments, a worth-while development which will be welcomed by employers. <Col N="232" /> He has also proposed a change to the way those on unemployment assistance will be means tested if they take up part-time work.  The details have to be announced but it is expected to be an improvement on the existing situation, which is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, these measures do not amount to the radical overhaul of the social welfare system which is required to facilitate people in getting back to work.  The Government's overall response to the unemployment crisis is disappointing.  Three different bodies, the Department of Social Welfare, FÁS and the local employment schemes, are supposed to provide information, advice and assistance to those looking for work.  These are in addition to the range of other bodies involved in this area, including the IDA, Forfás, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards.  How can an employer, or a person seeking work to find a way around this situation avoid getting confused?  Instead of adopting a coherent plan to tackle unemployment, the Government is relying on old structures that are in need of modification.</P>
    <P>How does the Bill respond to the recommendations of the most recent task force report on employment?  It recommended that a range of schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare, including the back to work allowance and the part-time job incentive scheme should be examined in the context of other income support measures for those on low pay, such as family income supplement and PRSI exemptions.  The report stated that there is considerable complexity in the range of income support measures for those in low paid employment.  It considers that the role and objectives of specific measures need to be clarified and streamlined to ensure that they complement one another.  The Bill makes no response to these recommendations.</P>
    <P>A range of simple measures for the elderly should have been introduced. Instead, the Government made an inadequate proposal in the budget on tax relief for security measures applicable only to those aged 65 years or older who <Col N="233" /> live alone and pay tax.  What about those who do not pay tax?  They need some assistance, again by way of subsidy, especially in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The response to the Government's proposal from a wide range of bodies indicated the need for a much wider level of support for elderly people. Indeed, the Minister set up a task force to look at this issue.  The solution to the problem is clear.  There should be a social welfare payment to assist elderly people to secure their homes.  How long does the Minister need to study the problem to see this?</P>
    <P>At a time when interest rates are at their lowest in living memory, the Department of Social Welfare uses rates of up to 10 per cent in estimating the means of elderly pensioners.  Not satisfied with this, the Minister introduced in the Bill rates of up to 15 per cent for some claimants.  I appeal to him to re-examine this.  Perhaps he will inform us if he intends to expand this to include old age pensioners.  Does he not realise this is counter-productive as people are afraid to put money into local credit unions or financial institutions?  Now is the time to reduce the rate of interest to reflect the kind of interest available, not to increase it to even more penal levels.</P>
    <P>Many self-employed persons of 56 years of age or older in April 1988, when the PRSI system was extended to them, are excluded from the old age contributory pension despite the requirement on them to pay PRSI up to 66 years of age.  The disqualification criteria is inflexible and penalises many thousands of self-employed people. Surely the Minister could have seen a way to introduce flexibility to the scheme to enable those affected, for example, to be allowed to make contributions to the State pension scheme or to continue to pay contributions beyond 66 years of age to meet the existing qualification requirements, or to provide a <i>pro rata</i> pension based on the amount of contribution paid by the person on reaching retirement age?</P>
    <P>The Bill has not addressed the position of women.  The report of the <Col N="234" /> Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the term &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo; should be substituted for the term &ldquo;dependent&rdquo;.  It also recommended that social welfare payments should be divided between the recipient and the qualified partner, the dependent spouse, that qualified partners should be issued with their own allowance book and that the Government should work towards establishing a system of individual rights and payments in the social insurance and social welfare systems by 1997.</P>
    <P>These recommendations are not addressed in the Bill.  The Minister will point to the introduction of a one parent family benefit for lone parents.  Why is the benefit to be means tested when, on 19 February, he announced that there would be no means test?  In introducing this scheme he has abolished the deserted wife's benefit scheme and the deserted wife's allowance.  People who had paid into the social insurance system on the basis that they would be able to qualify for deserted wife's benefit will not have to apply for a means tested scheme and many will not qualify.  The Minister has even cut the maximum earning level in respect of deserted wife's benefit, currently at £14,000 to £12,000 in respect of the new one parent family payment.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the deserted wife's allowance will mean that deserted wives in their 40s, who have raised their children and no longer have a dependent child living with them, will not qualify for any specific payment.  Will these women have to sign on at the local employment exchange and queue each week in the health centres to get supplementary welfare?</P>
    <P>The petty measures contained in the disability allowance scheme have not been changed.  I welcome the principle that disabled person's maintenance allowance should be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. However, the Minister has not taken the opportunity to remove some of the most objectionable features of the disabled <Col N="235" /> person's maintenance allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that people with disabilities in residential institutions will not receive any payment.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this situation. How does it fit into the Government's commitment to equality?  The measure will result in many such people having to live on a pittance each week.  This has been heavily criticised by the Ombudsman and it is time the measure was dropped.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the Minister and the Government failed to address the challenge to seriously develop and restructure the overall social welfare system.  Fianna Fáil is involved in a detailed evaluation of the current situation. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is prudent management of the resources available to him.  He should take advantage of the favourable economic climate to ensure that the maximum number in the weaker sections of our community will benefit.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill.  His is a difficult ministry. Across Europe the issue of social welfare is coming under increasing debate. It is partly motivated by concern that the European model of co-operation between workers, employers and the State, cemented by high level of welfare provision, renders European industry uncompetitive in the new global economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many of the fears currently being expressed are largely alarmist, and in part motivated by the political right and employers seeking to increase profits without passing them on to workers, there is a broad agreement that the European welfare system no longer caters properly for new systems <Col N="236" /> of production.  We are more than familiar with these problems.</P>
    <P>While the issue of welfare dependency was first raised by the new right, the left has begun to accept that its traditional solutions to problems caused by unemployment and pensions provision are in need of revision.  I use the term &ldquo;new right&rdquo; advisedly.  It has always struck me that the new right bore more resemblance to Victorian <i>laissez-faire</i> liberalism than to any 20th century phenomenon.  The concerns of the left are fundamentally different from those of the right.  The right is motivated by its need to free business of constraints imposed on it by the welfare and taxation systems.  Over the past few years this Government and its predecessors have begun to address this issue.  I accept that we have difficulties in this regard and I will support any moves to facilitate enterprise in our economy and in that of Europe.  However, some of the changes taking place in Britain in the last few days illustrate clearly that what one man regards as red tape radically affects another person's livelihood.</P>
    <P>The left's concerns are similar but motivated by other reasons.  The left, whose political base is more concentrated in working class areas, has seen at close hand the disintegration of many of these communities.  This disintegration has manifested itself in rising unemployment, the breakdown of the traditional family unit and increasing alienation from society.  All this has taken place despite increased levels of welfare payment and other schemes, such as disadvantaged status schemes, operating within our Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In Britain the debate about reform of the welfare state among those on the left has moved on to concentrating on the concept of the hand up rather than the hand out.  I welcome such a debate and advocate its extension to Ireland. However, the underlying premise of such a debate can only be that people's basic human rights are not undermined and that any of the reforms proposed as a result of the debate are aimed at <Col N="237" /> improving their quality of life, not undermining it in an effort to get them to work longer and harder for less money; that would be totally unacceptable.  The Bill represents a reasonable step in this direction.  It continues the Government's policy of addressing employment and poverty traps which force people to remain dependent on welfare when they would otherwise return to work.  This area is crucial in an age when there is a growing cynicism about politics and the differences between the respective political parties.</P>
    <P>There are substantial differences in the manner in which the political left and right have dealt with this issue.  In the aftermath of the budget, Davy stockbrokers pointed out that in the area of tax reform there were substantial differences between the approach adopted by the 1989-92 Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and the approach adopted by post-1992 Governments in which Labour has been prime player.  Davy's pointed out that between 1989 and 1992 tax reform was directed at groups paying tax at marginal rates and that subsequent to 1992 while progress continued at the marginal level, primary focus of tax reform was on the less well off.</P>
    <P>This year's budget announced the continuation of this policy and this Bill gives effect to many of the budget's proposals. They include further reductions in employers' and employees' PRSI payments, increased provision of employment schemes to encourage people back into the labour market, the provision whereby the long-term unemployed are allowed to retain secondary benefits such as child dependant allowance and medical cards taking up work, further increases in the exemption levels from the health and youth training levies, and increases in the amount of weekly income disregarded for PRSI purposes.  All this has been achieved without any reduction in the basic social welfare payment.  In fact, the 3 per cent projected increase in payments this year is in excess of the rate of inflation.  Child <Col N="238" /> benefit has also been increased and this payment is rightly identified as a means of addressing family poverty without creating further poverty and employment traps.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned the expert report on the integration of the tax and social welfare system which is due to be published in the near future. I look forward to that report and I am not at all surprised that it has taken a long time to produce because of the complexities of the issues being considered.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion lately about the most appropriate measure of unemployment.  People have spoken about the relative merits of the live register against the labour force survey. I am clear in my mind that the labour force survey is by far a more appropriate measure of modern employment trends.  For many people, unemployment assistance acts as a form of income support and I have no difficulty with that.  It is far better that people and the State should be involved in working and that they should obtain some of their income from work rather than be totally dependent on welfare.  It is very important that the system encourages them to work.  Some important steps have been taken in this budget in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that considerable progress is being made in relation to the need to simplify the welfare system.  The transfer of disabled person's maintenance allowance payments from health boards to the Department of Social Welfare is an important change and I hope that in the near future the payment of all supplementary welfare allowances will be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  Much of my thinking on this question is conditioned by the views of the British Labour MP, Mr. Frank Field, who has spoken in terms of the difficulties which social welfare has created over the years.  Essentially it creates two difficulties. On the one hand if people follow the system to the letter it tends to militate greatly against initiative and <Col N="239" /> enterprise.  The other alternative is for people to become involved in breaking the law.  Neither of those is desirable and I am very pleased to see considerable changes being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, social welfare is about social cohesion, an essential factor in developing economies.  That is the way forward and some very significant progress has been made in this Bill. I am sure that further progress will be made when the various reports are published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing his time with me.  I agree with him in relation to tax and social welfare. The Minister had very strong views on that subject when he was party spokesman on Social Welfare, as had I when I had that brief.  I hope something positive can be done.  The idea that somebody who has been in receipt of social welfare for six months finds the social welfare bill for the previous six months unloaded on him on his return to work is ludicrous to say the least.  That element of the system should be taken into account and I hope the Minister will do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposals introduced in this Social Welfare Bill.  I have been a Member of this House for 14 years and this is possibly the best package of social welfare proposals I have seen. People tend to look at the headlines in the budget in relation to social welfare but this Bill shows that there is much more to the social welfare package on this occasion than ever before.  This is reforming legislation and it meets many of the points that both I and the Minister when in Opposition highlighted for many years.  I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not enough time to go into every section but I will refer to the provision for widows.  There should be a widow's charter in the social welfare code because this category of social welfare recipient has been least well cared for over all the years.  A widow can be left with young children and a mortgage and her husband's total income, <Col N="240" /> whether from work or social welfare, disappears overnight.  It is impossible to bridge that gap.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have not cared well enough for widows.  This area should be examined in depth.  Several previous Ministers, when I was party spokesman for Social Welfare, indicated their sympathy in this area but nothing positive was done.  Widows could be assisted in a whole range of areas rather than have their income drop from several hundred pounds per week to an amount provided by widow's and orphan's allowance.  I appeal to the Minister to take that on board and, perhaps in the next budget, to bring forward a charter for widows under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Lowering the qualifying age for the old age pension to 65 is long overdue but it is difficult to encourage men and women to retire and make way for younger people if they do not qualify for subsidiary benefits until they are 66 years of age.  A range of benefits apply at age 65, but the subsidiary benefits do not apply at that stage.  It is difficult to explain the position to people who have reached the age of 65 and who paid contributions throughout their working lives over 40 to 50 years.</P>
    <P>Another reforming measure should be considered with regard to a matter which causes total confusion among workers and others.  It is difficult for public representatives to explain why the tax year starts and finishes on 5 April each year while the social welfare year starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December.  Both areas are related; one influences the other regarding the period of qualification and many other aspects of the social welfare code.  I do not understand why the social welfare year and the tax year cannot run from 1 January to 31 December.  This would greatly reduce the amount of administration and confusion, not only among the public, but also in the Department. However, great changes have taken place in the Department.  The level of efficiency in terms of the service provided to public representatives had increased dramatically since I first <Col N="241" /> raised the issue of social welfare in the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision on the social welfare appeals tribunal regarding industrial disputes.  This is long overdue as it was a most cumbersome system.  It was impossible to explain to the families of striking workers, who were often forced on to the street &mdash; as were the <i>Irish Press</i> people &mdash; why they had to wait months before tribunal hearings took place.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased payment for twins.  It is a pity the Minister did not make this retrospective as I would have qualified for it.  Nevertheless, I am pleased that those who come after me and my good wife will benefit from it.  I am aware of the difficulties in starting off married life with two children in the first year.  It can cause problems, particularly for those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 in relation to PRSI.  The means testing provision in section 37 is also welcome.  There should be a standard means testing mechanism so that people could be tested once a year and it would not be necessary for them to be tested again to qualify for various benefits. The system could be revised annually. It would save an enormous amount of time in the Departments of Social Welfare and Health.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the transfer of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance and the creation of the long awaited new disability allowance. It was ridiculous that social welfare recipients had to go from a social welfare officer to a community welfare officer and then back to the social welfare officer.  Perhaps this is the start of integrating the two services so that both can be dealt with under the same roof. I hope the Minister will move in that direction.</P>
    <P>The incentive to part-time workers is also welcome.  People who moved from social welfare to take up part-time jobs were, effectively, penalised.  As a result people worked part-time unofficially or illegally.  They can now openly take part in FÁS schemes for 20 hours a week and <Col N="242" /> work for the remainder of the week, or work on a week on week off basis.  This incentive should be extended and social provisions should be the same as those governing FÁS schemes.  The Bill is a good package in terms of social welfare reforms.  I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Finance and the Government for a job well done.</P>

      <P>Sílim áfach nach gcreideann éinne sa Teach seo &mdash; fiú amháin sa bhFreasúra &mdash; gur féidir an córas ath-structúriú go luath.  Is structúr an-chasta agus anmhór é.

      <P>The system is large and complex.  It has developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis over many years and it will take time to reform and streamline it and to integrate it with other social services.  All social services need to be integrated and co-ordinated and this will take time.</P>
      <P>I look forward to debating the policies on which I understand Deputy Ivor Callelly is working with the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on social welfare.  Since I became Minister for Social Welfare, there has been an absence of any serious critique of the social welfare system by that party.  I received much criticism about various elements and rates, but there was no serious critique as to what might be done to improve the system. I look forward to that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the reforms in this year's Bill I introduced a range of reforms last year.  In addition, a major national anti poverty strategy is being prepared involving a range of Govenment Departments.  A commission on the family has been established and is examining how families can be supported to <Col N="243" /> a greater and better extent and how we can ensure that our tax and social welfare system supports families given their important role in society.</P>
    <P>A range of other measures are also under way.  A discussion document on social insurance and the PRSI system will be published soon.  The task force report on the elderly will also be published soon.  We expect that the integration group on tax and social welfare, established by the last Administration under the care of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and for which the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, is currently responsible, will publish its findings by the middle of this year.  This will be a major step in terms of examining how the tax and social welfare systems can be restructured.  In addition, we have initiated a review of the basic minimum rates which the Commission on Social Welfare recommended ten years ago.  The ESRI is currently looking at those rates to determine an updated version of a minimum adequate income level for the 1990s.</P>
    <P>This reforming work is going ahead and cannot all be encapsulated in the annual Social Welfare Bill.  However, I would argue strongly that this is a very good Bill.  It is the product not only of my thinking but that of the Government as a whole.  It had the input of Labour and Fine Gael in addition to that of Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not perfect and choices had to be made in relation to the spending of resources.  Nevertheless, we introduced a one parent family payment; we reformed dramatically the assessment of unemployment assistance for part-time workers; we are continuing with the back to work allowance scheme, which is currently availed of by in excess of 10,000 people; we improved the family income supplement; we provided for the retention of medical cards for three years by people who take up work and we are enabling people to retain child dependant allowances for 13 weeks when they take up work.  We are also continuing to provide the third level <Col N="244" /> allowance schemes and are providing for the retention of child dependent allowances for certain categories of social welfare recipients with children in college.  We extended the age limit for that to 22 years last year and this year we extended it to 23 years or the end of the academic year, whichever comes later, in order to assist people to remain in education.</P>
    <P>All of these measures are important and it is wrong of the Opposition simply to ignore their existence.  They are indicative of a very specific direction in reforming the social welfare system, which is to make it more work and worker friendly and to help people to take up and make work.  We have also made improvements in the last two budgets in child benefit &mdash; it is clearly also a family friendly Bill and system.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the fact that a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies called for fairly extensive expenditure increases, despite the fact that late last year, when the Government was preparing the Estimates, we had calls from the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, for a reduction in social welfare expenditure.  Fianna Fáil Deputies said today that not enough is spent on social welfare.  In case there is any question about whether I am misleading the House in relation to this matter, I draw the House's attention to an article by Tom MacEneany in <i>The Irish Times,</i> dated 8 December 1995, which stated:</P>
    <P>Ireland should be spending less on social welfare, according to the Fianna Fáil leader, Mr. Bertie Ahern. &ldquo;At a time when the economy and jobs are growing strongly [It is nice to see him praising the growth in jobs] social welfare expenditure ought to be in decline&rdquo;, he said.  Speaking to the Institute of Directors yesterday, Mr. Ahern said he was mystified as to why, given the current economic conditions, there should be any question of exceeding agreed budget guidelines on social welfare.</P>
    <P>That is a matter of record and I would expect some consistency on the part of <Col N="245" /> Fianna Fáil speakers who come into this House to declaim that not enough money is being spent on social welfare. More money than ever is being spent on social welfare, but it is being spent in an effective way, not as a result of cutting back on some schemes but as a result of a general increase in the available resources.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a number of queries raised by Deputies during the debate.  I do not expect to be able to deal with them all, but we can deal with any I do not reach on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh and Deputy Quill welcomed the changes in PRSI provided for in the Bill but suggested they did not go far enough.  The cost of the improvements I am introducing this year is £121 million which, together with the changes made last year, gives rise to an overall cost of £270 million.  In contrast, the cost of improvements introduced in 1994, when Fianna Fáil was in Government, was just £63 million.</P>
    <P>As far as the rates of PRSI and employment creation are concerned, studies conducted by the EU and OECD have concluded the cost of employers' social insurance is passed on to employees because it is taken into account when wage rates are settled. Irish employers' PRSI rates are not high by international standards.  For example, only four EU states have lower rates of employer social insurance contributions &mdash; the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland.</P>
    <P>While it is natural that attention should focus on the rate of employers' PRSI contributions, other aspects are also important when comparing the social insurance systems in operation in different countries.  For example, there is no earnings ceiling for employers' social insurance contributions in the UK, where the rate of employees' social insurance is 10 per cent.  Taking employee and employer PRSI together, the total rate of PRSI is lower than the UK equivalent where wages are higher than £110 per week, when the measures provided for in this Social Welfare Bill are enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> There is no clear evidence that reductions in employer PRSI lead to additional employment creation or job maintenance.  Any assessment of possible positive employment effects must take account of the effect of the tax increases necessary to pay for such reductions in PRSI.  PRSI pays for social insurance benefits and pensions.  The current rates of PRSI cover most, but not all, of these costs.  It is important to be clear that calls for reductions in PRSI contributions mean either higher taxes or reductions in social welfare rates of payment.  There can be no question of reducing the rates of social welfare payments and there is no support in this House or the country for such a policy.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Quill raised the question of the one parent family payment, she asked why I was doing away with a social insurance benefit, that is, the deserted wife's benefit.  She made out that she was a defender of the social welfare system.  I find this rather odd because the Progressive Democrats launched a policy document just before the budget which proposed the abolition of the social insurance system.  They did not tell the public at that time that if they were to proceed with that, assuming they would want to maintain old age pensions, unemployment assistance and so on at their current levels, the net effect would be that the 27 per cent rate of income tax would have to rise to 33 per cent and the 48 per cent rate to 62 per cent.  I wonder if the Progressive Democrats will present that in their election manifesto at the end of next year when they propose to end the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>I will publish in the near future a discussion document on the social insurance system.  I look forward to a debate on it in the House, or the Select Committee on Social Affairs, at some point in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill raised a number of issues with regard to the one parent family payment.  Contrary to what she suggested about savings, the combined effect of the changes I am introducing will cost an additional £10 million in a <Col N="247" /> full year.  These changes will mean that about 4,200 lone parents currently on a reduced rate of lone parent's allowance will qualify for the maximum rate of payment and a further 900 lone parents will receive a higher rate of payment under the new one parent family payment. In addition, a further 2,000 one parent families will qualify for this payment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill also suggested that the one parent family payment represented an attack on the social insurance system. If she looks closely at the detail of my proposals, she will realise that they represent a considerable improvement in the income supports for one parent families. What has often been seen as a degrading requirement on women to prove desertion will be removed from the code and men and women will be entitled to the payment on the same basis.</P>
    <P>An initial disregard of £6,000 per year will be applied.  The first £2,000 of capital will also be disregarded and a proportion of maintenance payments may be retained towards housing costs.</P>
    <P>As far as the Deputy's comments on the insurance system are concerned, it is interesting to note the views of the Commission on Social Welfare on this issue.  It stated that in the event of marital breakdown or desertion by her husband, a woman is likely to experience long-term income needs.  The question arises as to the most appropriate way in which these needs should be met.  While the case for income support may be clear-cut, it is not clear that this support should be provided by an insurance scheme.  The assessment of maintenance being paid in assessing eligibility for deserted wife's benefit, which was introduced by the Finna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, dilutes the insurance concept itself.  While we are not convinced that desertion can be regarded as an insurable contingency, we recognise that any attempt to make alternative income maintenance provision must take account of the acquired <Col N="248" /> rights and entitlements of those currently in receipt of deserted wife's benefit. My proposals for a new one parent family payment not only address fully the issues raised by the commission in this area but provide for a comprehensive, unified payment for all one parent families which contains significant incentives for parents to return to the labour force.</P>
    <P>There has been an allegation that I made an incorrect and misleading statement last year on the one parent family payment.  Fianna Fáil spokespeople quote selectively, as usual, from a statement of mine on this payment when they allege I said there would be no means test.  What I said was that the new payment, instead of being means tested, will be earnings related.  It may be difficult for them to comprehend the difference. When I have more time I will explain it to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Walsh criticised the notional rates used for the assessment of capital for social assistance purposes, in particular, the 10 per cent rate applied in certain payments.  I have already made known in the House that I intend to standardise the provisions used for assessment across the different payments and I have taken the opportunity of the introduction of the one parent family payment and disability allowance to begin this process.  The provisions to be applied for these payments are that the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded.  The next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000 will be assessed at 15 per cent.  The substantially improved disregard of £2,000 significantly reduces the effect of interest rates for most recipients.  There is a difference between the practical reality that most lone parents do not have capital stashed away and the theory that if one has in excess of £22,000 one will receive a reduced one parent family payment.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Bill amends certain provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, and introduces some new provisions.  The Bill incorporates a number of mainly technical amendments to the Pensions Act which have been proposed by the Pensions Board.  I see this Bill as being the completion of a cycle that began in 1990 when the Pensions Act was introduced in this House.</P>
      <P>At the time of introducing the 1990 Pensions Bill, the then Minister said it was the most important legislation concerning occupational pensions to have come before the House since the foundation of the State.  Events in other jurisdictions since that time confirm the wisdom and foresight in bringing in the Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> In this regard it is proper to praise my predecessors for their commitment to the process of protecting the individual pensions of members of occupational pension schemes, a process which I have continued and of which this Bill is a part.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Pensions Act, 1990, is to regulate occupational pension schemes, ensure that they are properly administered and that, above all, the pension rights of members and their dependants are and continue to be adequately safeguarded.  My primary aim and intention at all times is the protection of individual members who are entitled to be secure in the knowledge that, when their day of retirement comes, their occupational pension is safe and the standard of living they planned for themselves and their partners in their retirement, by contributing to their occupational pension fund, will be realised.</P>
    <P>This was achieved by setting down minimum standards in key areas and by creating a framework for the regulation and supervision of schemes.  The Act provided for minimum preserved benefits for members who leave a pension scheme &mdash; for example on changing employment; the introduction of a minimum funding standard for certain funded schemes; the mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members with requirements for periodic actuarial valuations, annual reports and audited accounts; equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes; and the establishment of a new statutory body called An Bord Pinsean, or the Pensions Board, to monitor and supervise the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>At present the board is comprised of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members. This Bill will extend the ordinary membership from 12 to 14 and I will explain the reasons when I outline the specific provisions contained in the Bill.  The board includes representatives of trade unions, employers, Government and the various professional groups involved with occupational pensions.  The board has a chief executive and other staff to <Col N="251" /> manage its affairs.  The administrative expenses of the board are financed by fees payable annually by pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The board can act on behalf of any member of an occupational pension scheme who is concerned about the failure of those responsible for administering a scheme to adequately protect his or her pension rights.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board has proved its effectiveness over its first five years and I have no doubt it will play a continuing and important role in ensuring that the occupational pensions of individual members are safeguarded.  As Members will be aware, the first board completed its term of office the week after this Bill was published last December.  I take this opportunity to thank the first board's chairperson.  Mary Broughan, the members of that board, the chief executive, Gerry Mangan and his staff, for their hard work over the past five years, which has helped to ensure that the provisions of the Act have been successful, and in assisting me in formulating the provisions of this Bill.  Indeed this Bill is a fitting testament to the hard work they put in over their five year term.</P>
    <P>I also take the opportunity of thanking the new Chairperson, Eamon Heffernan, and members of the current board for agreeing to serve for the next five years.  Many of the members of the current board also served on the first one, and I trust that their willingness to continue means they consider the board's work to be valuable and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The pensions industry is of major importance to the economy.  The total asset value of pension funds is estimated to be in the region of £16 billion, equivalent to almost 50 per cent of GNP. When one considers the magnitude of this figure, one realises the economic and social significance of these funds, the importance of them being fully safeguarded, and the contribution to investment that they make.</P>
    <P>In recent months my colleague, the <Col N="252" /> Minister for Finance, has had discussions on the subject of increasing pension fund investment in the economy with the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Irish Association of Investment Managers.  Arising from these discussions, the three parties have agreed that a new study should be undertaken on the scope for increasing pension fund investment in the Irish economy.  The aim of the study is to identify commercially viable investment opportunities in the domestic economy and the potential for increasing the participation of Irish pension funds in the financing of such opportunities.  The study will also examine whether there are gaps in capital markets in terms of meeting economic needs for long-term finance and if so, what mechanisms or instruments can be developed to iron out such imbalances.  In carrying out the study, the consultants will have full regard to the commercial and fiduciary responsibilities of pension fund trustees.</P>
    <P>For much of our history old age, widowhood and permanent incapacity brought with them poverty, deprivation and dependency.  The progress that has been made in developing the overall social welfare pensions system has meant that a reasonable, basic level of pension is now avaiable.  The old age contributory pension and retirement pension rates are well in excess of the main target rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The increases in this year's budget will bring them to 110 per cent of that rate.  This year's increases also bring all remaining social welfare payments to at least 92 per cent of this main rate.  This year, the widow's and widower's contributory pension will reach the main rate for the first time, while carer's allowance will reach 99 per cent of it and invalidity pension 97 per cent.  The bulk of the remaining payments will then be at 95 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>Economic performance has been very strong in recent years and the economic outlook remains very positive.  It is most important that we take advantage of this opportunity to put in place adequate <Col N="253" /> levels of income support for those who need it.  While it is clearly necessary to bring the remaining payment levels up to the main target rate recommended by the commission, it is also appropriate to review from time to time what constitutes a minimum adequate level of income.  To this end, and in line with the commitment in the Government programme, I have initiated such a review which is being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The report will provide an objective basis for assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the current levels of social welfare entitlements.  The review will also discuss how the proposed rates could be indexed in future years.</P>
    <P>In December 1993 the National Pensions Board brought forward its final report, Developing the National Pension System.  As Deputies will be aware, the National Pensions Board had already completed four valuable reports prior to this one.  All of those reports were published and many of the recommendations implemented.  This final report is a very comprehensive one which deals with all issues relating to social welfare pensions and also deals with the relationship between social welfare pensions and occupational pensions. The issues this report raises, while not directly linked to this Bill, nonetheless will have a bearing on the future direction of pensions both in social welfare and the occupational area.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the members of the National Pensions Board for their hard and dedicated work which produced five valuable reports.  Their efforts are very much appreciated by the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope to bring forward proposals based on the recommendations of the National Pensions Board report in next year's budget.  The question, for example, of the introduction of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions falls to be considered in the context of this report and, of course, taking account of the overall future funding of pensions.</P>
    <P>A major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended <Col N="254" /> by the National Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by my Department and the pensions board and a report will be available by the middle of this year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of this new survey will give essential up to date information on occupational cover, which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>I have stated frequently in recent times that demands to abolish or significantly reduce contributions to the social insurance fund are short sighted given the demands which are currently being placed on it and which will grow in the years ahead.  I reiterate my views that we must preserve the principle of solidarity embodied in the social insurance system if we are to guarantee pensions needed in the future due to the ageing of the population.</P>
    <P>I stress that there is no danger to anyone's current pension entitlement. However, as I pointed out earlier, demographic and labour market changes are issues which we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided we face up, over the next few years, to the needs which we know will arise because of these changes, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee of the pensions board undertook a major review of the Pensions Act with a view to recommending the necessary changes to complete the cycle that began with the introduction of the Pensions Act, 1990.  Both the Department and the pensions board were well aware that teething problems were likely to arise with the Act. However, after a period of five years it is now considered desirable, if not essential, that a period of certainty should ensue.  Accordingly, this Bill results from a comprehensive review of the legislation with a view to making the necessary amendments so that no further amendments will be necessary in the short-term.  This may not be entirely possible in the area of equal treatment where final clarification of a number of European Court cases and directives on <Col N="255" /> equal treatment as regards pensions are being considered and may necessitate further changes in our pensions legislation. These matters will be considered in conjuction with the pensions board in due course and, if necessary, amendments will be made through a future pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>Overall this Bill reinforces the safeguards already in place in relation to occupational pensions and it is my hope and belief that it will stengthen the certainty that when the individual members or schemes come to retirement age their pension will be waiting safely for them to ensure their continued prosperity in retirement.</P>
    <P>I will briefly go through the provisions contained in each section of the Bill.  Section 1 simply defines the Pensions Act, 1990 as being the Principal Act.  Section 2 provides for certain definitions to be amended or inserted. Section 3 corrects an anomaly that exists by expanding the grounds for the defence of a person being prosecuted for an offence under the Pensions Act or its regulations.  This will particularly benefit trustees of schemes provided, of course, they act in an honest and honourable fashion.  This section also extends to two years, from the date of an offence, the time within which a summary prosecution can be brought.</P>
    <P>Section 4 extends the power of the pensions board to enable them to provide guidelines on the operation of the Pensions Act generally as, at present, their powers only allow them to issue guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of trustees.  Section 5 strengthens the powers of the pensions board in carrying out investigations.  It particularly authorises that a person other than an employee of the board can carry out such an investigation.  This person would, of course, have to be authorised by the board to act on their behalf. Section 6 extends confidentiality and prohibition on disclosing information to those serving on committees of the pensions board.  These had been inadvertently omitted from these provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Section 7 clarifies procedures in relation to the determination of disputes by the pensions board.  As I stated, I will be bringing forward oral hearing regulations when this Bill is enacted.  Section 8, 9 and 10 are technical amendments. Section 8 clarifies the situation in relation to calculating preserved benefits in specific instances.  Section 9 deals with an anomaly in relation to a situation that could possibly arise where a person could receive a refund of his or her contributions without terminating his or her employment and then qualify for a preserved benefit as well, if he or she subsequently left employment. Section 10 clarifies the position of a death benefit in the calculation of a transfer payment where a preserved benefit is involved.  It also clarifies certain matters in relation to the transfer of preserved benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows that forfeiture of a preserved benefit may occur, at the discretion of the trustees, in a situation where a member assigns or charges his preserved benefit and where in the circumstances it would be to the benefit and advantage of the member to have this forfeiture of his perserved benefit take place.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is another technical amendment.  This allows regulations to specify how a preserved benefit should be calculated where, within a particular scheme, a member's benefits are calculated partially on a defined benefit basis and partially on a defined contribution basis.  Section 13 allows for the payment of a preserved benefit later than normal pensionable age, but only in a situation where the member requests it to happen.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives the pensions board an option, in certain circumstances, to modify the provisions in relation to the production and submission of an actuarial funding certificate.  This would be in a situation where it could be in the best interests of the members of the scheme to do so.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, yesterday evening when Deputy Woods moved Second Stage of his Adoption Bill, 1996 which was ordered by the Dáil to be printed on 13 February last, he displayed a document entitled, Adoption Bill, 1996.  This document, also entitled the original No. 8 of 1996, differs substantially from the Adoption Bill, 1996, which was given a First Reading in this House.</P>
      <P>This bogus version of the Adoption Bill, 1996, was delivered to me in the House minutes before I was due to speak on the Bill and I was not given an opportunity to read it, never mind give it the consideration a Minister's reply demands.  At the very least, it introduced confusion into the debate on a subject about which many people feel passionately and which requires to be handled with the greatest sensitivity.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to rule whether the action by Deputy Woods was in accordance with the rules and procedure of the House.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear, without doubt or ambiguity of any kind, that there is but one Bill before the House, that is, the Adoption Bill, 1996, the official House document printed on green paper which Dáil Éireann gave leave to introduce on 13 February last and which will be decided on by this House later this evening.  I deem it, therefore, premature, irregular and most confusing to talk of an amended text of a Bill as this is a matter for a later Stage, if the Bill is proceeded with.  It pre-empts any consideration by <Col N="258" /> the Chair of the allowance of any proposed amendments in that regard.  It is something which I cannot countenance and which I hope will not arise again.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear that on many occasions amendments are suggested on Second Stage. That is a normal procedure employed by Ministers and Members of the Opposition. I did so in my speech and I outlined the type of amendment involved. As a courtesy to the Minister, I gave him a draft copy of how the Bill would look if it was so amended on Committee Stage.  There is nothing confusing or irregular about that.  Indeed, the only difference was that as a courtesy I set out for the Minister how those amendments would fit in with this Bill.  At no stage did I suggest that the Bill in question was not the one before the House.</P>

      <P>I did not.  I resent the statement by the Ceann Comhairle in this regard.  In terms of the precedent and custom of this House, it is clear that Committee Stage amendments are introduced and discussed, at least in principle, on Second Stage.  The only point on which it would appear that the Chair is taking exception is in relation to the further draft copy of how these amendments would affect the Bill; there is nothing unusual about that.  I spoke on the Bill before the House.  I believe the Minister did not understand what was happening and I will deal with that in my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Woods was very well intentioned in what he did, but I assert that it caused complications.  I will give some of the reasons there are additional complications. It is a long-standing rule of the House that a Member wishing to circulate a letter or a document in the House must do so by permission of the Chair and its officials and no such permission was sought from me yesterday during Private Members' time.  I should <Col N="259" /> say further that a Minister, according to precedent, is allowed to read important statements of policy or fact and, on this basis, is allowed to circulate a script.  In the case of other Members, however, the Chair takes the view that Members are referring to extended notes and not reading from a prepared script.  The Chair has given a great deal of latitude in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, if a Deputy, other than a Minister or Minister of State, attempts to distribute a script in advance of speaking, then the Chair would be left with no alternative but to insist on the long-standing rule that a Member is not entitled to read his speech but may consult notes.  A Minister, according to precedent, is allowed to read important statements on policy or fact.  The rule exists and I have deliberately and of set purpose very largely ignored that rule because to apply it, in the strictest sense, would disadvantage the majority of Members and would snip scripts from their hands.  The rule exists if Members want it, but they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not particularly mind about that because I am prepared to take what the Minister has to offer. However, I strongly object to the introduction of a precedent with which I agree, that is, that Members should only refer to notes.  However, the Chair knows that that precedent was dropped years ago and has not been implemented in this House because I have commented on this frequently.  I had notes which I will show to the Ceann Comhairle and of which I gave a typed version to the Official Reporter <Col N="260" /> and made available elsewhere.  I assure the House they were prepared by me last weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Woods, for introducing this Bill.  I have been following this debate and am amazed at the Minister's disgraceful behaviour.  I cannot understand why he is getting involved in splitting hairs on such a sensitive matter, one which is of genuine concern to every Member of this House.  I was here this morning when Deputy Woods asked for the co-operation of the Government parties on this Bill.  I was astounded then at the negative response of the Tánaiste on behalf of the Government and I think that is the reason for what has happened tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is missing the point. Deputy Woods, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, is trying to tell the Minister <Col N="262" /> that this Bill is tailor-made for the committee system.  One of the Minister's colleagues, Deputy Alan Shatter, agrees with Deputy Woods on that point.</P>
    <P>We heard much about and were lectured on Dáil reform.  We were told of the need to make the committee system work and become more meaningful.  We were told by Ministers and the Chief Whip that it is important to give Members of the Opposition a chance. All that rhetoric was a lot of nonsense. Is it any wonder that we have such poor attendance at committee meetings when Deputies realise that the committee system is merely being used as another means of propping up this Government and giving key positions to members of its parties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the truth.  The committee system is being used to stifle a good Bill which has tremendous public support.  It is a relatively simple Bill but it has profound implications for many people, thousands of adopted children and adoptive parents who want their children to be given the status they deserve, a status which should be recognised in Ireland.  It is not much to ask that these children not be treated as second class citizens.  China's adoption laws are not compatible with the Adoption Act, 1991, and we must deal with that matter.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have been approached by the parents of adopted Paraguayan children.  I know one couple who have adopted a child from Paraguay, a country which would also fall into the category of incompatible states. Deputy Woods's Bill will allow by way of regulation for countries, including Paraguay, to be regarded under Irish law in a similar way to China.  It will provide for registration as in the case of Chinese adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Tánaiste announced dramatically that 1,500 adoption files had been discovered in the national archives.  The Bill will provide for a voluntary contact register to enable a birth <Col N="263" /> mother and an adopted child to make contact with each other if both wish to do so, not just children adopted in the US and other countries but also children adopted in Ireland.  This is an important point.  Everybody accepts this is a sensitive and complex matter but it is evident that such a register would help heal much of the pain and trauma for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister would not support this basic and humane proposal.  We have heard much about the special position of children in this Government's programme of legislation. Sadly, having observed the Minister's response to my party's legislative proposals, there is little evidence to support that concern.  What we have heard tonight exposes the hypocrisy and the platitudes of this Government.  All its statements of concern mean nothing. Let it be judged by its actions.  I call on the Government to support the passing of this Bill to Committee Stage.  I warn the Minister not to oppose it because he will not be thanked for doing so.</P>
    <P>What we have heard tonight is not acceptable.  I was a Member of this House when Deputy Alan Shatter produced a good Bill in Opposition.  This Bill is in the same vein.  It has widespead support among the general public not only in relation to China.  I ask the Minister to stop this nonsense of trying to stifle a good Bill produced by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was published by the Fianna Fáil Party on foot of the appalling revelations regarding the conditions in Chinese orphanages.  I <Col N="264" /> appreciate absolutely the impulses which prompted Deputy Woods to draft this legislation.</P>
      <P>In drafting the Bill he did not know, nor could any of us have known, that we would gain a new insight a few weeks later into the tragic history of Ireland's orphanages in the 1950s and 1960s.  Irish children were consigned not to dying rooms but to rooms and buildings where they suffered intolerable pain and suffering. The revelations in the documentary &ldquo;<i>Dear Daughter</i>&rdquo; shocked us profoundly, yet at some level we were aware of the facts it contained.  We all knew that the children of what were then seen as illicit liaisons were not cherished equally as per the Constitution. We all knew that those children were made to pay the price for their parents' so called transgressions, real or imagined.  During the past few weeks, we were forced to look into the mirror of our own past and what we saw reflected there was not a pretty sight.  It was a portrait of intolerance, bigotry and of a narrow morality which places conformity above compassion at every turn.</P>
      <P>While the country was still trying to come to terms with the ordeal undergone by Christina Buckley and her companions, we were forced to confront yet another hidden corner of our past &mdash; the confirmation that up to 2,000 children were exported to the United States of America.  The issue of foreign adoptions is not confined to China, Romania or the famine stricken regions of Africa. The terrible revelations of the past few weeks have brought the matter uncomfortably home to us, not only in this Parliament but among the general public at large.  The children who were exported to the United States, whom we as a society had decided were surplus to requirements, were denied the most basic right of all, their own past.  Birth certificates were falsified and other details surrounding their birth were also deliberately obscured.  For far too long, both as a society and a State, we have covered up our mistakes in the past and shoved them under the carpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> In deciding to reveal the existence of the archives detailing the export of our children, the Tánaiste made it public as soon as he became aware of them.  This was a welcome break from the time-hallowed tradition of concealment.  Not only the individuals concerned but we as a society owe him a debt of gratitude in that respect.  However, the Tánaiste's announcement was only the first step in a process.  We are now faced with the far more difficult task of deciding how these files should be handled.  While they should obviously not be open to the general public, neither should they be permitted to disappear again into the vaults of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the relevant authorities will handle this matter sensitively and with due regard for the rights of all concerned &mdash; the birth mother, the adoptive parents and most importantly, the child.  It may never be possible for us to give back their history to all the children of the 1950s and 1960s. However, it is possible for us to ensure that no child in the future is ever denied his or her past.  We now know something of what happens to children who are sent for foreign adoption.  We must draw on our own experience to ensure that no child brought into Ireland from another jurisdiction suffers what happened to our children in the past.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, provides that an adoption must be carried out in accordance with our law and the laws of the child's country of origin.  That provision may not of itself be sufficient to safeguard a child's interests.  Recent revelations regarding present conditions in other jurisdictions and past conditions in Ireland have given us a new insight into the problems surrounding adoptions, particularly transnational adoptions.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts the desirability of modifying the 1991 definition of a foreign adoption to secure recognition of adoptions effected under laws such as those in China.  While I welcome the Minister's statement last night, we have to revisit our adoption law as a whole. In the long term we need to formulate <Col N="266" /> a new consolidated adoption law which provides an updated and sensitive framework for both domestic and foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>In the context of such legislation, we must examine the establishment of a contact register enabling children and their birth mothers to make contact with one another, should they so wish.  Such contact must obviously be restricted and regulated to protect individual privacy and to ensure psychological and emotional strain is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>There are already strict regulations in place governing the rights of adopted children to trace their natural parents and they could easily be adapted for the reverse situation.  We also must address the regulations governing the adoption process.  At present, adoption procedures are largely determined by individual adoption societies and many of the criteria applied to prospective adoptive parents are too stringent and militate against the children's interest.  Children up for adoption who are, by definition, vulnerable, must be placed in a stable and secure environment. However, current practices effectively exclude many prospective parents for financial, religious or age reasons.  These reasons would not prevent them from becoming parents in the natural course of events and they need not prevent them providing a loving and stable home.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a regulatory system which is transparent and unbureaucratic and takes full account of the individual circumstances of all concerned &mdash; the children and the natural and adoptive parents.  In tabling this Bill, Deputy Woods has provided us with a welcome opportunity to debate some of the issues surrounding adoptions.  I congratulate him.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I outlined, we should not add yet more legislation to the often impenetrable jigsaw which constitutes our adoption laws.  Rather, legislation in this area should be revisited as a whole. This debate, prompted by Deputy Woods, will help clarify some of the issues which must be addressed.</P>

      <P>I was listening to Deputy Kitt's contribution when I was preparing to speak.  I was amazed to hear him talk about this Government prevaricating etc.  I have not been a Member of this House for long &mdash; I came here in 1989 &mdash; and I had the experience of seeing Fianna Fáil in Government for most of that period.  It is a little painful to hear a Deputy from that party criticise this Government in its approach to committees and in getting work done.  The Deputy has only to look back through the records to see the performance of many of his colleagues in that period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt was speaking on a Bill about which I know nothing.  The Bill I read in preparing for this debate was the Adoption Bill, 1996, as presented by Deputy Woods.  As far as I know, there is no other such Adoption Bill before us.  This was the Bill issued to my office. It is the only Bill on this matter that I have and hence I will speak on that alone.  Deputy Kitt's statements seem to indicate that there is a totally different Bill available but I have not seen it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Woods for bringing forward this Bill.  Having been a spokesman in Opposition, I know what it is like.  I also know the difficulties associated with trying to put material together with scarce resources.  One is depending on the good will of friends and experts in the various fields to help them to survive in Opposition.  It is not good enough.  Some form of support and resources should be made available for Opposition spokespersons because they do not stand a chance against a Minister on the floor.  It should be considered in the long term and I agree with any move to provide increased support to Opposition spokespersons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to validate the adoption of children from the People's Republic of China.  I support the very worthy aspiration that people who adopted children from China should be supported by the legislature. Recent television programmes have led us to believe that the conditions in Chinese orphanages for children who have <Col N="268" /> been deserted or abandoned are anything but good and children are brought up in terrible conditions.  If people in this country can provide a family setting for some of those children and give them the opportunities available to Irish children, it is worth doing.  The sentiments in this Bill are to be commended. The Bill was introduced out of concern for children and their adoptive parents who, having taken these children in, should be permitted to keep them.</P>
    <P>During my short time in public life I have met many couples anxious to adopt children but none were available here for adoption.  They sought to adopt in Romania and elsewhere.  I recall one couple who were desperate and felt they should adopt relatively quickly before they became too old.  They were offering, to any child they might adopt, a stable home, a comfortable future and good educational opportunities.  The adopted child would probably have enjoyed succession rights in that family. That is something worth considering. The couple felt their lives were incomplete without children and wanted to share what they had with someone else.</P>
    <P>This legislature should, as far as possible, facilitate such people and the Bill proposes to do so.  However, it is somewhat incomplete and that is borne out by a letter many Members received yesterday from the parents of adopted Paraguayan children.  It states:</P>
    <P>Other incompatible states have allowed Irish families to adopt children through their courts with the result that a growing number of adopted children living in this country do not have their status recognised in this State.  Paraguay is one of these countries.  The Irish families who have adopted in Paraguay are anxious that any new legislation should take account of their position and remove them from the legal limbo they currently occupy.  The compatibility requirement of the 1991 Act is at the root of the difficulty in both the Paraguayan and Chinese cases.</P>
    <P>The parents proposed an amendment <Col N="269" /> but if it was made, who is to say there might not be difficulties with adopting children from Chile or some other country in the future?  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to bring forward comprehensive legislation to deal with all cases.  This must be done carefully, cautiously and correctly, in the first instance because it involves the future of young children and the happiness of their adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>I recall meeting another couple anxious to adopt a child.  They were given a child initially to foster.  The child lived with them for a number of months and they hoped for a legal adoption. After six months, the natural mother wanted her baby and it had to be returned to her.  The adoptive parents were shattered.  We must ensure this type of situation does not recur.  It is traumatic for the parents and the child and this must be borne in mind in our discussions.</P>
    <P>In recent months we heard much about past adoptions in Ireland.  We should hang our heads in shame at the practices which were commonplace in Ireland.  There was a home for unmarried mothers in my own area &mdash; Castle-pollard, County Westmeath.  Young girls were placed in this home, gave birth and, in many cases, put their children up for adoption.  Records of many adoptions are available from county councils, which, at that time, were responsible for health care within their areas.  When the Tánaiste reviews the information available on those adoptions he should request county councils in whose areas such homes were located to review their archives.  I am sure more material will come to light.</P>
    <P>The contact register is a very worth-while proposal.  I am sure the Minister of State will seek to introduce it.  I am reminded of the case of a young man I know quite well who has been trying to trace his natural mother for a number of years.  He enlisted my help and I identified his mother.  I have not been able to contact her but have requested her family to ask her to contact the young man or make herself available to him. <Col N="270" /> No response has been forthcoming and the individual in question is shattered that his mother may be alive but is not anxious to meet him.  That is particularly sad for him because of a recent high profile reunion of another adopted person &mdash; who may even be his cousin.  The young man saw the case in the newspaper, realised he shared the same name and wondered about the possibilities. Each day he waits for the postman to deliver a letter from his real mother stating that she is anxious to meet him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Until recently adoption seems to have been a controversial issue in Ireland and the number of infants offered for adoption was in decline.  In 1994 the number of in-family adoptions represented almost 60 per cent of all adoptions.  I compliment Deputy Woods on his initiative in bringing forward this Bill.  I hope the Government responds with promised speed to ensure that the necessary changes, to which the Minister of State's speech referred, are effected without undue delay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods has done a fine service in bringing forward this Bill which attempts to deal with recognition, in Ireland, of adoptions completed in China.  Deep public concern was aroused following the recent television programme dealing with orphanages in the People's Republic of China.  There is obviously a desire among Irish people to adopt such children to give them the opportunity to grow up in a settled family environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent revelations about the regimes that existed in some of our own residential institutions do not permit us to sit in judgement of events in other countries. As a society, we abrogated our responsibilities in so far as we appeared to adhere to a policy of out of sight, out of mind.  We must learn from the mistakes, errors and inadequacies of the past and work in close co-operation with the relevant Chinese authorities to promote the welfare of children.  The latter must <Col N="271" /> be the paramount consideration in legislation here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We should consider entering a bilateral adoption agreement with China as quickly as possible to facilitate the adoption of children by persons resident in Ireland.  We must learn from the situation which confronts us in Ireland, and to which several speakers referred, where children were sent abroad in the past.  We must ensure that any such agreement with China would contain appropriate safeguards to avoid this type of situation.</P>
    <P>To effect an effective bilateral adoption agreement with China, the aim must be to ensure that the status of Chinese children adopted in this country would be fully recognised here.  We would thereby ensure that these children will enjoy the same rights as children born and reared here.  The nonrecognition of Chinese or other foreign adoptions, such as Paraguayan adoptions referred to by Deputy McGrath, affects the adoptive parents' entitlement to full parental rights with respect to the child.  This arises from the non-compatibility of the adoption legislation of countries, such as China and Paraguay, with Ireland's legislation as required by the 1991 Adoption Act.</P>
    <P>Adoptive parents now find themselves in limbo.  Any changes we wish to bring forward must be fundamentally compatible with the 1991 Adoption Act. This legislation, which has been referred to very often in the House over the past 24 hours, had its genesis in a Private Members' Bill which was similar to that introduced by Deputy Woods.  The Bill was introduced by Deputy Shatter who was motivated by concern for those parents who adopted children in Romania and were encountering problems caused mainly by the lack of legislation providing for the recognition of foreign adoptions here.</P>
    <P>This extremely important Act dealt with the consequential and final effects of an adoption order, such as the rights and duties of the adoptive parents when <Col N="272" /> the adoption order is made and recognised. This is the nub of the problem in relation to China in so far as it is possible to terminate or revoke the adoption under its legislation.  This is obviously at odds with the position under our legislative framework.  I understand that the Government accepts the desirability of modifying the existing legislation on foreign adoptions to secure the recognition of adoptions effected under such laws. This should apply to a number of countries, such as Paraguay which has already been mentioned, and others.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Currie's reservations about a number of aspects of the Bill proposed by Deputy Woods but it should not be too difficult for a draftsman to extend the scope of the Bill to recognise foreign adoptions and encompass the four principal categories of adopters as recognised in the 1991 Act based upon ordinary residence, domicile and the habitual place of residence. It is critical that any change effected in the law would, as a minimum, encompass all these categories as specified in the 1991 legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Woods on ensuring that the pre-adoption procedure provided for in section 5 of the 1991 Act applies to his proposal.  It is imperative that it applies to any proposals brought forward in this field to ensure that Irish residents complete this procedure to have the adoption recognised as valid.</P>
    <P>This is a complex area of law and we must pay careful attention to any amendments brought forward to ensure that, in affecting a desirable amendment to our law on foreign adoptions, we do not create an anomaly down the line in our system of statutory recognition.  No matter what Bill is eventually brought forward, it will have to be teased out on Committee Stage to ensure the desired effect of the Bill would encompass necessary details and an anomaly is not created.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Government is urgently bringing forward specific legislative proposals to deal with these matters.  I am also glad <Col N="273" /> to note that the issues raised by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland will be dealt with in any new adoption Bill.  I was disappointed that the issues raised in the Keegan ruling were not addressed at an earlier stage.  I commend Deputy Woods on his initiative in bringing forward this Bill and I hope that the Government responds with the promised speed to ensure that the changes referred to are effected without delay. Otherwise, the words of concern expressed over the past number of weeks will be nothing more than empty rhetoric.</P>

      <P>I deplore the antics of the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  The procedural wrangle which Deputy Currie initiated without notice and his condemnation of my colleague, Deputy Woods, are only another decoy, a shabby excuse and alibi for inaction. Now that the Minister for Health has appeared in the House, I appeal to him directly to change his attitude and the Government's approach to this Bill which is frankly nothing short of contemptible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Shatter, a respected member of the Fine Gael party, speaking last night.  Deputy Shatter has more experience, expertise and knowledge in this area than any Member. He made two requests, one of the Opposition and one of the Government. He told the Government that this Bill is an appropriate vehicle which can be amended on Committee Stage and said it is the best way to get action at the earliest possible time.  He pointed out that the Government's approach would mean an infinitely longer time before the unfortunates which this Bill is designed to deal with can be helped.  He <Col N="274" /> said the Fianna Fáil Bill was an appropriate vehicle which could be amended on Committee Stage and he asked the Government to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter pointed out to the Opposition that this should not be made a political issue or political football and we should not be confrontational or contentious in the matter.  I am prepared to accept his advice, although with great difficulty, because I could be very contentious in this matter if I wished.  However, I will accept Deputy Shatter's advice and I ask the Government to accept his advice and the request he made to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter is the author of the Bill dealing with Romanian babies.  He admitted last night that if the Government in 1991 had not accepted that Bill immediately, with all its flaws and defects which were ironed out on Committee Stage, and moved to process it with alacrity, hundreds of parents who adopted Romanian babies would not have had the opportunity to do so and hundreds of babies would not have been adopted and found care, love and affection in this country.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State in the Department of Justice, Deputy Shatter introduced a Private Members' Bill on quite a different topic and I was asked by the Government of the time whether we should accept it.  It proposed changes to the law on commercial tenancies.  I advised the Government that we should accept it and we did.  The legislation which was eventually enacted after a detailed Committee Stage debate was different in many material respects from the Bill proposed by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>If we proposed a Bill to deal with some other aspect of landlord and tenant law and the Government refused to accept it, we could justifiably complain. We could say the Government is not being consistent as we accepted an Opposition Bill on a similar topic, complete with flaws, and ironed it out on Committee Stage.  The Bill we are proposing tonight is infinitely more important.  Landlord and tenant law is only about property.  Tax legislation is <Col N="275" /> only about money and local government legislation is only about local government. This Bill deals with matters of life and death.</P>
    <P>Unwanted Chinese babies have been herded in orphanages in conditions of unspeakable, almost sadistic, cruelty and deprivation.  They are dying in their hundreds on a regular basis.  These are human beings who have the right to life and if we can help a few of them, why should we not do so now?  Have they not waited long enough?  How much longer are they supposed to wait while the bureaucracy in this country takes its course?  Thousands of Irish parents and children have a void in their lives which can only be filled by being united with each other.  We can facilitate that process now.  Many of these parents are elderly and many do not have long to live. Have they not waited long enough? Should we not help them at the earliest possible opportunity?  We can do that now by using this Bill as a vehicle rather than waiting for a Government Bill which will not appear until some time in the future.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with Deputy Currie, who is Minister of State at various Departments.  He was sent in as some sort of political woodpecker to find holes in this Bill as an excuse not to accept it by a Government dominated by people who masquerade as socialists and people of concern.  Of course there are flaws in this Bill.  Has there been a Private Members' Bill or a Government Bill which could not be improved by debate on Committee Stage?  Has there not been a Government Bill longer than one section which contained some flaw that was not ironed out on Committee Stage?  There are flaws in this Bill which we will sort out on Committee Stage.  I am prepared to sit here for two or three days a week over Easter, if necessary, to sort out these flaws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I want to look at some examples of obstruction about which Deputy Currie was so concerned that he could not accept this Bill.  He is worried that the terminology &ldquo;the interest and the welfare of the child&rdquo; might not be equivalent to the terminology &ldquo;in the interests of the upbringing of the child&rdquo;. We can change that phrase with an amendment on Committee Stage.  He is also worried that Irish people resident abroad for a short period will not be able to avail of the Bill's provisions.  We can also change that on Committee Stage.  He pointed out that there is nothing in the Bill about the date from which it would be effective.  That is one of the reasons advanced by the Minister of State for refusing to accept the Bill. These nit-picking objections pale into insignificance when we remember the cries from the dying rooms.  This legal jargon and talk about paragraphs and schedules ignores the suffering, helpless human beings which this Government is refusing to help now.</P>
    <P>I do not want to patronise Deputy Currie who has a long record of concern about civil rights.  What civil rights are as important as Chinese babies' rights to life, love or care?  What civil rights are greater than the rights of parents and their natural children to meet each other?  Deputy Currie who has refused to accept progressive legislation from this side of the House is allowing himself &mdash; shamefully &mdash; to be turned into the Government's abominable no man.</P>
    <P>All Members agree that the people this Bill is designed to help should be helped.  The only point at issue between us is whether we help them now or at some time in the future.  I agree with Deputy Shatter who said time is of the essence.  Our bounden duty and moral responsibility is to help them now. There is no logic and, more importantly, there is no moral basis for further delaying tactics or prevarication.  These people are crying out to us in their anguish to help them.  We can extend a helping hand to them, so let us do so now.  No legalistic jargon, such as we heard last night, nit-picking or shabby <Col N="277" /> excuses constitute an acceptable delay when human life is at stake and human suffering can be ended.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to change his attitude to this Bill.  He will not be thanked if he maintains his present hard-faced approach but he will earn the respect and appreciation of many people who deserve help if he changes it.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy O'Dea and other speakers in expressing concern about the Government's tactic in relation to this Private Members' Bill. The same tactic was employed by the Government when I introduced the disabled voters' access Bill.  On that occasion, the Minister for the Environment expressed his support for the Bill's provisions, but promised to take his own action.  He stated that the issues would be considered by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on 12 and 13 March.  However, the Committee did not address this issue yesterday or today.  It meets tomorrow when it will briefly discuss a timetable but is unlikely to hold any substantive discussions before the summer recess.  I am, therefore, concerned about this Bill since the Government is employing the same tactic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods should be congratulated for introducing this Bill.  This is an emotional topic.  The relationship between children and parents is unique and personally defining.  Adoption has been given a lot of coverage in the media recently but it has always been an important issue.  I have been struck by the cases put by groups pushing for change in the statutory regulations on adoption.  There is a need for immediate action to address the key points.  Deputy Woods deals with these issues through a simple but effective amendment to the existing law.  He strives to give peace of mind to all those involved in the adoption process in other states.  In addition, he seeks to meet the calls of the Adoption Board and other agencies by establishing a voluntary contact register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provision of the Bill <Col N="278" /> deals with adoption between this State and the People's Republic of China. The provision deals with an important issue about which I am sure every Member has received representation.  The Bill, as drafted, meets the needs of those concerned and it will provide them with the security they require.  The other provision in the Bill to allow the Minister to extend the number of countries with whom we have regularised adoption arrangements is also important.  This would allow for reasonable flexibility and for speedy action by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other major issue which Deputy Woods is attempting to address is the establishment of a voluntary contact register.  Many people want to know more about their parents or children and this is a sensible, caring response to that situation.  This issue should not be delayed.  The Adoption Board and other adoption agencies have called for the establishment of a register.  Deputy Woods's proposal answers those calls.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a reasonable response to an important issue and Deputies should support it.  I am disappointed the Government has decided to use its strength to defeat the Bill.  In his contribution Deputy Currie demonstrated the short-sighted and inadequate Government response to this important matter. While he expressed appreciation for the Bill's provisions, he stated it was not properly thought out and that it contains defects.  He asked us to accept his plan to hold discussions on the issue and promised that the Government will at some future date propose changes to the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>This Government's response boils down to a simple result &mdash; delay and inaction.  Unfortunately, this is its attitude to many issues brought forward in Private Members' Time &mdash; I referred earlier to my Bill on disabled voters' access.  The Government is incapable of giving a serious reply to these important matters when included in Private Members' Bills &mdash; it can only resort to delaying them.  Parliamentary time has <Col N="279" /> been allocated to this issue and the prospect of a cross-party consensus would lead us to expect a reasonable response from the Government and a constructive contribution.  The matter is too important to be dealt with in the way the Government is attempting to handle it.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition must do their own research and drafting work and while they involve different experts and advisers it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings in their proposals. However, a reasonable response from the Government would be to allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage and then table amendments.  It is nowhere near adequate to say discussions will be held and changes proposed sometime in the future.  The need exists, the issue is before the House and Deputy Woods has expressly offered to deal with any amendments the Government might produce.  I am greatly concerned about this, especially because my disabled voters access Bill was treated in the same way.  There is delay and inaction on important issues which the Government can and should deal with, on which there is a consensus and which deserve a constructive response.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Woods on his initiative in bringing forward the Bill which provides a reasonable response to a serious issue and the Government should reverse its decision to oppose it. I join Deputy O'Dea in appealing to the Government to be sensible and constructive even at this stage and allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support the Second Reading of this Bill which is a response to a specific need, to provide for the registration in Ireland of adoptions of children in the People's Republic of China, to ensure they are valid in Irish law.  It is in response to an anomaly whereby Chinese law on adoption is not compatible with our legislation, although it was under the 1988 Act.  The Bill also provides that the <Col N="280" /> Minister for Health can, through regulation, designate other countries from which adoptions are regarded as valid under Irish law and allow them to be entered in the register.  The other provision is for a voluntary contact register so that a birth mother and an adopted child can make contact if they so wish.</P>
      <P>The Bill may be seen as a humanitarian and possibly a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; reaction to recent television programmes which alleged the ill-treatment of children in Chinese orphanages and showed harrowing pictures of what happened to them.  There must be an emotional response to such scenes but the Bill goes beyond that &mdash; it is not simply a kneejerk reaction to a specific incident, although it seeks to address those scenes.</P>
      <P>Not only are there people who wish to respond to those cases, there are Irish couples who went through the adoption process long before these programmes were seen or allegations made.  One couple waited at least three years to adopt a baby from China.  Their papers have been in Beijing for at least three months, long before the recent publicity. They were told by the Adoption Board that everything was in order but their hopes were dashed when the Chinese authorities were subsequently informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that the adoption could not be recognised as valid under Irish law. Despite what we saw taking place in orphanages, the Chinese authorities care about their children and would not allow them to be brought to a jurisdiction where they could not receive the full protection of the law.  In this heart-breaking situation, the couple have gone through all the proper procedures, have been deemed suitable adoptive parents by the Chinese and saw the lovely child they wished to adopt literally taken from their arms.  That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always reluctant to be critical of another country's record on the treatment of children, especially in the light of revelations about abuses at home, such as the most recent ones about <Col N="281" /> orphanages.  However, we cannot support or condone abuses anywhere and we must sound a cautionary note on the abuses in China.  We must be absolutely secure in the knowledge that our values and standards as a society are beyond reproach.  It must have been ironic for the Chinese Ambassador to have to respond to questions from people about the appalling conditions in her country at a time when there were revelations about child abuse here.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because it must be open to Irish couples to adopt children from whatever country they wish, if they are seen as fit parents.  We must be aware of the particular difficulties in cross-cultural adoption &mdash; I do not mean that we should discourage Irish couples who strongly wish to adopt children from other countries and to offer them a caring family environment in Ireland. However, we must strike a balance and recognise the special emotional needs, behavioural problems and questions of trust involved in cross-cultural adoption. As Deputy O'Dea said, we have all received heart-breaking representations from putative adoptive parents but we must take on board the caution expressed by the Adult Adoptees Association about cross-cultural adoptions. That body says that even within multi-cultural societies, cross-cultural adoptions have been shown to be fraught with difficulty for the adopted person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wood's Bill is pertinent on this point because the closed adoption system adds to the difficulties for foreign children or their original families who want to re-establish contact in years to come.  Those children may be linguistic or cultural aliens when they return as adults to their country of origin, according to the association.  It is important that we have specialised training to integrate institutionalised children into family life, quite apart from recognising the additional linguistic and cultural gulfs.  We must learn from the Romanian experience, when some children were returned to their orphanages when the difficulties <Col N="282" /> became insurmountable for their Irish adoptive families, because no resources or statutory support systems were made available.  Irish couples should have the freedom to adopt children from other countries provided they go through due process and the Bill provides for that. Post-adoption facilities must be in place for both families and children to cope with the undoubted extra strains imposed by cross-cultural adoption.</P>
    <P>Other so-called incompatible states have allowed Irish families to adopt children through their courts, with the result that a growing number of adopted children living here do not have their status recognised in the State.  This was alluded to earlier; the example given to me was Paraguay because Irish families who have adopted there are anxious to be removed from their current legal limbo.</P>
    <P>It should be possible through amendment to this Bill to allow the same validity in Ireland for adoptions in Paraguay and other countries as we are seeking for adoptions in the People's Republic of China.  It is right that under the 1991 Act Irish families have to go through arduous and lengthy assessment procedures before obtaining the Adoption Board declaration and the Department of Justice entry visa they require to adopt abroad.  It is indefensible that following that the children involved should be regarded as second class citizens in Ireland and the EU.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a voluntary contact register.  The previous Minister for Health gave a commitment that such a register would be established for adopted people wishing to contact birth relatives.  I support the principle of a register although there are some reservations about it being under the control of the Adoption Board which had the same status as a court and thus is inflexible. In this context, it is sad that details of the large number of babies from Ireland adopted in the US only came to light due to the work of Ms Catriona Crowe.  A voluntary register would alleviate the difficulty and the pain of <Col N="283" /> many adopted children and their adoptive and birth parents.  It would provide a safe, confidential environment where the issue of contact would be handled with sensitivity.</P>
    <P>Many women who had to give up their children for whatever reason genuinely fear being contacted and confronted by the child now an adult, and having their lives disrupted.  If it was handled sensitively and there was an environment in which contact could be established with sensitivity, it would be very helpful for the many people who wish to find where they came from and know about their birth parents and grandparents.  The urgent need for the register has been highlighted by the experience of the children adopted by American families many years ago.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is reluctant to accept the Bill.  He said last night it was fundamentally defective and that the Government would bring forward its own proposals to address the difficulties which have emerged with the operation of the 1991 Act.  We expect Bills to be amended on Committee Stage and perhaps on Report Stage.  This Bill has the potential to alleviate specific problems which are causing great suffering to children and <Col N="284" /> prospective parents.  I am disappointed there was not the openness in Government to accept the Bill, flawed as we may believe it to be, and seek to amend it on Committee Stage, It does not augur well for openness when Private Members' Bills from the Opposition are not accepted when, if they are deemed to be flawed, they can be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is not present for my reply.  We are dealing with item 22 on the Order Paper which is the Bill. There seems to have been some consternation about this matter and a misunderstanding on the part of the Minister of State which I find hard to understand. Most Members understand how the business of the House is conducted.</P>
      <P>I stand condemned for efficiency and courtesy to the Minister of State in trying to be helpful in explaining our Bill and the amendments we would make to it.  Anyone who knows how I behaved as Minister for Social Welfare will know that I provided the maximum possible information.  I transformed the Department in that regard.  Perhaps it is time to transform some of the procedures in the House.  We should be a little less shirty about the provision of information and courtesy.</P>
      <P>I mentioned my proposals for amendments on Second Stage.  That is a normal procedure.  There seems to be some confusion as to how I came to make these proposals.  I put forward this Bill initially in response to the Chinese babies. Representations were made to me and others about babies adopted from Paraguay and other countries to see if those categories could be included in the Bill.  We all agree the voluntary register is needed urgently and that the Legislature should tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I participated on Committee Stage of the Powers of Attorney Bill, 1995.  I put forward 27 amendments which I had signalled on Second Stage.  The Minister also put forward 27 amendments.  He <Col N="285" /> accepted some of my amendments, we agreed on others and left others to be argued on Report Stage.  The Bill is better for that process.  That Bill is to help people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, for example.</P>
    <P>There was nothing extraordinary about the procedure on this Private Members' Bill.  The matter is only a red herring.  It is a pity the Minister of State did not listen to our proposed amendments before making inaccurate observations on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the Hague Convention.  I am pleased the Government is to sign the convention. However, as the Minister of State clearly indicated it will be some considerable time before the convention becomes part of our law and before our adoption law is amended to accommodate it.  As the Bill is not inconsistent with the convention there is no good reason for not enacting it.  It is likely that even with the convention, legislation such as we propose will be necessary to deal with the problem of recognising adoptions effected in countries whose adoption law differs from ours.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to put off enacting this Bill, which deals with an immediate and compelling need, on the lame excuse that the adoption code will have to be amended in any event to accommodate the convention.  To do this is to ignore the urgent plight of those Chinese orphans who could be given good homes by Irish couples and the other babies and children who are seeking recognition here.  Surely the Minister cannot impose this kind of hardship for such an unworthy reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the question of a bilateral agreement on adoption with China.  While such an agreement would be a good thing, it is not necessary for Irish couples to effect adoptions in China.  Once a couple complies with the requirements of Chinese law in regard to adoption, and assuming they have been declared eligible and suitable <Col N="286" /> under the 1991 Act, they can effect an adoption in China and, under our proposed Bill, have it recognised and registered here.  This is a matter of international law and does not require a bilateral agreement between the Governments of Ireland and China. Deputy O'Dea was right to refer to these as red herrings.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is contemplating a bilateral agreement with China, he must have legislation of the kind proposed in our Bill which seeks to do precisely what the Chinese authorities require, namely to provide for the recognition in our law of adoptions effected in China.  For this reason alone, the Minister should welcome and support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the fact that the 1991 Act was introduced by Deputy Shatter as a Private Members' Bill and he properly acknowledges the work of the special committee which developed Deputy Shatter's original proposals into that Act.  Is it not a pity that the Minister is unable to take the same enlightened approach adopted by the Government of that time in supporting Deputy Shatter's Bill in principle and taking advantage of the goodwill towards it which existed on all sides of the House, with the consequent result that a very fine piece of humanitarian legislation was produced?  If the Minister induces his colleagues to vote against this Bill, a valuable opportunity to legislate on this important matter on an all-party basis will have been lost.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister and his officials have not paid attention to the amendments to the Bill proposed by us. The amendment to section 2 (1) of the Bill which states: &ldquo;any such country or countries that the Minister may, by regulations designate,&rdquo; will clearly and unambiguously enable the Minister to extend the Bill to such other countries as he may see fit.  Extending the scope of the Bill in this way would mean that further legilsation would not be <Col N="287" /> required while at the same time the Minister would be able to satisfy himself that any such extension is justified and does not compromise the integrity and quality of our adoption system.  Now that the Minister has belatedly considered this amendment, which solved his difficulty with the Bill, I assume he will change his attitude and support the Bill.</P>
    <P>The difficulty the Minister has with regard to the absence of a provision to cater for adoptions which are terminated under the law of the country where the adoption was effected is misplaced. The Minister should know that, when a foreign adoption is recognised and registered under the Act of 1991, the adoption is recognised in our law and has the same status and effect in our law as an adoption made under our own adoption code.  The fact that the adoption might be terminated under the law of the country where it was originally effected, after it was recognised and registered here, would not effect any change in the legal status of the adoption here.</P>
    <P>Whether one should make provision for revoking recognition and registration in these circumstances is debatable. Many would feel that, for good reasons, this should not be done.  I appreciate that others, for equally valid reasons, might disagree.  This should be teased out on Committee Stage.  We on this side of the House would carefully consider any amendment the Minister proposes to deal with his concern on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is critical because the scope of the Bill is restricted to adoptions effected by Irish residents.  As a central provision of the Bill dilutes or relaxes our law to a certain extent with regard to recognition of foreign adoptions. It is important, in the interests of maintaining the very high quality of our adoption system, to limit the extent of this relaxation to the minimum degree <Col N="288" /> necessary to solve the problem which our Bill seeks to address.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our Bill is to respond to the urgent need to enable Irish couples who have been declared suitable and eligible under the Act of 1991 to have adoptions effected in China, and such other countries as the Minister may designate, recognised and registered here.  In order to achieve this most desirable objective, the scope of the change in our adoption law proposed in our Bill has rightly been confined to a specific class of persons, namely Irish couples who have been declared eligible and suitable, and necessarily are residents of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister has overlooked the fact that the process of declaring persons to be suitable and eligible by the Adoption Board is confined to the residents of this State.  In view of the fact that the Minister welcomes the retention of this process in our Bill, his criticism of the Bill because it is not extended to apply to adopters living abroad, who would not be subject to the assessments that result in a declaration of eligibility and suitability, is as surprising as it is inconsistent.</P>
    <P>Our Bill is crafted carefully to meet a specific and urgent need.  If the Minister wishes to extend it further to provide for adoptions by people living abroad, we will listen respectfully to his proposals. If they have merit we will support them on Committee Stage.  The modification of condition (c) of section 1 of the 1991 Act, made in view of the fact that potential adopters must, before anything else, obtain a declaration of eligibility and suitability, is justified.  The fact that many of those orphans most acutely in need of adoption end up in orphanages in circumstances in which the kind of inquiry envisaged by condition (c) would not be entirely practicable accentuates the need for this change.</P>
    <P>The change the Minister suggests with regard to condition (d) of section 1 of the 1991 Act does not appear, on the <Col N="289" /> advice available to us from those familiar with this aspect of adoption, to be necessary.  However, if the Minister can make a convincing case for this change on Committee Stage we will support it. His difficulty concerning lack of clarity about the date of recognition is the result of the omission of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, which should have been included between the words &ldquo;order&rdquo; and &ldquo;upon&rdquo; in the fourth last line of section 2 of the Bill.  This should read: &ldquo;...to have been effected by a valid adoption order and upon an application on that behalf having been made to the board&rdquo;.  One of our amendments to the Bill is the inclusion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; as above discussed.  We have often included such words for Ministers in the form of routine technical amendments.  I am sure that when the Minister considers this amendment he will be satisfied that there is no lack of clarity on this matter and no departure from the scheme of 1991 in this regard.</P>
    <P>I reject the patronising assertion by the Minister that the proposed Bill is defective.  If he had attended to his duty by carefully considering the Bill and the amendments to it, which were circulated to him, he could not have made this ridiculous observation.  There are matters which, as with all Bills, require further teasing out on Committee Stage.  We look forward to taking advantage of the good will evident on all sides of the House with regard to this matter to produce, on Committee Stage and in co-operation with the Minister, excellent legislation.  The main objective is to address the urgent need to provide recognition in our law for the adoption of orphans from China and other countries, such as Paraguay.  We cannot fail <Col N="290" /> to respond in a generous way to those Irish couples who seek our assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Tánaiste wish to associate this Bill with the Keegan case. It has been almost two years since the decision in the Keegan case.  The Government has promised that its proposals will soon be ready.  However, it has nothing to do with this matter. There is no policy reason for associating these two issues.  It is purely a delaying tactic to avoid proceeding with our Bill. The Government is more concerned with taking the credit for being seen to act than for taking practical steps to solve an immediate and urgent need. This Bill is ready to go to a select committee now.  It has taken us two months to get this far.  Even if the Government keeps its new promise, at least two more months will be involved.  Four months is a long time for a baby to wait in the dying rooms.  The Government says it is concerned for the family, it is politically fashionable to be concerned for the family now.  I call on the Government to show concern for families who want to adopt and for the children they want to adopt.  Do not engage in this political charade.  Do not oppose this Bill on Second Stage.  Members on the Government side have suggested that this Bill be used as a vehicle.  If the committee system is used this new law can be in place by Easter.  Nothing could be more suited for all party agreement.</P>
    <P>Let Members be quite clear that if they vote against this Bill on Second Stage they will be voting against its principle. Forget the confusion created by the Minister of State.  The issue is the principle of the Bill and there is no basis for voting against it.  I do not believe Members can do this and I suggest that they let it go to Committee Stage to be considered on an all party basis.  Let us put the children first, for a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the matter of St. Joseph's national school, Killenummery, Dromahair.  At this stage, the Minister of State is aware of the problems at this school.  An application was made to upgrade the toilets in the school, which was sanctioned by the Department in September 1995, but this is only a small section of the work required.</P>
      <P>There are problems with regard to the condition of the windows, the provision of toilet accommodation for the teacher and of hot and cold water.  The windows and doors are defective and causing draughts.  A number of floors in the school need to be replaced.  In addition, there are problems relating to desks, chairs and general school furniture.  A major problem exists in terms of the playing facilities.  Part of the green area attached to the school was fenced off because it was waterlogged and in a dangerous condition.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister and her Department sanction the proposed renovations suggested by the board of management and the school's manager.  It is important sanction is given immediately so that the work can be done during the forthcoming summer holidays.  I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to this matter because nobody can expect pupils and teachers to work in the type of conditions in this school.  I hope she will be in a position to allow the board of management and the manager to proceed with bringing this school up to a condition suitable for pupils in 1996.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Ellis has given me the opportunity to outline to the House my <Col N="294" /> Department's current position in respect of St. Joseph's national school, Killenummery, Dromahair, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I am aware the school has a current staffing level of principal and two assistant teachers and an enrolment of 57 pupils.  The accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms and a prefabricated classroom.  I am aware that the accommodation and facilities are less than satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In May 1994 the school authorities requested grand-aid towards the cost of upgrading the sanitary facilities.  My Department's professional advisers recommended a new toilet block at an estimated cost of £16,000.  In September 1995 my Department sanctioned grant-aid of £13,600 towards the cost of these works.  The Deputy will appreciate that they require full planning permission and approval from the fire authority.  It is expected that tenders will be invited for these works by April.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received a request for grant assistance towards the cost of further improvements at this school.  The matter was referred to my Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, for a report.  On receipt of this report a decision regarding grant assistance will be conveyed to the school authorities in the light of available financial resources.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department appreciates the concerns expressed by the school authorities. The Deputy can be assured of my desire to see an improvement in conditions at the school and I thank him again for the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Child Sexual Abuse Victims.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter.  Arguably, the biggest crisis facing this State is the sexual, physical and <Col N="295" /> psychological abuse of a significant proportion of its children.  This phenomenon is now accepted by most people as a fact of Irish life.  It was not always so. We know that for generations many people in authority &mdash; parents, neighbours, the law or other responsible community members &mdash; were effectively complicit with actual abusers simply because they would not speak out or act on their suspicions.  A conspiracy of silence surrounded this awful crime and allowed its perpetrators to escape justice. Thankfully, that has changed.</P>
      <P>However, this change in attitude has forced us to face the awful reality of the widespread extent of this problem.  Last year, the Childline service received 10,348 calls about child abuse.  Each year, the number seeking help for sexual or physical abuse has continued to climb inexorably.  Last year was the busiest year ever for that confidential telephone line, with more than 2,000 children ringing every week.  Sexual abuse calls topped the list, followed closely by calls about physical abuse of children.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of bringing criminal prosecutions for incidents which happened many years ago are well documented. These are accentuated by the fact that the standard of proof in a criminal case, beyond reasonable doubt, is an extraordinarily high one.  However, many of these abusers could be made liable in a civil action.  In civil cases the standard of proof is less.  Many of these abusers are in a position to pay if a successful civil action could be taken against them.  However, the sad and unacceptable fact is that Irish law has allowed insurmountable barriers to stand in the way of the victims of child sexual abuse who wish to seek some vindication through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal barrier arises from the Statute of Limitations, 1957, which provides that a claim must be brought either within three or six years of the alleged act or acts of abuse.  That means <Col N="296" /> that victims of child sexual abuse who wish in adulthood to bring a civil action against the abuser will find their claim is effectively, statute barred.  If this situation is allowed to continue it is likely to reawaken the powerlessness and betrayal felt by the victims, leading inevitably to immense frustration and hopelessness.  The 1957 legislation was changed in 1991.  However, the bulk of legal opinion now is that that change will not assist the victims of child sexual abuse in the past who wish to bring a civil action.  The 1991 Act must be amended to allow them to do so as a matter of urgency.  I invite the Minister to state tonight whether he proposes to do that.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The principal among those is the issue of vicarious liability.  This issue concerns the liability of a principal, for example, an employer or an institution, for the acts of its servants or employees.  For example, it is quite unclear in what circumstances the Church will be liable for child abuse perpetrated by an individual cleric.  The attitude of the Government seems to be to allow this to be dealt with by judges on a case by case basis.  Inevitably, different opinions and judgements will emerge, and the net result will be a legal land-mine, similar to the incomprehensible maze into which occupiers' liability law had descended before it was clarified by a statute introduced by this Minister.  If the law on this vital matter is left to individual judges to make on a case by case basis, each judge will be ruled by his or her predilections and prejudices.  No lawyer will be able to clearly advise a victim as to whether, in the particular circumstances, he or she has a good case or a reasonable prospect of success.</P>
    <P>Legislation is now urgently needed to remove these barriers which the law has placed in the path of victims of child sexual abuse to enable the courts to place responsibility for this awful crime <Col N="297" /> where it truly belongs and ensure that past abusers can be made liable if a case is brought today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child sexual abuse is a heinous matter which society and our law condemns in the strongest terms possible.  As a crime it can be prosecuted and punished by means of heavy fines and imprisonment.  In that context, the distinction between criminal law and civil law is stark.  In criminal law the aim is the prevention and control of the abusive conduct by putting away in prison if necessary the perpetrator, whereas the civil law is largely concerned with the question of damages. We generally think of child sexual abuse as a crime and the criminal law aspects have received a good deal of attention by our Law Reform Commission and in legislation.  Recent reforms have addressed problems such as the giving of evidence in child sexual abuse cases and provision has been made for the criminal courts to order the payment by offenders, including sexual offenders, of compensation for injury or loss resulting from their offences.</P>
      <P>However, considerable attention in our laws has also been given to the civil aspects of the subject by way of implementation of the 1991 Child Care Act, and at the end of this month the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, will come into force.  That 1996 legislation increases the remedies available for acts of abuse against adults and children and strengthens the power of the Garda and health boards to act in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea, in bringing forward his motion on the Adjournment, framed the subject matter in general terms but the understanding has been that he would address two aspects, namely, the law concerning the time within which persons must bring civil actions and the law which imposes civil liability on a <Col N="298" /> party other than the actual wrongdoer. I will now deal with those two matters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy postulates that there are barriers in so far as those civil laws apply to child sexual abuse cases.  I welcome the Deputy's intervention in highlighting these areas and in putting them forward as matters which may require further analysis and attention.  However, that is not to say I accept his apparent assumption that the law has somehow placed barriers in the way of court actions in child sexual abuse cases.</P>
    <P>As regards the law on time limits, an important point to bear in mind is that while such periods do not generally apply to criminal actions, it is recognised that the longer the passage of time the more difficult it is to get a successful conviction.  This may simply be because of difficulty in getting together witnesses or because of the difficulties of witnesses in recollecting the facts.  Many other evidential aspects or links in the case may also have been dissipated or lost in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Where civil actions are concerned, the general rule by virtue of legislation of very long standing is that the action must be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrues.  There are important exceptions.  In the case of actions, for example, for damages for negligence when the damages are claimed in respect of personal injuries the period is three years, instead of six. Where children are concerned that three year limitation period does not begin to run until the injured person is 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The law on limitation periods was reviewed by the Law Reform Commission only a few years ago, following on which legislation was enacted in 1991 to provide, largely, that the three year period that applies generally in personal injuries cases may run from the date of knowledge of the facts relevant to the injury.  The 1991 Act makes clear if the person having the right to bring an <Col N="299" /> action was a child, either at the time when the right accrued or at the date of knowledge, the three year period does not start to run until the person reaches 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>In this whole area of the law there are, inevitably, competing interests and because of that not everyone will regard the law as being perfect.  Further changes would require careful study by any Government.  I am happy to take the Deputy's contribution to the debate into account in my Department's ongoing review of this area and if changes are found to be feasible and warranted, I shall be glad to consider them for legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea questions, also, the civil law which allows not just the actual wrongdoer but someone else to pay damages to the victim.  For upwards of two centuries an employer has been &ldquo;vicariously&rdquo; liable for the wrongful acts of his employee committed in the course of his or her employment.  The employer is not, of course, liable in the place of the employee &mdash; the employee remains liable as well and vicarious liability applies to practically the whole range of civil wrongs.  A justification for that liability is that the employer gets the benefit of the service of the employee and should, therefore, shoulder the losses when they arise.  Some argue that the employer is made a mark because his or her means are usually greater than that of the employee.  In any event, vicarious liability has been enormously extended over the years by the courts so that it may apply even where no formal relationship exists between the parties in question &mdash; it may on that basis be sufficient that a person had control over the acts of another.</P>
    <P>However, the law does not impose liability on an employer for all the wrongs committed by his or her employee and the question as to whether the wrong arose out of or within the scope of the employment is <Col N="300" /> very often one to be resolved in litigation. Relevant also is the question of whether the employer ought reasonably to have known or foreseen that the injury might take place.  It is plain that there can, in the nature of things, be no golden rule for determining the boundaries of a person's employment or control, as the case may be, over another. Every case must turn upon its facts. Again, the feasibility of possible changes in this area of the law has to be questioned closely.  If changes were to be contemplated the law would require very careful examination as to the implications. There are, as the Deputy will appreciate, no ready-made answers. What is important is that Governments have in recent years proceeded with a combination of sound legislative and administrative reforms to tackle the problem of child sexual abuse.  That also continues to be the policy of the Government on this subject.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme of action in relation to children includes a Bill in course of preparation in my Department on the giving of evidence by children in civil cases.  The programme includes proposals for the establishment on a statutory basis of an inspectorate of social services within the Department of Health with responsibility for aspects of child care practice and undertaking inquiries.  Mandatory reporting of child abuse is, of course, the subject of a discussion document recently initiated by the Minister of State at the Department of Health.  A special Cabinet sub-committee on children has been established to oversee all matters in relation to children.  I assure the House that the Government is committed to a structured approach to all aspects of the law and of administration in relation to children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At 11 a.m. on Friday, 1 March at Broom Hill, Fethard-on-Sea, a young man, Mr. Timmy Sutton, while <Col N="301" /> working on a low loader, sustained spinal injuries.  Mr. Sutton is 28 years old is one of nine family members employed by Jim Sutton Plant Hire.  Timmy, who has been married two years, was a careful worker.  He was cleaning the machine when the accident occurred. Unfortunately, he was working away from his house on his own and was in agony for an hour before he could attract attention.</P>
      <P>All emergency services were then alerted.  An ambulance arrived from Wexford hospital as quickly as could be expected.  The Hook peninsula, on which Mr. Sutton lives, is 28 miles from Wexford town.  Because of the nature of his injury, the ambulance had to travel at ten miles per hour to the hospital.  On arrival at the hospital and following examination, an air ambulance from Baldonnel was requested.  It arrived but then there was an unbelievable succession of bizarre events.  The incorrect stretcher was ordered.  Because of this an anaesthetic had to be administered to accommodate the patient on the only stretcher on the helicopter.  It was discovered that the anaesthetic would not have taken effect in time for the patient to be air lifted in daylight.  The air ambulance, complete with special medical equipment and a highly specialised medical team, could not wait because it was not equipped with night flying equipment.</P>
      <P>At this stage Mr. Sutton was in agony. His family, not knowing the extent of his injury, were very anxious.  As someone said on that occasion, it was like having a car with no lights.  I am told that now even lawnmowers have lights. Timmy's wife Mary, standing in the hospital grounds is quoted in last week's issue of the <i>New Ross Standard</i> as saying: &ldquo;You could just have stood there and cried watching them fly off&rdquo;.  The crew and everything else necessary was there but they had to take off without him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a call from the family on <Col N="302" /> Saturday morning.  On ringing Baldonnel to find out when the helicopter was coming back to Wexford, I was told there was a more urgent case.  Why was this helicopter not in Wexford at first light?  To cut a long, sad story short, the air ambulance arrived in Wexford at 4 p.m. and took Mr. Sutton to the Mater Hospital, Dublin.  It took 31 hours for a patient with a severe spinal injury to be taken to hospital.  This should have been done in five hours.  An extra 26 hours is a long time to wait and God only knows what damage was done during this time.</P>
    <P>This is 1996, not 1946.  It is a disgrace that a fully equipped air ambulance was not available.  During the week the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, announced that a helicopter with night flying equipment is being made available to assist in marine safety.  This was a result of a call earlier this year by me and others.  Can this helicopter be used as an air ambulance during night time emergencies for those with spinal injuries?  When I asked this question during the week, I was given flippant answers.  This is a serious issue.  The Suttons hope that no other family will endure such a fiasco ever again.  A fully equipped air ambulance service must be provided, particularly for the east and south-east coasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of air ambulance services.  The Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases and this arrangement has been in place since 1965.  This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance.  It is also provided for the removal from islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient. The Air Corps has a fleet of five Dauphin helicopters with night flying capabilities and these have been used in exceptional and urgent circumstances in the past for air ambulance missions.  In addition, since August 1991, the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine is also available for air ambulance transport in cases of emergency.  This service has been used at times by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service recommended that a standing committee on air ambulance services be established.  This committee was established in 1995 under the aegis of the Department of Health and <Col N="304" /> the Department of Defence.  One of the standing committee's terms of reference was to consider the adequacy of resources for air ambulance missions and put forward jointly any proposals for the improvement of the air ambulance service.  This committee is currently engaged in an examination of all the options regarding the most appropriate arrangements for the provision of air ambulance services.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of the role which a dedicated air ambulance service could play in enhancing the effectiveness of the ambulance service, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the provision of optimal patient care requires that the operation of an air ambulance service should be integrated with the general ambulance services to secure the appropriate response to emergencies.  Last year my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, Minister for Health, gave approval to his Department to proceed with the purchase of a fully equipped mobile intensive care unit.  This service which will be provided by the Eastern Health Board in association with a number of Dublin hospitals will enable a safer transfer of acutely ill patients from intensive care units around the country to hospitals in Dublin.  This service will reduce the number of calls made on the Air Corps for inter-hospital transfers. The Department of Health also has a programme in place for upgrading the ground emergency ambulance service, to include fleet replacement, new training standards for staff and the development of command and control centres.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have detailed arrangements to ensure that an integrated service operates between the air ambulance, ground based ambulance services and hospital based accident and emergency services.  All of these matters fall to be considered by the standing committee and any development in this area should await the recommendations of the standing committee on air ambulance services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> The Deputy's comments may <i>inter alia</i>, relate to an incident which was the subject of recent comment in the <i>Wexford People</i>.  A report on this incident from the Air Corps has been received by the Department of Health and certain matters will now be the subject of discussion with the South-Eastern Health Board and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  If the Deputy so wishes, I will be happy to communicate with him further in this matter when these inquiries have been completed.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of whether the Government intends to initiate an independent inquiry into child sex abuse cases in Wexford, what form the inquiry would take and whether the Government would undertake to publish the report of such an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the investigation into the conduct of child sex abuse cases on 22 February last.  I was concerned that many worrying aspects of this investigation required explanation.  The Minister's response was that the matter was the subject of a Garda investigation and that it was not the practice of the Minister for Justice to make statements to the House about the progress of Garda investigations except in instances where the circumstances are so exceptional <Col N="306" /> that such a course of action is appropriate. At the time, I believed that response was appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have heard that the families involved in those cases now believe the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, will order an independent inquiry into the Fr. Jim Grennan case.  I will outline the background to this.  In 1986-87 a school teacher in Monageer outside Enniscorthy was preparing a class for confirmation when some children complained about being abused by a local priest. The teacher reported this to the community care authority.  A report was prepared and subsequently a copy was sent to the bishop.  The priest was removed for a short time but returned after some weeks.  The community care authority could not do anything about it.  Counselling was not made available to the children.  Unfortunately, the priest reoffended in 1993-94, although this did not come to light until after the priest died in 1994.</P>
    <P>Initially, the impression given locally was that the allegations were false and the families concerned suffered a great deal as a result.  According to reports, the boy involved in the latter case tried to commit suicide a couple of times.  It is now alleged that the failures took place at a high level in the health board and the Garda.  The Garda inquiry taking place now seeks to find out why the authorities did not proceed with the prosecution when there appeared to be more than enough evidence to send to the DPP, and to establish if the health board handled their area of responsibility properly.</P>
    <P>What is the truth?  Has the Minister initiated an inquiry and if so what persuaded him to initiate it?  Has he now received the Garda report on its investigation? Can he let us know what happened to halt the investigation at the time?  There is also anxiety about a subsequent case, the Fr. Jim Doyle case.  He was convicted in 1990 of abuse of a young boy who also, unfortunately, <Col N="307" /> tried to commit suicide.  Was there counselling and support for the families in that case?</P>

      <P>The chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board issued a statement on this matter in November 1995.  In that statement the board said senior management, who had not previously been involved with the cases, carried out a review of the <Col N="308" /> board's involvement in these cases.  That review suggested the board acted appropriately. On the basis of the information currently available to me, it does not appear that an independent inquiry is required in these cases.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the matter referred to by the Deputy is now the subject of a Garda investigation.  While this investigation into these serious matters is ongoing it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on them.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Independent Hospital Association represents 19 private hospitals countrywide.  Its member hospitals constitute approximately one-third of all private beds in both public and private hospitals.  The vast majority of patients treated by the association's member <Col N="112" /> hospitals are members of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  The association negotiates centrally for its members with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in relation to arrangements for payment in respect of the care and treatment of VHI members. Regrettably, the central negotiations which took place in respect of payment arrangements between the parties for this year did not achieve a mutually satisfactory conclusion and resulted in a dispute between the parties.  I recognise that the association must pursue what it considers to be an equitable settlement for its members while the VHI must seek to obtain an arrangement, in the interests of all its members, which it considers sustainable in terms of increases in premium levels.</P>
    <P>When a centrally negotiated arrangement failed, the VHI proceeded to pursue individual arrangements with the 19 hospitals concerned.  However, with the exception of one major acute hospital which concluded an agreement, all member hospitals either declined, or did not respond to, a request for direct negotiations and, therefore, agreement remains outstanding with 18 private hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should point out that private hospitals which are not members of the association and public voluntary hospitals are not involved in the dispute. Private and semi-private accommodation in health board hospitals is also unaffected.  The VHI's arrangements for the payout of professional fees remain unchanged, regardless of the hospital in which the member receives treatment.</P>
    <P>As VHI members will continue to be indemnified as normal under their particular cover plan for treatment in private or semi-private beds in public and voluntary hospitals, it is likely that there will be some movement by them to such hospitals instead of opting for treatment in private hospitals.  The degree to which such movement may occur cannot be determined.  It is part of a providers normal process to manage their volumes of treatment at a given time.  Any significant movement of the <Col N="113" /> kind mentioned would arise to be dealt with by providers as part of this process.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me to intervene in a dispute of this kind which concerns fundamental commercial arrangements between an insurer and a number of private healthcare providers.  Financial arrangements between any health insurers and service providers are matters to be directly negotiated between the parties.  It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the dispute in view of my role as the regulatory authority for the health insurance market.  I cannot, for example, attempt to bring about a solution which would lessen the financial exposure of the dominant insurer in the market, neither can I increase the return to private hospitals which could affect future competition. This does not, however, prevent me from calling on the different parties to try to resolve their differences in the time remaining up to 4 April and I would request them to do so as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am making arrangements for the establishment of a healthcare consultative forum.  It is intended that this would bring together all the parties involved so as to facilitate the development of consensus on the improved delivery of private healthcare.  The forum will not be involved in negotiations on budgetary matters but rather will involve itself in creating an environment where matters of common interest can be addressed.</P>

      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the value for money examination of means testing is being considered within my Department at present.  This report examined means testing arrangements in the case of schemes relating to a number of Departments, including the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The report identifies inefficiencies in the administration of means testing and it also identifies impediments to harmonisation. It makes a number of recommendations on how efficiencies might be achieved, including the possible use of a single means testing agency.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Sections 66 and 67 of the 1970 Health Act provide that health boards shall make available a health examination and treatment service for pre-school and national school children and shall make available dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances for defects noticed at these examinations.  These examinations are to ensure that existing or emerging health problems are picked up at an early age and appropriate treatment provided as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that all health boards are providing an adequate range of examinations under sections 66 and 67 of the 1970 Health Act.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, came into operation on 1 September, 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost. Up to 31 December 1995 a total of £31.2 million had been expended on subventions and approximately £16 million has been allocated for 1996.</P>
      <P>The current levels of subvention are among the various aspects of the scheme which have been examined by a working group comprised of officials of my Department and the health boards, which has reviewed the operation of the Nursing Homes Act.  I am aware that the group has finalised this report and I expect to receive it this week.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, under which applicants are assessed for subvention do not compel any individual to sell his or her home in order to pay for nursing home care.  Indeed, when assessing an individual's means and circumstances the principal residence is treated as a special asset and is not taken into account where the house is occupied by a dependent spouse or relative.  Where it is not so occupied, an income from the house is imputed, based on its notional value. In the final analysis, the disposal of an individual's house to fund nursing home fees is a private decision and a matter of consumer preference over which I, as Minister for Health, have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Nursing Homes <Col N="119" /> Act, subject to regular review in its operation, is capable of meeting its objective, which is to provide assistance towards the cost of nursing home care for those who cannot do so from their own resources.  I am aware that certain difficulties are being encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will continue to endeavour to address these problems within the resources available to me.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): On Second Stage of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, I said that if I can meet the points now being raised by Positive Action, I would not be reluctant to do so.</P>
      <P>I wrote to Positive Action on 7 March last in connection with a number of issues which it raised in relation to the working procedures of the Compensation Tribunal, namely a right to give oral evidence by claimant, a right to give oral evidence by a medical practitioner, provision of satisfactory provisional awards and confidentiality in relation to form of authority included in the tribunal application form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed Positive Action that the tribunal recently wrote to solicitors who had made contact with it advising them that all claimants shall be entitled to give oral evidence.  In relation to oral medical evidence, the tribunal has advised that there is no prohibition against calling oral evidence regarding the content of medical reports unless the claimant has been notified by it that oral evidence will not be required.  If the tribunal has notified the claimant that <Col N="120" /> oral evidence is not required, the claimant may still advance reasons why such evidence should be heard orally and any reasons so advanced will be carefully and fairly considered by it.</P>
    <P>I informed Positive Action that the tribunal has advised solicitors regarding provisional awards, as follows:</P>
    <P>There cannot be a general unqualified right to seek a provisional award of compensation.  It is provided under the scheme that awards will be calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort.  Where damages are claimed for tort in the ordinary courts, awards are not made on a provisional basis.  Damages under the scheme will reflect the risk of future harm or deterioration even in claims for lump sums of compensation.</P>
    <P>I also informed Positive Action that in relation to confidentiality the tribunal has advised solicitors that while it is not envisaged that an approach by it to an employer of a claimant will occur as a matter of routine, it reserves the right to do so.  However, the tribunal will not do so without first reverting to the claimant or his/her solicitor if applicable.</P>
    <P>In my letter to Positive Action on 7 March I also addressed the following additional concerns that have been expressed by the group recently, namely permanence of the compensation tribunal by way of contracts; and the <i>ex-gratia</i> nature of scheme not to exclude judicial review.  I stated in that letter that I have been advised by the Attorney General that the terms of any award made by the tribunal would be enforceable before the courts.  I understand that when a provisional award is made the tribunal will issue a letter to the claimant specifying that the award is a provisional award and that the claimant may make a further application to it in the event that a particular serious consequence or consequences occur and specify the time period within which the claimant may apply.  This letter to the claimant will support the legal contract <Col N="121" /> which arises following the acceptance of a provisional award.</P>
    <P>In relation to judicial review, I informed Positive Action in my letter of 7 March that I have been advised by the Attorney General that proceedings before the compensation tribunal will be subject to judicial review.  As I have already indicated to the House, I am confident that the compensation tribunal will act with sensitivity and fairness in all cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of the food <Col N="123" /> hygiene regulations, which are enforced by the health boards on behalf of my Department, is to ensure that food placed on the market for sale to the public is fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the health boards share my appreciation for the valuable contribution made by small scale food operations.  The potential for growth and employment in these small scale operations is well recognised.  As a result, I am satisfied that the health boards show considerable understanding and flexibility when applying the regulations to small businesses while, of course, being obliged to give priority at all times to the protection of public health.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Free Choice organisation I am pleased to say that senior officials met a delegation from the organisation on 7 February last and discussed at length a wide range of issues of concern to the organisation, including the implications for small food operations of the new EU food hygiene directive.  That directive will be transposed into Irish law shortly.  During the course of that meeting the officials encouraged the organisation to participate in the drawing up of codes of practice as forseen in the directive.  These codes are designed to facilitate compliance with the directive and afford interested groups an opportunity to shape the regulatory regime which will be put in place.  I hope they will agree to take part in the process.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this programme is still in the early stages.  I am very pleased with the response to date from general practitioners and I am confident that the final uptake level will be extremely high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £10 million has been made available in 1996 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This includes £6 million revenue funding of which £3 million is being provided to meet the 1996 cost of additional services which were put in place in 1995.  The remaining £3 million revenue funding provided will facilitate the provision of an additional 66 residential/respite places and 265 day care places as well as home support services this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, £4 million capital funding <Col N="125" /> is being provided of which £2 million will be used to support general service developments.  The remaining £2 million will be used to develop and improve the quality of training facilities for persons with a mental handicap under the European Regional Development Fund assisted programme.  As the Deputies are aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap. Additional funding of £44.58 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-95 which has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.  The Government is committed under both the Health Strategy document &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available.</P>
    <P>That commitment is reflected in my decision with my colleague the Minister for Health Deputy Noonan, to prepare a five year service development plan to meet the needs identified by the new national mental handicap database.  I expect the plan to be ready later this year when the database becomes available.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for services to persons with a mental handicap, I have met with a wide number of agencies and representative associations, including the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland (NAMHI).  All such requests are given sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to bring forward implementation of part VIII of the Child Care Act, 1991, in view of the need to ensure that abuses such as those which occurred in Goldenbridge, Dublin 8 and other orphanages do not recur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, children in residential care are no longer maintained in orphanages or similar type institutions designed to cater for large numbers of children.  Since the early 1970s there has been a major shift away from the provision of care in such settings to smaller purpose-built group homes and other appropriately sized residential units.</P>
      <P>In relation to the implementation of Part VIII of the Child Care Act, 1991, I am pleased to report that much of the ground work has already been done.  A working group has already prepared a draft set of standards for residential care which will form the basis of the regulations to be prepared under Part VIII of the Act.  The new regulations will provide a statutory basis for the registration and inspection of residential care centres.  I have given a commitment that Part VIII, and the remaining provisions of the Child Care Act, will be implemented by the end of the year. This commitment will be honoured.</P>
      <P>I have also announced my intention to establish, at a national level and on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social services in the Department of Health. This inspectorate will be responsible for quality assurance and audit of child care practice, and will undertake inquiries on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I am confident that, together with the important new provisions relating to residential care under the Child Care Act, this will improve the safeguards and procedures for the protecton of children in residntial care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would like now to address a number of important initiatives that have already been taken to promote the welfare of children in residential care and to protect them from abuse.  The most significant of these are the Child <Col N="127" /> Care (Placement of Children in Residential Care) Regulations, 1995, which I brought into operation with effect from 31 October last.  These regulations were made under Part VI of the Child Care Act and govern the placement by health boards of children in their care in residential centres.  They apply to residential centres operated by voluntary bodies as well as those operated by the boards themselves.</P>
    <P>The new regulations lay down detailed requirements to be complied with by health boards in relation to the placement of children in residential care, the conduct of residential centres for children provided by health boards, the supervision, visiting and review of children placed in residential centres and the removal of children from such placements in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>In particular, the new regulations require each health board to: satisfy itself that adequate arrangements are in place in each residential centre to guard against the risk of injury and for the reporting and recording of accidents and injuries affecting children residing there; satisfy itself that procedures are in place for the prompt notification to the board of significant events affecting children placed there by the board; monitor standards in each residential <Col N="128" /> centre in which the board has placed a child and ensure that the centre is visted from time to time by an authorised person; arrange for the supervision of children placed in residential centres by the board and for the children to be visited within prescribed intervals; and arrange for the periodic review of each child placed by the board in a residential centre.</P>
    <P>The regulations are designed to ensure that children in residential care are visited, supervised and reviewed on a more systematic basis than before and that the changing needs of children are taken into account.  Full recognition is given to the role of parents, carers, and indeed the children themselves, in this process.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The administration of the registration system for marriages is a matter for An t-Árd Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local Registrars who operate under his general direction. The duties of registrars of marriages appointed in accordance with the Marriages (Ireland) Act 1844 include the taking of notice of marriage, the solemnisation of and the registration of marriages.  Each registrar is required under the marriages act to maintain an office within his-her designated district and there are currently 30 such districts within the State.  The registrars districts and the location of the offices within the districts are given in the following table. In many cases the boundaries of the district and the county boundaries coincide.  Where a county is broken into two or more districts, each district is listed separately.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The term &ldquo;tranquilliser&rdquo; is a general term which covers a number of classifications of medicinal products in use, including the classifications of anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives. The total projected potential savings in respect of these three classifications is in the order of £453,000 per annum on the GMS scheme, if the lowest priced generic is prescribed in every case.</P>
      <P>The projected potential savings that could be made in respect of antibiotics is in the order of £1.4 million per annum on the GMS scheme if the lowest priced generic is prescribed in every case.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding the prescribing of particular medicines are solely a matter for the professional judgment of the medical practitioner concerned.  The measures which have been taken by the Department and the health boards, in conjunction with the medical professsion, for encouraging the rational, safe, and cost effective use of prescription medication, protect the right of the doctor to prescribe as he-she considers necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The indicative drug target (IDT) scheme has its origins in the review of the General Medical Services scheme in 1992.  In discussions between the Department of Health, the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation during that review, it was agreed that medicines were not always prescribed in the most effective manner.  It was further agreed that there was potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better quality patient care and more efficient use of resources in the development of general practitioner services.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, each doctor was encouraged to look critically at his-her existing prescribing practices with a view to making them more effective and less costly for all patients.  To assist in the process, doctors were provided with indicative drug targets based on average prescribing cost and weighted by age and sex factors.  As an incentive to doctors to participate, the IDT scheme provided that a proportion of the savings made against target would be made available to the individual GP for investment in and development of his-her own practice subject to the agreement of the relevent health board.  The remainder of the savings was allocated to the relevant health board for investment in general practice projects within the board's area.</P>
      <P>The duty and obligation on doctors, individually and collectively, to provide the most appropriate management and to utilise the available resources for optimum care for each patient, was emphasised by all parties to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussions leading to the IDT scheme and in a number of reviews since then, it was <Col N="135" /> clearly understood by the parties involved that the right of the doctor to prescribe, as he-she considers necessary, remains absolutely in place and there is no limitation on the range of items from which he-she can choose to prescribe.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department has commissioned a study under the direction of Professor Michael Murphy, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, University College, Cork, on the effects of the IDT scheme on the quality of care accorded to patients in the GMS.  It is expected that the study will be completed later in the year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.  Under the current disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations a child dependant means a person under the age of 18 years, or in the case of a person receiving full-time instruction at any university, college, school or other educational establishment, under the age of 21 years who normally resides with, and is being wholly or mainly maintained by the disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Department of Social Welfare has increased the age limit for a child dependent of a long-term social welfare recipient up to <Col N="136" /> age 22 where the dependent is in full-time education.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is in the process of being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. The Department of Social Welfare took over responsibility for the funding of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 1 August 1995 and it is expected that responsibility for the administration of disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to the Department of Social Welfare in mid-1996. I have no plans to change the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations pending this transfer but I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Irish hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services over the past number of years. Various measures have been taken by successive Minister for Health in an endeavour to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>This is not a phenomenon confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also.  At present a £12 charge is levied on eligible patients who attend accident and emergency departments.  This charge replaced an earlier £6 charge.  However, notwithstanding these charges the number of patients who attended at the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin increased by 39 per cent over the years 1988 to 1995.  This increase in the volume of attendances at accident and emergency departments has also been a feature of hospital services around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been particularly concerned <Col N="137" /> about the accident and emergency services provided by hospitals.  That is why I was anxious that a more comprehensive and integrated approach be adopted to tackle this problem and I introduced a plan to tackle the serious difficulties in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the need for hospital management to give priority to the problems that have emerged in the organisation and delivery of accident and emergency services.  Hospitals have been asked to re-focus their activities to a greater degree on bed utilisation policies and admission and discharge procedures. Each hospital should agree a series of measures that will result in a better and more streamlined response.</P>
    <P>The plan which I have introduced to deal with the accident and emergency difficulties in Dublin includes tackling a number of these areas which are internal to the acute hospital together with improving a range of services outside the acute hospital setting e.g. services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and sub-acute services to ease the pressure on the acute hospitals.  When taken together these measures provide a comprehensive and integrated response.</P>
    <P>In addition, the health board general practice units are involved in the development of closer links between hospitals and general practitioners including the introduction of admission and discharge Protocols between hospital consultants and general practitioners. A major investment is also being made in the improvement of facilities and equipment within general practice.  This will encourage general practitioners to undertake procedures which have traditionally been provided in a hospital setting but which are more appropriate to the primary care services.</P>
    <P>In addition a public education campaign co-ordinated by the Eastern Health Board on the appropriate use of accident and emergency services was launched on 15 January 1996.  While it is too early to assess the full impact of this campaign I understand that the <Col N="138" /> Eastern Health Board will shortly be reporting to me on the impact of this campaign and the benefits which should flow from the project.  I will continue to monitor the service over the coming months.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Eastern Health Board assure me that they are conscious of the need to provide additional facilities for the elderly and they are currently engaged in planning various new services for the elderly, including respite, convalescent, rehabilitation, long stay and day care.</P>
      <P>Recent step down facilities for elderly patients who have completed the acute phase of their medical treatment, in Dublin, include the following: In January 1995 20 contract places in private nursing homes were reactivated; a 22 bed unit for the elderly was opened in Cherry Orchard Hospital in January 1995; in December 1995 40 contracted private nursing home places were reactivated; a 25 bed unit for the elderly was opened in Peamount Hospital in December 1995; in February 1996 a 46 bed community unit and day care unit was opened at the Navan Road to provide a range of services for elderly patients; and the provision of three additional community ward teams for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is also currently planning the development of a community unit and day unit for the elderly at both the former Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Lower Grand Canal Street and at South Circular Road.  The <Col N="139" /> Sir Patrick Dun's unit will be the first of these to come on stream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that an increasing number of parties to legal adoption proceedings are seeking to reestablish contact with one another.  I accept that the law in this area is in need of updating to take account of recent developments in adoption practice and the changing nature of adoption.  The Health Strategy contains a commitment to introduce changes in adoption law and procedure to provide arrangements to facilitate contact between adopted persons and their birth parents.  The <Col N="140" /> question of an adopted person's right of access to his or her original birth records will also be considered in that context as the two matters are interrelated.</P>
      <P>My immediate legislative priority in the adoption area is the introduction of amending legislation to recognise the adoption of children in countries such as China and to give fathers of non-marital children a greater say in the adoption process.  This latter issue arises from the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland, delivered subsequent to the launch of the Health Strategy.  I will be seeking Government approval shortly to a proposed legislative response to that judgment.</P>
      <P>It is my firm intention that work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the commitment in the health strategy relating to the establishment of an adoption contact register will commence when the issues raised in the European Court judgment have been addressed.</P>
      <P>As regards the scope of the proposed contact register, it was envisaged that it would address the needs of persons who were parties to legal adoption proceedings under Irish law.  However, in the light of recent developments, it would be my intention to examine whether it would be possible to make provision for Irish children who were adopted abroad in the past.  It is only fair to say, however, that this may not be feasible because it is unfortunately the case that no centralised system existed here for the recording of information relating to such adoptions.  At present, my officials are ascertaining the information available from a number of sources on children adopted abroad in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House a number of difficulties have emerged since the procedure for the Notification of Suspected Cases of Abuse between health boards and the Garda was launched. These include the reporting of cases of teenage pregnacies and the position of health board counselling services providing therapeutic support to victims of abuse.  The discussion document on mandatory reporting, Putting Children First, which I launched last month, addresses these and many other issues involved in the reporting of cases of abuse.  I intend to review all guidelines in the light of the consultative process which I have initiated on mandatory reporting.</P>
      <P>One of the central recommendations of the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation team concerned the need for inter-programme collaboration between hospital and community care staff on matters concerning the identification, notification and follow-up of child abuse.  I am satisfied that all health boards are taking steps to improve existing arrangements for the assessment and management of child abuse cases, with particular importance being attached to co-operation and co-ordination between the hospital and community care programmes of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for children was a reflection of the Government's concern for the need for closer co-ordination between all State agencies in seeking to promote and protect the needs of children.  One of my first <Col N="142" /> actions on appointment was to bring together senior representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice to review their respective roles and responsibilities in relation to child care services.  Following this review, I initiated a multi-dimensional approach to protect children, involving a combination of short-term measures and measures of a more long-term nature requiring significant legislative change. The key elements of this approach were: the early implementation of the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991; the early implementation of a new Juvenile Justice Bill to update the legislation governing provision for children in need of special care or in conflict with the law, and the adoption of a series of immediate initiatives to address current pressing difficulties arising from inadequate accommodation for children who are out of control of their parents or who are in conflict with the law.</P>
    <P>I believe that this multi-disciplinary approach will best serve to protect children from abuse and promote the interests of all children with special needs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified by their general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition, such as asthma, with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Persons who quality for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  I have no plans to reduce this threshold under the drug cost subsidisation scheme and I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive treatment and support is being provided to asthma patients through the existing range of services and support schemes available.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc, &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>In the case where a particular child or member of a family is incurring heavy expenditure due to their asthmatic condition, the chief executive officer may grant a medical card to cover that child or individual, rather than issue a card to cover the whole family.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medicine above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>For some time now the accident and emergency services at University College Hospital in Galway have been the subject of comment in the media.  Various representations have been made to me concerning the problems at the hospital and their causes.  My Department has had a series of contacts with the Western Health Board on the matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are difficulties caused by the physical layout of certain areas of UCHG.  The Deputy will know that I have already approved a significant programme of interim development works at the hospital, which will alleviate these problems through the provision of extended accident and emergency facilities.  This project is expected to go to tender in a few months time and I hope the builders will be on site by late summer.  Apart from an extended accident and emergency department, the project will also encompass the following elements: additional ward accommodation, new X-ray accommodation and upgrading of the existing operating theatres.</P>
      <P>The overall cost of this major capital project will be of the order of £5 million.</P>
      <P>I moved to address this problem within a matter of months of taking office.  However, this building work will, of necessity, take some time and in any event is not likely on its own to offer a solution to the overall challenges of providing an efficient accident and emergency service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to get at the core of the problem, I have requested the Western Health Board to give its analysis of the root causes of the ongoing accident and emergency difficulties at the hospital and to propose a comprehensive plan to address them.  In response to this request, I have recently received documentation from the health board which has been examined in my Department. I feel that it does not deal with the issues in a comprehensive manner and I have asked the health board for <Col N="145" /> additional information.  When this is provided, my Department will discuss with the health board the various options available in order to improve matters at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board put a series of measures in place in 1995 aimed at alleviating the problems in the accident and emergency department in UCHG.  In 1995, and in the current year, I have made available a substantial sum in additional revenue funding for acute hospital services in the Western Health Board area.  Notwithstanding these measures, the problems at UCHG appear to persist.  Preliminary indications seem to point to a series of organisational and management issues which need to be addressed by the management of the health board, rather than the immediate injection of further funds, as requested by the health board.</P>
    <P>I should stress that this is not a problem which has arisen overnight.  I look to the health board and its management to address the issues involved.  Resolution of the accident and emergency difficulties requires close co-operation between primary and acute services, as the Dublin experience has shown.  I am confident that, with a similar integrated approach in Galway, the Western Health Board will be able to deliver the quality of service its patients deserve.</P>
    <P>With regard to the industrial action by junior hospital doctors at the hospital, I am pleased to say that the specific issue which gave rise to the action is now being resolved.  This is an indication of the commitment and dedication of all concerned to the resolution of the present difficulties without further affecting patient care.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the introduction of a system for the inspection and supervision by health boards of pre-school services for children.  This involves the introduction of regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of preparing the regulations I have established a working group in my Department to make recommendations in relation to the standards that should apply to pre-school services in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>The working group is representative of my Department, the Department of Education, the health boards, the broad range of pre-school service providers and is chaired by the Department.  The group held its first meeting on 15 February. It is intended that the draft guidelines prepared by the group on the standards that should apply in pre-school services will form the basis of the new regulations and accompanying guidelines on their implementation for the health boards.  The group is expected to complete its work by mid-year.  I intend to implement the new regulations before the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (2) of the Adoption Act, 1988, requires the High Court, before making an order under that section authorising the adoption of a child, in so far as is practicable, to give due consideration to the wishes of the child.  A health board which is a party to such proceedings must accordingly be in a position to say to the court that the child is present should the court desire that the child be heard.  It is then for the court to decide whether it wishes to consult the child and in what circumstances. I understand that it is the practice of the health boards to arrange for the attendance of the child in all such proceedings.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Southern Health Board that in every case under the 1988 Act in which it has been involved, counsel has insisted that the child be present for the purposes of being heard should the court so require. The board does of course accept that the attendance of the child in court can be distressing for the child and the adopting parents; however, it considers that the matter is outside its control.</P>
      <P>Since it is not for the health boards to predetermine matters of a judicial nature, it would be inappropriate for me to issue the directive suggested by the Deputy.  However, in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice I will certainly make inquiries to see whether anything can be done to improve arrangements for the hearing of these cases.</P>

      <P>In the case of Myrtleville and Fountainstown areas, such method of payment will cease with effect from Monday, 1 April 1996.</P>
      <P>All recipients in these areas have been given an alternative service, i.e. they have been offered a postal payment with built-in controls or they have been offered a service at Crosshaven Health Centre.</P>
      <P>In the case of Desertserges.  Newcestown, Crossbarry and Kilumney, it is planned to discontinue the service from 1 May 1996.  Clients are currently being offered a choice of alternative arrangements, e.g. postal payment or transferring payments to an alternative site with facilities.</P>
      <P>In the case of Coolea and Kilnamartyra, alternative arrangements are currently being considered.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dungourney, there are no immediate plans to alter the current arrangements.  The community welfare officer has the use of an office in the school in Dungourney during school term and only uses his car during school holidays when the school is closed.  The numbers attending are very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has no proposals to provide office accommodation in any of the areas concerned due to the small number of clients and <Col N="149" /> the short length of time spent by the community welfare officer in the areas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities commenced in late 1994.  The programme provides an ongoing subsidy in respect of disabled people and once-off employment grants in respect of able bodied people.  There are 143 people with disabilities and 45 able bodied persons are currently employed in seven enterprises &mdash; six by Gandon Enterprises and one by the Special Equestrian Training Centre.  It is expected that the numbers employed under the programme will increase further in 1996.  The 1996 budget for the programme is £1.75 million.</P>
      <P>The programme, which is administered and monitoried by the National Rehabilitation Board, is currently in the final year of the pilot phase.  As with any pilot programme, it is appropriate that it should be reviewed before its continued operation.  Accordingly, I will establish such a review shortly which will be completed before the end of 1996.  Initial reports on the operation of the pilot programme are favourable both as regards employment targets and in terms of providing meaningful jobs to people with disabilities in an integrated setting.  While I cannot pre-empt the review process, I would expect that the programme will be continued after its pilot phase.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and any estimate of the value of drugs and medicines which could be supplied by the indigenous pharmaceutical industry would be somewhat speculative. The indigenous pharmaceutical industry is principally involved in the manufacture of generic medicines and a possible pointer as to the potential for increasing the value of medicines supplied by this sector would be to examine available information on expenditure on prescription medicine in the general medical services scheme.  The ingredient cost of prescription medicine in the GMS in 1995 was £122.5 million. Approximately 30 per cent of expenditure on medicines prescribed in the GMS relates to products which have a generic equivalent which would represent an ingredient cost value of £36.75 million if a generic was prescribed in all cases.  The value of generic medicines prescribed under the scheme in 1995 represented about one half of this figure which would suggest a potential for increase of the value of medicines supplied by the indigenous industry.</P>

    <P>The figures are based on the 1991 census. It should be noted that the figures relate only to the approved level of expenditure for the boards and do not include expenditure for voluntary hospitals, directly funded mental handicap homes or the GMS in each health board area.  I would also point out that expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average which does not take into account a number of demographic and geographical factors.  The difference in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialties, density of population and the present stage of development of the services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would initially like to point out to the Deputy that not all of the 363 persons with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals in the Eastern Health board region are inappropriately placed.  While a large proportion of this group will be considered for transfer as resources come on stream, some because of their ongoing mental health needs are, in fact, appropriately placed.  In the case of others, because of their age or the length of time which they have spent in a psychiatric hospital, a transfer to the generic mental handicap services is not deemed to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>A sum of £400,000 was made available to the Eastern Health Board last year towards the purchase of suitable residential accommodation in the community. This will allow up to 24 people with a mental handicap to be transferred from St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, this year.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering proposals which will allow further transfers.  The Eastern Health Board has prepared a draft plan which addresses the needs of people with a mental handicap in St. Joseph's Service, St. Ita's Hospital.  The board plans in the medium term to move over 200 of the younger adults with mental handicap to a number of alternative locations spread throughout the board's area.  It is proposed that the clients remaining on the St. Ita's campus will be accommodated in the more modern units on site which are being gradually upgraded.</P>
      <P>I have recently initiated a major review of needs, based on the national mental handicap database, which will lead to the preparation of a five year development plan later this year.  That plan will provide for the relocation of inappropriately placed persons with a mental handicap over the period.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> At the request of clinicians from the oncology unit, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, a meeting was held with Department of Health officials on 4 <Col N="160" /> March 1996, to discuss a number of issues related to the work of the oncology unit.  Arising from this meeting, the hospital authorities undertook to submit further details of the problems being experienced in the unit to my Department officials.  Arrangements are also being made for a medical officer from my Department to visit the unit on 19 March 1996 to assess any problems at first hand.  Once this process has been completed, I will then be in a position to review the situation at the unit in the context of the overall cancer strategy which is currently in preparation in my Department.</P>

      <P>No decisions were taken in 1995 on the funding of projects under the cultural development incentives scheme which provides capital investment in cultural projects.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, on 27 February 1996 I announced details of the first eight arts and culture capital projects which I approved in principle for funding under the scheme.  The projects approved in principle will involve investments of almost £8 million and, subject to satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues with applicants, grant offers totalling just over £5.5 million in EU and Exchequer funding towards these projects will be made.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee which makes recommendations to me on the projects to which funding should be offered under the scheme comprises two representatives of both my own Department, including the chairperson, and of An Comhairle Ealaíon, and one representative each of the Heritage Council, the Department of Tourism and Trade, the County and City Managers Association and the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the cultural development incentives scheme, the Deputy should be aware that An Comhairle Ealaíon allocates a small proportion of its annual grant each year to capital expenditure on the arts, which mainly involves refurbishment and upgrading of existing arts facilities rather than the provision of new ones.  In 1995, An Chomhairle <Col N="172" /> allocated £950,853 in capital expenditure from its total allocation of £16.25 million.</P>

      <P>Insurance of pillion passengers on motor cycles is not compulsory at present, but will be required with effect from 31 December 1998.  In line with this extension of compulsory cover, pillion passengers will be covered by the agreement in the case of accidents caused by uninsured motorcyclists occurring on or after that date.</P>

      <P>The revised syllabuses in Irish are intended to ensure that the full range of pupil ability and aptitude is catered for.  Nevertheless, provision exists in rule 46 of the &ldquo;Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools&rdquo; for exemption from Irish in limited special circumstances. The rule provides that pupils may be allowed to substitute any other subject from the list of approved subjects for Irish in the following circumstances. <i>inter alia:</i> pupils who function intellectually at average or above average level but have a specific learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basic language skills in the mother tongue; pupils who have been assessed as having a general learning impairment due to serious intellectual impairment (i.e. mental handicap) and are also failing to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue; pupils who have been assessed as having a general learning disability due to serious sensory impairment and are also failing to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue.</P>
      <P>Written evidence of the disability must be furnished by a qualified psychologist and the Department has issued guidelines to assist in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the scope of the rule is sufficiently broad to accommodate situations where, as a result of disability, genuine difficulties are encountered in the study of Irish.</P>

      <P>The guidelines on countering bullying behaviour, which were prepared by an expert group and circulated to schools in 1993 state that the creation of a positive school climate, which focuses on respect for the individual, is at the centre of a whole school response to bullying.  When staff, pupils and parents are involved in the development of a school behaviour policy, they are more likely to actively support it.  I am confident, therefore, that the guidelines, which were issued to primary and post-primary schools, will assist schools in identifying the incidence of bullying and in reducing the level of bullying in our schools.  I expect the guidelines to be adopted by each school board of management.</P>
      <P>It is suggested in the guidelines that schools monitor the effectiveness of school policy on this issue and their views will, of course, be taken into account in any review of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>Contracts have not yet been placed for the majority of projects on this list. It is not the practice of my Department to release details of the costings for individual projects in advance of obtaining tenders and placing the contracts.</P>
      <P>The release of such information at this stage could compromise the tendering process and give rise to substantially increased costs.</P>

      <P>The fire which occurred in the health care unit, Mountjoy on the night of 18 December 1995 was caused by an inmate of the prison intentionally starting a fire in his cell.  As a result of the fire 13 prison officers and six prisoners were taken to the hospital.  Two officers and four prisoners were detained overnight. No staff or prisoners were seriously injured.</P>
      <P>The modern health care unit of which construction was completed in 1993 conformed fully with health and safety standards and regulations at that time.  Arising from recent fire vulnerability studies conducted in all prisons a programme of improved fire safety measures was identified and is being implemented.  In the case of the health care unit, the major element of the proposed improvements was the installation of a mechanical smoke evacuation system.  Completed tenders for the installation had been received on 17 November and were being professionally evaluated at the time of the fire.  Installation is now proceeding.</P>

      <P>The Small Business Task Force made 121 recommendations in its report which was published in March 1994.  The following schedule gives details of the recommendations which have been implemented to date. This does not include the substantial progress that has been made in the partial implementation of a number of the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The systematic examination and implementation of the remaining recommendations is being pursued by the small business and services division of my Department which has assessed all of the recommendations and is actively pursuing their implementation. While it is not possible to give a precise schedule for the implementation of the remaining recommendations, I should mention that in 1996 my Department will be developing a programme on <Col N="190" /> administrative simplification which will be of particular relevance to a large number of recommendations.  My Department will also be giving special attention to proposals for legislation to resolve the problem of late payment of business debts, which is an area highlighted by the Task Force as being of particular importance.</P>
    <P>An area to which I attach special importance is the financial environment for small business and I believe the recently announced seed venture capital measure of the Operation Programme for Industry will be particularly important for the sector.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Government's programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> that this Government is committed to the development of small business.  In general terms, I am pleased with the progress that has been made towards creating a better business environment in Ireland for small business to grow and flourish.  Much more needs to be done and I will be pressing ahead with a view to substantial further progress in 1996.  In this regard, policy statements which will have significant implications for this area in relation to both enterprise strategy and service are nearing completion in my Department.</P>
