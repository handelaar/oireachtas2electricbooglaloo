      <P>Will the Tánaiste indicate whether the Government has any legislative or other proposals to deal with violence against women?  Is he confident the Government has adequate resources and personnel to cope with the necessary research and investigative work on a number of unsolved murders and quite a number of cases of missing persons, suspected to have been murdered?  A number of families continuously write to Members on all sides of the House about this matter.  Has the Government any proposals to deal with a real crisis involving 15 murders in the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there has been an unprecedented number of tragedies in the last 12 months and that women have been the victims.  I assure him that no resources will be spared in their investigation.  I am confident the Garda have the resources, in terms of the investigation necessary, and that everything that can be done will be in this matter.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Price Waterhouse report, yesterday I suggested that inspectors should be appointed under the Companies Act.  Will the Government give this suggestion serious legal consideration in addition to consideration by Ministers?  A cloud of suspicion hangs over everybody as long as the report remains a secret.  If the powers under the Companies Act cannot be used there should be a judicial inquiry.  The President of the Institute of Taxation said last night it will be years before the Revenue Commissioners can continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I reply to the Deputy?  This is an extremely important matter and a pall of suspicion hangs over everyone.  Headlines in this morning's newspapers state that £5 million was paid to politicians of almost all parties.  I have not seen the report and have not spoken to anyone who has seen it.  We are looking at a number of possibilities, particularly the application of section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.  I am not sure this is the correct remedy but we will get legal advice on it this morning.  There are other possibilities ranging from a public inquiry to investigation of the matter by a Dáil committee. It is important that the details in the report relevant to the public interest are made available as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be aspects of the report which are personal and private to the company and which should not be in the public domain.  What is important is that the aspects of the report which are of legitimate public interest are published.  One possibility is that the leaders of the parties would write to the company asking it to make those aspects of the report available so that they can be discussed in the House and the cloud hanging over politicians can be cleared once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence <Col N="702" /> (Amendment) (No.2) Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State to participate in the temporary multinational force established for humanitarian purposes in regard to the situation in Eastern Zaire by United Nations Security Council Resolution Number 1080 of 15th November, 1996.</P>
    <P>In commending this motion to the House I will outline why the Government decided to respond positively to the invitation from the United Nations to participate in the multinational force. I know the House has been following the crisis in eastern Zaire with deep concern, as demonstrated by the debate on the matter here last Wednesday. As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said in that debate, we cannot doubt the continuing serious nature of the position in eastern Zaire and the Great Lakes region generally.  While the voluntary return to Rwanda of up to 600,000 refugees in recent weeks has been a positive development, enormous problems remain to be addressed.  The challenge for the Rwandan Government and society of absorbing returnees on the current scale is truly daunting. The plight of large numbers of refugees and displaced people in eastern Zaire remains a major source of concern to the international community.  As Members are aware, Tanzania has also been carrying a heavy burden in hosting up to 500,000 refugees and has received thousands more in recent weeks.  Meanwhile the position in Burundi continues to give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>Primacy in the response of the international community to the crisis in eastern Zaire rests with the United Nations.  The House will be aware that a number of Security Council resolutions on the matter have been introduced, the most recent of which, Resolution 1080 of 15 November, sanctioned the &ldquo;establishment for humanitarian purposes of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the immediate return of humanitarian organisations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organisations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire, and to facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons&rdquo;.  The House will be aware that Canada has agreed to take the lead in putting together the multinational force.  It is this force to which the motion before the House refers.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs briefed the House last week on the efforts of the EU, under the Irish Presidency, to support the efforts of the UN in the provision of humanitarian assistance to those in need.  In addition to humanitarian assistance, the Union has also recognised that there are fundamental political issues at the core of the problem and that a humanitarian response alone will not be <Col N="703" /> sufficient to bring about a lasting solution.  Those are the twin realities that need to be addressed in the search for such a lasting solution.</P>
    <P>At political level, efforts are continuing to broker a dialogue between Zaire and Rwanda. The Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General, Ambassador Chretien, and the EU Special Envoy, Mr. Ajello, among others, are playing important roles in this regard.  It remains the strong view of the European Union that the complex problems at issue can be resolved only by dialogue.  In regard to the longer term perspective, it is essential that a comprehensive approach is developed to address the many problems involved.  In 1994 a humanitarian solution alone was not enough and I believe that lesson has been well learnt.  There is a strong dynamic now in favour of a broader approach and the current crisis provides a new context within which that dynamic can be given expression.  That is why the European Union supports the concept of the international conference on peace, security and development under the aegis of the UN and the OAU.  We believe the process begun by the Heads of State of the region in regard to Burundi, with Julius Nyerere in the role of mediator, could serve as a bridge into such a conference.  The holding of such a conference will be one of the priorities of the EU in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the need for longer-term political solutions, our immediate concern in regard to this motion is the pressing humanitarian position on the ground in the Great Lakes region. The Secretary General of the United Nations reported to the Security Council last Friday on the position as he assessed it at that time.  His report is valuable as an authoritative update on the overall state of play and I will arrange to have it placed in the Dáil Library.  I will outline some of the key points contained in that report, as it has an important bearing on the scale of the humanitarian problem which a multinational force would be required to address.  Since 15 November 1996 an estimated 500,000 Rwandans have returned to Rwanda from camps in eastern Zaire.  According to earlier estimates of the UNHCR, more than 700,000 refugees remained in eastern Zaire, but more recent estimates put the number between 300,000 and 700,000. Reports indicate that there are groups of people in several large new concentrations, including at locations south of Uvira, south west of Bukavu, north west of Bukavu, between Bukavu and Goma and north west of Goma.  While it is assumed the majority of those persons are from the refugee camps, there are likely to be displaced Zaireans among them and significant numbers of displaced Zaireans elsewhere.  Thus far 36,000 Burundian refugees have returned to their country from the Uvira region of Zaire. There have been considerable new influxes from eastern Zaire into Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.  They include mostly Zairean nationals but also Rwandan and <Col N="704" /> Burundian refugees.  The United Republic of Tanzania continues to host 535,000 Rwandan refugees and has faced an additional influx of 49,000 refugees from Burundi since 1 November.</P>
    <P>That is the broad background against which the decision to establish a multinational force to assist in the humanitarian effort must be assessed. As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated in the House last week, the Government has already made a decision in principle, subject to the approval of the House, that Ireland should participate in the multinational force called for under UN Resolution 1080.  Together with the other countries concerned, we have engaged in discussions with the lead country, Canada, to assess the precise needs of the humanitarian situation and the type of deployment that will be required from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that since the passing of Resolution 1080 on 15 November, the context in which the force was to be established was greatly altered by the massive voluntary return of refugees to Rwanda from Zaire.  Accordingly, intensive consultations have been taking place between the countries proposing to contribute troops to evaluate the role of such a force in the new circumstances.  Members will also be aware that questions have been raised about the need for the force in view of the new circumstances. Others, however, argue that since hundreds of thousands remain unaccounted for in eastern Zaire, the need for the force is as great as ever.</P>
    <P>The Government's position throughout this debate has been one of prudence, allied to the need for an urgent response to the humanitarian position.  It would be unreal not to acknowledge that the massive return of refugees has considerably altered the context of the proposed mission.  However, there are enough authoritative voices indicating that serious problems remain for large numbers of people in Zaire.  Fighting continues on the ground in the Kivu region. Humanitarian agencies, including Irish NGOs, have reported gunfire during operations by them into eastern Zaire to assist refugees.  It is undesirable that aid workers should have to operate unprotected in such conditions of danger and uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The report of the UN Secretary General to the Security Council, dated 29 November, states:</P>
    <P>Humanitarian agencies are currently permitted only a very limited access to the areas of displacement in eastern Zaire.  This denies them a basis for detailed programming.  Nor, given the security situation in the area, can any detailed assessments be undertaken at this time.  At the same time, the plight of the affected population does not permit further delay in the mobilisation of funds and the deployment of assistance.  This must be provided through the most suitable expeditious routes of access.  The great majority of the humanitarian agencies believe that these conditions can be fulfilled only if the multinational force is deployed in a way that will ensure them <Col N="705" /> the access they need and provide the necessary security for the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.</P>
    <P>In outlining the Secretary General's assessment of the position, the report states:</P>
    <P>... the immediate concern of the Secretary General is the fact that hundreds of thousands of men, women and children are still facing hunger, disease and violent death, most of them scattered in inaccessible and inhospitable areas of eastern Zaire beyond the reach of those who can bring them help.  Neither the United Nations system nor the non-governmental organisation community has the capacity in such conditions to secure access to the refugees and displaced persons and to deliver them the relief they need with the necessary speed.  That is why the Secretary General believes that a practical way to avoid a humanitarian disaster is the establishment of some form of military presence in the region.</P>
    <P>Against that background, it is the judgment of the Government that planning for the deployment of the multinational force should proceed as a matter of urgency.  As indicated, over the period since the passage of Resolution 1080 on 15 November we have been attending an intensive series of meetings of potential troop-contributing countries hosted by Canada.  Through this process of consultation a phased, progressive and flexible plan for the deployment of the force has been worked out and agreed by the participating countries.  Under that plan, the force's role will evolve to match the changing circumstances and its deployment will proceed on a step by step basis in the context of the overall objective of facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the orderly, voluntary repatriation of refugees and displaced persons.  The first phase of that plan has already been in place for some time.  It involved, with the deployment of a small planning staff, assisting the current efforts to provide humanitarian relief and voluntary repatriation as well as assisting in the task of ascertaining the location and condition of remaining refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the plan was agreed at a meeting of troop-contributing countries in Ottawa last Friday.  It involved the establishment of the force's headquarters in Kampala, Uganda, in the coming days.  The primary mission of the headquarters will be to direct and co-ordinate ongoing and future activities involved to facilitate humanitarian assistance and voluntary repatriation.  The headquarters will liaise closely with the UN humanitarian co-ordinator, who is based in the region and responsible for the coordination of international humanitarian relief. Decisions on further phases of the plan including, for instance, the conveying of humanitarian <Col N="706" /> assistance in eastern Zaire by air lifts or ground convoys, remain to be taken.  The establishment of the headquarters in Kampala should considerably enhance the planning and information-gathering for such options.</P>
    <P>Political oversight of the force will rest with a steering group in close consultation with the UN Secretary General.  This steering group, formally established by Canada at last Friday's meeting in Ottawa, will have 14 members, two of whom will be in an <i>ex officio</i> capacity.  The group will comprise Canada, Belgium, Cameroon, <i>ex officio</i> as chairman of the Organisation of African Unity, France, Japan, Senegal, South Africa, Italy, Ireland, <i>ex officio</i> as EU Presidency, Spain, the UK, the US, Uganda and Sweden.  The steering group was chosen for the most part on the basis of the size of the proposed contribution of the particular country to the force.  The group will have a decisive say in regard to any proposal to move from one stage of the phased plan to the next.  The group is expected to meet mostly in New York with participation likely to be by the permanent representatives to the United Nations. The New York location will also facilitate close liaison with the UN.</P>
    <P>In regard to the precise composition of the force, the Canadian Government circulated a detailed series of questions to potential troop-contributing countries last week.  Ireland responded promptly making it clear in doing so that our proposed participation in the force was subject to Dáil approval.  I will outline to the House the elements set out in our offer.  They are as follows: for the force headquarters, a number of staff officers and non-commissioned officers; radio operators to assist in the communications centre of the HQ; military police and a small number of experienced officers who could provide liaison with NGOs and local authorities. These officers have experience of having served previously in Rwanda with NGOs.  Should ground development in eastern Zaire be decided on we have offered additional elements, an engineering component and a transport platoon.</P>
    <P>Depending on the elements the Canadian Government wishes to take up, in the light of requirements, from our offer, Ireland could be contributing a contingent of 100 plus troops to the multinational force.  Ireland's contribution will be primarily oriented to the logistical support side of the multinational force.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the following additional points about the force and our proposed contribution to it.  Canada is currently evaluating the offers of the various countries wishing to participate in the force.  In our case it is doing so in direct consultation with our Defence Forces on a daily basis.  Canada has not yet decided which offers it will require to set up the headquarters in Kampala.  For this reason, and in view of the relatively large number of countries proposing to contribute, we cannot say the precise level or nature of the Irish involvement in the headquarters element in Kampala.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> Ireland will have to finance its participation in the force from its own resources.  The United Nations has established a trust fund to assist participation in the force of African countries. Ireland proposes to contribute £250,000 to that fund.  The force commander will be General Maurice Baril of Canada.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the force falls under Chapter Seven of the Charter of the United Nations.  Draft rules of engagement for the force are currently being elaborated by Canada, in conjunction with potential troop-contributing countries.  They have not yet been finalised.  For our part, it goes without saying that the safety of our troops will be a major consideration in determining the details of our participation in the force.</P>
    <P>The ultimate size of the force has not yet been determined.  Canada envisages that for the current level of the operation the troop requirement will be of the order of 2,000.  The future size will depend on the way in which the deployment plan evolves, in accordance with needs, over the coming period.  Accordingly, Irish Defence Forces deployment will also depend on the operational option decided as the planning for the force is developed and depending on the situation.</P>
    <P>Deployment of those elements of the Irish offer required by Canada will take place as quickly as possible.  The first elements of the force headquarters are being put in place in Kampala this week.  In determining the speed with which Ireland can deploy its contingent, issues such as transportation of heavy equipment, if required, will be factors.  Irish participation in the force will be reviewed after six months or earlier if the objectives of the operation have been fulfilled in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 1080 of 1996.</P>
    <P>UN Security Council Resolution 1080 indicates that the operation will terminate on 31 March 1997, unless the Council, on the basis of a report of the Secretary General, determines that the objectives of the operation have been fulfilled earlier.  Resolution 1080 envisages the establishment of a follow-on operation which would succeed the multinational force and the Security Council has requested the Secretary General to submit for its consideration, no later than 1 January 1997, a report containing his recommendations regarding the possible concept, mandate, structure, size and duration of such an operation.</P>
    <P>That is the overall background to the proposed participation by Ireland in the multinational force.  The Government believes that we have the support of the people in offering the deployment of our troops in this force.  Our Defence Forces have a long and proud record of service in peacekeeping around the world.  Our troops look forward to playing their full part in Africa with the Irish NGOs who are already performing such excellent work, in the task of bringing <Col N="708" /> humanitarian assistance to those in need as a result of this crisis and to helping with the voluntary repatriation process.  The step by step flexible approach proposed for the force by Canada is a sensible and prudent one which balances the humanitarian needs of the situation with the safety of the participating troops.  We are all aware of the volatile nature of the situation in eastern Zaire.  It is right that the planning for the deployment of troops from the international community in that situation should be done on an extremely thorough and careful basis, which inevitably is taking time.  Our troops deserve no less.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the motion before us.  We have a proud record of participation in UN humanitarian and peacekeeping missions throughout the world. Ironically, in 1996, 35 years after the first force went to the Congo, we are sending our people back to that region.</P>
      <P>That confirms the role a small neutral country can play in humanitarian aid efforts and there is a high level of acceptance of our troops and gardaí when they participate in UN missions.  I note the offer made by the Government to the Canadians of logistical and headquarters support as well as an engineering component and transport platoon.  I look forward to the Canadians taking up this offer soon.  I also support financing our participation from our own resources.  It is the least we can do in this crisis. We have contributed £250,000 to the trust fund to assist participation by African countries and it is very important that African countries participate on the African continent.</P>
      <P>The safety of our forces within the constraints of the job they are requested to do must also be of paramount concern.  Unfortunately, we have had tragedies over the years but that is part of participation in these missions.  It is a risk recognised by our gardaí and military personnel. Despite that risk they are prepared to take on the task, as are our NGOs.  We must do everything possible to provide for the safety of our personnel and NGOs.  The Minister should ensure that when our military authorities negotiate with the Canadians this is as safe an operation as possible for all troops.</P>
      <P>The central African states have been calling for the establishment of a neutral force to protect the vulnerable population of the Great Lakes region since 5 November.  The establishment of a temporary multinational force for humanitarian purposes in eastern Zaire was eventually sanctioned by the UN Security Council Resolution No. 1080 on 15 November.  It is no surprise that the long awaited motion approving the dispatch of a contingent of the permanent defence force to eastern Zaire has finally reached the House for discussion days before the Dublin Summit of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> This Government must, at all costs, appear to lead the EU in its response to the crisis in the Great Lakes region.  The Government must appear proactive, decisive and unselfish and appear to act on the concern for the people of the Great Lakes it has often expressed.  &ldquo;Leadership, action, decision-making, concern&rdquo;.  A thin veneer of words have been used to disguise the inertia of the Irish Presidency and the EU at a time of great human need.  For the past five months the Government has been uniquely placed to influence events on a global level.  The Rainbow Coalition has failed to live up to its responsibilities as President of the EU.  There is no crock of gold at the end of this rainbow but a crock of a different nature.  The Tánaiste's statement on the Great Lakes region last Wednesday documented a series of meetings and meetings about meetings.  The Tánaiste spoke of what he called the &ldquo;twin realities&rdquo; of the central African crisis.  The shameful truth is, the Tánaiste as President of the EU Council, has done nothing, and is not doing anything to alleviate the plight of the central African peoples.  Those are the twin realities of the central African crisis.</P>
    <P>In the same statement, the Tánaiste offered congratulations to the Canadian Government for relieving him of the burden of responsbility which accompanies the title of President of the EU Council.  In a great show of magnanimity, the Tánaiste warmly thanked the Canadians for seizing the initiative and agreeing to take the lead in putting together a multinational force for deployment in the Great Lakes region.  So much for the Irish Presidency and Irish leadership.</P>
    <P>As EU President, Ireland has failed completely to exercise its duty to provide leadership to EU member states.  The response of the EU to the crisis in the Great Lakes region has amounted to little more than diplomatic noise.  Ireland, the EU and the UN have pursued an &ldquo;ostrich&rdquo; policy. With our heads buried deep in the sand, we have expressed our concern and done nothing.  We are now offered the opportunity to redeem ourselves through action.  However, the deployment of a multinational force of the type sanctioned by UN Resolution No. 1080 is inadequate to tackle the new dynamic of the Great Lakes crisis.</P>
    <P>Resolution No. 1080 sanctioned: &ldquo;the establishment for humanitarian purposes of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the immediate return of humanitarian organisations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organisations' humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire, and to facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The original purpose of the multinational force was twofold: to open humanitarian aid corridors to gain access to the refugee population isolated by fighting in eastern Zaire, and to provide protection for aid workers active in the region. <Col N="710" /> The current situation in the Great Lakes region has changed dramatically in recent weeks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned to Rwanda, and continue to return at a rate of 5,000 per day.  The Mugungan refugee camp, previously the world's largest refugee camp, has been effectively dismantled.  Aid workers have returned to the Great Lakes region and have tirelessly resumed their valuable work.  These are positive developments which occurred in spite of international inaction rather than as a result of any coherent EU or UN policy.</P>
    <P>Conversely, the political situation in Zaire has deteriorated into anarchy and civil war.  The Tutsi rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, has stepped up his campaign to capture Kinshasa and oust President Mobutu.  In Burundi, the army has reportedly embarked on a bloody campaign against the Hutu population.  In Rwanda, thousands of Hutu prisoners, including many women and children continue to languish in filthy, disease-ridden prisons without the prospect of trial.  The Hutu extremist Interhamwe militia, responsible for the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda over two years ago, have not been captured, disarmed and brought to justice.  The situation in the Great Lakes region is volatile and explosive.  However, the volatility and dynamism of the crisis should not be manipulated by the Government, and the international political community at large, as an excuse for inaction.</P>
    <P>The EU, through the UN, has a critical role to play in resolving the crisis in Central Africa. Ireland, as President of the EU, must assume the responsibility of leadership and ensure that the EU takes decisive action to achieve a stable and long lasting solution to the crisis.  This is a responsibility each of us must assume as we debate the pros and cons of sending a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces to eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>Although I am strongly in favour of the motion, it is insufficient merely to revitalise the concept of a multinational force as embodied in UN Security Council Resolution 1080.  The most immediate and critical task to be undertaken by a multinational force is that of ascertaining the location and condition of the 200,000-700,000 refugees who have failed to return to Rwanda.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the debate among representatives of the European Union, the United Nations and central African countries has shifted from the task of formulating a coherent international response to the crisis in the Great Lakes region to the question of whether a response is needed.  This shift in agenda, which has occurred at the expense of time and lives, hangs on the failure of the international community to monitor the movements and numbers of the refugee population in eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>The United Nations estimated that it was feeding approximately 1.2 million refugees in Zaire since the crisis in 1994.  The United Nations and aid agencies in the region estimate that <Col N="711" /> approximately 700,000 refugees have returned to Rwanda in recent weeks.  Basic arithmetic is sufficient to demonstrate that the Rwandan Government grossly misrepresented the severity of the problem when it claimed that virtually all of the refugees had returned.</P>
    <P>Although the return of 700,000 refugees to Rwanda is a positive development, it presents many grave challenges to the Rwandan Government and the international community as represented by the European Union and the United Nations.  Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.  The mass influx of refugees will greatly exacerbate the problems associated with overpopulation.  The local population of predominantly Hutu areas such as Gisenyi and Ruhengeri has increased by as much as 30 per cent.  When coupled with the explosive political atmosphere which has surrounded the return of the refugees, these twin circumstances present a dangerous picture.  A multinational force must be on hand to guarantee and protect human rights.</P>
    <P>To assess accurately the number and condition of remaining refugees and to adequately protect human rights the mandate of a multinational force for deployment in the Great Lakes region must be expanded beyond the capacity of Resolution 1080.  It must have a mandate to disarm the militias active in the region as well as elements of the former Rwandan Army.  It must have a mandate to arrest those guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, rape and other violations of human rights.  It must include a specialised international civilian human rights component to monitor the human rights situation.</P>
    <P>As President of the European Union, Ireland must ensure the establishment of a multinational force for deployment in the Great Lakes region is not merely a belated exercise in face-saving.  It must have a clear and strong mandate to be carried out within a specified period.  This is essential, as we have seen from other examples. If these criteria are not fulfilled, not only will the presence of a multinational force fail to alleviate the crisis, it may serve to aggravate it.</P>
    <P>The role played by Ireland, the European Union, the United Nations and the international community as a whole in the Great Lakes region must not be restricted to military action alone. The deployment of a multinational force in the region has as its primary objective the need to expedite the humanitarian aid effort, which must underpin rather than replace the search for a stable and long-lasting political solution to the problems which have bedevilled the countries of central Africa.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to deliver temporary relief, wash our hands and return home for Christmas dinner.  The international community must commit itself to the long-term restructuring of central Africa.  Long-term priorities must include the successful resettlement and reintegration of returnees in Rwanda; rehabilitation of the judicial <Col N="712" /> system in Rwanda; radical restructuring of the prison system in Rwanda in compliance with full respect for human rights, and restoration of democracy which must address the need for power sharing.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute, on behalf of the people, to our non-governmental organisations such as Trócaire, Concern, GOAL and others operating in the region.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude.  They continue to operate and provide humanitarian aid at great personal risk.  They embody the aims and ideals of the people in a magnificent manner.</P>
    <P>There is no simple solution to the crisis in central Africa.  It is a complex problem to which the response must be sophisticated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad that this motion has, at last, been introduced, I am disappointed at the nature of what has been proposed by the Minister.  The strength of our armed forces is 13,000-14,000 personnel.  The most we are prepared to contribute to this expedition for which there is a crying and urgent need is, apparently, about 100 men.  That is inadequate from an Irish, European and United Nations point of view.  The Minister mentioned that it is envisaged that the total number of troops involved will be about 2,000.  When one thinks of the vast areas where there are problems and the vast populations of the countries concerned, particularly Zaire, 2,000 troops is a mere drop in the ocean.</P>
      <P>It appears that many of these troops will be based in a headquarters in Kampala in Uganda.  I cannot understand the thinking behind this.  It is like the United Nations deciding, if there was a serious problem here and it felt it had to deploy a force to protect refugees and displaced persons, that its headquarters should be located in the south of France or northern Italy, approximately the same distance away.  This does not make sense.  I would have thought that the headquarters of a multinational force would be located in Goma, Bukavu or either end of Lake Kivu at the centre of the problem.</P>
      <P>The significance of the problem is highlighted by the fact that the flow of refugees returning voluntarily to Rwanda has been reduced to a trickle.  The United Nations report of 3 December, issued last night, states that the number of refugees crossing into Rwanda from Goma has slowed to 250 per day and that aid agencies fear most of the remaining Rwandans have moved west further away from the border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of remaining Rwandans and displaced Zaireans is somewhere in the region of 750,000, many of whom have not had any contact with an aid agency or NGO for well over one month.  Nobody can say with certainty what condition they are in but it must be bad because they have been wandering for over one month and living off the land.  There must be little left to live on.  This is most distressing as these people are highly vulnerable.  In spite of constant calls <Col N="713" /> from people like Commissioner Bonino in the European Union and the Secretary General of the United Nations, the response of the western world and the United Nations in general has been to talk about the deployment of 2,000 troops.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not specify a time for the deployment of this force.  The Canadian Foreign Minister said yesterday that nobody wanted to be in Rwanda or Zaire over Christmas and that these troops might arrive after Christmas.  I find that quite distressing &mdash; it is an indication of a lack of concern for the awful suffering which 0.75 million are enduring.  While I fully support this motion, I have reservations about its inadequacy and the inadequacy of our response and that of the UN and the EU.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the up to date position which seems to change so rapidly.  It was reported last night and again this morning that eastern Zairean rebels claim to have captured Kisangani, but this remains uncertain because it has been denied by the Zairean central Government. However, the rebels are certainly in the vicinity of Kisangani, hundreds of kilometres west of the Rwandan border.  As I said three or four weeks ago, Zaire is beginning to disintegrate. Everything which has happened since seems to bear that out.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which exist are borne out by the fact that the Zairean rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, who is closely associated with the Rwandan Government or the Tutsi element in it, has said the territory under the control of his forces will soon be named Democratic Congo.  He was interviewed on the news last night and he seems to be in the process of establishing a breakaway independent state.  NGOs and aid agencies cannot operate in an environment with this type of conflict unless there is a serious military presence there to protect the donors and would be recipients of the aid which is so urgently needed.</P>
    <P>Another reason I am concerned about the headquarters being located in Kampala is that AFP reported &ldquo;celebrations by Ugandan soldiers following the capture of Kasindi, Masabwe, Manda and Mutaga in Zaire.  Uganda is reportedly assembling many more troops along the Zairean border.&rdquo;  That is a serious situation and it is obvious that those in the region look on Zaire, or what we might now call former Zaire, as being up for grabs.  Mr. Kabila is to form a country in eastern Zaire to be known as Democratic Congo.  Uganda has already moved into part of Zaire and is celebrating its capture. To talk about 2,000 troops being headquartered in Kampala as a sufficient reaction is patently inadequate.</P>
    <P>However, at least we have made progress.  Five weeks ago in the House I said it was essential that the UN, the EU and Ireland should send troops to the region.  I was told by the Tánaiste on 31 October that there was no question of us or the EU sending troops.  He said it was unlikely that the UN or the EU, under whatever mandate, <Col N="714" /> would be sending troops to this region.  He went on to say that in all honesty he did not see European Union member states offering troops for a mission to the area.  When I said it required immediate military intervention and that nothing else was adequate, he said he had to disagree with my suggestions.  At least we have advanced from that position and we have succeeded, as a result of short debates in the House, in changing the Tánaiste's mind.  The tragedy is that if there had been military intervention when I recommended it in October, thousands of people would now be alive.</P>
    <P>While I am disappointed by the size of Ireland's contribution, it is not the only country which is not fulfilling its obligations as fully as we might wish.  Larger, richer and militarily more powerful nations are making as small a contribution as Ireland, in particular the US and the UK.  It was reported yesterday that the UK will now be contributing only a few logistics personnel to the multinational force.  That is appalling and we are entitled, even with our small contribution, to express our criticism and regret at the unwillingness of the UK to contribute a meaningful force to this multinational effort.  The US has confined itself to providing transport and money.  Money is a way of salving one's conscience.  If one does not want to make an effort and is rich enough, one can provide money so that nobody can blame one for not making an effort to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>I am sorry we do not have more time to deal with this matter.  I welcome the motion, which does not place a limit on troops.  I hope the numbers will increase.  Do we need to maintain a battalion in the Lebanon?  Could we not move these troops?  Could the UN not move most of its 5,000 troops in the Lebanon to eastern Zaire to protect these unfortunate people?</P>
    <P>The Minister said &ldquo;We saw in 1994 that a humanitarian solution alone is not a solution at all.&rdquo;  I have no difficulty in agreeing with that, but here we are again trying to wash our hands and say that we, the western world, the rich world, will provide money but we will not put anybody at risk.  We will allow people to die in their thousands, we will not try to prevent the breakup of the existing order, we will allow all kinds of breakaway states and anarchical developments to continue in the area.  The world has a duty to stop what is happening in Zaire.  On passing a motion such as this we cannot afford the luxury of leaving it open to be fulfilled at some unspecified date in the future.  The troops should be on their way as soon as this motion is passed.  Those who have greater obligations than we have, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and others, should also ensure that troops are on their way without delay.  It is a crying disgrace that is not done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> The wider political points relating to this region will be <Col N="715" /> debated tomorrow and I hope to have an opportunity then to contribute further to that debate.  Two years ago we all realised the importance of intervening to assist the people of Rwanda.  From our knowledge and experience of that part of Africa we realise how incredibly complex is the position there and that a political solution needs to be found.  It has proven very difficult to persuade the international community and even the European Union to address the question of a long-term political solution.  The colonialism visited on the continent of Africa in the last century and the first part of this century by our partners in the EU has left a dreadful legacy of division, power struggles and exploitation.  Yet they, more than anybody else, have been most unwilling to intervene in a positive fashion to assist those countries.</P>
      <P>In all the conflicts that have arisen in Africa in the past 20 years, there have been three main elements: the Cold War conflict between the United States and the Soviet bloc, the hasty colonial retreat by the Belgians, British and French in their efforts to maintain an economic stranglehold on many of those countries and in more recent years the insidious element of the international arms trade.  We cannot solve those problems on our own, but as a small neutral country we can do much in the humanitarian area and we can help in the political area.  Our contribution in terms of military intervention will complement the work done by Irish NGOs and volunteers.</P>
      <P>In the political area our capacity to act is limited for a number of reasons, particularly the weakness of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.  It has proven extremely difficult to get agreement on that issue at European as well United Nations level.  The only area where agreement was reached quickly is the humanitarian area.  The recent visit to the region by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and Commissioner Bonino achieved a rapid response at a humanitarian level and I compliment them on that.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised it has taken nearly two months to reach a decision that 2,000 military personnel will be sent to this region.  That contrasts clearly with the response to the Iraqi evasion of Kuwait and the crisis relating to the Kurds in northern Iraq when the international community under the UN flag moved very quickly.  Our so-called partners such as France and Belgium do not have an honourable record in this area.  Considering their involvement in the events leading up to the genocide in 1994, one is almost ashamed to be their partner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised the Rwandan people are sceptical about a United Nations force.  There was a United Nations force there when the genocide occurred but it stood by because its mandate was not strong enough.  It is a disgrace to the international community that in this case it has taken so long to get a commitment to intervene, <Col N="716" /> and it has taken even longer to work out a mandate.  As is evident from the debate today and from current affairs coverage in the past two weeks, it has proven even more difficult to get a commitment from countries that are in a position to send large contingents of military forces.  When the crisis was at its peak, Mr. Perry, Mr. Rifkind and Mr. Portillo got credit for their determination to commit troops to the area, but in the past two weeks they quietly retreated on that.</P>
    <P>I share many of Deputy O'Malley's concerns about this force, but I agree we should contribute to it.  The contribution outlined by the Minister is a start, but I hope it is only a start and that we will be in a position to send further troops as the need arises.  I particularly welcome the fact that a number of Army officers who have experience of Rwanda and eastern Zaire will be included in the force.  Many of those officers worked extremely hard in the 1994 emergency in assisting humanitarian organisations and NGOs.  From my encounters with Irish officers in Africa, they provide a very useful role in liaising between organisations, military forces and local communities.  I have no doubt the officers who take part in this force will serve in a distinguished fashion.</P>
    <P>The House should keep under constant review the mandate for the force.  We have seen in recent weeks that uncertainty can prevail &mdash; for example, when we feared the genocide of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire, almost overnight the position changed and they returned to Rwanda.  We have heard varying reports of the number of refugees &mdash; from 170,000 to 700,000 &mdash; still in the south Kivu region.  As the position in Zaire unfolds daily, we realise how complex and difficult the problems are.</P>
    <P>The Government and this House should keep its attention focused firmly on this issue.  I stress that no military force, regardless of its size, will solve the problem in the Great Lakes region.  A response will be required at three levels, political, humanitarian and human rights level.  We should do everything possible to assist ex-President Nyerere in his efforts to broker agreements.  It should be remembered that the genocide occurred in 1994 because elements in the Hutu leadership in Rwanda would not accept the implementation of the Arusha accords.  This problem did not appear overnight and it will not disappear overnight.  We must maintain an interest in providing military forces and continue to provide a political interest and a humanitarian response to this problem, which will not be solved by sending a force as proposed in this motion. Sending the force will help, and it should be supported, but sustained effort is required over a long period.  I hope the House will return to this subject on a more regular basis than it has in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said the world bank of knowledge doubled twice in this century alone. We all know about advances in medical science, food nutrition, transport, housing, sanitation and communications.  Many of these developments are without parallel in our history.  The world's population has grown from two billion to 5.6 billion in this century.  In many developed countries people are living almost ten years longer, yet in the middle of all this development lies a human tragedy of death, disease, hunger and ethnic conflicts.  We see harrowing pictures on television of children reaching for food and being trampled on by those who are stronger.  A week does not pass but these pictures come into the homes of everybody who has a television.</P>
      <P>What is at issue here this morning is not that these tragedies occur but the action the world community is prepared to take to ensure that, as far as is possible, human life is not trampled on in the way it is being trampled on in eastern Zaire, where hundreds of thousands of people walk for miles without food or water.  We have to admit honestly that the efforts of the United Nations have been sluggish and unresponsive to these great needs.  In addition, the European Union, of which we have the Presidency, has delayed sending troops who will try to open up the corridors for the aid workers and to assist the other developments that must take place.  An opportunity was lost in this area.  It is time we remedied that and made sure troops, and others being recruited in the transport military police and engineering areas, are sent as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I was sad to learn that in regard to the specialised group which left for Rwanda we are still squabbling about overseas allowances.  Will the Minister for Defence, who is taking this debate today, ensure that problem is resolved and we do not ask troops to go overseas in this uncertainty?  Given our experience in Rwanda, we should end that dialogue, solve the problem and move on.</P>
      <P>In regard to the convention on the safety of United Nations troops and associated personnel, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs introduce the legislation to ratify that convention as soon as possible?  I want to give the remainder of my time to Deputy Kitt.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for sharing his time with me.  As we have been reminded in the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, we are finding out more every day about the position in the Great Lakes region.  In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> there is an article referring to the fact that the Tutsi rebels captured the Bunia town in north eastern Zaire, according to refugees and Ugandan army sources.  In addition, US army reconnaissance has located 170,000 refugees in a strip of land 60 miles west of the Rwandan border.  That brings home to us the seriousness of the crisis.  The chairman of Trocaire, Bishop Kirby, recently described the crisis in the area as <Col N="718" /> a scene of biblical proportions and talked about men and women carrying large bundles on their heads, children clinging for dear life to the skirts of their mothers and old people hobbling on crutches and on sticks.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the delay in dealing with this matter.  I understand from questions I tabled to the Minister a summit of regional leaders took place in Nairobi on 5 October.  I would have expected to see more action being taken in regard to this crisis since then.  The regional leaders' resolution to take urgent measures was followed up by the OAU in Addis Ababa; I believe the Minister of State travelled to the region also. There have been major delays since then in bringing that resolution before the House.</P>
      <P>My other concern relates to the fact that our army officers complained of not having sufficient personnel, not even a battalion.  The Minister put our minds at ease this morning in that regard and perhaps he might comment on the question of further troops being made available.  Those comments were not encouraging, however, and the officers stated also that the question of medical corps personnel was not addressed.</P>
      <P>When I raised this question with the Minister on 20 November he told me a resolution had been adopted by the UN Security Council to establish a force up to the end of March 1997.  I hope the Minister's comment about further consideration to supplying more troops will be realised.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has raised concern about Resolution No. 1078 which does not specifically mention the prevention of human rights violations as one of the functions.  Will the Minister comment on that point and on the questions raised by Trocaire about monitoring the resettlement of refugees and the thousands of prisoners living in appalling conditions in Rwanda, which is vitally important?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Ireland's participation in the force.  I have been critical of the slowness of the UN response, and that is one of the reasons I led a EU Troika mission to the region, specifically in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.  The work done by me, my other colleagues in the Troika, and Commissioner Bonino, was important.  At that stage the Secretary General had talked about reconvening the committee three weeks later, on 20 November, to discuss the question of sending a force to the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the mandate of the force includes the separation and disarming of armed elements because Zaire is a vast country the size of western Europe made up of a number of provinces, some of which are remote from the authority of central government.  A number of rebel forces in Kivu in Zaire appear to have been accepted by the local population.  Probably the fiercest and most appalling militia groups ever seen, the ex-FAR <Col N="719" /> and the Interhamwe, which masterminded and carried out the murder of one million people in Rwanda, are operating in Kivu province at the same time.  Not all those murdered were Tutsis as has been said.  A number of moderate Hutus who refused to take part in the killing of their fellow Tutsi citizens were also murdered.  It is important that we and our troops understand this appallingly complex and interwoven situation which is not capable of an easy solution.  It is a problem which has been there since colonial times which was exacerbated on independence.  It is ironic that our soldiers are now returning to Zaire which was where the first peacekeeping mission was undertaken by them when the country was known as the Congo.  It is interesting that the leader of the rebel forces, Mr. Kabila, comes from what is now called Shaba province and was known to most Irish people then as Katanga.</P>
    <P>There has been dithering on the part of the generals at the Stuttgart meeting.  What we need from the force changes on a week-by-week basis but it can do important work, even at this late stage.  It can assist in the humanitarian effort. Approximately 600,000 people have successfully returned home but other people are still out in the bush in eastern Zaire and have been out of camps for more than five weeks.  I am more than fearful for their condition.  We also know that the Hutu militias, the Interhamwe and the ex-FAR, are on a rampage of killing in parts of eastern Zaire.  Our reports on this are limited but the intelligence made available to us is frightening. The international force must have a mandate which includes the separation and distinguishing between the armed elements in the ex-FAR and the Interhamwe and ordinary refugees forced to leave their homes and who, like the 600,000 who have successfully returned home, would also like to return home.</P>
    <P>We already have reports that the rebel forces led by Mr. Kabila may have already made their way as far as Kisengani which is in the middle of eastern Zaire and 500 kilometres from Goma. Kivu province now appears to be, with the exception of areas controlled by the Interhamwe, under the control of the Kabila forces.  There are sensitivities as to how the international force will operate.  It must clarify that those who are genocidal killers are not in the same category as those whose express desire is to take part in Zairean elections.</P>
    <P>We, as President of the European Union, started our visit to Zaire by saying to the people that we would like to see a peaceful transition to democracy and that we, as the European Union, would underwrite in part the cost of the elections. I urge the rebel forces to go the democratic road and I hope the troops' presence will offer part of the mechanism whereby those forces in Kivu can join in a democratic solution to the problems of Zaire.  Otherwise, I fear Zaire may break up into <Col N="720" /> a series of chaotic civil wars with huge potential for loss of life.</P>
    <P>As regards the soldiers, the Army and the Government have said that we are ready to assist as requested.  There are important jobs we can do and soldiers and officers in the Army have a good record of assisting in a peacemaking process in similar difficult situations.  It will be essential to keep the progress of the force under constant review.  The return of people to Rwanda has been an extraordinary success as 600,000 people have returned to their homes in conditions which are close to miraculous.  Rather like our ceasefire, that miraculous sense of going home in conditions of calm with no revenge killings can only be maintained if the international community makes a massive effort to support it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt referred to monitors. They are essential because they let us know how the returning refugees get on and they are also essential in vital areas such as housing.</P>
    <P>People talk about Rwanda in terms of hunger. Those who know Rwanda know it is one of the most fertile countries and the region is one of the most fertile parts of the world producing two to three crops per year.  If people go hungry, it is not because of famine but because of political events. We must provide seeds and agricultural implements for the first season to provide food for the first period when people return home. Ireland is making a specific contribution of £2.25 million and the European Union is making a massive commitment of 170 million ECU to this area.  We need to assist with housing.  At the moment returning refugees are claiming their houses and people who are the victims of genocide or are former refugees are being thrown out of those houses to make way for the returning owners.  A situation like that can only be settled by a huge amount of extra housing.  The presence and assistance of the international force is needed for the logistics of this.  There were 200 hundred lorries in Rwanda three weeks ago for a movement of half a million people.  Every bus, bicycle and lorry in the country was commandeered.  If the people in Zaire are to come home, more logistical support like lorries are needed to take them home and save them walking 50 to 100 miles.  They can and are doing it but it would be better if there was transport to their homes and that, when they get home, they were assisted as rapidly as possible with housing and shelter.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience in visiting the camps in Ngara and Goma on different occasions that the Irish people working in the region have done a tremendous job.  The fact that they are so involved in the various planning committees in the region is a tribute to the work the organisations have done in those areas.  We can all be proud of the Irish people.  The logistical experience of soldiers from the Army is vital and of enormous practical assistance even if it is not regular soldiering in the tradition we know.  It is important in the key work to be done.  We must <Col N="721" /> also bear in mind that military assistance is ten times more expensive than humanitarian assistance.  The humanitarian workers and the local authorities in the region know what assistance they want from the soldiers.  There is an important job for them to do.</P>
    <P>One other point Deputy Kitt made was about the conditions in Rwandan jails.  That is something on which the European Union has focused and Irish aid has contributed significantly in terms of feeding, clothing and providing water to the prisoners.  We have undertakings from the Government of Rwanda, which we will follow up closely, that those prisoners will be brought to trial beginning in December and will include elements of the South African truth and reconciliation process.  The reality in Rwanda is that with more than one million people being killed and with everybody being made complicit in the killing, the ordinary systems of justice simply do not answer the need for justice and for judicial proving of guilt or innocence.  That is necessary, but they also have to provide the mechanism for reconciliation between the different groups in the country.  That is why in our statement we said that the assistance we give to Rwanda must not only meet humanitarian needs but must be consistent with efforts to reconcile the different groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this proposal of the Minister for Defence.  It was I who, when Minister for Defence, introduced the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993 which sent two contingents of troops to Somalia where they served two six-month rotas over a period of 12 months with honour, integrity and responsibility.  I have no doubt that in introducing this legislation the Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, will have at his disposal the same quality of officers and other ranks to serve this cause in the name of Ireland. Our record in that regard is unequalled.</P>
      <P>On the general question, I do not wish to be critical or to appear in any way anguished about the lateness of the introduction of this legislation. To say the least, the international community has been dilatory.  It has taken almost two months to reach this point.  The United Nations approach to this issue has been utterly disgraceful, and the EU has not been far behind, despite what the Minister of State says.  Credit is due to her for going with the Troika to that region in the company of Commissioner Bonino who has been tremendously consistent in her criticism of the EU and the UN.  However, we are better late than never, because there are many hundreds of thousands of lives still at stake.  I can imagine the number of lives that have been lost as a direct result of the slowness of world organisations to do what we would consider to be the business on our behalf and that of the international community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I had the honour to be Minister for Defence I was in Rwanda.  I visited Kigali, Goma in Zaire and the Katale camp and saw the most <Col N="722" /> horrendous of sights, which I am sure the Minister of State saw too when she was there.  There were a million refugees in two or three camps surrounding Goma.  I then left to go to Kigali, the capital of Rwanda.  I saw probably one of the most beautiful countries I have ever seen, and I have travelled quite a considerable part of the world.  Rwanda, which was depicted in &ldquo;Gorillas in the Mist&rdquo;, a wonderful film about the possible extinction of gorillas living in that part of the world, was magnificent.  There were crops in untended fields and beautiful rolling hills reminiscent of parts of Kerry at its very best but this beautiful country is denuded of people.  It was quite eerie, to say the least.</P>
    <P>I too would like to be associated with the wonderful work of the Irish aid agencies and non-governmental organisations who do a magnificent job.  We would be lost without them.  Sometimes our foreign policy lags behind what they are doing; they lead and we follow.  We should be leading and they should be following.  The large organisations to which we happen to belong grind slowly, and it is for that reason that we lag behind.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has indicated that a contingent of Irish troops will be going to the Great Lakes region.  It is important that they should go, and that they should go sooner rather than later. If the international community continues to prevaricate in Stuttgart, we should go anyway to Rwanda or wherever our presence is required in the first instance, presumably eastern Zaire, and shame the rest of the world into going.  I have no doubt that we would be capable of protecting ourselves with the assistance of whoever may be there currently.  There is too much to be lost by not going now.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one other aspect.  As Presidency of the EU we should expose the obscene arms trade.  The newspapers have reported over the past weeks that arms are still going to certain elements in the part of the world under discussion here.  This is utterly disgraceful. The arms trade knows no morality, no bounds, no sides.  It is all about money and the pursuit of money.  There are countries within the EU which should be exposed as part of the so-called armaments industry.  These include France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany and others.  The sooner we, as a small country, expose them for the type of immorality they are involved in, the better world we will have.  It has never been discovered where the arms that got to this region came from.  I can only speculate, and perhaps I would be doing some countries an injustice.  It has been happening, and it has been a shame.  The countries involved are eastern Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and western Tanzania, and these are the countries which are threatened. France and Belgium owe these areas deep consideration. They are the countries that colonised this region.  We have our own history of having gone to the Belgian Congo in the late 1950s and lost a considerable number of our men in the pursuit <Col N="723" /> of peace.  That is how the Irish Army is.  Its contribution has been immense and the Army has never been found wanting.  It has been a huge element in our whole foreign policy structure and we should be deeply grateful to it.</P>
    <P>The failure of the United Nations to act in the Zairean crisis must be considered one of the great acts of inhumanity in recent times.  The Security Council has failed to provide the aid agencies with protection.  In fairness, this is what the Minister for Defence is doing in this instance.  The aid agencies have decided to go it alone to the refugee camps in an act of immense courage.  It is time we took the lead and sent out our own contingent in advance of those other larger powers which have failed to do their duty to these people.  If there were oil there, or if the people were not black, if it were Kuwait, there would be no problem. Unfortunately, that is not the reality.  It is time we took the lead, regardless of what the rest of the world does.</P>
    <P>The Government has given time to discuss the humanitarian crisis.  Again I pay tribute to the ministerial Troika that visited the region. However important the visit of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, is to the region it is imperative that the United Nations does its duty urgently without the politics and supports a response force.  Ireland will be part of that force for the rescue of many hundreds of thousands of men, women and children and, more particularly, for the protection of the aid agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute on this important matter.  The initiative to intervene in central Africa is late in the day and our involvement in Dáil Éireann could have been earlier.  I will be interested to know from the Government whether that has been delayed as a result of other distractions within Dáil Éireann. It is important that we are getting down to dealing with the issue of sending troops which requires a decision from Dáil Éireann rather than the Government.  It is sad that in trying to understand the complexity of what is happening in central Africa, without the benefit of visiting the region, that the media reports contain huge contradictions and widely differing reports.  An article in <i>The Guardian</i> last week by Chris McGreal stated:</P>
      <P>Last week American and United Nations' officials studied the same satellite photos of the same tracks of Eastern Zaire and came up with entirely contradictory conclusions.  The Americans saw almost nothing, the UN spotted 750,000 miserable souls being driven in circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that statement it was imperative that the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, visited the region and that we got an accurate and up-to-date report on exactly how we can help and where help is needed.  In sending Irish troops we must ensure that the structures of command are as patently neutral as possible.  If we sent Irish troops <Col N="724" /> on their own that would not be an issue.  Presumably we will be operating under a UN mandate. If we were operating under a French command it would be seen as partisan whereas under Canadian command it would be seen as less partisan. Those considerations are vital for the safety of our troops in this region.  It is vital also that we work through the political means which involves assisting the aid agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government and all of us owe an increased debt to the aid agencies.  It is not always realised that the success of the lottery has resulted in a considerable fall off of voluntary funds to aid agencies and the Government has to pick up some of the tab.  The likelihood, given the rampant, uncontrolled and unregulated arms industry, which has played not a small part in this conflict, is that Irish troops run the risk of being shot by British, French or Belgian arms in this region.  We hope it will not happen and we must take precautionary steps to ensure the arms industry is stopped in its tracks because it is running riot over the poorest areas of the world.  That issue needs to be tackled urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, came in to respond from the point of view of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  As the Minister responsible for the Defence Forces, I will not, under any circumstances send troops to any place where they do not know what they are supposed to do and where they are disposed to risks that are not acceptable.  It is grossly unfair of people to criticise the delay on the part of the Irish Defence Forces in participating in this region.  For the past four, five and six weeks we have been available to participate in any force, in any way required. The reason I have mentioned a figure of 100 Irish troops &mdash; it could be 140 &mdash; is that the Government committed itself to a UN standby arrangement to a maximum of 850.  Between Bosnia-Hercegovnia and South Lebanon we have in the region of 750 to 775 people involved.</P>
      <P>As a small country we should be proud of our record in terms of peacekeeping.  We have proven ourselves to be experts at peacekeeping.  We do not have an army that is armed to the hilt with heavy weaponry.  We are more involved in logistics in terms of human aid, humanitarian assistance and we are good at dealing with people. That is the speciality of the Irish army and long may it continue.  Wherever we go we fit in in a broader scale with those involved with heavy weaponry and so on who have another job to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job which the Irish Army do in the context of peacekeeping is very specialised, to the extent that we are respected wherever we go irrespective of the size of our country.  I was pleased to hear the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton. I reject the criticism that Ireland has been sitting on the fence during its Presidency in dealing with this issue.  Everybody knows that the Irish Presidency, for the last number of weeks <Col N="725" /> and months, has been forcing the situation here. Unfortunately people have not lived up to their responsibilities.  We have been prepared to live up to our responsibilities and are prepared to do it tomorrow morning.  I understand that a request could come this Friday for up to 35 military police to proceed to the region and we would be pleased to supply them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future role of Irish Defence Forces in peacekeeping, we have a specialist role to play.  Please do not ever expect trained soldiers to go into an area where they do not know what they are supposed to do.  That is the key issue in peacekeeping.  It was ironic that my colleague from Dún Laoghaire, Deputy Andrews, who was Minister for Defence in 1993, contributed to this debate.  As a result of his bringing in legislation a small transport unit was sent to Somalia, which I visited when a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  As a result of the 1993 legislation this motion is before the House.  The reason people are dragging their feet in relation to Rwanda and Zaire is because of the failure in Somalia.  The troops who were sent there did not know what they were supposed to do.  The Americans moved in, cleared the port at Mogadishu and the food got in.  Eventually the UN had to withdraw its troops.</P>
    <P>We are pressing to get an international conference under way consisting of the UN and the OAU.  This is essential if we are to find a solution to the problem in central Africa.  I saw it and anybody who cares to visit that region will soon realise we talk about a totally different culture that is simply not understood by western Europeans. That was my personal experience of my visit to Somalia.  To send troops to these areas without a clear mandate is absolute madness.  We will be there because we want to assist in a humanitarian way and to assist the NGOs in their great work.</P>
    <P>I am proud the Government has increased its level of aid to the Third World which, this year, is in the region of £106 million, the highest ever. That is real commitment on the part of a small country like Ireland.  The Government's commitment in terms of the availability of troops for peacekeeping is an indication that we are serious.</P>
    <P>It is galling for a Minister for Defence and our Defence Forces, when we go as observers to the Western European Union and recognise we should be participating in partnership for peace, that everybody says we are breaching neutrality and going off the rails.  Let us make up our minds once and for all what role we will play in Europe in terms of peacekeeping.  That is an essential issue we have to face.  There have been calls in this House for a European force to go into the region.  How can a European force go into this region when we cannot make up our minds on how we will co-operate on peacekeeping in Europe?</P>

      <P>In late 1995, the National Economic and Social Council decided to undertake a study programme under the broad heading &ldquo;Socio-Demographic Trends: Implications for Social Policy&rdquo;.  The demographic study will be completed in tandem with the related study of rural settlement patterns which the Government has requested as part of the programme of action in support of rural renewal and the development of the west, which is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  This reflects the fact that socio-demographic trends, settlement patterns and the associated policy implications are inextricably linked.  The first reports from this study are due to be published in the second half of 1997 although I will ask the council to bring forward the report on rural settlement at an earlier date if possible.</P>
      <P>The demographic programme consists of three modules: the first module is observed demographic-socio-demographic change and projected demographic change; the second module is separate studies of the policy implications of demographic change for the labour force, education, health and social services, social welfare, housing, pension and long-term care of the elderly; the third module is implications of demographic change for the private informal sector and the implications of this for the mixed economy of welfare.</P>

      <P>We are trying to have the report brought forward earlier.  I am aware of the population decline that occurred in the past and the current static statistics, particularly in Leitrim. However, the economy in that county has been significantly assisted by the Masonite project, which will provide 150 jobs, and the substantial economic spin-offs from the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal.  Both projects will have a major effect in south Leitrim.  Furthermore, the Leader programme, the area partnership programme and the North Leitrim Glens tourism initiative have not <Col N="727" /> yet had an appreciable effect on recorded statistics, which of necessity lag behind reality, but there are considerable signs of buoyancy in the economy of Leitrim.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I addressed the World Food Summit at the FAO headquarters in Rome on 15 November last.  I have arranged for copies of my address to <Col N="728" /> be circulated in the Official Report, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The Rome declaration on world food security and the World Food Summit plan of action were adopted by more than 160 countries, including Ireland, at the World Food Summit.  I have also arranged to have these documents circulated in the Official Report.  The Rome declaration is a policy statement which conveys a strong political call for the eradication of hunger and the achievement of food security for all.  The plan of action consists of seven commitments and associated actions which will help lay the foundations to achieve food security for all people.</P>
    <P>At the summit I announced a contribution of £1 million to the world food programme from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I also took the opportunity to meet the Chinese Prime Minister, Mr. Li Peng.  During the course of this meeting we discussed bilateral trade relations, EU-China relations, the issue of human rights and the EU-China human rights dialogue. The discussion on human rights was frank and full and lasted for the greater part of the meeting. The extensive nature of this discussion on general human rights did not allow time for discussion of the situation in particular parts of the People's Republic of China.  The Deputy can, however, be assured that I made clear to the Chinese Prime Minister the desire of Ireland and the EU that human rights should be respected throughout China.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity while in Rome to meet the Iranian Vice-President, the Argentinian Vice-President, the Korean Prime Minister, the Rwandan Prime Minister and the Maltese Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Address by Taoiseach, President of the Council of the European Union, to World Food Summit in Rome.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the Irish Taoiseach, I am pleased and privileged to speak to you today as President of the Council of the European Union.</P>
    <P>This Summit will focus the world's attention on one of the greatest challenges which will face us in the 21st century &mdash; the issue of how to achieve food security for all people.</P>
    <P>Almost one person in every seven faces hunger or severe malnutrition in the world today.  In the developing world, it is estimated that one person in every five does not have access to enough food to meet their daily needs.  In addition, a far greater number of people, estimated at 2 billion, live on diets which are chronically deficient in essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, iodine and Vitamin A.</P>
    <P>This is an intolerable and unacceptable situation and that is why we are here today. Through this Summit we wish to affirm our absolute resolve that this appalling situation cannot, and will not, be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> As the population of the world grows, the challenge of feeding all our people will become even greater.  Despite a falling growth rate, world population is expected to nearly double, to almost ten billion people, by 2050.  We must act now both to deal with the huge problem we currently face and to ensure that it will not grow to even greater proportions in the future.</P>
    <P>I therefore welcome, and wish to associate the European Union with, the key undertaking in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security in which we pledge our political will to achieving food security for all and reaffirm our commitment to the on-going effort to eradicate hunger in all countries.</P>
    <P>These must not be empty promises.  We have a solemn duty as national and international leaders to ensure that words are matched by actions on this critical issue.  We owe that duty to the hundreds of millions of men, women and children who are suffering from hunger and malnutrition, and the many more who will suffer a similar fate in the future if we do not act effectively now. Moving from words to actions requires that we have a clear understanding of the nature of the problem, and agreement on what needs to be done and by whom.</P>
    <P>Through hard experience &mdash; through trial and all too frequently error &mdash; we have learned that food security is a complex and multi faceted concept.  We know that the prime source of food insecurity is poverty.  In any food crisis, whether local or large scale, it is the poor who starve. Poverty is a major cause of food insecurity since it prevents people from producing food for themselves and from buying it from available supplies.  Progress towards the eradication of poverty is essential if access to food is to be improved for all people, and especially for the poor and members of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and minorities.</P>
    <P>This is why we define food security to be a situation where all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient and nutritionally balanced food for an active and healthy life.  The mere availability of food is not sufficient, although it is of course crucial, to the achievement of food security.</P>
    <P>Addressing the problem of food security therefore requires that we address the fundamental causes of poverty in both rural and urban areas.  In this regard the issues we address now are closely related to those we addressed at the World Conference on Social Development in Copenhagen.  The committments made then are important to the achievement of the objectives of this Summit.</P>
    <P>Effective and responsive governance is critical if the needs of the poor and the food insecure are to be clearly articulated and heard.  The Rome Declaration correctly identifies a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment as the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication.  The <Col N="730" /> necessary conditions for achieving this policy environment are recognised as:</P>
    <P>I.  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;II.  a democratic political system;</P>
    <P>III.  a transparent and effective legal framework;</P>
    <P>IV.  transparent and accountable governance and administration;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;V.  and effective and equal participation by all people in decisions affecting their food security.</P>
    <P>Human rights and respect for democracy must not be seen as luxuries to be enjoyed only by those who can afford them, but as providing the foundation for legitimate government action. With regard to combating terrorism, whether nationally, or internationally, the European Union recalls that this cannot call into question the universality &mdash; and the protection &mdash; of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Human rights and democracy are also essential elements in the creation of a genuinely enabling environment which provides the basis for development, the eradication of poverty and for food security.  Appropriate population policies, consistent with the conclusions of the International Conference on Population and Development, are also an important part of the equation, as are the provision of education, sanitation and primary health care and other necessary services.</P>
    <P>Women play a crucial role both in food production and in household food management. The commitments entered into at the Fourth World Conference on women in Beijing are particularly relevant in this regard.  Promoting the full and equal participation of women in society and the economy, and appropriately focusing policies on their needs, will contribute significantly to food security objectives.</P>
    <P>Sustainable and participatory food, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development policies are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies, as are trade policies which are fair and market oriented.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in recent years in encouraging food production.  As a result, world per capita dietary energy supply has increased over the past twenty years despite the very high population growth in that period. However, these benefits have not been equally spread and some regions, notably in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, remain in the category of &ldquo;low income, food deficit areas&rdquo;.  As we look to the future it is clear that further gains in yields and in productive area will be more difficult to attain, while population will continue to grow. We must continue the search for appropriate technologies to assist farmers to produce in an efficient and sustainable manner.  Such technologies must be economically viable, <Col N="731" /> socially appropriate and environmentally friendly if they are to be truly sustainable in the long-term. Particular attention must be paid to ensuring that land and water resources are not degraded or destroyed but are used to their maximum potential in a way that ensures that future generations can also enjoy access to them.</P>
    <P>Local production is frequently important not only to food supply, but also to poverty eradication and rural development.  Agriculture is in this sense multi functional, taking in as it does all these aspects and also the questions of avoiding rural depopulation and protecting the environment.  Local production cannot however be the complete answer to food security needs. Trade is also critical.  If we are to feed all our people we must produce and distribute food efficiently, and trade is essential to this. Appropriate trade policies, in accordance with WTO rules, are therefore another important element in the food security equation.</P>
    <P>We have seen in recent years how man-made emergencies such as civil wars and ethnic violence have severely disrupted food production and distribution, leading to hunger and malnutrition even in previously food abundant areas.</P>
    <P>The tragic situation in the Great Lakes Region is an affront to the entire international community.  The European Union will continue our intensive efforts to assist in averting further human tragedy in Eastern Zaire and in avoiding a potentially catastrophic humanitarian disaster developing in the region.  The Union will also continue to urge in every way possible that the necessary conditions should exist for essential humanitarian tasks to be carried out as quickly as possible and for the process of dialogue and reconciliation to be advanced.</P>
    <P>We must spare no effort in our attempts to prevent conflicts and to ensure the peaceful resolution of any difficulties should they arise. Corruption too is another insidious source of food insecurity, through the disruption it causes to economic and social development, and it must be combated relentlessly.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Plan of Action acknowledged so clearly the multi-dimensional nature of the follow up to this Summit.  Actions at household, local and national level must form the basis of any effective follow up.  In the Plan of Action, Governments have made many commitments on the wide range of issues that impact on food security.  It is vitally important that these commitments are implemented, for without action at national level little can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The international community too has its responsibility, to support national efforts where appropriate and to ensure the necessary intergovernmental co-ordination and action.  The follow up to this Summit must be closely interlinked with that of previous international conferences in order to ensure that the objective <Col N="732" /> of food security achieves its due recognition in this process.</P>
    <P>It is of course also important that there should be close co-ordination among UN agencies, and other relevant international organisations, in the follow up to the Summit, so that each can contribute to the overall objective within the area of its mandate, and duplication can be avoided. Clearly FAO will have a major role in this process, and I am happy to see this reflected appropriately in the Plan of Action.</P>
    <P>Development aid, including food aid, has a role in supporting national and local efforts to achieve food security.  The European Union is the largest provider of development aid in the world.  An EU Development Council Resolution on Food Security was adopted in November 1994 which was later developed by the policy reform adopted in July 1996.  It stresses the importance of long-term food security, and points out that food security should become one of the guiding principles of development programmes aimed at poverty eradication.  The primary aim is that victims of food crises become active participants in their own development process.</P>
    <P>Speaking as Prime Minister of Ireland I would also like to refer briefly to Ireland's policies in relation to development.  It is 150 years since Ireland suffered the effects of a great famine, in which over a million people died and a further million were forced to leave the country.  Ireland's experience of famine sharpens our official and voluntary commitment to development and to food security.  I would like to pay special tribute to the role played by Irish Non-Governmental Organisations in this effort.</P>
    <P>I also wish to take this opportunity to restate the commitment of the Irish Government to achieve the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for development co-operation assistance.  Irish Aid has grown signifiantly since 1992 and is now at a record level.  I am confident that this growth can continue.  Specifically, the Government is committed to increasing Ireland's Official Development Assistance by 0.05 per cent each year, so that we continue to progress towards the UN target.</P>
    <P>Irish Aid is committed to addressing basic needs, poverty reduction and capacity building and this has clear implications for food security. Our efforts are largely concentrated in the poorer rural communities of our partner countries.  Our objective is to increase the capacity of these communities to meet their own needs.  This emphasis on capacity-building will continue so that Ireland's development co-operation programme continues to serve our partner countries in the most effective way possible.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I stressed the importance of moving from words to actions.  The countries of the European Union are convinced that the Plan of Action which we have adopted provides a sound basis for moving towards our objective of the eradication of hunger and the provision of adequate food for all.  We stand <Col N="733" /> ready to play a full and active part in this process in co-operation with other members of the international community.  The task ahead is great, but the achievement of our objective would stand as one of greatest accomplishments of mankind. We must now show the courage and determination needed to reach that objective.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action.</P>
    <P>This was approved by the Committee on World Food Security at the conclusion of its 22nd Session on 31 October 1996, and pursuant to FAO Conference Resolution 2/95, is submitted to the World Food Summit for adoption.</P>
    <P>Rome Declaration on World Food Security We, the Heads of State and Government, or our representatives, gathered at the World Food Summit at the invitation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, reaffirm the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.</P>
    <P>We pledge our political will and our common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an on-going effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015.</P>
    <P>We consider it intolerable that more than 800 million people throughout the world, and particularly in developing countries, do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs. This situation is unacceptable.  Food supplies have increased substantially, but constraints on access to food and continuing inadequacy of household and national incomes to purchase food, instability of supply and demand, as well as natural and man-made disasters, prevent basic food needs from being fulfilled.  The problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and are likely to persist, and even increase dramatically in some regions, unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, given the anticipated increase in the world's population and the stress on natural resources.</P>
    <P>We reaffirm that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication. Democracy, promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, and full and equal participation of men and women are essential for achieving sustainable food security for all.</P>
    <P>Poverty is a major cause of food insecurity and sustainable progress in poverty eradication is critical to improve access to food.  Conflict, terrorism, corruption and environmental degradation also contribute significantly to food <Col N="734" /> insecurity.  Increased food production, including staple food, must be undertaken.  This should happen within the framework of sustainable management of natural resources, elimination of unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, particularly in industrialised countries, and early stabilisation of the world population.  We acknowledge the fundamental contribution to food security by women, particularly in rural areas of developing countries, and the need to ensure equality between men and women.  Revitalisation of rural areas must also be a priority to enhance social stability and help redress the excessive rate of rural-urban migration confronting many countries.</P>
    <P>We emphasise the urgency of taking action now to fulfil our responsibility to achieve food security for present and future generations. Attaining food security is a complex task for which the primary responsibility rests with individual governments.  They have to develop an enabling environment and have policies that ensure peace, as well as social, political and economic stability and equity and gender equality.  We express our deep concern over the persistence of hunger which, on such a scale, constitutes a threat both to national societies and, through a variety of ways, to the stability of the international community itself.  Within the global framework, governments should also cooperate actively with one another and with United Nations organisations, financial institutions, inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, and public and private sectors, on programmes directed toward the achievement of food security for all.</P>
    <P>Food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure.  We reaffirm the importance of international cooperation and solidarity as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures, not in accordance with the international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security.</P>
    <P>We recognise the need to adopt policies conducive to investment in human resource development, research and infrastructure for achieving food security.  We must encourage generation of employment and incomes, and promote equitable access to productive and financial resources.  We agree that trade is a key element in achieving food security.  We agree to pursue food trade and overall trade policies that will encourage our producers and consumers to utilise available resources in an economically sound and sustainable manner.  We recognise the importance for food security of sustainable agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development in low as well as high potential areas.  We acknowledge the fundamental role of farmers, fishers, foresters, indigenous people and their communities, and all other people involved in the food sector, and of their organisations, supported by effective research and extension, in attaining food security.  Our sustainable development policies will promote full <Col N="735" /> participation and empowerment of people, especially women, an equitable distribution of income, access to health care and education, and opportunities for youth.  Particular attention should be given to those who cannot produce or procure enough food for an adequate diet, including those affected by war, civil strife, natural disaster or climate related ecological changes.  We are conscious of the need for urgent action to combat pests, drought, and natural resource degradation including desertification, overfishing and erosion of biological diversity.</P>
    <P>We are determined to make efforts to mobilise, and optimise the allocation and utilisation of, technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies.</P>
    <P>Convinced that the multifaceted character of food security necessitates concerted national action, and effective international efforts to supplement and reinforce national action, we make the following commitments:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will ensure an enabling political, social, and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace, based on full and equal participation of women and men, which is most conductive to achieving sustainable food security for all;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will implement policies aimed at eradicating poverty and inequality and improving physical and economic access by all, at all times, to sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and its effective utilisation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will pursue participatory and sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas, which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household, national, regional and global levels, and combat pests, drought and desertification, considering the multifunctional character of agriculture;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will strive to ensure that food, agricultural trade and overall trade policies are conducive to fostering food security for all through a fair and market-oriented world trade system;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will endeavour to prevent and be prepared for natural disasters and man-made emergencies and to meet transitory and emergency food requirements in ways that encourage recovery, rehabilitation, development and a capacity to satisfy future needs;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to <Col N="736" /> foster human resources, sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries and forestry systems, and rural development, in high and low potential areas;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we will implement, monitor and follow-up this Plan of Action at all levels in co-operation with the international community.</P>
    <P>We pledge our actions and support to implement the World Food Summit Plan of Action.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Rome, 13 November 1996.</P>
    <P>World Food Summit</P>
    <P>Plan of Action</P>
    <P>1.  The Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action lay the foundations for diverse paths to a common objective &mdash; food security, at the individual, household, national, regional and global levels.  Food security exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.  In this regard, concerted action at all levels is required.  Each nation must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals and, at the same time, co-operate regionally and internationally in order to organise collective solutions to global issues of food security.  In a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, co-ordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.</P>
    <P>2.  Poverty eradication is essential to improve access to food.  The vast majority of those who are undernourished, either cannot produce or cannot afford to buy enough food.  They have inadequae access to means of production such as land, water, inputs, improved seeds and plants, appropriate technologies and farm credit.  In addition, wars, civil strife, natural disasters, climate related ecological changes and environmental degradation have adversely affected millions of people.  Although food assistance may be provided to ease their plight it is not a long-term solution to the underlying causes of food insecurity.  It is important to maintain an adequate capacity in the international community to provide food aid, whenever it is required, in response to emergencies.  Equitable access to stable food supplies should be ensured.</P>
    <P>3.  A peaceful and stable environment in every country is a fundamental condition for the attainment of sustainable food security. Governments are responsible for creating an enabling environment for private and group initiatives to devote their skills, efforts and resources, and in particular investment, towards the common goal of food for all.  This should be undertaken with the co-operation and participation of all members of society.  Farmers, fishers and foresters and other food producers and providers, have critical roles in achieving <Col N="737" /> food security, and their full involvement and enablement are crucial for success.</P>
    <P>4.  Poverty, hunger and malnutrition are some of the principal causes of accelerated migration from rural to urban areas in developing countries. The largest population shift of all times is now under way.  Unless these problems are addressed in an appropriate and timely fashion, the political, economic and social stability of many countries and regions may well be seriously affected, perhaps even compromising world peace.  It is necessary to target those people and areas suffering most from hunger and malnutrition and identify causes and take remedial action to improve the situation.  A more complete, user-friendly source of information at all levels would enable this.</P>
    <P>5.  Availability of enough food for all can be attained.  The 5.8 billion people in the world today have, on average, 15 per cent more food per person than the global population of 4 billion people had 20 years ago.  Yet, further large increases in world food production, through the sustainable management of natural resources, are required to feed a growing population, and achieve improved diets.  Increased production, including traditional crops and their products, inefficient combination with food imports, reserves, and international trade can strengthen food security and address regional disparties. Food aid is one of the many instruments which can help to promote food security.  Long term investment in research and in cataloguing and conserving genetic resources, particularly at the national level, is essential.  The link between sufficient food supplies and household food security must be ensured.</P>
    <P>6.  Harmful seasonal and inter-annual instability of food supplies can be reduced.  Progress should include targeting on minimizing the vulnerability to, and impact of, climate fluctuations and pests and diseases.  To effect timely transfers of supplies to deficit areas and the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, use should be made, in efficient combination, of climate early warning systems, transfer and utilization of appropriate agricultural, fishery and forestry technologies, production, and reliable trade, storage and financial mechanisms.  Natural and man-made disasters can often be anticipated or even prevented, and response must be timely and effective and assist recovery.</P>
    <P>7.  Unless national governments and the international community address the multifaceted causes underlying food insecurity, the number of hungry and malnourished people will remain very high in developing countries, particularly in Africa, south of the Sahara: and sustainable food security will not be achieved.  This situation is unacceptable.  This Plan of Action envisages an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015, and a mid-term <Col N="738" /> review to ascertain whether it is possible to achieve this target by 2010.</P>
    <P>8.  The resources required for investment will be generated mostly from domestic, private and public sources.  The international community has a key role to play in supporting the adoption of appropriate national policies and, where necessary and appropriate, in providing technical and financial assistance to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in fostering food security.</P>
    <P>9.  The multi-dimensional nature of the follow-up to the World Food Summit includes actions at the national, intergovernmental and inter-agency levels.  The international community, and the UN system, including FAO, as well as other agencies and bodies according to their mandates, have important contributions to the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.  The FAO Committee on World Food Security (CFS) will have responsibility to monitor the implementation of the Plan of Action.</P>
    <P>10.  Reaching sustainable world food security is part and parcel of achieving the social, economic, environmental and human development objectives agreed upon in recent international conferences.  The World Food Summit Plan of Action builds on consensus reached in these fora and is based on the conviction that although the world is faced with major food insecurity, solutions to these problems exist.  If all parties at local, national, regional and international levels make determined and sustained efforts, then the overall goal of food for all, at all time, will be achieved.</P>
    <P>11.  The Plan of Action of the World Food Summit is in conformity with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law and strives to consolidate the results of other UN conferences since 1990 on subjects having a bearing on food security.</P>
    <P>12.  The implementation of the recommendations contained in this Plan of Action is the sovereign right and responsibility of each State through national laws and the formulation of strategies, policies, programmes, and development priorities, in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, and the significance of and the full respect for various religious and ethical values, cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of individuals and their communities, and should contribute to the full enjoyment by all of their human rights in order to achieve the objective of food security for all.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Commitments and Actions</P>
    <P>Commitment One:</P>
    <P>We will ensure an enabling political, social, and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and <Col N="739" /> for durable peace, based on full and equal participation of women and men, which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Basis for Action</P>
    <P>13.  A growing world population and the urgency of eradicating hunger and malnutrition call for determined policies and effective actions. A peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable states to give adequate priority to food security, poverty eradication and sustainable agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development.  Promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development and the progressive realisation of the right to adequate food for all and the full and equal participation of men and women are also indispensable to our goal of achieving sustainable food security for all.</P>

    <P>(g)  Focus research efforts on the division of labour and on income access and control within the household;</P>
    <P>(h)  Gather information on women's traditional knowledge and skills in agriculture, fisheries, forestry and natural resources management.</P>
    <P>17.  Objective 1.4:</P>
    <P>To encourage national solidarity and provide equal opportunities for all, at all levels, in social, economic and political life, particularly in respect of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and persons.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Support investment in human resource development such as health, education, literacy and other skills training, which are essential to sustainable development, including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development;</P>
    <P>(b)  Enact or strengthern policies to combat discrimination against members of socially vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, and persons belonging to minorities, with particular attention to their rights to land and other property, and to their access to credit, education and training, commercial markets and food security programmes;</P>
    <P>(c)  Enact legislation and establish institutional structures that provide opportunities for youth and enhance the special contribution that women can make to ensuring family and child nutrition with due emphasis on the importance of breast-feeding for infants;</P>

    <P Just="Center">Commitment Two:</P>
    <P>We will implement policies aimed at eradicating poverty and inequality and improving physical and economic access by all, at all times, to sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and its effective utilisation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Basis for Action</P>
    <P>18.  Assured access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is essential for individual welfare and for national, social and economic development, in <Col N="742" /> accordance with the World Declaration on Nutrition (International Conference on Nutrition (ICN), Rome 1992.  Every country in the world has vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals, households and groups who cannot meet their own needs.  Seventy percent of all poor are women, which should be taken into consideration when preparing poverty eradication action.  Even where and when overall food supplies are adequate, poverty impedes access by all to the quantity and variety of foods needed to meet the population's needs.  Rapid population growth and rural poverty have resulted in excessive migration to urban areas with serious negative social, economic, environmental and nutritional impact. Unless extraordinary efforts are undertaken, an unacceptably large portion of the world's population, particularly in developing countries, could still be chronically undernourished by the year 2010 with additional suffering due to acute periodic shortages of food.  Contributing to malnutrition is inadequate food utilisation which, in this context, is the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients in food by the human body and requires adequate diet, water sanitation, health services, and health education.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Objectives and Actions</P>
    <P>19.  Objective 2.1:</P>
    <P>To pursue poverty eradication, among both urban and rural poor, and sustainable food security for all as a policy priority and to promote, through sound national policies, secure and gainful employment and equitable and equal access to productive resources such as land, water and credit, so as to maximise the incomes of the poor.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnerships with all actors of civil society, as appropriate, will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Review and adopt policies to pursue the eradiation of hunger and attain sustainable food security at the household and national levels as a top policy priority, and make every effort to eliminate obstacles such as unemployment and lack of access to factors of production that adversely affect the attainment of food security, and implement the relevant commitments they entered into at the World Summit for Social Development, Copenhagen 1995;</P>
    <P>(b)  Develop human skills and capacities through basic education and pre-and-on-the-job training;</P>
    <P>(c)  Adopt policies that create conditions which encourage stable employment, especially in rural areas, including off-farm jobs, so as to provide sufficient earnings to facilitate the purchase of basic necessities, as well as encourage labour intensive technologies where appropriate;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> (d)  Pursue sound economic, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and land reform policies that will permit farmers, fishers, foresters and other food producers, particularly women, to earn a fair return from their labour, capital and management, and encourage conservation and sustainable management of natural resources including in marginal areas;</P>
    <P>(e)  Improve equal access, by men and women, to land and other natural and productive resources, in particular, where necessary, through the effective implementation of land reform and the promotion of efficient utilisation of natural land agricultural resources and resettlement on new lands, where feasible;</P>
    <P>(f)  Promote access, by farmers and farming communities, to genetic resources for food and agriculture.</P>
    <P>20.  Objective 2.2:</P>
    <P>To enable food insecure households, families and individuals to meet their food and nutritional requirements and to seek to assist those who are unable to to so.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, as appropriate; will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Develop and periodically update, where necessary, a national food insecurity and vulnerability information and mapping system, indicating areas and populations, including at local level, affected by or at-risk of hunger and malnutrition, and elements contributing to food insecurity, making maximum use of existing data and other information systems in order to avoid duplication of efforts;</P>
    <P>(b)  Implement, where appropriate, cost-effective public works programmes for the unemployed and under-employed in regions of food insecurity;</P>
    <P>(c)  Develop within available resources well targeted social welfare and nutrition safety nets to meet the needs of the food insecure, particularly needy people, children, and the infirm.</P>
    <P>21.  Objective 2.3:</P>
    <P>To ensure that food supplies are safe, physically and economically accessible, appropriate and adequate to meet the energy and nutrient needs of the population.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, as appropriate will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Monitor the availability and nutritional adequacy of food supplies and reserve stocks, giving particular attention to areas at high risk of food insecurity, to nutritionally vulnerable groups, and to areas where seasonal variations have important nutritional implications;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> (b)  Apply measures, in conformity with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary Measures and other relevant international agreements, that ensure the quality and safety of food supply, particularly by strengthening normative and control activities in the areas of human, animal and plant health and safety;</P>
    <P>(c)  Encourage, where appropriate, the production and use of culturally appropriate, traditional and under-utilised food crops, including grains, oilseeds, pulses, root crops, fruits and vegetables, promoting home and, where appropriate, school gardens and urban agriculture, using sustainable technologies, and encourage the sustainable utilization of unused or under-utilised fish resources;</P>
    <P>(d)  Develop and promote improved food processing, preservation and storage technologies to reduce post-harvest food losses, especially at the local level;</P>
    <P>(e)  Encourage rural households and communities to adopt low-cost technologies and innovative practices;</P>
    <P>(f)  Promote and support community-based food security and nutrition programmes that encourage self-reliance, utilising participatory planning and implementation process;</P>
    <P>(g)  Implement the goals of preventing and controlling specific micro-nutrient deficiencies as agreed at the ICN.</P>
    <P>22.  Objective 2.4:</P>
    <P>To promote access for all, especially the poor and members of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, to basic education and primary health care provision in order to strengthen their capacity for self-reliance.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Promote access for all people, especially the poor and members of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to primary healthcare, including reproductive health services consistent with the Report and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, Cario 1994;</P>
    <P>(b)  Promote access to clean water and sanitation for all people, especially in poor communities and rural areas;</P>
    <P>(c)  Promote access to, and support for, complete primary education, including where appropriate, school feeding programmes, with particular attention to children in rural areas and to girls;</P>
    <P>(d)  Provide nutrition, sanitation, and health education for the public and promote technologies and training programmes on nutrition, home economics, environmental protection, food supply and health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> Commitment Three:</P>
    <P>We will pursue participatory and sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas, which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household, national, regional and global levels, and combat pests, drought and desertification, considering the multifunctional character of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Basis for Action</P>
    <P>23.  It is imperative that food production be increased, particularly in low-income, food deficit countries, to meet the needs of the undernourished and food insecure, the additional food requirements resulting from population growth, demand for new food products due to rising standards of living and changes in consumption patterns.  Production increases need to be achieved without further overburdening women farmers, while ensuring both productive capacity, sustainable management of natural resources and protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>24.  In many parts of the world, unsustainable and otherwise inadequate policies and programmes, inappropriate technologies, insufficient rural infrastructures and institutions, as well as pests and diseases, lead to inefficiency and wastage of natural and human resources, inputs and products.  The resource base for food, agriculture, fisheries and forestry, is under stress and is threatened by problems such as desertification, deforestation, over-fishing, overcapacity and discards in fisheries, losses of biodiversity, as well as inefficient use of water, climate change and depletion of the ozone layer. This has a negative impact on both food security and the environment.  The framework for sustainable agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development in relation to food security was elaborated in the Programme of Action for Sustainable Development (Agenda 21) of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), Rio de Janeiro 1992, and recently expanded in both the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action on the Sustainable Contribution of Fisheries to Food Security (Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action), 1995, and the Leipzig Declaration on and the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Leipzig Declaration and Global Plan of Action), 1996.</P>
    <P>25.  Expanding production in low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs) is frequently one of the primary means to increase the availability of food and income for those living in poverty.  Most of the increases in food output of these countries, and of more developed regions, are expected to come from areas which have the agro-climatic potential to generate sufficient surpluses in economically and environmentally sound conditions, in particular to feed growing numbers <Col N="746" /> of urban consumers.  The generation of employment and income will raise effective demand in these areas, thereby stimulating production, economic diversification and rural development.  In marginal areas and coastal communities with lower potential and fragile environments, there is also a need to increase food production through the provision of inputs and appropriate technology to reduce rural migration, but this should be based on sustainable management of resources and environment. Efficient land use for sustainable agricultural activity in many areas will also contribute significantly towards reducing the pressure to convert forests to agricultural land.</P>
    <P>26.  Food security depends, inter alia, on sustainable management of fish, forests, and wildlife.  In many indigenous communities, these resources are the principal sources of protein in the diet.  The traditional knowledge within indigenous communities also plays an important role in the achievement of food security for these communities and others.</P>
    <P>27.  Establishing sustainable and diverse patterns of production should take into account the present and future needs of the people as well as the natural resources potential and limitations. Policies that provide an effective incentive structure for sustainable management of natural resources will help ensure that national agriculture, fisheries, forestry and natural resource plans and practices are developed and implemented in a holistic approach.</P>
    <P>28.  Small island developing states face the threat of land loss and erosion due to climate changes and sea level rises and have particular needs for their overall sustainable development. Improvements in trade, transportation, communication, human resources, stabilisation of income and higher export earnings will increase food security in these countries.</P>
    <P>29.  Food production and rural development, particularly in those countries with significant food security inadequacies, require appropriate and up-to-date technologies which, according to sustainable development criteria and local food traditions, promote modernisation of local production methods and facilitate transfer of technology.  Full benefit from these technologies will require training, education and skill development programmes for local human resources.  National efforts to increase local capacity, coupled with consolidated international co-operation, facilitate application of know-how and technology in areas with similar conditions and new techniques.  This may be promoted by active international co-operation, particularly towards developing countries, both at the North-South and South-South levels.</P>
    <P>30.  Research in agriculture, fisheries and forestry will be essential to achieving the sustainable food productivity increases upon which the short and long-term food security of a <Col N="747" /> growing world population will depend.  The combination of such research, and an enabling environment, can improve food security both at national and household levels.  Equity issues and equality between women and men should be given appropriate consideration when setting research agendas for the future.  Research efforts should clearly focus on poverty eradication and on the creation of more environmentally sustainable agricultural, fisheries, forestry and food production systems.  This research should be directed to low, as well as high, potential areas according to their specific research needs. Renewed efforts should be made to involve farmers, fishers, foresters and their organisations in setting research priorities and directions, and to make experimental findings accessible to them.</P>
    <P>31.  The economic and social development of the rural sector is a key requisite for the achievement of food security for all.  Rural poverty is a complex phenomenon that varies considerably between and within countries.  The rural areas in developing countries are generally poorly equipped in terms of technical and financial resources and educational infrastructure.  In these areas, lack of income opportunities, failure to crop and to maintain production systems, inadequate commodity and input and consumer goods distribution networks, limited access to public services and the poor quality of these services are all fundamental aspects that need to be considered with regard to rural food security.  The main consequences of this are reflected in high population growth and out-migration, both internally and to other countries.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Objectives and Actions</P>
    <P>32.  Objective 3.1:</P>
    <P>To pursue, through participatory means, sustainable, intensified and diversified food production, increasing productivity, efficiency, safety gains, pest control and reduced wastes and losses, taking fully into account the need to sustain natural resources.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, and with the support of international institutions, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Establish policies and implement programmes to optimise, in an economically, socially and environmentally sound manner, sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry production, particularly of the main staple foods, aimed at achieving food security;</P>

    <P>(i)  Seek to ensure effective prevention and progressive control of plant and animal pests and diseases, including especially those which are of transboundary nature, such as rinderpest, cattle rick, foot and mouth disease and desert locust, where outbreaks can cause major food shortages, destabilise markets and trigger trade measures; and promote concurrently, regional collaboration in plant pests and animal disease control and the widespread development and use of integrated pest management practices.</P>
    <P>33.  Objective 3.2:</P>
    <P>To combat environmental threats to food security, in particular, drought and desertification, pests, erosion of biological diversity, and degradation of land and aquatic-based natural resources, restore and rehabilitate the natural resource base, including water and watersheds, in depleted and over-exploited areas to achieve greater production.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, and with the support of international institutions, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> (a)  Monitor and promote rehabilitation and conservation of natural resources in food producing areas as well as in adjacent forest lands, non-arable lands, and watersheds, and where necessary upgrade sustainably the productive capacity of these resources; and establish policies that create economic and social incentives to reduce degradation;</P>
    <P>(b)  Identify the potential and improve the productive use of national land and water resources for sustainable increases in food production, taking into account the anticipated impacts of natural climate variability and climatic change on rainfall and temperature patterns;</P>
    <P>(c)  Develop appropriate national and regional policies and plans for water and watersheds, and water management techniques; promote economnically, socially and environmentally sound irrigation improvement, in particular small-scale irrigation, and sustainable intensification of rainfed agriculture, with a view to increasing cropping intensities and reducing the impact of droughts and floods on food output and restoring natural resources, while at the same time preserving the quality and availability of water for other purposes, especially human consumption;</P>
    <P>(d)  Promote early ratification and implementation of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Instruments of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks) and of the FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas. Implement sustainable fisheries management and practices, in particular the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, to address a responsible and sustainable utilization and conservation of fisheries resources in order to optimize the long-term sustainable contribution of fisheries resources to food security &mdash; and fully recognising Agenda 21, and the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action within the context of the relevant rules of International Law as reflected in the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)³ &mdash; by, <i>inter alia,</i> strengthening and establishing, as needed, appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, minimizing wastes in fisheries, reducing excess fishing capacity and applying the precautionary approach in accordance with the UN Agreements on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries; by establishing and strengthening integrated <Col N="750" /> marine and coastal area management; by conserving and sustainably utilizing marine and freshwater biodiversity; and by studying the effectiveness of multi-species management in the context of relevant provisions of UNCLOS and Agenda 21.  In working to achieve the above, full recognition should be given to the special circumstances and requirements of developing countries, particularly the last developed among them and the Small Island Developing States:</P>
    <P>(e)  Promote an integrated approach to conservation and sustainable utilisation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, through <i>inter alia</i> appropriate in situ and ex situ approaches, systematic surveying and inventorying, approaches to plant breeding which broaden the genetic base of drops, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of such resources;</P>
    <P>(f)  Promote the conservation and sustainable utilisation of animal genetic resources;</P>
    <P>(g)  Reduce the deforestation rate and increase forest coverage, maintain and develop the multiple contributions of forests, trees and forestry to food security for the conservation and sustainable use of land and water resources, including the protection of watersheds, and as reservoirs of biological diversity; to this end, implement the UNCED outcomes related to forests;</P>
    <P>(h)  Seek to understand better the impacts of global environmental threats, in particular climate change and variability, the depletion of the ozone layer, loss of biodiversity and various forms of environmental pollution, on food security;</P>
    <P>(i)  Implement the Leipzig Global Plan of Action;</P>
    <P>(j)  Promote early ratification and implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, 1994, and implement the Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992, the Montreal Protocol on substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 1992;</P>
    <P>(k)  Seek to prevent and control degradation and over-exploitation of natural resources in poorly endowed, ecologically stressed areas.

    <P>To promote sound policies and programmes on transfer and use of technologies, skills development and training appropriate to the food <Col N="751" /> security needs of developing countries and compatible with sustainable development, particularly in rural and disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, and with the support of international institutions, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Strengthen agricultural, fisheries and forestry education, training, skills development and extension systems, ensuring equal gender opportunities and close inter-action with research systems and farmers, fishers and foresters, in particular small-scale farmers, fishers and foresters, and other food producers, and their representative organizations in food production technology and transfer, and initiate programmes to increase the proportion of women in these systems.  National capacity-building efforts, principally in LIFDCs should be supported with North-South and South-South cooperation among education and extension and research institutions;</P>
    <P>(b)  Promote viable technology transfer and extension services that meet real local needs; stimulate programmes that will help identify possibilities of bilateral and regional cooperation so that experience and technology information can be exchanged on a South-South and North-South level;</P>

    <P>To this end, governments in collaboration with the international and scientific communities, in both the public and the private sectors, as appropriate, will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Strengthen national research systems in order to develop coordinated programmes in support of research to promote food security. Such programmes should focus on interdisciplinary research to provide a scientific basis for policies and action to maintain the natural resource base while increasing the productivity potential of agriculture, fisheries, including aquaculture, and forestry. Appropriate attention will be given to areas <Col N="752" /> that are less endowed with natural resources. Increased cooperation with the private sector will be promoted;</P>
    <P>(b)  Strengthen international research systems, in particular the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), and promote coordination and collaboration among international, developed country, and developing country institutions;</P>
    <P>(c)  Participate actively in and support international cooperation in research to promote food security, in particular in developing countries, with special emphasis on under-utilised food crops in these countries;</P>

    <P Just="Center">Commitment Four:</P>
    <P>We will strive to ensure that food, agricultural trade and overall trade policies are conducive to fostering food security for all through a fair and market-oriented world trade system.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Basis for Action</P>
    <P>37.  Trade is a key element in achieving world food security.  Trade generates effective utilization of resources and stimulates economic growth which is critical to improving food security.  Trade allows food consumption to exceed food production, helps to reduce production and consumption fluctuations and relieves part of the burden of stock holding.  It has a major bearing on access to food through its positive effect on economic growth, income and employment.  Appropriate domestic economic and social policies will better ensure that all, including the poor, will benefit from economic growth.  Appropriate trade policies promote the objectives of sustainable growth and food security.  It is essential that all members of the WTO respect and fulfil the totality of the undertakings of the Uruguay Round.  For this purpose it will be necessary to refrain from unilateral measures not in accordance with WTO obligations.</P>
    <P>38.  The Uruguay Round Agreement established a new international trade framework that offers opportunity to developed countries to <Col N="755" /> benefit from appropriate trade policies and self-reliance strategies.  The progressive implementation of the Uruguay Round as a whole will generate increasing opportunities for trade expansion and economic growth to the benefits of all participants.  Therefore, adaptation to the provisions of the various agreements during the implementation period must be ensured.  Some least-developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience short-term negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions, including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs.  The Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries, Marrakesh 1994, shall be fully implemented.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Objectives and Actions</P>
    <P>39.  Objective 4.1:</P>
    <P>To meet the challenges of and utilize the opportunities arising from the international trade framework established in recent global and regional trade negotiations.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, will, as appropriate:</P>

    <P>(h)  Conduct international trade in fish and fishery products in a sustainable manner in accordance, as appropriate, with the principles, rights and obligations established in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement, the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and other relevant international agreements.</P>
    <P>40.  Objective 4.2:</P>
    <P>To meet essential food import needs in all countries, considering world price and supply fluctuations and taking especially into account food consumption levels of vulnerable groups in developing countries.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments and the international community will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Recognizing the effects of world price fluctuations, examine WTO-compatible options and take any appropriate steps to safeguard the ability of importing developing countries, especially LIFDCs, to purchase adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions.</P>

    <P>International organisations, including FAO, will, according to their respective mandates;</P>
    <P>(c)  Continue to assist developing countries in preparing for multilateral trade negotiations including in agriculture, fisheries and forestry <i>inter alia</i> through studies, analysis and training.</P>
    <P>Commitment Five:</P>
    <P>We will endevour to prevent and be prepared for natural disasters and man-made emergencies and to meet transitory and emergency food requirements in ways that encourage recovery, rehabilitation, development and a capacity to satisfy future needs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="758" /> The Basis for Action</P>
    <P>42.  While the number of people affected by natural disasters fluctuates annually, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of victims of civil conflicts.  These situations require emergency assistance and they point to the importance of early action to defuse tensions and of preparedness in minimising the risk of future crises and in preventing food emergencies.</P>
    <P>43.  National and international relief operations are often the only solution for hungry people facing immediate starvation, and should continue to be a priority and be provided in an impartial and a political manner, with due respect to national sovereignty and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the guiding principles of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 46-182.  However, emergency food assistance cannot be a basis for sustainable food security.  Conflict prevention and resolution, and stepped up rehabilitation and development promotion activities, which prevent recurrence of and reduce vulnerability to food emergencies, are essential elements of food security.  Emergency preparedness is a central element for minimizing the negative effects of food emergencies and famines.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Objectives and Actions</P>
    <P>44.  Objective 5.1:</P>
    <P>To reduce demand for emergency food assistance through enhancing efforts to prevent and resolve man-made emergencies, particularly international, national and local conflicts.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, individually and collectively, and in partnership with all actors of civil society, will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Use appropriate international, regional and national mechanisms to prevent or reduce those situations, in particular war and civil conflict, which give rise to man-made emergencies and increase demands for emergency assistance, including food aid;</P>
    <P>(b)  Co-ordinate policies, actions and legal instruments and/or measures to combat terrorism and other activities contrary to human rights and human dignity;</P>
    <P>(c)  Promote the continuation of international discussions and co-operation on all aspects of anti-personnel land mines.</P>
    <P>45.  Objective 5.2:</P>
    <P>To establish as quickly as possible prevention and preparedness strategies for LIFDCs and other countries and regions vulnerable to emergencies.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society and with international organisations where necessary, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> (a)  Prepare and/or maintain for each LIFDC, and other countries and regions vulnerable to emergencies, vulnerability information and mapping, drawing or, amongst others, a food insecurity and vulnerability information and mapping system, once established, with an analysis of the major causes of vulnerability and their consequences, making maximum use of existing data and information systems to avoid duplication of effort;</P>
    <P>(b)  Maintain, promote and establish, as quickly as possible, in collaboration with non governmental organisations and other organizations, as appropriate, the preparedness strategies and mechanisms agreed upon at the ICN, including development and application of climate forecast information for surveillance and early-warning, drought, flood, other natural disasters, pest and disease alertness;</P>
    <P>(c)  Support international efforts to develop and apply climate forecast information to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of emergency preparedness and response activities, with special efforts to create synergy and avoid duplication;</P>
    <P>(d)  Promote the development of appropriate community-based and regional surveillance systems to gather and assess information and to implement prevention and preparedness programmes.</P>
    <P>46.  Objective 5.3:</P>
    <P>To improve and, if necessary, develop efficient and effective emergency response mechanisms at international, regional, national and local levels.</P>
    <P>To this end, international organisations, in close co-operation with governments and civil society, as appropriate will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Strengthen the co-ordination and efficiency of international emergency assistance to ensure rapid, co-ordinated and appropriate response, particularly by improving communications amongst the international community,</P>
    <P>Governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(b)  Seek to ensure adequate supervision of emergency operations and involve communities, local authorities and institutions and grass-roots relief initiatives and structures in implementing emergency operations to better identify and reach populations and areas at greatest risk.  Women should be fully involved in the assessment of needs and in the management and evaluation of relief operations;</P>
    <P>(c)  Pursue at local and national levels as appropriate adequate and cost effective <Col N="760" /> strategic emergency food security reserve policies and programmes;</P>
    <P>(d)  Promote triangular food aid operations;</P>
    <P>(e)  Protect the lives of civil populations, including humanitarian aid workers, in times of conflict;</P>
    <P>(f)  Seek to ensure that access to food, with particular attention to women-headed households, is protected during emergency situations;</P>
    <P>(g)  Consider the creation of national volunteers corps, building upon &ldquo;White Helmets&rdquo;, as defined by UNGA Resolutions 49/1398 and 50/19, and already launched by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV), in order to support emergency relief and rehabilitation operations, when deemed pertinent and in accordance with the guiding principles on humanitarian assistance embodied in UNGA Resolution 46/182.</P>
    <P>47.  Objective 5.4:</P>
    <P>To strengthen linkages between relief operations and development programmes, along with demining activities where necessary, so that they are mutually supportive and facilitate the transition from relief to development.</P>
    <P>To this end, international orgnisations, governments and civil society will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Keep under review the standards for the nutritional adequacy of food assistance to disaster-affected populations;</P>
    <P>(b)  Ensure that emergency operations will foster the transition from relief, through recovery, to development;</P>
    <P>(c)  Prepare and pursue well-planned post-emergency rehabilitation and development programmes to re-establish the capacity of households, including those headed by women, to meet their basic needs in the long-term as well as to rebuild national production capacity and return to sustainable economic development and social progress as soon as possible.  Where necessary, these should include operations to remove land mines.</P>
    <P>Commitment Six:</P>
    <P>We will promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources, sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries and forestry systems, and rural development, in high and low potential areas.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Basis for Action</P>
    <P>48.  Many developing countries need to reverse the recent neglect of investment in agriculture and rural development and mobilise sufficient investment resources to support sustainable food security and diversified rural development.  A sound policy environment, in which such food-related investment can fulfil its potential, is <Col N="761" /> essential.  Most of the resources required for investment will be generated from domestic private and public sources.  Governments should provide an economic and legal framework which promotes efficient markets that encourage private sector mobilisation of savings, investment and capital formation.  They should also devote an appropriate proportion of their expenditure to investments which enhance sustainable food security.</P>
    <P>49.  The international community has a key role to play in supporting the adoption of appropriate national policies and, where necessary and appropriate, in providing technical and financial assistance to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in fostering food security.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and other private financial flows have increased considerably recently and provide an important source of external resources.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) has exhibited a decline in recent years.  In the context of food security, ODA is of critical importance, particularly for countries and sectors left aside by other external sources of finance.</P>
    <P>50.  All partners in development, including investors and donors, should place priority on sectors of developing countries' economies relating to food security.  To this end, governments should adopt policies that promote foreign and domestic direct investment and effective use of development assistance.</P>
    <P>51.  In view of their special situation, Small Island Developing States have identified key sectors of priority which require investment so as to achieve their sustainable development.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Objectives and Actions</P>
    <P>52.  Objective 6.1:</P>
    <P>To create the policy framework and conditions so that optimal public and private investments are encouraged in equitable and sustainable development of the food systems, rural development and human resources on the scale needed to contribute to food security.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in co-operation with all actors of civil society, international and private financing institutions, and technical assistance agencies will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Promote policies and measures to enhance the flow and effectiveness of investments for food security;</P>
    <P>(b)  Give priority to human resource development and strengthen public institutions, especially in LIFDCs, including through equipping and staff training, to enhance their supportive and facilitating role in promoting increased investment in food security;</P>
    <P>(c)  Encourage the development of public-private partnerships and other institutions in promoting socially and environmentally responsible investment and re-investment from <Col N="762" /> domestic and foreign resources, and increase the participation of local communities in investment;</P>
    <P>(d)  Strengthen co-operation, at the regional and international level, to share the costs of investments in areas of common interest, such as appropriate technology generation through collaborative research and transfer, as well as to share investment experience and best practices.</P>
    <P>53.  Objective 6.2:</P>
    <P>To endeavour to mobilise, and optimise the use of, technical and financial resources from all sources, including debt relief, in order to raise investment in activities related to sustainable agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food production in developing countries to the levels needed to contribute to food security.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in co-operation with the international community, and all actors of civil society, as well as international and private financing institutions will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Undertake to raise sufficient and stable funding from private and public, domestic and foreign sources to achieve and sustain food security;</P>
    <P>(b)  Encourage investment to create infrastructure and management systems that facilitate sustainable utilization and management of water resources;</P>
    <P>(c)  Support investments that contribute to sustainable food security and further conservation and sustainable utilization and management of natural resources, including land, water, watersheds, fisheries and forests;</P>
    <P>(d)  Strive to secure appropriate international financial assistance for sectors related to food security, where it is needed;</P>
    <P>(e)  Strengthen efforts towards the fulfilment of the agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  In striving to promote sustainable food security, development partners should endeavour to mobilise, and optimise the use of technical and financial resources at the levels needed to contribute to this goal and should ensure that this flow of concessional funding is directed to economically and environmentally sustainable activities;</P>
    <P>(f)  Focus ODA towards countries that have a real need for it, especially low-income counties, and enhance their capacity to utilise it effectively;</P>
    <P>(g)  Explore new ways of mobilising public and private financial resources for food security, <i>inter alia</i>, through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures, including global military expenditures and the trade, and investment for arms production and acquisition, taking into consideration national security requirements;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> (h)  Promote mechanisms to mobilize domestic savings, including rural savings;</P>
    <P>(i)  Promote mechanisms to provide access to adequate credit, including micro-credit, for men and women equally, for activities in the food sector;</P>
    <P>(j)  Promote investment in small-scale food products, especially women, and their organisations, in food security programmes; strengthen their capacity to design and implement these programmes;</P>
    <P>(k)  Give priority to people-centred investments in education, health and nutrition in order to promote broad-based economic growth and sustainable food security;</P>
    <P>(l)  Identify financial, physical and technical resources available internationally and encourage the enhancement of their transfer, where appropriate, into developing countries and countries with economies in transition while also developing and enabling environment, notably through strengthening national capacities, including human resouces;</P>
    <P>(m)  Intensify the search for practical and effective solutions to debt problems of developing countries and support the recent initiatives of international financial institutions (International Monetary Fund and World Bank), to reduce the total external debt burden of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries;</P>
    <P>(n)  Explore the possibilities for countries to direct the funds released by debt swaps towards the achievement of food security.</P>
    <P>Commitment Seven:</P>
    <P>We will implement, monitor, and follow-up the Plan of Action at all levels in cooperation with the international community.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Basis for Action.</P>
    <P>54.  World food security is of concern to all members of the international community because of its increasing interdependance with respect to issues such as political stability and peace, poverty eradication, prevention of and reaction to crises and diasters, environmental degradation, trade, global threats to the sustainability of food security, growing world population, trans-border population movements, and technology, research, investment, and financial cooperation.</P>
    <P>55.  National, regional and international mechanisms for political, financial and technical cooperation should be focused on the earliest possible achievement of sustainable world food security.</P>
    <P>56.  Governments have the primary responsibility for creating an economic and political environment that assures the food security of their citizens, involving for this purpose all elements of civil society.  The international community, and the UN system, including FAO, <Col N="764" /> as well as other agencies and bodies according to their mandates, have important contributions to offer to the goal of food security for all.</P>
    <P>57.  The multi-dimentional nature of the follow-up to the World Food Summit includes actions at the national, intergovernmental and inter-agency levels.  In addition to the indispensable mobilisation of national efforts, the effective implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action requires strong international cooperation and a monitoring process at the national, regional and global levels, using existing mechanisms and fora for its operation.  To allow for better cooperation, the information regarding the different actors in the field of food security and agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development and their activities and resources needs to be improved, where appropriate.  Setting realistic targets and monitoring progress towards them call for reliable and relevant information and analysis which are still often unavailable at the national and international levels.  For the follow-up to the World Food Summit, coordination and co-operation within the UN system, including the Bratton Woods institutions, is vital and should take into account the mandate of FAO and other relevant organisations.  Bearing in mind UNGA Resolution 50/109, the outcome of the World Food Summit should be included in the follow-up to major international UN conferences and summits, including the implementation of their respective programmes of action in conformity with UNGA Resolution 50/227 and ECOSOC Resolution 1996/36, in order to promote sustainable food security for all as a fundamental element of the UN system's effort to eradicate poverty.  In this context, the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action requires actions at the intergovernmental level, in particular through the CFS and at the inter-agency level through the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC).  In the field, the representatives of all UN agencies should work within the UN resident coordinators' system to support country-level implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Objectives and Actions</P>
    <P>58.  Objective 7.1:</P>
    <P>To adopt actions within each country's national framework to enhance food security and enable the implementation of the commitments of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments will, where appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Review and revise, as appropriate, their national plans, programmes and strategies with a view to achieving food security consistent with the World Food Summit commitments;</P>
    <P>(b)  Establish or improve national mechanisms to set priorities, develop, implement and monitor the components of action for food <Col N="765" /> security within designated timeframes, based both on national and local needs, and provide the necessary resources for their functioning;</P>
    <P>(c)  In collaboration with civil society, formulate and launch national Food for All Campaigns to mobilise all stake-holders at all levels of society and their resources in each country, in support of the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action;</P>
    <P>(d)  Actively encourage a greater role for, and alliances with, civil society organisations in addressing food security;</P>
    <P>(e)  Strive to mobilize public and private resources to support community food security initiatives;</P>
    <P>(f)  Establish mechanisms to collect information on the nutritional status of all members of communities, especially the poor, women, children and members of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, to monitor and improve their household food security;</P>
    <P>(g)  Complement existing national plans of action on nutrition, developed as a follow-up to the ICN, with action on relevant aspects of food security or, where necessary, develop such plans in accordance with the recommendations of this Summit and the ICN, in partnership with all actors of civil society;</P>
    <P>(h)  Plan and monitor in a coordinated manner the implementation of relevant recommendations of all UN conferences aimed at eradicating poverty and improving food security and nutrition.</P>
    <P>59.  Objective 7.2:</P>
    <P>To improve sub-regional, regional, and international cooperation and to mobilize, and optimise the use of, available resources to support national efforts for the earliest possible achievements of sustainable world food security.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in cooperation among themselves and with international institutions, using information on food security and vulnerability, including mapping, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Reinforce poverty eradication strategies and orient the development assistance policies of the international agencies of the UN system, with broad particiption of the developing countries, so that resources are directed towards sustainable development, including agriculture for food security, and effectively contribute to the improved situation of food insecure households;</P>
    <P>(b)  Encourage relevant agencies within the UN system to initiate, <i>inter-alia</i> within the framework of the ACC, consultations on the further elaboration and definition of a food insecurity and vulnerability information and mapping system to be developed in a coordinated manner; member countries and <Col N="766" /> their institutions and other organizations, as appropriate, should be included in the development, operation and use of the system; FAO should play a catalytic role in this effort, within the framework of the ad hoc inter-agency task forces on the follow-up of the UN conferences.  The results of that work should be reported to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) through the ACC;</P>
    <P>(c)  Improve the collection, through definition of common standards, and the analysis, dissemination and utilisation of information and data, disaggregated <i>inter alia</i> by gender, needed to guide and monitor progress towards the achievement of food security; in this context, the contribution of NCOs is recognized;</P>
    <P>(d)  Continue, within the framework of UNGA resolutions 50/120, 50/227 and the coordinated follow-up by the UN system to the major UN conferences and summits since 1990, the review of functions and capacities of the UN system, including the specialized agencies, programmes and funds, in their relation to food security; this review should aim at reducing duplications and filling gaps in coverage, defining the tasks of each organization within its mandate, making concrete proposals for their strengthening and for improving coordination with governments, and for avoiding duplication of work between relevant organizations, and implement these proposals as a matter of urgency;</P>
    <P>(e)  Starting in 1997, review the adequacy and effectiveness of the allocation and use of financial and human resources for action required to ensure food for all as a follow-up to the World Food Summit, and reallocate available resources accordingly, with special references to the needs of countries facing deteriorating food security, nutrition, health and resource degradation;</P>
    <P>(f)  review and streamline existing mechanisms, increase cooperation and the sharing of knowledge and experience among developing countries and with developed countries, and improve coordination amongst and between all partners involved in order to maximise synergy for the attainment of food security;</P>
    <P>(g)  Focus technical assistance more effectively on building-up and mobilizing national capacity, expertise and local institutions;</P>
    <P>(h)  Invite the ACC through its chairman, the Secretary General of the UN, to ensure appropriate inter-agency coordination in accordance with UNGA Resolution 50/227 and, when considering the Chair of any ACC mechanisms for inter-agency follow-up to the World Food Summit, to recognise, in the spirit of ECOSOC Resolution 1996/36, the major role of FAO in the field of food security, within its mandate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> With clear tasks given to each within its mandate and under system-wide coordination within the framework of the coordinated follow-up to UN conferences, in accordance with UNGA Resolution 50/120, FAO and the other relevant organizations of the UN system, as well as the international finance and trade institutions and other international and regional technical assistance organizations, are invited to:</P>
    <P>(i)  On request, assist countries in reviewing and formulating national plans of action including targets, goals and timetables for achieving food security;</P>
    <P>(j)  Facilitate a coherent and coordinated UN system follow-up to the World Food Summit at the field level, through the resident coordinators, in full consultation with governments, and in coordination with international financial institutions;</P>
    <P>(k)  Provide technical assistance to member countries to facilitate implementation of food security programmes in order to meet targets established by governments;</P>
    <P>(l)  Assist in arranging partnerships for economic and technical cooperation among counties on food security;</P>
    <P>(m)  Raise the global profile of food security issues through UN system-wide advocacy and sustain the World Food Summit commitments to world food security;</P>
    <P>In cooperation among themselves, governments and international financial institutions will:</P>
    <P>(n)  Make every effort to ensure that goals and programmes aimed at food security and poverty eradication are safeguarded in difficult times of economic transition, budget austerity and structural adjustment;</P>
    <P>(o)  Encourage the multilateral development banks to enhance their support of developing country efforts to increase food security, especially in Africa.</P>
    <P>60.  Objective 7.3:</P>
    <P>To monitor actively the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, in coordination with relevant international institutions and, in conformity with ECOSOC Resolution 1996/36 on the follow-up to the major international UN conferences and summits as appropriate, will:</P>
    <P>(a)  Establish through the CFS a timetable, procedures and standardized reporting formats, which do not duplicate similar reports to the UN, FAO and other agencies, on the national, sub-regional and regional implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action;</P>
    <P>(b)  Set out in the CFS a process for developing targets and verifiable indicators of <Col N="768" /> national and global food security where they do not exist;</P>
    <P>(c)  Report to the CFS on national, sub-regional and regional implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action, drawing on a food insecurity and vulnerability information and mapping system, once established, as an analytical aid;</P>
    <P>(d)  Invite the Secretary-General of the UN to request the ACC to report to ECOSOC in accordance with established procedures progress on the follow-up by UN agencies to the World Food Summit;</P>
    <P>(e)  Monitor through the CFS the national, sub-regional, regional and international implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action, using reports from national governments, reports on UN agency follow-up and inter-agency coodination, and information from other relevant international institutions;</P>
    <P>(f)  Provide regular reports on implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action through the CFS via the FAO Council to ECOSOC;</P>
    <P>(g)  Encourage the effective participation of relevant actors of civil society in the CFS monitoring process, recognizing their critical role in enhancing food security;</P>
    <P>(h)  By 2006, undertake, in the CFS and within available resources, a major broad-based progress assessment of the implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action and a mid-term review of achieving the target of reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015.  This progress assessment and review should be in the context of a special forum of a regular session of the CFS and involve active participation from governments, relevant international organizations and actors of civil society.</P>
    <P>61.  Objective 7.4</P>
    <P>To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, as stated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments, and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realisation of this right as a means of achieving food security for all.</P>
    <P>To this end, governments, in partnership with all actors of civil society, will, as appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  Make every effort to implement the provisions of Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the Covenant) and relevant provisions of other international and regional instruments;</P>
    <P>(b)  Urge States that are not yet Parties to the Covenant to adhere to the Covenant at the earliest possible time;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> (c)  Invite the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to give particular attention to this Plan of Action in the framework of its activities and to continue to monitor the implementation of the specific measures provided for in Article 11 of the Covenant;</P>
    <P>(d)  Invite relevant treaty bodies and appropriate specialised agencies of the UN to consider how they might contribute, within the framework of the coodinated follow-up by the UN system to the major international UN conferences and summits, including the World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna 1993, within the scope of their mandates, to the further implementation of this right;</P>
    <P>(e)  Invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in consultation with relevant treaty bodies, and in collaboration with relevant specialised agencies and programmes of the UN system and appropriate intergovernmental mechanisms, to better define the rights related to food in Article 11 of the Covenant and to propose ways to implement and realise these rights as a means of achieving the commitments and objectives of the World Food Summit, taking into account the possibility of formulating voluntary guidelines for food security for all.</P>
    <P>62.  Objective 7.5</P>
    <P>To share responsibilities in achieving food security for all so that implementation of the World Food Summit Plan of Action takes place at the lowest possible level at which its purpose could be best achieved.</P>
    <P>In implementing this Plan of Action, it is recognised that:</P>
    <P>(a)  individuals and households have a key role in decisions and actions affecting their food security.  They must be enabled and encouraged to participate actively, both individually and also collectively, through producers consumers and other organizations of civil society,</P>
    <P>(b)  Governments have the responsibility to ensure an enabling environment conducive to the achievement of food security;</P>

      <P>In regard to the World Food Summit held recently in Rome, will the Taoiseach say whether there were any constructive or practical suggestions on how to eliminate <Col N="770" /> disparities between those countries with an abundance of food supplies, or who experience no supply difficulties, and those others who have so little?  Were there any concrete proposals or suggestions advanced which member states could get their teeth into, or was any particular plan agreed?</P>
      <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's meeting with the Chinese Prime Minister &mdash; which took place within days of the visit here of the Chinese dissident, Mr. Harry Wu, who at great personal cost has dedicated his life to highlighting and seeking change of the oppressive regime in China &mdash; had he any opportunity of raising these issues with him?</P>

      <P>To use diplomatic parlance, we had a very full and frank discussion about human rights between myself on behalf of the European Union and the Chinese Prime Minister on behalf of the People's Republic of China.  I sought a meeting of the European Union/China dialogue group on human rights.  The Chinese Prime Minister was reluctant to agree to that meeting, even though it was provided for in EU/China agreements, because he was anxious that the European Union should agree not to table a motion at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights session in Geneva in relation to the human rights position in China.  We did not reach agreement on that point; he was unwilling to move from his position on this matter.  I can assure the House that the European Union and the Irish Government, within its Presidency, will continue to seek to have a dialogue with China on the matter.  We believe that, while it is important that we mark our concern about human rights in China on the public record of the United Nations Commission, and we have an entirely proper right to table resolutions on that matter, action is likely to come about as a result of dialogue.  We believe there must be a meeting of the human rights group.  I have indicated to the Chinese Prime Minister that we shall be pursuing this matter further with them through diplomatic channels.  The matter has also been raised by the Tánaiste in other fora.  We will continue to use whatever means we can to achieve this meeting so that progress can be made on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked me a question about the practical measures being taken resulting from the Rome declaration on world food security.  It must be understood that primarily this is a political declaration which will guide actions through a whole range of areas of activity and agencies. Numerous objectives are set out for the action to be taken which I could go through at inordinate and unnecessary length but these have all been tabled with my reply for Members to read.  The general conclusion I drew from the summit was that food production is one thing, food distribution another and the ability to pay for food yet another.  It is not sufficient to have the technical capacity to produce more food if, through civil strife or military activity, the food <Col N="771" /> cannot be distributed to those who need it. Equally, even distribution is insufficient if the people who need the food are unable to pay for it.  Therefore, there is a need for a complementary policy of economic development, the promotion of peace and, of course, the promotion of better technical methods of food production.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>To date, I have had meetings with the Heads of State or Government of the following countries as part of the preparation for the European Council to be held in Dublin on December 13 and 14: Greece, in Athens; the Netherlands, in Dublin; Finland, in Helsinki; Austria, in Vienna; Portugal, in Lisbon; Spain, in Madrid; Sweden, in Stockholm; Denmark, in Copenhagen; Luxembourg, in Luxembourg; and with the Italian Prime Minister most recently in Rome.</P>
      <P>I will be having discussions with the Heads of State or Government of Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom and France as well as with the President of the European Commission prior to the European Council.</P>
      <P>In all my meetings to date I have stressed the following key objectives for the outcome of the European Council:</P>
      <P>&mdash;completion of the current phase of preparations for the commencement of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1999 in line with the provisions set out in the Maastricht Treaty;</P>
      <P>&mdash;reiteration of the commitment of the EU to the fight against European unemployment, in particular by reference to an agreed framework within which member states can devise policies to generate employment growth;</P>
      <P>&mdash;endorsement of the general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties which will be submitted to the European Council by the Irish Presidency with a view to the completion of the Intergovernmental Conference at the European Council in Amsterdam next June as planned;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; endorsement of specific measures to counter at European level the problem of drug trafficking and abuse and of an intensification of the EU-wide fight against <Col N="772" /> organised crime and trafficking in persons, including the sexual abuse of children; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;discussion on the key external issues facing the Union; in this regard I look forward to welcoming the Heads of State or Government of the Associated Countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus to a meeting and working lunch with the members of the European Council on Saturday, 14 December.</P>
    <P>In my meetings to date I have been encouraged by the support from my colleagues on the European Council for the achievement of these broad objectives.  Therefore, I am confident the Dublin European Council will be successful and will give the required impetus to the work of the European Union at this important time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 13 November 1996, in reply to supplementary questions to Question No. 1, I understand that the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions first became aware of the problem relating to the composition of the Special Criminal Court at approximately 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November 1996.  This occurred when a phone call was received by that office from the office of the Chief State Solicitor. I understand that the office of the Chief State Solicitor became aware that there was definitely a problem on the afternoon of 6 November 1996. This occurred on foot of an inquiry from the office of the Chief State Solicitor on the previous day to the Registrar of the court who in turn raised the matter with the Department of Justice. Contrary to suggestions made, there was no contact on the matter between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office or the Department of Justice prior to 6 November.</P>
      <P>The solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office who contacted the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court on 5 November is engaged exclusively on work for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in law in the discharge of his functions.  The solicitor's involvement in relation to the question of Judge Lynch's position arose in connection with his work for the DPP and is privileged as between the solicitor and his client.  For these reasons, I am unable, as Deputies will understand, to comment on the context in which the solicitor's conversation with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions took place, beyond indicating as I have done the date and fact of the conversation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Carey, informed the House in reply to Question No. 1 from Deputy Michael McDowell on 27 November 1996, the Attorney General read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996.  No one brought the matter to the Attorney's attention.  On 29 October 1996, there was a court report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch's name was mentioned.  To the best of his recollection, the Attorney General thinks it is likely that this is the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  The Attorney cannot give the precise time or date on which he read this report which, as I have said, appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 October.</P>

      <P>Once again we are not being given information, and this time because of privilege.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the Director of Public Prosecutions can waive this privilege and has he asked him to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is important that we know the full facts in this matter, which is very unsatisfactory?  If for no other reason, the Director of Public Prosecutions should exercise his right, on the Taoiseach's request, to waive privilege so that we can get the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to know the facts but it is also important that there should not be any disclosure in respect of a matter which is the subject of court proceedings.  I do not propose to make any disclosure in the light of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach suggesting that to tell us the basis of the Chief State Solicitor's knowledge in this matter could prejudice the court proceedings?  Is he saying he cannot tell us some of the facts about the way in which State servants came to know about the problems in the Dominic Lynch case as it would endanger their defence of current proceedings in the High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information the Deputy seeks relates to conversations between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's office in respect of a matter which is the subject of a court case.  Apart from giving the date and time of the conversation, which I have already done, it would not be appropriate to outline the content of the conversation which relates to matters currently before the courts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is familiar with the wisdom of not disclosing such information given that the matters in question are likely to be the subject of contest in court proceedings.  There is a well established practice that, for example, the consultations between a barrister and his client in any private or criminal case are not disclosed prior to hearing the case.  It is an important and well established principle of our legal system that the confidentiality between a client and the person acting on his behalf is maintained, particularly when the matter is the subject of court hearings. The suggestion that this should prudently be lifted in this case suggests that Deputy McDowell does not adequately appreciate the relevance of the general issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the issues involved.  Why is it that when one asks the basis on which people in the State service came to the conclusion that Judge Dominic Lynch was functioning in the Special Criminal Court at a <Col N="775" /> time when he had been removed one is confronted with the answer that privilege is being claimed in respect of this matter?  Surely I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach the very simple question how State servants came to know Judge Dominic Lynch was serving in the Special Criminal Court at a time when he ought not to have done.  I do not see how the liberty of any citizen or a case before the courts can be adversely affected if the Taoiseach imparts that information to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances in which the relevant arm of the State which is responsible for the administration of the courts, the Department of Justice, came to be aware of this matter and acted upon it have already been the subject of extensive debate in the House.  What the Deputy is concerned about is an earlier conversation between two State servants which is covered by client confidentiality.  The State's knowledge of the matter took the form of knowledge obtained by, and immediately acted upon, the Minister for Justice in a manner which has already been the subject of extensive discussion in the House.  The Deputy knows the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the Attorney General exercised his duties and responsibilities as guardian of the Constitution and protector of the public interest in the context of this affair?  When exactly did the Attorney General learn that Mr. Justice Lynch was still serving on the Special Criminal Court and when did he inform the Taoiseach?  If the Attorney General did not tell him until 12.45 a.m. on the day in question, did the Taoiseach not ask him why he had not informed him previously when it was obvious that he had known about the matter for several weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is well aware, definitive knowledge on this matter did not become available to the Attorney General until the day in question.  I was informed about the matter at approximately 12.30 a.m. the following day.  It is well known that the Attorney General, who has no direct responsibility for the administration of the courts, raised two queries about this matter in a letter to the Department of Justice.  He had no definitive knowledge that the matter was as it subsequently transpired to be until a half an hour before I was informed.  The Attorney General acted in this matter, as in all other matters of which I am aware, with exemplary skill and dedication.  He is an outstanding public servant and he has carried out his job exceptionally well in this and every other matter, and the Deputies should accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that privilege should be claimed sparingly in this House and only when it is absolutely necessary? Nobody can claim privilege in regard to a <Col N="776" /> conversation which took place between State officials on the improper composition of the Special Criminal Court given that everyone now knows the court was not properly constituted. Will the Taoiseach advise the House on whether the Director of Public Prosecutions or the solicitor concerned has claimed privilege and, if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the matter.  The general rule is that client confidentiality is claimed in all cases.  It is prudent that it should be claimed as it is extremely difficult to establish a basis for distinguishing cases where it ought or ought not to be claimed if one goes down the road of claiming it in only some cases.  The Deputy, who is familiar with the matter, will fully understand the reasons privilege is being claimed in this case.  Given the concerns previously expressed by him and others in the House about this matter and the pending court proceedings which are a matter of public record, it is disingenuous of the Deputy to seek a lifting of privilege in this case.  He is trying to some degree to have it both ways on this issue.</P>

      <P>I think the Taoiseach said the Chief State Solicitor's office became definitively aware of the matter on 5 November.  This seems to suggest that it had some inkling of the matter before that date.  Will the Taoiseach give a fuller explanation of this point?</P>
      <P>It appears the Attorney General read the newspaper report on 29 October.  Did he speak to anyone in his office about it?  He wrote to the Minister for Justice some days later &mdash; the letter was received on 5 November.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Attorney General should have telephoned the office of the Minister for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court on the day in question to find out if the report he had read in the newspaper was correct?  He had known from October there was a problem in the Special Criminal Court?</P>

      <P>The authorities in charge of the administration of the courts and ensuring they are properly constituted is the Department of Justice. When the Minister for Justice became definitively aware that there was a problem, she acted immediately.  As the House is aware, there was earlier correspondence from the Attorney General inquiring about the matter.  That correspondence was not dealt with in the way it should have been and that has been the subject of an inquiry.  It could be argued that if the correspondence had been dealt with properly, the relevant authority &mdash; the Department of Justice &mdash; would have become definitively aware of the problem much earlier.  Deputy Ahern asked me about the state of knowledge of the Director of Public Prosecutions office and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Neither of those offices is the State authority responsible for the constitution and administration of the courts.  They are responsible for preparing cases for the courts or pleading before them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they have an interest in the matter, but statutory responsibility for ensuring everything is in order in the courts does not rest with either of those offices, it rests with the Department of Justice.  In regard to the non-discharge of responsibilities by the Department of Justice in this matter, extensive answers, on the basis of an independent inquiry, have been given to the House.  Deputy Ahern asked me for information about the discussions that took place between the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Registrar of the courts in this matter.  I have given the date and time of the only such discussions that occurred.  There were no other discussions of that nature.  For the reasons I explained to Deputy McDowell, I am not in a position to give anything other than the time and date of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> The context and content of those conversations are covered by a legitimate and understandable plea of client confidentiality in respect of current important court cases.  That has been acknowledged by Members on all sides.  It would be prejudicial to the case that needs to be made if one side in those cases were obliged by me or anybody else to release information about internal communications between various people acting for the State in respect of those court cases if the other side was not obliged to make similar disclosures about discussions that may have taken place between client and legal adviser.  I am sure Members understand why that principle of client confidentiality is preserved.</P>

Is the Taoiseach claiming privilege for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office or are they claiming privilege through him?

I am not claiming privilege, privilege exists as a general principle of law in respect of client communication with the respective legal adviser.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach told the House repeatedly that the Attorney General did not have a role in this matter.  Does he accept that the Attorney General is independent in the exercise of his role as guardian of the public interest?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Attorney General decides the ambit of that role and that he made this matter his business? <Col N="779" /> Otherwise, how could one explain him writing letters in an official capacity about the constitution of the Special Criminal Court?  Does the Taoiseach accept the Attorney General did the business badly on this occasion?  Does he consider it acceptable that the Attorney General should read a newspaper report on a Tuesday when the Special Criminal Court is sitting and write a laconic letter the following Friday?  Was the letter of 2 November from the Attorney General made available to the Cromien-Molloy Committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the second letter from the Attorney General was discussed with the Cromien-Molloy committee.  They did not consider it necessary or relevant for them to see that letter.  I indicated that as far as the Attorney General was concerned there was no problem making it available to them if they had requested or required it, but they did not.</P>
      <P>Regarding the role of the Attorney General as the protector of the Constitution, Deputy O'Dea is correct.  The Attorney General is absolutely independent in regard to the exercise of that function.  That means I am not accountable on his behalf to the House in regard to that aspect of his work.  I am accountable to it in regard to other aspects of his work and I am answering questions here in regard to this matter on the basis of the other general responsibility I have for the functioning of his office.</P>
      <P>I explained to Deputy O'Dea and other Deputies that the Attorney General does not have responsibility for the administration of the courts.  That responsibility rests with the Department of Justice.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the Attorney General had a role in the matter and that was acknowledged from the outset. Were it not that the Attorney General alerted the Department of Justice to this matter in writing, we would probably have had a very different inquiry in regard to it.  That the Attorney General was industrious and alert enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a matter of public record that although the Attorney General did not and does not have responsibility for administration of the courts, he drew to the attention of the Department of Justice in writing &mdash; the most appropriate, recordable and definite form possible &mdash; the potential problem.  When the Attorney General became aware there was definitely a problem as distinct from an issue which seemed to be unexplained, he and the Minister for Justice acted with great speed on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said definitive awareness did not arise until a certain point.  If people read something in a newspaper and it started the alarm bells ringing in their minds, presumably they would verify the matter before they would waste their time writing a letter.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Attorney General took any step to verify the newspaper report he read on Tuesday, 29 October last?  In view of widespread publicity given to new reforms in the Attorney General's office, is there a record of the date on which the letter dated Friday, 1 November 1996 left that office?  Did it go by post or was it delivered by hand?  Is there any record of how the letter was sent from that office to the office on Stephen's Green as there is no record of it being received in that office until five days later?</P>

      <P>The Attorney General took the appropriate step to verify the facts, which was to communicate in writing &mdash; the most reliable form possible &mdash; with the people responsible under law for the verification of the appropriateness of the arrangements in the courts, the Department of Justice.  When the Attorney General read the newspaper report he acted by dictating a letter to the Department of Justice.  He was not at that time in possession of the full facts.  He addressed his query to the people who were responsible for having the full facts, the Department of Justice. There were a number of possibilities at that time as to why Mr. Justice Lynch might have been sitting on that court.  One being that the date of retirement might have been fixed for a later date than the date of the meeting.  The Attorney General did not know at the time he dictated the letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I further said that, if they wished, it was open to Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy in preparing their report to inquire into the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  They did not do so.  It was their decision and it was not as a result of any prompting.  As I explained to the House on four or five occasions communication in regard to the matter between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Director of Public Prosecutions is privileged and covered by client confidentiality. It would not be appropriate for me to initiate any inquiry into that matter until any question of court proceedings arising from the nature and content of such a conversation has been removed by the completion of the relevant court cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring the live animal export trade takes place in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare. Accordingly, I made, in 1995, the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals During Transport) Order which lays down strict provisions in relation to the registration of transporters, conditions regarding loading and unloading of animals, stocking density levels, feeding and watering requirements and the use of trained and experienced staff as well as other general requirements.  The Deputy will be aware that, following a number of serious incidents in relation to exports of live animals to third countries, I also arranged a detailed review of the existing arrangements applicable to the carriage of cattle by sea.  This review was undertaken by officials of both my Department and the Department of the Marine, the Meteorological Office, marine consultants and representatives of live exporters and shippers.</P>
      <P>Following the outcome of that review and with effect from 1 February 1996, I introduced the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Order, 1996.  This order established strict criteria for the approval of boats used for the carriage of cattle by sea, including requirements as to stability, construction and deck heights, set out the weather conditions in which such boats may operate and also regulated the drainage, lighting, provision of supplementary power and other measures designed to protect the welfare of animals being transported by sea.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these new statutory instruments have placed the transport of live animals from the State on a secure and defensible footing and have had a positive effect on the efficiency and safety of this trade.  I am not prepared to authorise any vessel or animal transport vehicle which does not comply with the requirements of the two orders concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this question down as a result of the unilateral decision by this Minister to impose stricter regulations in relation to the transport of animals by sea than is the case in any other EU country.  This is farcical given our dependence on live exports in trying to maintain a cattle trade.  Can the Minister confirm that the <Col N="784" /> commercial reality of what he has done is that while we have only eight ships chartered now as a result of these regulations, this time last year we had over 20?  Could he also confirm that even were further export orders to be obtained by live exporters, that there are no ships available to transfer those cattle to markets?  Is he prepared to stand over that position in view of the crisis in the beef industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a decision in all these cases on whether a ship was approved or rejected, I relied totally on the technical advice of marine consultants, who are the experts.  Eight boats have been approved and three were refused.  It is true I have come under political and other pressure to approve certain boats.  The <i>Guernsey Express</i> is one example.  It sank with the loss of 1,500 animals.  I must have regard to the taxpayers' situation.  There is a precedent by which if I approve a boat and it subsequently sinks or is damaged, the taxpayer and I are liable to a claim because we authorised that boat.  I am not to be browbeaten by anyone into departing from the technical advice.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's other question, there are eight boats approved and as markets become available and the Egyptian market recovers, there are boats from the Australian and southern hemisphere region that are being chartered here. We have copied the Australian rules, which I believe are the best.  There is no point in having a trade that may be undermined by serious sea accidents.  I want to put durable conditions in place because we depend on live exports.  We need outlets for our cattle and we are large exporters.  That is the best way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should reply to the questions I have asked.  Can he confirm that this time last year there were over 20 ships taking cattle from this country to export markets and that, having brought in these regulations, there are only six?  I have not come to browbeat the Minister but to wake him up to the commercial reality of what has happened.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is a bystander in this process.  Would the Minister not agree that the live exporters who have got this trade, without much help from the Department, have as much interest in the proper transport of animals to those markets as anybody else?  Can he not confirm that in relation to the technical issues he is raising, the roll period, part of the rules he has brought in, is now equivalent to that of a passenger liner?  That is an impossible rule to meet in the way it is being applied.  It is totally impracticable.  Does the Minister not understand that the effect of the new regulations, apart from the loss of ships being chartered for exports, means the discretionary clause that was a feature of previous regulations has been dropped and that therefore, when particular problems arise and need to be addressed in an emergency, there is no way that can be done?  Would the Minister <Col N="785" /> not agree that this is an unsatisfactory situation and that he should be prepared to look at the situation again in view of the fact that some of the ships rejected by his technical experts are regarded as fine by the Australians?  They have since got the export markets we used to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put the record straight. Eight vessels are currently approved for the purposes of the 1996 order which have a combined capacity of some 13,000 animals.  A further three vessels were found on inspection to have defects that would require correction before they could be approved under the 1996 order. The current capacity available on the approved vessels is such that there would be no shortage of shipping capacity for the live cattle trade.  I would welcome extra ships being put forward for inspection.  There will be no delay on my part in the speedy administration of the scheme but independent consultants, Department vets and marine experts are all involved.  This is the correct way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Under the previous Administration there was one incident where hundreds of cattle were killed in one sailing.  It was covered up and I was unaware of it until it was revealed in the media. Given the public's anxiety, this trade must be defensible and professional and ships must meet those specifications and be safe to travel in.  They are not up to passenger line standards.</P>

      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage, 62 per cent, of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.</P>
      <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with many recommendations.  Following consultation with the farm bodies on the consultants' report, I have made a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years.  These would involve some limits on the overall level of payment, adjustments to a small number of grant rates and a better targeting of payments to meet the overall aim of the disadvantaged areas scheme. Discussions on these proposals with the Commission are ongoing.  I will announce the details as soon as Commission agreement has been obtained.</P>

      <P>Once again, I am looking for a simple answer.  I asked the Minister what proposals, if any, he has made or agreed to in relation to reform of headage payments.  As a Member of this House, I am entitled to know what proposals he has sent to Brussels for changes in headage payments.  This is the third time we have tabled this question.  When tabled by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív it was evaded.  This is supposed to be an open and transparent Government.  I and the many thousands interested in this question want to know what proposals the Minister has submitted to the Commission to have the terms changed.  That is a simple question.  Let us have the answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me outline the background. Because of the cost of the extension of less severely disadvantaged areas, the reclassification <Col N="789" /> of areas from less to more severely disadvantaged areas, the third tier and the sheep deal in 1995, cuts of £14 million have to be made in existing headage payments.  The consultants in their report &mdash; the Kearney report &mdash; recommended a series of changes.  My policy is to adopt a minimalist approach to cuts and changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rejected the recommendation that an off-farm income limit be imposed. Without going into detail, the matters under discussion and not agreed to include the payment of a contributory pension after a certain date to target moneys at active younger farmers and placing a ceiling on compensatory payments made to an individual farmer to target the scheme at low income farmers who are always close to the Deputy's heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm organisations put forward different proposals.  We are negotiating on a combination of them.  On the question of breeds of cows and in-calf heifers, there is an anomaly between the national scheme and the beef cow scheme.  The definition of beef cow includes a cow belonging to a meat or dairy breed.  Farmers in advantaged areas can only receive payments in respect of beef breeds.  The question of extending this to disadvantaged areas is the third issue under review.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>the final amount of forfeiture of export refund bonds; whether this figure was agreed with UCLAF and DG 20; and the amount outstanding in respect of these guarantees.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23546/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent Government decision relating to forfeitures amounting to £7,302,241.73 in respect of one beef company because of a failure to fulfil the regulatory conditions.  These forfeitures have now been paid and the relevant guarantees were released back to the company in November. Further guarantees amounting to £17 million approximately against which there were no forfeitures were released at the same time.</P>
      <P>These files were the subject of a thorough investigation by UCLAF, the European Commission's anti-fraud unit, which agreed with the Department's proposed forfeitures and releases.  DG 20, the Commission's financial control unit, which is concerned with the clearance of accounts procedure, was not involved in this work.</P>
      <P>The only outstanding beef export refund guarantees of this company relate to an amount of approximately £6 million of pre-1990 guarantees which are being held separately at the Commission's request until its assessment has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain how the amount forfeited increased from £7 million, which was announced by the Government, to £7,302,000 and its decision of 12 October 1995? Is he aware UCLAF is under the impression that the figure which would be properly forfeited is £8 million?  Can he reconcile the differing figures and Government decisions and announcements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>After the original Government decision to which the Deputy referred concerning the lower figure of £7 million, new information came to light from informants who had approached UCLAF and, subsequently, the Irish authorities.  Arising from that, further detailed investigations took place.  Other investigations led to a revision of the figure and the net position was an extra forfeiture of £302,000.  When these informants contacted the Irish authorities, we immediately approached UCLAF so that we could work hand in glove and pool our information.  Before the matter was brought by me to Government, UCLAF indicated it was satisfied that the files were being dealt with correctly, with the exception of the £6 million which has still to be determined between the Commission and other authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is £6 million in guarantees still outstanding given that all these guarantees are in respect of export refunds payable on beef sent to Iraq by one company prior to 1990?  Most <Col N="791" /> of it was sent in the mid to late 1980s &mdash; some of it as long as ten years ago.  If this money is due to the State, why not collect it?  Why allow the question of forfeiting these bonds to extend for such a prolonged period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that the Irish authorities are the agent for the EU authorities.  At the request of the EU Commission to allow for further scrutiny of these transactions, this residual amount of £6 million is still being deliberated to see if all the performance aspects of this trade were properly concurred with.  I am not prepared to release them until we get clearance from the Commission and I am anxious that whatever amount of the £6 million has to be forfeited is forfeited properly.</P>
      <P>As regards the rest of the money, the £17 million, litigation was pending against me to release the moneys.  We were caught both ways in that we faced disallowance from Europe and we could have been sued by the person involved. This £7,302,000 is the largest forfeiture in the history of the State.  I am satisfied a correct decision was taken.  I took the unusual step of not only bringing it to the attention of Government, which would not be normal, to UCLAF and the Commission, but also to other authorities.  I got independent legal advice as well as that of the Attorney General before a final release was implemented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify that.  In cases involving former clients of the Attorney General, the senior legal officer in his office has dealt with the work.  Mr. Gleeson had no personal involvement, although his office which is staffed with legal expertise was involved.  Given the sensitive nature of these files, we got independent advice from a senior counsel who recommended the course of action subsequently taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that further disallowances against the State in respect of export refunds have been highlighted in the 1995 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, <Col N="792" /> will the Minister explain why his Department has not been able to get these matters to ensure the forfeiture of the bonds concerned where they are not in order?  The taxpayer should not be called on to make the payment but rather those who gave the bonds on behalf of the exporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that these files involving the £30 million relate to the late 1980s and 1990.  I was not Minister at the time, but I understand there is now greater scrutiny. The paper trail and the computerised system have been vastly improved in terms of resources, staff and IT.  Senior officials in the Department will admit that they only now have proper checks and balances in the system.  While any forfeiture must go through the due process, controls now in place are superior to those which existed heretofore.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Government to establish the Food Safety Board of Ireland was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Health, last October.  Pending the enactment of the necessary primary legislation to give effect to that decision, an interim board has been set up under the aegis of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The board's primary function will be to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance by the food industry with best practice in food safety and hygiene.  In this respect, it will have an independent auditing and supervisory role in relation to the food control and inspection functions of all Departments and agencies and will have the authority to make decisions binding on these bodies as regards any aspect of those functions.  It will have final overall responsibility for ensuring that the control and inspection functions are established and carried out in accordance with best practice.</P>
      <P>It will not, however, assume any of the primary or day to day functions of these bodies and, consequently, the question of transferring staff and/or resources from my Department to it does fully with the board in the exercise of its functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the activities of the board do not directly relate to my office.  The board is independent.  While I do not have the answer to the question, I know it held its inaugural meeting last Wednesday because I <Col N="793" /> was at a function where I met people who had come from it.  I would not get the minutes of its meetings.  The primary legislation will relate to the Minister for Health, who attended the inaugural meeting, not to me.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's blissful ignorance about this important interim board which was set up to deal with a consumer crisis, is he suggesting he no longer has any role in this matter?  He is saying this is the problem of the Minister for Health and that he does not want to know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more accurate to say I will not be meddling in the affairs of the board than to say I am blissfully ignorant.  The board is autonomous, independent and absolutely all powerful in terms of its binding recommendations, Protocols and the operation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is intended that my Department, like a health board or a local authority, will be the servants of the instructions of this independent food safety board.  The Minister will be subject to its recommendations and it is appropriate that I am at arm's length from its deliberations.  That would give it independence to do what it sees fit because its loyalty and duty is to the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few matters lie in my office for four months.  The traceability system, with the computerised animal location file, the CMMS file, is under proactive consideration by me to secure resources in the Estimates and the proper technology to ensure it works.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will have total responsibility for its establishment.  The Food Safety Authority will be responsible not for running the traceability scheme but ensuring it is satisfactory and that it meets the objectives.  The role of this expert group is to ensure, in a totally independent, autonomous way, that the Department is doing its job properly.  It will have no loyalty to the staff carrying out the functions of traceability, veterinary inspection and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as June I actively sought from An Bord Bia, Teagasc and other interested parties an input to a national traceability and quality assurance scheme.  An Bord Bia was appointed to a working group to develop this matter and consider its own national quality assurance scheme, which may be separate from a safety assurance scheme.  There is ongoing <Col N="794" /> contact and submissions are made almost on a weekly basis.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will have responsibility for the establishment of the traceability scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My question asked what functions, staff and resources will be transferred to the new food authority.  The only conclusion I can draw from what the Minister said is that there is no expertise in food quality in the Department.  Is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear distinction between the job of those who carry out the day to day functions of food subsidies, EHOs, VIs, Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry inspectors and so on, and that of the Food Safety Authority which will decide whether those people are doing a good job or should operate under different Protocols and instructions.  The Authority will have a free hand to lay down the law under which it operates.  It may carry out random checks to see whether the work of the Department is up to scratch, and it would be a very serious indictment of the Department if it did not meet the required standards.  There is primary legislation involved here and the Deputy will have an opportunity to table amendments to the Minister for Health as appropriate.  It would be very serious if the independent Food Safety Authority was critical of the Department.  The Department will have to be on its toes, like everyone else, to ensure it meets the standards laid down by the Authority.</P>

      <P>The importation of animal feedstuffs containing bovine material of UK origin was banned following an EU decision last March.  Imports from other countries are allowed provided they comply with the animal health conditions set out in the relevant EU directives. Cereal based animal feedstuffs are allowed entry to the State from the UK only on production of sufficient evidence that no bovine material of UK origin was used in its manufacture.  Imported feedstuffs are sampled and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that the above named provisions are complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates specifically to imports of feedstuffs and £2.8 million worth of such feed is imported.  Importers' premises are visited on a regular basis as part of the Department's inspectorate's monitoring of <Col N="795" /> premises which manufacture or handle animal feed.  Samples are taken for analysis which is carried out at the State laboratory.  Where breaches of the regulations occur measures are taken, including impounding and destruction of feed to ensure illegal material is not placed on the market.</P>

      <P>In regard to the changes I put in place with particular reference to meat and bonemeal, a licence is required to manufacture, import, distribute, feed or hold meat and bonemeal.  That regulation was introduced in September.  People feeding ruminants or producing meal for ruminants will not get a licence.  If they have a dedicated poultry or white meat business they will get a licence but if, for example, they have a provender mill plant they will not be allowed to use the same feed line for pigs and poultry.  As with the approach to the illegal substance, angel dust, I have put in place a task force inspectorate to deal with this aspect of meat and bonemeal.  As regards other imported feeds, they are checked at the point of import.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Single Market most of the customs officials have been relocated and I can speak only for the Department's inspectorate.  I suspect that imported feed may have been involved in some BSE cases.  In regard to meals, I have asked that checks by the Garda and sampling by the Department be carried out, similar to the operation of security to prevent the smuggling of animals.  It is illegal to export meat and bonemeal or animals from the UK-Northern Ireland jurisdiction.  Special measures are applied in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to feedstuffs, yesterday I had a meeting with IGFA, the Irish Grain and Feed Association and requests were made by many people that there should be a full display of feed ingredients in compound feed.  I reached agreement with that association today that, in addition to the existing declaration, feed information will be available whereby all feed ingredients in compound feeds will be, from a certain date &mdash; I hope, shortly &mdash; displayed in alphabetical order so that people are in no doubt about the matter.  In addition, on 1 January the law will require that every piece of meal will contain a label stating that it does or does not contain meat and bonemeal and if it does, it is banned for ruminant feed.  In that way <Col N="796" /> there can be no inadvertent feeding of meat and bonemeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy heard my earlier remarks but essentially the legal position is that an EU directive was introduced in 1992 which set out an either/or situation.  Sixteen product categories were deemed unsatisfactory in terms of not giving detail or full ingredients.  The industry here decided on the 16 categories by descending weight order, by volume.  I have now agreed with those in the industry that, in addition to the legal requirements, they will voluntarily introduce a second label which will spell out all the ingredients in alphabetical order, and that will be reviewed in time.  They were not prepared to do this by volume weight because that would give away the recipe element which they felt was a trade secret.  I am not legally empowered to go beyond the EU law at this time but this is a significant step forward.  I have also discussed with those in the industry the question of prescription antibiotics in pig feed, about which I know the Deputy is concerned.  An agreement has now been reached with pig producers that a new finisher ration will be given for the last 28 days which in all circumstances will not be allowed contain antibiotics, with or without a prescription.  Those two measures point to the need to integrate the feed chain with the food chain and I hope they will reassure consumers.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to assist small milk quota holders who face serious super-levy bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23363/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With four months of the present milk quota year still to run, it is not possible to accurately forecast the extent of either the liability which will be incurred at national level or the extent of the liability which will fall to be paid by smaller scale producers.  I am concerned, however, at the level of excess milk deliveries to date this year.  This was estimated at 3.5 per cent or 30 million gallons over quota up to the end of October which would, if deliveries from November onwards remained unchanged on last year, result in a levy bill of £33 million.  The October figures, however, showed a slight decline.  This appears to be continuing in November which is somewhat heartening.</P>
      <P>Under the various schemes operated this year, smaller scale producers were given first priority access to any additional quota which became available.  This is also the case under the third stage of the temporary leasing scheme currently in progress.  Producers in this category with particular difficulties have been given special treatment.  Under the flexi milk rules smaller scale producers will be specifically provided for also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further arrangement I put in place this year was the application of a 10 per cent clawback on sales and leases of land and quota.  While the indications are this measure is having a positive impact on the amount of quota available under <Col N="798" /> the third stage of temporary leasing, the full impact on volume and price will be more obvious in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I stress, however, that the reality is and always has been that because of the unprecedented demand for quota this year, requirements cannot be fully satisfied.  In this context I emphasise that it is the sole responsibility of each producer to manage his or her own quota at farm level. Producers should maintain ongoing contact with their co-operatives and TEAGASC advisers as to the action they can take to minimise their super-levy liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of my constituents who are small milk quota holders are in serious financial difficulties due to the non viability of their existing quota and the heavy financial demands on them due to oversupply?  Will the Minister indicate if some additional quota will be allocated in the coming quota year to those hardship cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Every available quota has been allocated to those farmers producing less than 35,000 or 30,000 gallons.  There is no more quota available.  For the first time, half of the milk quota under the Milk Quota Appeal Tribunal has been given to such farmers.  It does not add to those small farmers' viability to over-produce.  People have written to me from all over the country and have attended my clinics complaining of super-levy bills of £8,000 and £9,000 when they have already exhausted their quota.  Those people took a risk in overproducing milk, and there is no escape from that.  The super-levy rules have not been changed; there has been no quota cut.  I appreciate that prices for cull cows have been bad but that will not provide for any mitigation of a super-levy bill.  I hope the 10 per cent clawback will stop the movement out of the temporary leasing scheme, and the disparity between the State and the private sector schemes will be brought back into balance somewhat next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if progress has been made in regard to a well documented proposal put to his Department and the British authorities by the co-operatives North and South of the Border that additional quota should be made available to small milk quota holders on both sides of the Border due to the importance of dairying as an income generator in those areas?  The proposal would be supported by both Governments under the European Union's peace and reconciliation programme.  Will the Minister avail of every opportunity, particularly as President of the Agriculture Council of Ministers until the end of this year, to progress this proposal which has the unanimous support of all Oireachtas Members in the Border area as well as farming organisations and co-operatives North and South of the Border?  The provision of additional milk quota would help rebuild the <Col N="799" /> economy in that area which has been devastated in the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement was reached on this proposal by my Department and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  However, the British authorities deemed it a non-runner.  The Commission was not sympathetic to it and the matter has not progressed.  I endorse the sentiments expressed by the Deputy but I do not want to raise the expectation that this proposal will reach a satisfactory outcome.  If such a proposal was approved in Whitehall and in the Commission, there would be considerable resistance from the Council of Ministers because many countries have requested extra quota and a deaf ear has been turned to them.  I am willing to do anything I can but I consider it a distinct uphill battle at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister use his influence as President of the Council of Ministers to ensure that unused milk from European countries is transferred as flexi milk.  I understand last year a substantial amount of milk was not used up in Germany.  Furthermore, will the Minister agree that the processor is mainly to blame for encouraging farmers to produce milk? The farmer pays the levy and the processor can continue to manufacture and sell the product. Will the Minister agree there is need for change in this regard?  The processors of the commodity for the manufacture of milk should declare they cannot use up that milk.  They are encouraging it because there is a profit margin in it for them and that is where the real problem is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an expectation that there would be unused milk in some member states last year, especially in Germany.  This did not materialise.  A majority were over quota, some as high as three or four per cent and Germany was not under quota.  No spare quota was available. The Commission is resolutely opposed to national transfer or flexi-milk but it did not arise at European level because there was none to spare.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct on his second point in that processors charge a levy of £1.38 but get milk for virtually nothing and can dispose of it and avail of the EU export refunds for intervention for the disposal of surplus milk.  Processors make money out of super-levy milk.  It needs to be highlighted that there has been no change in the ownership and management of quotas.  It has always been at primary production level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many small and medium-sized holders, up to this year, had been getting the usual amount of leased quota from the co-ops.  As a result of the changes made by the quota tribunal, land producers started to get access to this milk.  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that only half the temporary lease <Col N="800" /> quota went to producers under 35,000 gallons? Would he not agree that it should all have gone to such people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that virtually all the milk should go to smaller producers and we have given priority to those who have become accustomed to a dependency on it.  In the first tranche, less milk went to large producers under this year's system of allocation than was previously the case. Previously 2,000 farmers applied for temporary lease milk.  Some 8,500 applied for it this year at a time when there was less milk in the scheme because cheque book operators could offer a higher price to lease it, perhaps 50p to 60p per gallon, than the 30p per gallon available to the temporary lease scheme.  It was a combination of extra demand and the overall pool of temporary lease milk which was the problem rather than milk being given to larger farmers.  I accepted the recommendation of the milk quota review group and am not defensive about it.  The truth is that less milk went to larger producers in proportionate terms in the first tranche in 1996 than in the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

It is the one area where a small amount of quota from the European Commission could make an enormous difference to the smallholders referred to.

      <P>There is no problem with the Irish authorities in supporting this proposal.  However, I get the distinct impression from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British authorities that they do not want reciprocal demands from English, Welsh and Scottish dairy farmers for extra quota.  Therefore, they have not seen fit to support our proposal.  I will facilitate any dialogue with Sir Patrick Mayhew or Mr. Douglas Hogg which can resolve this matter.  I do not want to raise expectations or make promises about something which, unless both Governments actively support it, will not happen. There has been substantial support under the INTERREG programme under the agricultural chapter for the Border counties.  I will do everything to foster that in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded by this statement to report to the House on the current situation relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>All of us in this House, and indeed all parties involved in efforts to reach an honourable and generally acceptable accommodation, have one aim in common.  We remain fully committed to an inclusive process of negotiations on exclusively democratic terms and, if at all possible, to conducting the negotiations against a totally peaceful backdrop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Differences, when they arise &mdash; whether in this House or elsewhere &mdash; relate not to where we are going but rather how we get there.  For some time now the twin objectives of Government policy have been the establishment of a truly inclusive process of negotiations and the earliest credible restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  That is where <Col N="803" /> we are going.  Now let me talk about how we get there.</P>
    <P>The history of the past 25 years has shown one thing clearly.  Unless both Governments travel together on the same road and towards the same destination, progress is simply not possible.  The problem we are grappling with is immensely complex.  In the first place it is a problem involving the people who live in Northern Ireland.  Beyond that, it is a problem for the two Governments.  It is not an Irish problem.  It is not a British problem.  It is a joint problem and, therefore, requires the Governments to take a joint approach.  It is against that background that both Governments have created the basis for the restoration of the ceasefire and inclusive negotiations.  That basis is contained in two agreed documents: the joint communiqué issued by the Prime Minister and myself on 28 February this year, and the Ground Rules for Substantive All-Party Negotiations published on 16 April last.</P>
    <P>There are three important points to be made about these documents.  First they are agreed by both Governments.  Second, they are public documents.  Third, they post-date the breakdown of the ceasefire through the murderous IRA attack in London's Docklands.  Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ground Rules document are particularly relevant.  That, then, is the agreed basis for moving forward.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the human element.  It is a matter of fact that trust has been broken.  When the IRA declared a ceasefire in 1994, it was presented on the basis that it would last.  It did not.  We must also take account of the fact that it was generally expected Sinn Féin would participate in negotiations within a reasonable but undefined period.  That did not happen.  The Unionist community who, it is probably fair to say, never trusted the IRA ceasefire are now particularly distrustful not just of the republican movement but perhaps of the process as a whole. That is the background against which we are working as we head into next week's Anglo-Irish summit.  It is a background which recognises that there is an agreed basis for progress but which also recognises the need to deal with the issue of trust.</P>
    <P>Since last February, the Government has worked hard to bring about an unequivocal restoration of the 1994 ceasefire and, on that basis, a fully inclusive process of negotiations.  We have engaged closely with the British Government, with John Hume and others and I still believe that a co-ordinated approach offers the best prospects for a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>The Government will, therefore, continue to work with the people to whom I referred with the aim of securing a definitive and clear understanding on Sinn Féin's admittance to negotiations in the wake of an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  In particular, it is vitally important that there should be a clear <Col N="804" /> understanding on the timing and means of that party's entry to talks in such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>My Government's position on this whole issue remains as it always has been.  Our approach has been informed throughout by the joint position of the two Governments as set out in the February communiqué and the ground rules paper.  This means that if the IRA clearly called an unequivocal ceasefire, in words that are believable, and provided there is adherence to both the cessation and the Mitchell Principles, then Sinn Féin should be admitted to the talks. In practical terms, given the imminence of the Christmas recess this might have to be on resumption of the talks in the New Year, but there could be room for useful reciprocal confidence building contacts in the interval.</P>
    <P>All roads, however, lead to an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire, which should, of course, never have been broken.  Its restoration now would reopen the road to the inclusive negotiations to which both Governments have given their commitment.  I appeal for it to be done without delay.  I want to make it absolutely clear that there is no justification now, nor has there ever been, for paramilitary violence from any quarter.  Violence deepens divisions in an already deeply divided society like Northern Ireland. Only democratic and peaceful means can bring about, and nurture, the essential process of healing and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>At the same time, however, we cannot ignore the political considerations and positions involved in trying to secure an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire while not raising unnecessary suspicions on the Loyalist side.  For this reason both Governments are engaged in intensive contact with a view to developing our respective positions on the basis of the ground rules and the February communiqué.  That work will be continued in the coming days.  The two Governments must build on the substantive areas of agreement between us.  These would include an openness on both our parts to work towards proposing adoption of an agreed indicative timeframe for the talks as one way to constructively advance the negotiations.  The British Prime Minister and I will, next week, review the situation generally, including the prospects for substantive progress in the multiparty talks.</P>
    <P>Turning to the multiparty talks, the Government remains convinced that the current impasse over the handling of the decommissioning issue can best be resolved on the basis of all participants agreeing to work constructively and in good faith to implement all aspects of the Mitchell report.  We believe that a breakthrough can be achieved provided the necessary determination exists on all sides.</P>
    <P>Public confidence in current efforts to achieve political agreement would undoubtedly be greatly increased if there was clear and speedy movement to substantive three-strand negotiations.  There are many issues of profound <Col N="805" /> importance within each of the three core relationships which need to be addressed and I hope that negotiations on such matters can be commenced soon.</P>
    <P>The Government has always appreciated the constructive and helpful role played by the United States in our collective efforts to secure the necessary forward movement.  President Clinton and his Administration have been kept apprised of recent developments.  The President shares the desire of both Governments for a successful outcome to the ongoing efforts aimed at securing inclusive and substantive negotiations against a background of peace.  I took the opportunity with Vice-President Gore in Lisbon this week to express my appreciation for continuing American support.  It certainly remains my firm view that with good will and determination on all sides, the twin objectives of a credible ceasefire and fully inclusive talks can be realised.</P>
    <P>The polarising effects of this year's marching season underscore the urgency of the task facing us all.  There has been extensive intimidation. There has been damage to property, Orange halls and Protestant places of worship as well as to Catholic churches and schools.  An equally sinister manifestation of violence has been orchestrated interference with people's right to worship.  All these actions are profoundly wrong, contrary to the most basic civil and religious liberties and clearly point to the overriding need for the primacy of politics to be firmly re-established. The most effective way to achieve that is through inclusive all-party talks against a background of peace and leading to an agreed settlement to which Nationalists and Unionists, Republicans and Loyalists could give their support and allegiance.  I assure the House that I and my Government will continue to do everything we can, in co-operation with others, to bring that about.</P>
    <P>As 1996 draws to a close, we must look forward with determination to the challenges and opportunities that await us all in the New Year. Let us all redouble our efforts to make 1997 the year in which a new chapter is opened on the way in which all the peoples of these islands coexist in an environment of peace and tolerance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for giving the House the opportunity of a short debate.  His meeting next week with the British Prime Minister may well be the last chance of restoring peace in Northern Ireland this side of a British general election.  He therefore has to be clear and focused about what he is seeking.  He also has a duty as President of the European Council to try to secure worthwhile progress on important European issues at the forthcoming Dublin Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland is bedevilled by an almost complete breakdown in trust.  The British Government and the Unionists in effect accuse Sinn Féin and the IRA of not ever having been <Col N="806" /> serious about the August 1994 ceasefire, and want stronger guarantees next time.  Sinn Féin and a sizeable section of Nationalist opinion attribute the breakdown in considerable part to British bad faith in stalling for 17 months on convening inclusive all-party talks, which were promised by them.  The challenge posed by John Major on 9 January 1994 on the David Frost programme was put in the simplest terms: &ldquo;Will the IRA give up violence in order to enter into talks in the democratic process?&rdquo; The IRA gave up violence but the promise to enter into talks was a mirage.</P>
    <P>On top of the mutual distrust and occasional acts of IRA violence, there has been a virtually sterile and often confrontational talks process at Stormont.  After six months, negotiations have got almost nowhere, further undermining faith in democratic politics.  On the streets of Northern Ireland, there has been a degradation of community relations, with appalling scenes outside a Catholic Church and the continuation of brutal punishment beatings.  All of us fear the havoc that the amount of naked hatred could wreak, if there is one act of violence too many. In this dangerous and volatile situation, all of us who are genuinely working for peace must stand together.  We must persuade those parties who can do most to transform the situation to act, recognising that it is difficult to get anyone to move in isolation without some gurarantee of corresponding movement on the other side.  That was the whole purpose of John Hume's praiseworthy initiative.</P>
    <P>The IRA needs to be clear that when it restores its ceasefire this time it will be for good and that it cannot be broken under any pretext.  When Sinn Féin sign up to the Mitchell Principles, it will have to be in good faith on behalf of its entire movement.  The IRA has to renew the definitive commitment it made to democracy in August 1994, and be prepared to show that this time it means it to hold in all circumstances.  All must recognise that achieving a political settlement in Northern Ireland and greater justice for the Nationalist people may be not merely difficult in the short-term but impossible.  Even in those circumstances, exclusively peaceful strategies must be pursued.  In the long run, natural forces, a democratic consensus and a reform agenda with a new British Government under the Anglo-Irish Agreement can achieve more progress than any renewal of paramilitary violence.</P>
    <P>The demand I would have most reservations about &mdash; and one I have mentioned in this House on numerous occasions &mdash; is the one for a short timeframe.  No one in the IRA should delude themselves that setting a timeframe for talks and its subsequent expiry without agreement or even progress will create a renewed mandate for its armed struggle.  Those who demand unmistakable evidence that armed struggle is over for good are right and I am not referring to the question of decommissioning here, which is secondary.  That was Fianna Fáil's clear position in 1994 and since. <Col N="807" /> The peace process will only work, if everyone, the two Governments, the Northern parties, and above all republicans and loyalists, are prepared to absolutely commit themselves to peace and democracy.  If all the IRA is prepared to offer this time is a rather more obvious tactical ceasefire, it will not work.  No democrat will tolerate an alternating <i>de facto</i> armalite and ballot box strategy, and I speak on behalf of by far the largest republican party.  The only basis on which all of us are prepared to work with and include Sinn Féin is an exclusively democratic one.</P>
    <P>This year, in this Republic, we celebrate 75 years of Irish democracy.  Its full realisation has been gradual, but we can look back with pride on how far we have come.  We can also look forward to the progress we all want to make in deepening our democracy and making it work better for all our people.  The attempts to reform and democratise Northern Ireland, dating from the civil rights movement, one of whose founders is a Government Minister, have also made some progress, though not nearly enough.  North and South, we have &ldquo;the freedom to achieve freedom&rdquo;, if violence can be put behind us, even though it will not be an easy road.  A direct or indirect attempt to coerce Unionists would be a profound and historic mistake, regardless of provocation and intransigence.  We all know that violence leads only to death, misery and destruction.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must persuade the British Prime Minister that, if republicans show themselves willing to give the type of commitment we all demand, they have a right to be admitted to talks in the New Year.  The Nationalist people of Northern Ireland have democratic rights that have been trampled upon for far too long. Neither the Unionists nor the British Government have any right or discretion to exclude, deny or delay full talks participation to any democratically elected and committed party, however much they may dislike their past.</P>
    <P>In its fundamentally unsatisfactory reply to John Hume, the British Government gave every impression of trying to temporise and delay, the same disastrous way it did for 17 months, because of its precarious situation at Westminster.  To make participation in talks subject to intelligence assessments is totally unacceptable.  So-called intelligence sources have just come up with the ludicrous and insulting notion that a senior US diplomat working with Senator Mitchell had a liaison with a senior republican she had not even met.  Giving any role to secretive and unaccountable organisations with their own agendas amounts to placing an absolute discretion in the sole hands of the British Government.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach, when he goes to London, to make the following clear to the British Government.  An early and definite date must be set for inclusion in talks, if the IRA and Sinn Féin are prepared to make specific commitments <Col N="808" /> about the irrevocable character of a new ceasefire, underpinned by the appropriate behaviour and by signature of the Mitchell Principles upon entry into talks.  The Taoiseach should also make it clear that the date in late January to be set is for a full plenary session, with any bilaterals, successful or not, to be completed before then.  If the British Prime Minister refuses to tie himself down to any such commitment, the Taoiseach must make it clear publicly that provided the basic conditions are satisfied the Irish Government will insist on Sinn Féin's inclusion in plenary talks as a matter of democratic principle.  He will have the support of all in this House if he does so.  I accept what I am asking requires political courage and risk taking for peace, but it must be done.  It is time for the Irish Government to once more play a driving role in the peace process and to be in the loop rather than on the sidelines.</P>
    <P>It will be suggested there is no point if some or all of the Unionist parties may walk out, even though many in the wider community, especially business people, are anxious to see a negotiated settlement.  That difficulty, or other difficulties of a similar order, will have to be faced because neither Government can condone or collude any longer with an attempted Unionist veto on the right in principle of all sections of the Nationalist community to be represented at peace talks.</P>
    <P>Peace is of equal benefit to all.  Some parties have made a much greater effort for peace than others, including John Hume and the SDLP, the Alliance Party, the loyalist parties and the Women's Coalition.  What have the Unionist politicians and some of the backbench Tories done for peace, except demand surrender?  It is about time they made a similar effort for peace, instead of some doing all they can to make continued conflict inevitable, in the hope of some ultimate elusive military victory or in the hope that the need for a fundamental new accommodation between the communities will go away.  If Unionists want Northern Ireland to survive, and to become a viable political entity, they have to start trying to win the consent of Nationalists.  What is deeply destructive are attempts by either side to get their own way without making any attempt to seek through dialogue, the consent of the other.</P>
    <P>We need a stronger sense of civil responsibility. Political and other leaders as well as communities must stand out against sectarianism.  There should be no false equation of the right to march without local consent through a particular area, with the right to attend one's own church without persecution, which is one of the most fundamental of all civil and religious liberties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach and Prime Minister will say something strong about recent events. Equally, every influence must be brought to bear to stop the appalling punishment beatings, which are a gross violation of human rights carried out by members of paramilitary organisations.  They represent the ugly and unacceptable face of both <Col N="809" /> republicanism and loyalism.  It is possible to stop them, if the will is there.  The unacceptability of the police is no excuse for savage barbarity against members of one's own community.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in the next few days as he prepares for the Summit, an important event for the country and for Europe but I wish him particularly well next week in his efforts to try to restore peace.  In the course of this session we have had many debates on the North and we on this side of the House have continued to be constructive and supportive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty, twenty and even ten years ago there were profound divisions in this House when it debated virtually any aspect of Northern Ireland.  Those divisions no longer exist. There is a high degree of agreement on all sides of the House about what needs to be done and, by and large, how it should be done.</P>
      <P>No Government has received more support in this regard than the present Government.  I will say nothing today to change that, other than to express my urgent desire and that of my party that progress be made and the frustrations in the talks which have been going on since 10 June, must be overcome.  I took part in the 1992 talks and was told by somebody who took part in the same talks and is familiar with what is taking place in the current talks, that the 1992 talks were most progressive in comparison with what is happening at present.  I was most frustrated in 1992 so I can only imagine how slow progress is now.</P>
      <P>There is an absolute priority to try to establish a genuine, non-tactical IRA ceasefire which demonstrates that violence is over for good.  I used the word &ldquo;establish&rdquo; and did not refer to re-establishing what was declared in 1994 because that is not enough.  It was not a permanent ceasefire and the assurances that were given at the time, unfortunately, were not honoured. There are three requirements which, if fulfilled, would be sufficient.  The three requirements are short of total decommissioning, which appears to be the cause of the present impasse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will enumerate the requirements first and comment briefly on them later.  The first requirement is that all targeting, intelligence gathering, rearming, regrouping and reorganising by the IRA must stop immediately on the declaration of a ceasefire.  Second, all punishment beatings, which rely ultimately on the threat of worse violence, must stop on the declaration of a ceasefire.  Third, people who are exiled from Northern Ireland under threat of violence should have that threat withdrawn and the verdict of <Col N="810" /> exile withdrawn.  Unless those requirements are fulfilled, nobody can say violence is truly over even if a ceasefire is declared.  A preoccupation with complete physical decommissioning is unnecessary and misses the point. Decommissioning of itself is not necessarily meaningful except as a gesture, albeit an important gesture.  The three requirements I have outlined would demonstrate the sincerity of those who are prepared to abide by them.</P>
    <P>The first requirement, that all targeting, intelligence gathering, rearming or regrouping cease, did not occur after the ceasefire of 1994. That activity continued unabated.  With regard to punishment beatings, it is sobering to read in today's newspapers the figures given in the House of Commons yesterday which show that the number of punishment beatings has not just increased but quadrupled in two years.  Up to 25 November this year there were 276 punishment beatings and 297 punishment beatings and shootings.  Guns were used as the ultimate sanction in 21 of the 297 incidents.  Apparently, that number breaks down at a ratio of about 60:40 on the republican side, but they are equally deplorable on either side.  How a society could claim that peace existed if that type of activity continued is beyond me.  It is reprehensible that people are still exiled from Northern Ireland and other areas under threat of violence, particularly when the exile is imposed by an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>To demonstrate credibility, short of total physical decommissioning, and to engender good will, it is not unfair to look at what the loyalists have done since they declared their ceasefire.  In the first place, they have maintained it in spite of great provocation.  Part of the reason there was more ready acceptance of the loyalists' ceasefire than of the IRA ceasefire, was the nature of the statements the loyalists made on its declaration and particularly their expressions of regret.  The statements were sincerely meant if one is to judge by what has happened since then.  There are many ways short of immediate, total decommissioning of weapons and explosives which could be used to demonstrate the sincerity of those who might declare another IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <P>All is not entirely bleak in Northern Ireland, although the situation is not very encouraging. There was an encouraging development in recent weeks, the statement of the new Chief Constable of the RUC, Mr. Flanagan, who said it was his ambition that the RUC would become a politically neutral force.  One takes such a thing for granted in any other democratic jurisdiction but it is something new and different in Northern Ireland and would be most welcome.  If that willingness to change traditional thinking were to permeate more broadly we could anticipate a great deal of progress.</P>
    <P>One of the most distressing aspects of current events in Northern Ireland, apart from the non-event of the talks and ongoing punishment beatings, is the extraordinarily flagrant <Col N="811" /> interference with the right of Catholics to worship and the apparent inability of the authorities to uphold that right.  Of all places for such a thing to happen, I thought Northern Ireland would be the last, given that it boasts the highest level of church attendance in any country outside the Islamic world.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in the forthcoming Summit at which I hope some breakthrough can be made.  Even though I suppose all of us, including the media, tend to focus our attention on them, there is a limit to what Governments can do.</P>
    <P>I shall finish by reiterating something I and the leader of my party have said on many occasions, that in circumstances like these, the greatest duty is on the leadership of the more moderate factions on both sides because, from their willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue with one another in a spirit of compromise only will an ultimate solution emanate.</P>

The main instrument at its disposal is the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, better known as the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ireland became a party on 25 February 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of a Human Rights Charter and a Court of Justice was contained in the text of the <Col N="812" /> draft European Convention on Human Rights submitted by the European Movement on 12 July 1949 to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  This text made provision not only for a court but for a human rights commission to which litigants would first have to submit their cases.  It was foreseen that this body would be empowered to filter out petitions which were clearly unfounded, which had failed to exhaust domestic remedies or which did not meet the six-month deadline.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a human rights commission, in addition to a court, was made to counter the criticism that the court would be inundated with frivolous litigation and its facilities exploited for political ends.  The creation of a commission was not a contentious issue during the drafting of the convention.  By contrast, there was considerable opposition to the creation of a court, it being argued that it would not correspond to a real need of member states.  The net result was the tripartite structure, which entered into force on 3 September 1953: the Commission &mdash; to consider the admissibility of the facts, to promote friendly settlements and, if appropriate, to give an opinion as to whether the petitions reveal a violation of the Convention; the Court &mdash; to give a final and binding judgment on cases referred to it by the Commission, by a contracting party concerned or, since the entry into force in 1994 of Protocol 9 to the Convention, an individual applicant in certain circumstances and, finally the Committee of Ministers &mdash; to give a final and binding decision on cases not referred to the court by any of the aforementioned bodies or persons.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade the number of cases considered under the enforcement mechanism of the European Convention on Human Rights has greatly increased as the Convention has become better known to citizens, as more member states have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the court, and new member states have joined the Council of Europe.  In 1986, 2,869 applications were received by the Commission, in 1995 there were 10,201 applications.  On 31 December 1995 there were 4,065 cases pending before the Commission, including 2,461 awaiting first examination.  Such delays threaten the effectiveness of the system as a means of protecting human rights.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Protocol 11, which Ireland signed on 11 May 1994, is to replace the existing European Commission and Court of Human Rights with a new permanent court to expedite the hearing of cases and reduce the backlog of applications.  The establishment of a new court was agreed unanimously by Heads of State and Government at the Vienna Summit of the Council of Europe in October 1993.</P>
    <P>The new court will have jurisdiction in all matters concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention and Protocols thereto.  Before an application by an individual can be heard by the Commission at present, the State against which the application is lodged must <Col N="813" /> have previously made a declaration recognising the competence of the Commission to consider individual petitions.  In practice, all contracting states accept this provision, although they must do so only for renewable periods.  Ireland accepted this provision for an indefinite period on ratification of the Convention in 1953. Following a proposal by Ireland at the Vienna Summit and the subsequent unanimous agreement of member states, Protocol 11 will make it a permanent and mandatory requirement for contracting states to accept the right of individuals to petition the new court directly.  This general acceptance renders the two-tier structure obsolete and, in recognition of this, the structure which Protocol 11 will bring about will &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo; the system.</P>
    <P>The court will consist, as at present, of a number of judges equal to that of the states parties to the Convention.  Each state will nominate three candidates one of whom will be elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe; there is no change in this process.  The members of the court will be elected for a period of six years as opposed to nine years under the present system and can be re-elected. A judge must retire on reaching the age of 70.</P>
    <P>The new Court will exercise the same filtering function as that currently performed by the Commission and will assume the existing Commission's role of establishing the facts with the co-operation of the parties.  It may sit in Committees of three judges to determine the admissibility of cases, in Chambers of seven judges to examine the merits of an application and in a Grand Chamber of 17 judges where a case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation of the Convention or where the resolution of a question might have a result inconsistent with a previous decision.  Inter-State applications will be dealt with initially by a Chamber of seven judges and may be re-examined by the Grand Chamber.</P>
    <P>The President of the Court, the Vice-Presidents and the Presidents of the Chambers will be members of the Grand Chamber.  The judge elected in respect of the State against which the application has been lodged shall sit as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Grand Chamber.</P>
    <P>The admissibility criteria remain unchanged under the new system.  For example, applications will continue to be declared inadmissible where domestic remedies have not been exhausted or the application is out of date.  The procedure before the new court will be written and oral, as is the case under the present system, unless otherwise directed by the court.</P>
    <P>Following the judgment delivered by a chamber of the court, the grand chamber, only at the request of one of the parties to the case and in exceptional circumstances, will be competent to re-examine a case if it raises serious questions concerning the interpretation or application of the convention or an issue of general importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The purpose is to ensure the quality and consistency of the court's case law by allowing for a re-examination of the most important cases if the conditions mentioned have not been met.  A panel of five judges of the grand chamber will decide whether a case is to be accepted for re-examination. This is a departure from the existing procedure where the commission, or the state concerned, has an automatic right to refer to the court a case which has been declared admissible by the commission and where no friendly settlement has been reached.</P>
    <P>The terms of office of the members of the commission and court will terminate as soon as the Protocol enters into force.  This will take place one year after its ratification by all the state parties to the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, members of the commission will continue their work for one year after the entry into force of the Protocol to finalise under the former system, applications which have already been declared admissible by the commission at the date of entry into force. Admissible applications which cannot be completed by the commission during the one year time limit will be examined by the new court under the new system.  Applications pending before the commission which have not been declared admissible at the date of entry into force will also be examined by the new court in accordance with the new system.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Irish member of the court, Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, who, Deputies will recall, made a landmark contribution to Irish constitutional law during his distinguished career on the High and Supreme Courts.  His contribution to the Court of Human Rights has been equally distinguished.  The valuable work of the Irish member of the Human Rights Commission, Ms Jane Liddy, should also be recognised.</P>
    <P>The judgment of the grand chamber will be final.  Judgments of the chambers of seven judges will become final if the cases in which they have been rendered are not brought before the grand chamber.  The new court will, as is the case with the existing court, determine the question of &ldquo;just satisfaction&rdquo;, including that of costs and expenses.  Final judgments of the court will be binding.  The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe will, as at present, continue to supervise their execution.</P>
    <P>It is not considered there will be any change in the financial implications for the State in direct consequence of the ratification of Protocol 11.  As is the case with the existing court, the new court will have power to award &ldquo;just satisfaction&rdquo;&mdash; compensation and costs &mdash; to an applicant if it finds there has been a violation of the convention. The amount of &ldquo;just satisfaction&rdquo; awarded in any given case depends on factors such as the type and complexity of the case and the extent of the loss suffered by the applicant.  Protocol 11 does not provide for any change in the system of &ldquo;just satisfaction&rdquo; already existing under the current <Col N="815" /> arrangements.  An informal working party comprised of past and present members of the court and commission and officials of the Council of Europe Secretariat is examining the practical aspects of setting up the new system, particularly in regard to the transitional period.  Reports on the progress made will be submitted to the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Most of the rights and freedoms protected by the European Convention on Human Rights and its additional Protocols are the same in nature as those protected by the fundamental rights section of the Constitution.  They include rights such as the right to life, respect for private and family life, home and correspondence, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to freedom of expression and the right to the fair administration of justice.  Ireland has always been to the forefront in the defence of these fundamental rights and freedoms.  As one of the first state parties to the convention, Ireland's ratification is necessary for entry into force of this important Protocolumn The convention remains the most advanced regional provision for the protection and promotion of human rights.  It has had a major influence in the development of our national understanding of human rights.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long awaited motion.  We are being asked to approve, by way of motion, the terms of Protocol 11 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms commonly known as the European Convention on Human Rights. This Protocol which is in general terms, an amendment to the convention is the most important reform of the machinery of the European Convention on Human Rights since it first came into force almost half a century ago. The Minister has failed to explain the long delay in bringing the motion before the House to enable us to ratify the Protocol to the convention.</P>
      <P>The Heads of State and Government agreed in the Vienna Declaration of 9 October 1993 that Protocol 11 should be ratified as soon as possible. It was their clear determination to ensure that the enforcement machinery of the Convention on Human Rights should be radically altered to try to deal with the enormous backlog of cases which has built up.  It was agreed by all that extreme urgency was the order of the day.</P>
      <P>The Protocol was signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland on 11 May 1994, the day on which it was adopted and opened for signature. The Protocol cannot enter into force until one year after the date on which it has been ratified by all parties to the convention.  It is essential for Ireland and the few other countries which have not yet ratified the Protocol to get moving and give the Council of Europe a chance to deal with the backlog and delays in the Strasbourg Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was among the first countries to sign the Protocol, yet it has become one of the last <Col N="816" /> countries to ratify it.  As the Minister knows, the political consensus in the House for ratification of the Protocol has never been in doubt.  Why is it that Ireland, which should have been the first to ratify, has ended up among the last to ratify the Protocol?  No country in the Council of Europe is more aware of the European Court and Commission of Human Rights and its problems of backlogs and interminable delays than Ireland. No country has played a greater role in the development of the jurisprudence of the Court of Human Rights or is more committed to ensuring continued and enhanced protection for human rights than Ireland.</P>
    <P>No Member of the House would disagree with these three propositions.  Why, therefore, is Ireland, which should have been first, now among the last of the Council of Europe countries to ratify Protocol 11?  As a result of the Government's delay, Ireland has been held up before Europe as one of the laggards whose failure to act has prevented the introduction of desperately needed and already agreed reform of the institution established by the European Convention on Human Rights.  Members of the House are entitled to an explanation for this sorry and shabby delay, for this lost chance of leadership gone a-begging.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this reform is to effect a radical restructure of the control machinery set in place by the convention.  It is intended that the present structure will be swept away and replaced by a single court which will be permanently located in Strasbourg and which will deal with the work of the present commission and court.  If the convention is ratified by all states and enters into force it will greatly simplify the processing of complaints made against states under the convention.  The need for this simplification springs from the extraordinary success of the Court and Commission of Human Rights.  The court has now become a victim of its own success &mdash; it is flooded with cases and is likely to experience an even greater upsurge in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Fourteen states, including Ireland, signed the convention in 1950.  As of 1 July last there were 33 contracting states, while six states had signed, subject to ratification.  The convention now spreads its protection from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals.  The present structure has been in operation for almost 40 years.  While there is a permanent secretariat in Strasbourg the court and commission are part time institutions.  This is so despite the extraordinary increase in the workload of the court and commission over the past 40 years.  During its first 18 years of operation the court delivered 26 judgments while it delivered 472 judgments during the second 18 years.  In 1995 it delivered 55 judgments.  In 1975 335 applications were registered with the Commission of Human Rights, while in 1995 3,481 applications were registered.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware of the vast range of matters which have come before the court and <Col N="817" /> commission &mdash; the right to life; torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; corporal punishment in schools or as a judicial punishment; the rights of psychiatric patients; length of judicial proceedings; the legal status of children born outside marriage; the law on homosexual activities; freedom of expression, including the freedom of the press and the freedom of artistic creation; freedom to engage in trade union activities; property rights etc.</P>
    <P>This enormous growth in activity has clearly overburdened the court and on its own would warrant a radical restructuring in Strasbourg. However, added to this has been the enormous increase from 14 to 33 in the number of contracting states as of 1 July last.  Every state that joins is a new source of case work for the court and commission.  The present system in Strasbourg cannot survive much longer.  This is all the more reason the Government should be ashamed for delaying so long in bringing this vital reform before the House.</P>
    <P>At present a person applying to have a complaint heard by the Commission of Human Rights must wait five years from the date of lodging that complaint for a date for a final judgment by the Court of Human Rights, if the matter goes that far.  The European Convention on Human Rights requires that all persons should have a hearing within a reasonable time.  Nobody could claim a five year delay is reasonable.  It is unacceptable that the Court and the Commission of Human Rights fail to comply with the Convention's requirements.  Far from getting better, if radical action such as that proposed by Protocol 11, is not taken quickly, the system will collapse.  Respect for, and confidence in the system carefully built up over the past 40 years is likely to disappear.</P>
    <P>The current system provides for two structures in Strasbourg.  The first structure is the Commission of Human Rights.  In general terms it decides if a case is admissible and presents an opinion on the case.  If the case is not subsequently settled it will usually proceed to the Court of Human Rights.  By the time applicants have their cases concluded in the Court of Human Rights they will have had two hearings &mdash; one in the Commission of Human Rights and another in the court.  There is a general view, with which I agree, that this creates unnecessary duplication and that an essential part of any reform must be the abolition of this duplication.</P>
    <P>The Protocol, if and when it comes into operation, will provide for necessary restructuring in the system.  The existing Commission and Court of Human Rights will disappear.  It is intended their functions will be taken over by a new permanent court which will continue to be situated in Strasbourg.  Thus, the proposed human rights monitoring machinery will comprise a single structure, the new European Court of Human Rights.  Unlike the present court and Commission, the new court will operate on a full-time basis.  We hope the new <Col N="818" /> system will be able to deal more efficiently with the heavy workload than the existing two-tier system.  To do so it will be necessary for the working system of the new court to be carefully designed to ensure that cases are dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible, but that will not happen of its own accord.  If the Government's sloppy handling of Ireland's ratification is anything to go by, it will have little input into this important aspect of the new system.  I hope the Minister accords the highest priority possible to ensuring that streamlined procedures are introduced so that when the new system comes on stream it will realise all our hopes for the continued efficient processing of these important cases.</P>
    <P>It is hoped the ratification process will be completed some time in the coming year.  One year later the Protocol will enter into force.  I understand by then there will be approximately 40 contracting states to the Convention.  Under the new system, as with the old, one judge will be elected in respect of each contracting state.  This should ensure a sufficiently large pool of judicial personnel to allow a number of courts sit at the same time.  We have seen how our Supreme Court system has developed, we regularly have two Supreme Courts sitting at the same time.  I hope our experience in this regard, in so far as it can be helpful to the Council of Europe, will be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, no country in the Council of Europe has been more committed to the Human Rights system than Ireland.  Members of this House and of the public will be aware of the small but important number of cases involving this country in which important human rights have been established, not just for the people of this country, but for the Council of Europe.  We are justifiably proud of the fine contribution made by Irish people to the development of this great human rights structure. For many years our distinguished jurist, Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, has represented this country with great distinction on the Court of Human Rights and continues to do so.  Irish officials have played a distinguished role in negotiation of this complex Protocol and we are entitled to be proud of their achievements.  I join the Minister in paying tribute to Ms Jane Liddy for her work in this area.  It is regrettable that the Minister was unable to bring the Protocol before the Dáil for approval earlier, not two and a half years late.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the reform of the Strasbourg system, I sound a warning note about the possibly over-optimistic hopes for its effectiveness.  The new single court will have to do the work of the previous court and commission combined.  It will have to work its way through an enormous backlog and deal with the vastly increased number of member states, each one with its individual reservoir of cases.  It will have to deal with new member states, many of them from former Iron Curtain countries, almost all of which <Col N="819" /> recently joined the Council of Europe or are expected to do so shortly.  For historical reasons, those countries have little or no effective system on which individuals can rely for the protection of their human rights.  Their expectations for the Convention on Human Rights are naturally great, but with the best will in the world it will take many years before their legislative structures are in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is to be expected, therefore, that many cases will arise from those countries.  If that is the case, the number of cases arising on a pro rata basis will be far in excess of previous numbers.  This will result in an even bigger backlog.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge member states of the Council of Europe to bear in mind that this new system, while undoubtedly an improvement, is unlikely to be the panacea for all their problems.  I note a tendency in recent years to develop further areas of responsibility for the court.  I urge Ireland's fellow members to resist this temptation, at least for the present.  We cannot afford to overload the new court to the extent that it will be incapable of performing the functions accorded to it so as to provide a hearing for applicants within a reasonbale time in accordance with article 6 of the Convention.  The new structure must not fail. It must be given time to deal with the enormous workload it will inherit and to work out its own procedures so that the legacy of the first 40 years is carried through to the new system and that in the 21st century the member states of the Council of Europe can erect a shining beacon of respect for human rights to light Europe and the world beyond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  It is regrettable that it is more than two and a half years since Ireland signed the Protocol.  We are entitled to an explanation as to why it has taken so long to bring it before the House.  As I am sure Members will not vote against it, it is not likely to be defeated.  The Minister made a useless speech, it is a précis of the explanatory report to the Protocol provided by the Council of Europe. It contained nothing that is not in the report we have already read.  There is no point in the Minister coming in here to give a shortened version of what we already know.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not come in to take the motion.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform dealt with it, but he has now left the House and I presume will not reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>We should be told who has ratified the Protocol.  I gather the majority of member states have done so.  If those who have not are having difficulties with its ratification we should be told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should also give its view on the position of some of the more recent member states of the Council of Europe and signatories to the Convention on Human Rights.  Due to the undemocratic background from which many of <Col N="820" /> those countries have happily emerged, their judicial and penal systems leave a great deal to be desired and are not in accord with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I have in mind, in particular, the judicial and penal systems in Russia, which are quite appalling.  People are kept in custody there, often for many years, before they are tried and it is not unusual for defendants to die in custody because of the conditions in which they are kept. The Russian authorities agree the conditions are intolerable, but say they have no money to improve them.  I thought there would be a huge rush of applications from citizens of some eastern European countries to the court, but I do not know if it will be able to hear them because of the requirement that all domestic remedies must first be exhausted.  It is impossible to exhaust domestic remedies in some of those countries because one cannot get a domestic remedy in them.  How do people in those countries stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> the court?</P>
    <P>On reading the Protocol, it appears totally to recast the convention.  If it recasts it totally and fundamentally, certainly in so far as the machinery of the convention is concerned, the question arises as to whether a new convention should be adopted.  If that has not been done, we have a Protocol which repeals parts of the convention, repeals several of the existing Protocols and amends much of the convention. Towards the end of the explanatory report there is a somewhat convoluted explanation as to why this is being done by way of a Protocol rather than by way of a new convention, namely, to avoid an apparent overlap in jurisdictions which would otherwise arise.  That should be spelt out more clearly because we now have a new document rather than the original document of 1953.</P>
    <P>Getting rid of the commission and having one institution where there were previously two may, on the face of it, appear a rationalising move, but what is proposed here in terms of the grand chamber, the chambers and the committees is so complex that it will not necessarily save any time. The length of time taken in dealing with an application to the court, which is fully considered, is extraordinarily long.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 21 on page 22 of the explanatory report states that it takes on average over five years for a case to be finally determined by the court under the present circumstances.  A long list of procedural requirements is set out in the outline of procedure in paragraph 52 on page 26 of the explanatory report, which surely cannot be any shorter than the present system.  It is very important that only in the most exceptional cases a normal application should go to the grand chamber.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested in his speech that any one of the parties can request a hearing by the grand chamber after a decision by the chamber which heard the case.  If that were so, the grand chamber would effectively be simply a court of <Col N="821" /> appeal from individual chambers.  That would be very undersirable except in exceptional cases because of the lengthy delay it would virtually perpetuate.</P>
    <P>The explanatory report differs from the Minister's speech.  Paragraph 46 on page 25 of the explanatory report states that only the parties may request that the case be referred to the grand chamber for a rehearing.  That suggests that both parties must request it.  Which version is correct? This is one of the few places the Minister's speech deviates from what is set out in the explanatory report.</P>
    <P>The House should bear in mind that if any one member state fails to ratify the convention it appears the Protocol and the new system cannot come into effect.  There are references in the document to all the member states, which are contracting parties to the convention, having to ratify it and the new institution being established 12 months after the last ratification has taken place.  That matter should be clarified because it would be unacceptable if, for example, one member state was able to hold up the whole procedure because of failure to ratify the convention.  None of these matters has been made clear in the Minister's speech and, accordingly, it is necessary to raise them.</P>
    <P>I will move from the detail to the history of the convention, the commission and the court during the past 40 years.  We must all welcome and admire the work of those institutions, express our gratitude for it and the hope that in the years to come they will develop into an even more successful institution.  Its workload will be hugely increased by a combination of the greater complexity of modern life and by the advent of formerly undemocratic states in eastern Europe where the court may well be faced with great difficulties in how it will vindicate human rights, given the inadequacy of some domestic judicial system there.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which the Council of Europe generally and the court must come to terms is the question of the death penalty.  It is still very widely used in a number of eastern European countries and is totally incompatible with the spirit if not the letter of the convention. It should be a prerequisite for member states, which are contracting parties to the convention, to abandon the death penalty as a form of punishment because it will not be appropriate in the Europe of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty will arise in regard to certain Balkan states in the former Yugoslavia.  I do not know how they can operate this convention given the history of what has happened there in recent years and the absence of a satisfactory judicial system in some of those republics.  I do not know, for example, how the Council of Europe proposes to deal with the type of situation that exists in Kosovo where 90 per cent of the population are deprived of their fundamental human rights by a minority of 10 per cent and an adjoining power. The Council of Europe, and the Court, would be <Col N="822" /> better employed in dealing with these fundamental cases of human rights than with some of the exotic matters it has dealt with recently.  On much of this Continent there is a need to vindicate the fundamental right to life and liberty of millions of people.  That is the task the Council of Europe and this court should undertake.  I wish them well in that task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are approving, although late, the terms of this convention.  I do not understand why ther has been a delay of up to two and a half years on this. Perhaps we are rushing to debate it because the European Council is coming up.</P>
      <P>A discussion on a Council of Europe convention is welcome.  As a member of the Council of Europe, I found very little discussion in the Dáil of the various conventions signed and ratified in Europe.  For example, there are conventions relating to minority languages which have been in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for some years.  There has also been a convention on regional development and there has been no action to sign up to or ratify any of them.  The Minister of State made one point with which I agree, that European citizens are only now getting to know about the Council of Europe, the convention on human rights and the court because of the large number of countries which have recently joined the Council.</P>
      <P>When I was on the Council of Europe in the early 1990s, many Eastern European countries joined.  I have not had as distinguished a record there as the Acting Chairman but he will recall his involvement in the applications of those countries.  There is an interesting device in the Council of Europe in relation to giving these countries &ldquo;guest&rdquo; status.  If a country did not abide by the laws on pluralist democracy or the protection and promotion of fundamental principles of human rights and the rule of law, it would never get full membership of the Council of Europe.  Examples are the death penalty, mistreatment of minorities or educational discrimination against minority languages.  That has always been one of the principles of the Council of Europe and that &ldquo;guest&rdquo; status has always been very important in having countries ratify and comply with conventions.</P>
      <P>I was on a committee that dealt with European non-member states.  The committee was about to be abolished because every country in Eastern Europe had joined.  However, many of those that had joined had not complied with the ratification into which they had entered and the committee was not abolished because it was mandated to see if countries were complying on human rights, pluralist democracies and freedoms for minorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question of rationalisation when discussing the court which might be welcome. There is also a worry because of the backlog of cases but it looks as if those cases will be dealt with.  I join Deputy Ray Burke in paying tribute <Col N="823" /> to Mr. Justice Brian Walsh and the Irish member of the Human Rights Commission, Jane Liddy. Debate on this convention, Protocol 11, is welcome but I hope that we will have further opportunity to discuss other conventions that are lying in certain Ministers' Departments.  We will be told there is no time in the House but there are Oireachtas Joint Committees on European and Foreign Affairs.  It would be worthwhile if those committees could discuss these conventions.  It would also give an opportunity to our members on the Council of Europe &mdash; we have four members and four substitute members &mdash; to take part in these debates, whether in committee or in the House.  I welcome the debate and hope it will improve the situation in the court, especially the backlog of cases.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  There has been no unreasonable delay by Ireland in ratifying the Protocol.  To date, just over half the ratifications required for the Protocol to enter into force have taken place. The practical steps for implementation of the changes brought about by the Protocol need careful study and are still being considered by a working party made up of past and present members of the court, he commission and the Council of Europe secretariat.</P>
      <P>Those familiar with the system will realise it will take time to put the machinery into place. Deputy O'Malley asked for specific numbers of countries that have now ratified the Protocol; 40 countries have signed the Protocol, 24 have ratified it and 16 have not ratified it.  Of that 16, ten are states that are all required to do so before the Protocol.</P>
      <P>The length of time required by the present organs of the convention to rule on application is considered to be excessive.  It is particularly embarrassing for the credibility of a control mechanism whose task includes monitoring the requirements that judgments are delivered in a reasonable time, as enshrined in Article 6 of the convention.  On average, cases take four to six year to be completed from the time they are first lodged to the final judgment of the court.  Over 90 per cent of cases are judged inadmissible and those take, on average, over 1 months to the completed.  In 1991, the number of new applications was almost equalled by the number of applications disposed of.  There were 1,648 cases registered and 1,620 disposed of.  Owing to the rise in cases, more recent statistics show a widening gap between the cases registered and those disposed of.  In 1995, the gap was 3,481 cases registered compared with 2,916 cases disposed of.  All indications are that this trend will continue if remedial action is not taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is impossible to make bold predictions, Protocol 11, providing an institutional unification of both the control organs and their secretariats, <Col N="824" /> should help to achieve a reduction in the length of time in procedures but there is no guarantee. The permanent nature of the new court is the same.  The judges must refrain from any activities incompatible with the demands of full-time office. The terms and conditions of employment of the judges of the new court remain to be decided by the member tates of the Council of Europe.  As I said earlier, the procedure for the nomination and election of judges to the new court will be the same as that for the present court, judges will be elected by the parliamentary assembly from a list of three candidates nominated by each contracting partner.  It would be premature to enter discussion on this matter.</P>
    <P>At present there are no cases against this State before the court.  There are five cases pending before the Commission of which the Government is aware.  The convention article No. 33 stipulates that the Commission shall meet <i>in camera.</i> Because of the confidentiality of proceedings before the Commission I cannot provide details of the cases in question.  With the exception of one case that has been declared admissible and in which the possibility of a friendly settlement is being pursued, the other four cases are at relatively early stages.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that the terms of Protocol 11 will give rise to an increase in the number of cases brought against the State as they do not add any new rights to the convention or alter the existing criteria for the admissibility of cases.  It is not possible to say whether the anticipated shortening of the length of time it takes to process an application under the convention will, of itself, give rise to an increase in the number of cases against the State.</P>
    <P>In recent years Ireland has made further progress in ensuring the protection of human rights guaranteed by the convention by ratifying three important Protocols, namely, Protocols 6, 9 and 10.  Protocol 6 abolishes the death penalty in peacetime.  Protocol 9 gives an individual the right to refer a case which has been declared inadmissible by the commission to the court in certain circumstances.  Protocol 10, when it enters into force, will allow for an easier decision-making process by the committee of Ministers in cases referred to it under Article 32 of the convention.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to begin the necessary consultation process with the relevant Departments aimed at the eventual ratification of Protocol 7 as soon as possible after Protocol 11 has been ratified.  Protocol 7 adds a number of new substantive rights to the convention covering such matters as the rights of aliens, aspects of criminal law and equality of spouses.</P>
    <P>In the broader context of its mission to defend human rights, parliamentary democracy and the rule of law, the Council of Europe, since 1989, has assumed a crucial role.  It acts as the political anchor and human rights watchdog for Europe. This involves assisting the countries of central <Col N="825" /> and eastern Europe in carrying out and consolidating political, legal and constitutional reform in parallel with economic reform.</P>
    <P>The entry into force of the Protocols is becoming urgent with the recent surge in the number of accessions to the Council of Europe which now has 40 members.  To serve the interests of the peoples of what is now a pan-European organisation in the best way, new control machinery is necessary for the convention which was originally conceived for ten or 12 member states.  The Protocols have been signed by all of the state parties to the convention and ratified by 22 of the 32 state parties.  It is hoped ratification by Ireland will encourage the remaining state parties to complete their procedures so that this new important mechanism can be put in place and become fully operational.</P>

    <Title>Universities Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last week I referred to one of the central problems in the universities sector, the difficulties encountered by students from deprived socio-economic backgrounds in gaining access to third level.  This is borne out by figures produced by the Minister recently.  Between 1982 and 1992 the proportion of students who proceed to college increased from 20 per cent to 36 per cent.  While the proportion of students from the higher professional class increased from 67 per cent to 89 per cent, the proportion of students from the unskilled-manual work class increased from 3 per cent to 13 per cent.  This remains the most fundamental problem the House has to deal with.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, the Minister adopted sensible policies under which resources will be targeted at first and second level to bring about change and break the cycle of inequality in terms of access to third level education.  Last week at Dublin City University, which is located in my constituency, she launched the north Dublin access programme which I welcome.  I have criticised the university in the past for not maintaining close links and a close relationship with surrounding areas which have a population of between 300,000 and 400,000.  They include some of the most deprived areas and worst unemployment blackspots in the country. This issue had to be addressed.  I pay tribute to the Minister and the university, therefore, for inaugurating this programme under which 14 second level schools in the Coolock, Darndale, Finglas, Cabra and Ballymun areas will be designated as feeder schools.  All of these schools have already been designated as disadvantaged and are located in the Northside, Ballymun and Finglas Partnership areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> The university has made a number of changes in its organisational structure.  It appointed an access officer, established a summer school and provides tours of the university to improve access for students from poorer sections of the community in which there is little or no tradition of pupils proceeding to third level.</P>
    <P>The university has introduced a direct entry scheme to give a second chance to those who, because of various drawbacks and disadvantages, did not proceed to third level having completed second level.  This scheme, which I welcome, should be extended to the six other universities.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for the work she has done during the past four years.  Her decision to abolish third level fees will long be remembered, particularly by working parents who found the cost of sending their children to college a severe burden.  The idea of proceeding to third level is beginning to permeate through deprived housing estates in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I congradulate the Minister for increasing the maintenance grant by 5 per cent this year. Students studying abroad are to be assisted under the mutual Higher Education Authority scheme. Despite this, recent studies which have been discussed in the House, show that students in urban areas are grossly discriminated against under the maintenance grant scheme in that the family income limits appear to offer more flexibility to the self-employed and those from a farming background.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for taking these welcome initiatives to improve access to third level which remains the central problem in the university sector.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to bring another scheme to the Minister's attention.  It was presented to her the day she launched the Breaking the Cycle scheme in Darndale national school, which is in my constituency.  The Northside Partnership, which covers the Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central constituencies, has piloted a third level maintenance scheme in Coolock, Kilbarrack, Donaghmede, Edenmore, Baldoyle, Artane and Killester.  It includes areas with the lowest access rate to third level education.  Dublin 17, for example, has an access rate of only 10 per cent while Dublin 6 has a 70 per cent plus access rate.  Many rural areas have an 85 to 90 per cent access rate.</P>
    <P>The Northside Partnership inaugurated this higher education support scheme in the past two years.  It has assisted over 100 students from these deprived areas at a cost of approximately £60,000, averaging £600 per student.  The students admitted to the scheme were not given direct funding but their books, travel, secretarial and other necessary student costs were met by the Northside Partnership.  In the current academic year, it will spend approximately £80,000 on the scheme.  Recently a study of the scheme was prepared by Ms Phyllis Murphy called &ldquo;Higher Education: Dream or Reality&rdquo;.  The Minister got a copy of the study a couple of months ago on the <Col N="827" /> announcement of the Breaking the Cycle scheme. She will be aware of the cost benefit analysis contained in the study which shows how valuable the scheme is.</P>
    <P>Those on the north side of Dublin believe this is another valuable initiative.  Perhaps the Department of Education and the Department of Enterprise and Employment might look at the scheme with a view to funding future partnership allocations.  Indeed, it might be extended throughout the country.  As I have done many times in the House, I commend the Northside Partnership on such a remarkable and farsighted initiative.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill, there are genuine fears in relation to governance and visitation.  The Minister will respond generously to some of the fears expressed, although in some cases there was widespread hysteria which was not merited.  Our universities have a great tradition as unique bastions of research and cultural freedom dating back over a number of centuries.  It is important to get the structures in relation to governance and accountability right.  The Minister is prepared to consider comments and reasonable requests.  The Bill will enable the seven great universities to continue their fine role in our educational system. I would like to see all the universities, particularly TCD and DCU which are surrounded by areas of great deprivation, making an effort to involve young people who live within a stone's throw of their campuses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for reserving places in third level institutions for students from deprived backgrounds.  It is an extremely progressive step which should be encouraged.  Although this operates on a pilot basis in Dublin, the Minister should look at other deprived areas so that we will ensure the maximum number from such areas can avail of third level education.  It may be downhill all the way from here, but it is important the House recognises something constructive which will give young people opportunities.  I am <i>ad idem</i> with the Minister on this matter but, unfortunately, our paths diverge on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Any examination of the Bill would suggest it smacks of the Labour Party ethos.  Everything and anyone provided for in this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must conform to the general norm that we trust nobody but ourselves. The Bill seeks to nullify intellectual and academic freedom.  It also seeks to nullify the independence of the universities, which is its very purpose.  It placed strictures on the terms and tenure of employment of the staff of the universities.  It is extraordinary that the Minister has given enormous powers to the Higher Education Authority which has advised her that it does not <Col N="828" /> want them, that they are unnecessary and will lead to inordinate levels of bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>The Bill could have given an independent status to the universities and have allowed them to develop their individual ethos, culture and international standing.  It is appropriate when discussing such a Bill to pay tribute to the progress made in third level education and the international standing of our students, professors and lecturers.  We can hold our heads high on the level of achievement from these bastions of education.  I assure the Minister that what she proposes is destined to give us a &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; system comparable to that introduced in the UK in the 1970s which has not served that country well.</P>
      <P>The university sector does not object to accepting responsibilities and being accountable. The management and staff of the universities would welcome such initiatives.  If the Bill was directed in that way, they would welcome it with open arms.  They would agree with the maxim promoted by the Government but which it has failed to deliver, that is, openness, transparency, accountability and, latterly, credibility.  The Bill demonstrates an out moded way of thinking which would hinder the development of any organisation to enable it to compete internationally and, therefore, it negates the objectives set out when it was introduced.</P>
      <P>The key asset of any organisation is its people. The question arising within organisations, whether business organisations or educational institutions, is how do we give people scope.  How do we get the best from people so that they contribute to the best of their endeavours for the betterment of the organisation?</P>
      <P>University management and staff are happy to be measured on results and performance and at the end of the day on the outcome.  The provisions in this Bill, however, are totally out of line with the strategic management initiative espoused within the Civil Service.  The Minister is going against that initiative.  Surely she recognises that the Bill is incongruous and does not stand up to scrutiny.  She and her officials should consider the Bill side by side with what is promised and what it is hoped to achieve under the strategic management initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with the Bill is that it has been a long time in gestation.  It has been lumbering for such a long time that when it has finally arrived at the station it is off the tracks.  The provisions were spawned in what I would term a &ldquo;controlled era&rdquo;.  Any reading of the Bill lends one to that conclusion.  I am surprised that an excellent concept signalled by the Minister as being part and parcel of the Bill has disappeared.  The Minister said that it would be easier for people outside the university system to become president of a university, but there is no mention of that in the Bill.  If it was such a good concept a short time ago surely there is still justification for it.  I can only presume the Minister has been compromised <Col N="829" /> in some way by existing presidents who prevailed on her to remove that provision from the Bill, but that is a mistake.  When introducing amendments she should consider reinserting that provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill will transfer resources from research and development to delivering reports.  This country is so full of reports lying on shelves and gathering dust that the last thing we want in the late 1990s is another Bill that will ensure we have more reports.  That is not an objective of the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>Any examination of the remit will show that the NUI has been, by and large, removed, yet it continues in existence at a cost to the State of £1 million gross per year.  That is not logical or cost effective and is not an efficient way of operating. Suffice to say that if the NUI does not have a meaningful role, in the form proposed by the Minister, it will have no purpose.  It is proposed that four universities out of seven will be placed in a subsidiary position.  They will be involved in meetings of the NUI, heads of universities, rectors and various Government Departments. Where is the cohesion, efficiency, effectiveness and unity of purpose in that?  All those meetings will lead to bureaucracy, confusion and obfuscation, not to efficiency of management which, presumably, the Minister desires.  The system will become a maze of in decision and inactivity.</P>
    <P>In a letter to the staff of universities, who were concerned about their position, the Minister indicated that their conditions cannot be worsened.  I presume, therefore, the generous provisions for professors regarding pay, tenure and allowances cannot be changed.  The Minister probably would have interfered with the conditions of service of staff members were it not for the fact that when she checked the legalities of the proposals in the Bill as presented she found she would be contravening the constitutional property rights of individuals.  She therefore indicated that she will make amendments in this area, and I welcome that, but she retains a role in the administration of pensions of staff members.  I and others ask why she has done that.  Is it necessary?  If we look at the position of other groupings, staff members pay into a pension fund and each pension fund puts in place specialists to examine the investment and the return.  In the event that groups oversee the investment and return on pensions, why does the Minister have to intrude?  That is unnecessary.  It is adding a further layer of bureaucracy and is absolute madness.</P>
    <P>The Bill smacks of too many &ldquo;try-ons&rdquo; and is incoherent.  Fianna Fáil believes that it cannot be amended sufficiently because the base upon which it is founded is false and erroneous.  It is without the type of foundation that is proper and necessary for such legislation.  When we get back into Government we will repeal the Bill because the necessary amendments cannot be made to make it a workable entity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> The Minister was very careful to take care of existing presidents and inserted provisions to protect them, but she has not done so for the staff.  They wonder why she is so selective in giving special regard to the presidents of the various universities while she does not have the same regard for them.  She has been influenced by ad hockery and special interests.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is no educational direction in the Bill that will further enhance the international standing of our universities.  I want to ask the Minister a pertinent question.  Why is Trinity College getting a private Bill of its own? The word in Cork is that University College Cork will not be worth a full shilling when the Trinity College Bill goes through this House.  The grapevine has it that nothing will happen to Trinity College as a result of the Bill. Amendments will be made here and there but when the Bill goes through the House, it will be seen that the forces working in the background have ensured that nothing will change in Trinity College.  I pay special tribute to the Provost of Trinity College who stood up to the Minister on this issue, and the Minister backed down.</P>
    <P>We must have a level playing pitch in these matter and it would be in the best interests of everybody if this Bill was introduced in conjunction with a Trinity College Bill.  In that way we could compare like with like and be assured that no &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deals were being negotiated for Trinity College over and above the other colleges.  The people in the other universities have serious reservations that both these Bills can be taken together.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the regional technical college Bill she was anxious to ensure that the colleges remained independent.  It is extraordinary that that lack of consistency, ranging form the third level technological sector to the university sector, has not continued.  For instance, if the Minister thought it was a good idea that the regional technical colleges remain independent, why did she not reach the conclusion that it would be equally consistent for the universities to remain independent, rather than lumping four of them under an NUI that should be taken out of the system?</P>
    <P>Rumour has it that the real reason for keeping these universities together is the Irish dimension. Irish will be a necessary qualification for entry to the NUI universities, but two science subjects will be adequate for Trinity College.  We have spoken about equality, but can the Minister not see that certain students will be at a distinct disadvantage because of the rules and regulations she is imposing on the various universities?  Is that progressive?  I do not think it is.  The £1 million the Minister would save by dispensing with the NUI in the form she proposes could be put into the development of the Irish language in the entire university sector.  That would be welcome but I am certain that what is being done here will discriminate against certain students because of the universities they attend. <Col N="831" /> I want to refer to the number of people who avail of second chance education.  Many housewives want to go back to university.  This is a new phenomenon and it is an area to which the Minister will have to give serious consideration because mature students need some type of funding.  The Minister should extend the grants scheme to facilitate such students where possible and if she does that, I will laud her in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and for her excellent work.  She is a hard-working, dedicated, far-seeing Minister who has restored confidence in the education system.  Teachers and pupils can have every confidence that the guidelines she is setting down will bring us into the next century and give our young people an opportunity not only to get a good education but meaningful employment, which is all important.</P>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the Bill in so far as it goes but, regrettably, it does not go far enough.  The Minister is propagating the class distinction that exists between the universities and the Dublin Institute of Technologys.  Why were the Dublin Institute of Technologys excluded form the Bill?  Their exclusion highlights the non recognition of the contribution the Dublin Institute of Technologys have made to education for many years.  The blue collar jobs come from the Dublin Institute of Technologys but there is an attitude that only certain types of students attend them.  The same distinction was drawn in regard to the vocational education committees by foolish parents over many years. Some people believed that only students from certain family income groups attended vocational education committees and, unfortunately, that view existed for far too long.</P>
      <P>It was many years before parents concerned about their children getting a proper education realised that the vocational education committees offered a wider range of practical subjects.  These included woodwork and mechanical drawing for boys and cookery and pre-nursing classed for girls.  The vocational education committees are now bursting at the seams with students and others are clamouring to attend them because they provide opportunities for students to make up their own minds about what they want to do in life.  There is now competition from the colleges which have broadened the range of subjects they provide, but that is being done on a level playing pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third level sector a major distinction is drawn between attending university and the Dublin Institute of Technologys.  Parents who previously wanted their children to become lawyers, doctors or accountants now see industry as offering them the best opportunities.  The real money is to be made in industry but those jobs are only attainable with the qualifications that can be obtained in places like Bolton Street, Kevin Street and the other Dublin Institute of <Col N="832" /> Technologys.  Unfortunately, no recognition is given to that in this Bill.  The Dublin Institute of Technologys are regarded as places where children who are not academically minded attend. That is wrong.  Recognition should be given to the qualifications that can be obtained in these institutions whether in regard to the construction, electronics or computer industry in which major job creation is currently taking place.  I cannot understand why we do not recognise these qualifications.  They may not be totally academic but the skills are needed.  The courses are broad-ranging and demand much time, effort and study. The perception that attendance at a Dublin Institute of Technology college does not convey the same status as attending a university is wrong.</P>
    <P>I recognise the role of the universities.  The National Institutes for Higher Education were excellent fora of education.  The one on the north side of Dublin was recently raised to the status of Dublin City University and rightly so.  Many thousands of students achieved excellent qualifications and secured wonderful employment with NIHE qualifications.  That it was given university status did not change that, but it was a recognition by the State of what had been achieved.</P>
    <P>I recall when one had to get a special dispensation to attend Trinity College.  Now children of all religious beliefs can attend without question.  That is a step forward.</P>
    <P>Maynooth College is growing fast and will receive university status.  It has location, spaces and is accessible from places such as Lucan.  It will be less costly to keep students from the country in Maynooth than in Dublin city where accommodation is extremely costly and difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can explain why the Dublin Institute of Technology is excluded from this Bill and is not given recognition.  We must move away from creating categories such as white collar and blue collar jobs and class distinction, by giving the Dublin Institute of Technology recognition.  The construction industry and all its component parts and the computer business for which we are becoming renowned are based on graduates from the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Thousands of young people employed in Intel in Leixlip are highly skilled and qualified and come from the institutes of technology such as Bolton Street and Kevin Street.  Companies are clamouring to employ these graduates whose qualifications are not full university qualifications but are equal to and as important as those of a barrister, solicitor or doctor.  These colleges should be given the recognition so richly deserved.  The distinction between universities and the Dublin Institute of Technology should cease.  They should all be brought under the one umbrella so that people will get recognition and their degrees will carry the same weight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> The Minister might take note that, for the self-employed, farmers and business people, the income limit for maintenance grants is not realistic and is totally out of line with modern day costs.  While I appreciate that fees have been abolished, it is extremely costly for young people from the country to take digs in Dublin.  I do not want to go into the detail because the Minister will know it.  The income limits are far from satisfactory and are a source of complaint.  A child should not be disadvantaged because he or she happens to live a distance from third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I was annoyed at the Minister's assertion that &ldquo;We are extremely fortunate to have such a diversity of university institutions&rdquo;.  It would have been far better to have said we are extremely fortunate to have such a diversity of third level institutions.  The Minister can compliment each Dublin Institute of Technology college on the work they do but she should offer them some light at the end of the tunnel and include them, if not in this Bill, then in the immediate future. Amendments have been tabled relating to Trinity College and Limerick University and we might have to do something to ensure the Dublin Institute of Technology will be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on the case made by the Dublin Institute of Technologys.  I admire the role they play in education and the bigger role they play in our economic development.  In the professional areas, the Dublin Institute of Technology plays a substantial role whether it be in architecture, electronics, science, business studies, law, hotel management, marketing and design or music.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has a major role to play and has been developing it in recent times.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say in response to Deputy Boylan's points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that there be clarity in the Minister's thinking and direction when it comes to policies.  That is not evident in this Bill.  The Minister has consulted widely on a number of issues during her tenure, has operated on the basis of consensus and consultation and has come up with some policies which I would be the first to say were aimed in the right direction.  In this case, it does not give me any pleasure to say that never in the history of education has a Minister for Education demonstrated such muddled thinking, confusion and lack of vision as she has shown in bringing forward this legislation.  There is much interest in this Bill.  It is not evidenced by the number of people debating it tonight, but the Minister is aware that many of my colleagues and our spokesperson have contributed to the debate. From the time the Minister presented the position paper until she published the Universities Bill, her handling of this issue has been questionable.  I do not make this point lightly.  For example, there has been a considerable change of emphasis between her <Col N="834" /> original position paper referring to the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos and traditions and to academic operational freedom, and the Bill.</P>
    <P>The public reservations she announced recently lead me to believe she should now withdraw the Bill and redraft legislation to deal with the substantive issues on which we all agree.  My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, has made the same point.  I make that point sincerely because there is a build up of frustration for those in the field of education.  The recent communication from the Dublin Institute of Technology is another example of the genuine confusion and lack of clarity.  People want some real direction.  It is a muddled landscape.  It is time to start again and the Minister would do a better job if she did so.  I am convinced the Minister's strategy is to confuse issues by including certain beneficial aspects in the proposed legislation to mask the main thrust of the legislation which is to facilitate political intrusion into the detailed workings of the universities.</P>
    <P>I do, of course, agree that UCC, UCD and UCG, as well as St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, should be established as constituent universities of the National University of Ireland.  The welcome restructuring of the National University of Ireland should have been introduced by way of separate legislation rather than being linked with the proposal for wider administrative changes based on a fundamentally flawed misunderstanding of the nature, role, functions and operating realities of the Irish universities.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I agree with the first of the three stated purposes of the Bill relating to the restructuring of the National University of Ireland.  I regret to say that the second and third of the stated purposes do not stand up to rigorous assessment as to their need.  The Minister should explain to this House in clear and unambiguous terms specifically why she sees the need to provide a revised composition of governing authorities of universities.  Is there something wrong which must be corrected or are there improvements which can be made which would benefit the functioning of the universities for the good of the general community?</P>
    <P>The Bill is seriously defective in that it removes the autonomy of a university, curtails the academic freedom of staff and fails to guarantee the ethos of a university.  It is well established that there are three basic freedoms in any democracy, those being freedom of the press, freedom of the Judiciary and academic freedom.  In removing the latter this legislation strikes at the very heart of our democracy.  It demonstrates the true colours of the Labour Party whose arrogance we have almost come to accept.  This party seems to really believe that they know what is best for all of us. They will not be let away with it on this occasion. The Minister is on the run and we will keep her running until she drops the ball.  She would not be the first prominent member of the Labour Party to drop the ball.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> The Bill omits any reference to the promotion or encouragement of freedom of speech or thought.  In a speech to the Adam Muckiewicz University of Poznan on 24 June 1994 the President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, said:</P>
    <P>It is right that our universities should seek to be relevant to the needs of society.  But what society most needs, whether it realises it or not, is a continuous constructive but critical judgment from within.  So the university and the writer will have to continue to assert the right to stand at a tangent to the rest of society, to take an oblique but engaged view.  In society's own interest we ask for the freedom to be critical in analysis; dispassionate in the search for knowledge but passionate in its defence.</P>
    <P>The Bill has rightly been described as intrusive in that it involves the Minister and the Higher Education Authority in meddling on a day to day basis in the affairs of universities.  Quality assurance in most professional faculties is already guaranteed by visitations from professional bodies for degree recognition and validation.  The Minister wants to put in place a system more akin to that which exists in the UK, a system that is intrusive and expensive, which has in effect reduced the quality of all courses.  What the Minister is proposing can be likened to periodically pulling up a tree to check that the roots are OK.  The Minister's proposals would drastically change the rights of university staff and would override completely existing terms and conditions of service.  All staff are defined as employees who may be suspended or dismissed. The 1908 Act gave academic staff much better protection.  The Minister's suspicious attitude which demonstrates a lack of trust in universities and their objectives is regrettable.</P>
    <P>No provision is made for promotions on merit or any sort of professional advancement but absolute discretion on rigid and artificial staff structures is given to the HEA.  This is currently the <i>de facto</i> situation and has damaged both staff morale and good will.  The Bill should allow the universities to operate a staffing structure based on merit and overall budget constraint on the lines of modern management practices.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that another purpose of the Bill is to provide structures for accountability and transparency in the affairs of universities.  Would the Minister tell us what is wrong that needs to be corrected?  Already, through the Higher Education Authority, the State exercises a very detailed level of control over the universities and other designated institutions.  The Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 includes the following functions of the HEA: the funding of universities and other designated third level institutions; the development of third level education to meet the need of the community; and advising the Minister in relation to all third level education, including <Col N="836" /> that offered outside the Higher Education Authority designated institutions.</P>
    <P>Budgets are approved by the Higher Education Authority for each university and other designated institutions, and accounts are submitted to the Higher Education Authority by each institution.  Operating statistics, development plans and other regular reports are also submitted to the HEA.  The chairperson of the Higher Education Authority is appointed by the Minister for Education on a whole-time basis and there are 18 part time members of the authority.  In addition to all of this, the accounts of the universities are independently audited and, just like the Government Departments, come within the mandate of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Surely there are adequate structures already in place to ensure accountability and transparency in the affairs of universities, or is the Minister suggesting that there is something amiss?  The words &ldquo;openness and transparency&rdquo; are being used as a smokescreen to allow for greater political control and intrusion into the everyday operation of universities.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the wider contribution of the universities in Irish society, including the very significant contribution which they make directly and indirectly to research, enterprise and job creation.  The State grant is allocated each year by the Higher Education Authority to each university on the basis of a unit cost formula, presumably with the objective of achieving greater equity and transparency.  I suggest, however, that there lies the root of the present misunderstanding.  The unit cost mechanism is fundamentally flawed in that it is based only on student contact hours and takes no account of the wider service of the university to the community. The end result is that the grant encourages the maximisation of direct teaching by putting as many students as possible through the system at the lowest direct cost per student.  We need look no further afield than Britain to see that it is not possible to reconcile mass education with scarce funding without a compromise of standards. Different types of teaching institutions are needed to deliver mass third level education and further education on this type of unit cost basis. Those developments are already taking place in Ireland on an excellent and cost effective basis in the regional technical colleges and through the provision of a wide range of post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>It is counterproductive, however, to confuse this issue with the nature, role and functions of universities in relation to their capacity to provide research.  These functions can be categorised as follows: (1) Research and development support for industry; (2) direct job creation through campus companies and otherwise; (3) attraction to inward investment in industry and tourism; (4) global research networking; (5) contributions through representation on Government, EU and OECD committees; (6) enhancement of Ireland's <Col N="837" /> cultural and technological image; (7) participation in the formulation of national development policies; and (8) provision of an independent voice for social change and societal developments.</P>
    <P>Some people mistakenly speak about expenditure on education.  I would remind the House that we should more correctly refer to investment in education.  I suggest that rather than proceed with inappropriate legislation based primarily on misunderstandings, misconceptions and simple lack of knowledge of the facts of higher education, the Minister should proceed separately with legislation which would be to the benefit of the National University of Ireland.  As for the other changes, I fear that we are in grave danger of adversely impacting on the functioning of the universities, demotivating university staff and diminishing many of the excellent, social and economic contributions made by the universities to the general community.  The Minister should consider instead requesting the Higher Education Authority, in detailed dialogue with the universities, to consider and advise her upon any administrative changes which would result in enhancing the outputs of the universities, not only in terms of student numbers, but also under the heading of each of the social and economic functions which I listed earlier.  The Higher Education Authority already has a statutory role to advise on all aspects of the higher education system so that my suggestion does not create any new structures or precedent.</P>
    <P>Since the Universities Bill was published on 30 July 1996 the Minister has wasted much of her time and energy in back tracking and defending her actions.  As a result of her approach to this issue there have been hundreds of letters to the editors of our daily newspapers, discussions on radio and television and debates in universities in which strong opposition to this legislation has been expressed.  I am convinced that if forced through this House it will have a rocky passage through the Seanad.  I am not aware of what discussions are taking place with individuals in that Chamber but it has been signalled clearly by individuals, who represent the universities in that Chamber, that they will have major problems with this legislation.  The concerns of those opposing the Bill are real and coherently expressed.  The time has come for the Minister to start listening.  The only option open to her is to clean the slate and start all over again.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that it will be left to Fianna Fáil in Government to repeal this Bill, when enacted, and introduce legislation to deal with the substantive issues on which we all agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Universities Bill should have been substantive legislation and extremely forward looking.  If it had been so and if it had encompassed the principles originally set out by the Minister, this side of the House would have welcomed it.  We have instead a misconceived Bill which is interventionist in nature, unhelpful and <Col N="838" /> uninformed by the realities of university governance.</P>
      <P>Our universities face a multiple challenge, more than ever they are at the heart of national development and deserve better than these proposals.  The Bill has generated widespread criticism right across the political spectrum from outside as well as from inside our universities. Some of those criticisms are misinformed.  In particular there has been unfounded and unfair criticism of officials in Government Departments. There has also been criticism of the Higher Education Authority which misrepresents the responsibilities of the officials and the Authority in the constructive manner in which they have carried out those responsibilities.  However, many of the criticisms are well founded.  The Minister has sought to take powers that are excessively instrusive, that potentially compromise the integrity and independence of university governance, quite needlessly override the freedom of universities to order their own affairs and call into question the employment status of certain universities staff.  That is unacceptable. The central theme of the Bill is an implied criticism of the standards of accountability in our universities and that criticism is seriously misplaced.</P>
      <P>It is right that all institutions, especially those which are publicly funded, should continually explain the relevance and effectiveness of their governance.  It is surely the case that the universities are well capable of identifying and carrying through such changes themselves.  They have much experience in managing change.  After all they have been doing so for some considerable time, in some instances long before this House was established.  We should trust them to continue to do that.</P>
      <P>There is an absence of trust in the State's dealing with the university system.  That trust has been eroded by the major changes in the content and nature of this legislation since the initial proposals were published.  Trust is now rightly recognised as the central element in the governance of nations.  How can we hope to inculcate and nourish this trust in and governance of society if we do not first recognise the integrity of a major social institution, such as our universities?</P>
      <P>The universities have, in their contribution to society over hundreds of years, carried this trust. Any legislation brought in by this or any Minister for Education should build on that contribution to society, not undermine it, as this Bill does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience as a student and as a graduate of both University College, Galway and University College, Dublin and as a former Minister for Education, has led me to conclude that we can and should trust our university system to oversee and manage the changes, which they are well capable of doing, and lay down the standards of governance themselves.  If legislation is needed for that I and my party would be the <Col N="839" /> first to work with the universities in the public interest to introduce it.</P>
    <P>The Bill has distracted attention from the achievements of our universities and of our regional technical colleges, achievements which are obvious in delivering world class standards in teaching and research to successive generations of students.  Despite serious under-funding, this contribution is now the bedrock of national economic life and the central element of competitive advantage in an increasingly knowledge-driven global economy.  With this, the universities and the regional technical colleges have demonstrated an unstinting commitment to providing access as a means of overcoming social disadvantage.  In fairness successive Governments have made substantial strides in the use of our third level system to overcome social disadvantage.  Myriad programmes, which are not taken into account within the universities funding mechanism, demonstrate that the universities are more socially responsible and open than this legislation would lead one to believe.  The truth is that the public has considerably more confidence in the standards of governance in our universities than the Minister.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in this legislation are so pervasive, deep seated and insidious as to require extensive amendment.  I welcome the Minister's decision, in the face of widespread pressure and criticism, to amend the legislation.  Although it has been forced on her it is, nevertheless, commendable.  There is nothing to be gained by the Government or the Minister in toughing it out and seeking to push through botched legislation. For those reasons the amendments are welcome. A series of <i>ad hoc</i> amendments, however well informed and motivated, brought forward in a panic under public pressure and negotiated behind closed doors is a seriously deficient way of getting university legislation.</P>
    <P>University legislation rarely comes to this House.  Universities are long-term business and, therefore, any legislation should seek to deal with them in that fashion.  For that reason, any amendments should be well thought out and stand the test of time long after this and future Governments have come and gone.  The manner in which the Minister is seeking to reshape this Bill is not the way to do it.  It is too important for our universities, economy and society.</P>
    <P>I suggest the heads of Irish universities, under the chairmanship of the HEA, form a working group on university governance and management and invite suggestions from individuals and representative bodies.  It should examine standards in other countries with a view to avoiding the worst mistakes of others.  It should learn from the best and report in three months. The group's brief should be to provide guidance on systems and procedures of governance which will facilitate, not impose, our universities in continuing to deliver world class standards in <Col N="840" /> teaching and research.  This may require legislation.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues referred to the situation at the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is a cause of great dismay that the Dublin Institute of Technology has not been included in the Bill.  It is evidence of the continued neglect of that institution by the Minister for Education.  In December 1995 the Minister established an international review group which, having assessed the work of the institute, recommended that it be allowed to confer its own degree awards from 1998.  The Dublin Institute of Technology believes this recommendation is an endorsement of its reputation as a leading and progressive educational institution operating at degree and post-graduate level and that this should be acknowledged by elevating its status to that of a university.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology has been contributing to the educational needs of this country since the 19th century and it is widely recognised as being of university standard.  The Minister should make the necessary amendments in the Bill to confer such status.  I introduced the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1992 in the Dáil and at the time I said degree awarding status should be given to the institute within a year or two.  I am still of that opinion.  The commitment I gave on that Government's behalf should have been implemented by its successors and I regret that it has not.  Dublin Institute of Technology has the history, excellence, staff and vision to merit university and degree awarding status.  I recommend that the Minister confer that status.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Minister to bring forward the technical elements of this legislation relating to the status of Maynooth College.  They will be widely supported.  The Minister should also consider the procedure I have suggested as a solid and informed basis for producing the landmark, positive, empowering legislation which universities require and deserve as they face the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take greater interest in research and development in our universities, in co-operation with her colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, by funding and ensuring a greater supply of PhD students in the research area. Valuable research and information has been yielded by such programmes.  The Department of Education and the Department of Enterprise and Employment should augment the funding for PhD students to carry out research on specific projects.  When one considers the price of research in the commercial sector, research in universities is extremely good value.  For a few thousand pounds per year one can secure expert investigation and research on solid and advanced projects while research in multinational firms can cost millions of pounds.  This area represents a good investment and I urge the Minister to see if the Department's role in this regard can be improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> The use and benefit to the nation of campus companies must be acknowledged.  Many of them do tremendous work on small budgets.  They are centres of excellence based on university campuses.  While strict auditing and financial procedures must be applied to such companies, as they should to all Government projects, the network and structure of campus companies should receive more support.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider progressing the concept of a science park in Dublin at a much quicker pace?  A science park is not just another industrial development idea.  It is put forward as a centre of excellence where scientists involved in research can congregate and provide a boost to the scientific and technological infrastructure which is needed to develop industry.  The role universities, regional technical colleges and other third level institutions can play in the development of a science park could be pivotal. The concept should be given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>When the establishment of the IFSC was proposed people assumed it was just another fancy idea that would not work.  I predict that if the concept of a science park is taken seriously in a structured way and if the necessary taxation and investment criteria are laid down, a science park based in Ireland, given our historical love of education and science, could be as successful as the IFSC.  However, it must be viewed as a serious project and supported by political will.  The concept has been suggested for a number of years and if the IFSC had been given the same consideration, the Minister would only now be examining the final report and proposals for its establishment.  In the case of the IFSC, however, the then Taoiseach decided it was important and urgent so it was fast tracked and rapidly established.  The Minister for Education should see if the science park concept can be fast tracked too, because it is extremely important that it be given such treatment.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to my comments, particularly on the intrusive nature of this legislation.  She should consider my proposal that the Higher Education Authority call together the heads of the universities and, within a short timespan, work out amendments that would be satisfactory for the long-term benefit of the universities.</P>
    <P>I also wish to comment on private third level institutions.  Some of them believe they are of university status and that their status should be enshrined in legislation.  Will the Minister give some thought to a clearer strategy for private third level education?  I am aware she is a member of a political party that would not be comfortable with the notion of any institution other than existing public educational institutions taking on the serious business of third level education.  However, in the modern world it will be increasingly expensive and difficult for the State to undertake the entire cost of third level education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> There is no reason private sector third level education cannot coexist with the State sector.  To treat such institutions as second class institutions is not correct.  The correct course is to appreciate the investment and to insist that the standards of such institutions equal the highest international standards of third level education.  The Government can play a leading role in the area of standards.  It is critical that standards in private third level institutions are supervised.  Structures to do that can be put in place if there is the political will to do so.</P>
    <P>There is another thorny issue in this regard which requires a great deal of discussion.  The issue is whether one should grant aid students who attend private third level colleges in the same way as they are grant aided to attend State third level institutions.  Is there a case for only providing financial support if a student goes to a public institution and not providing it if the student goes to a private institution?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider my comments. My central message is &ldquo;hands off the universities&rdquo;.  They have done a fine job for many centuries and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>They do not need this or any Government dabbling in their affairs; they have their integrity, independence and governance ethos.  If the Minister leaves it at that she will see that those universities will serve our nation well in the future.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Appointment of Remedial Teachers: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Minister for Education to appoint even one remedial teacher for the 1996/97 academic year and calls on the Minister to appoint a significant number of additional remedial teachers to schools for the 1997/98 academic year from the demographic dividend that will emerge as a result of falling enrolments.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to highlight the position pertaining to remedial teachers nationwide.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil tabled this motion to highlight the lack of access of primary school children to a proper, comprehensive remedial teaching programme and its purpose is to reveal the inadequate degree of access to the remedial programme of education.  We call on the Minister for Education to appoint additional remedial teachers for the 1997-98 academic year as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our motion and contributions by the various members of the parliamentary party during this debate will expose the myth peddled by the Minister's expensive public relations machine <Col N="843" /> that up to 80 per cent of children have access to remedial teachers.  That is absolute nonsense.</P>
    <P>When one talks to people with direct, on the ground experience one finds that the quality of remedial education for children is very much open to question, as is its quality and means of access to many children.</P>
    <P>I know that, in response to tabling this motion, the Minister issued a rushed press release yesterday announcing an immediate study into remedial education saying she had commissioned the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra to carry out a major study of the State's primary schools' remedial service commencing in January 1997.</P>
    <P>Why, having been in office for four years, has the Minister only now decided to initiate such a comprehensive research study?  Why was it not commissioned at the beginning of her term of office?  Is this not yet another classic case of responding to an issue, by commissioning another study &mdash; which, of course, will take time &mdash; in the hope that a general election may well be called before its completion, letting the Minister off the hook?</P>
    <P>The caseload with which individual remedial teachers have to cope is excessive and militates against the provision of a comprehensive, holistic remedial education programme.  In recent years the Minister has deliberately orchestrated a media campaign to give the impression that the position has improved dramatically.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question she said that access to remedial teachers had increased from about 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  Has anybody questioned the quality of that access?  Will the Minister explain or define for the benefit of Members the nature of this access and what it entails?</P>
    <P>There are approximately 3,203 national schools nationwide, yet only 1,188 remedial teachers have been appointed.  The reality remains that approximately 900 schools do not have the service of a remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>The Minister failed to use the demographic dividend made available this year, from falling enrolments, to appoint additional remedial teachers, with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>I should have said, a Cheann Comhairle, that I wish to share my time with Deputies Hughes and Killeen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the Minister has certainly increased the geographical ground now covered by remedial teachers.  Additional schools have been added to existing ones to create clusters, with additional day schools not served by remedial teachers to date.  In short, the remedial service has been spread more thinly across the board while a fundamental question marks hangs over its quality.  To put it simply, too few teachers <Col N="844" /> are coping with too many pupils within too great a geographical area.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Killeen last year on the remedial education service in County Clare the Minister replied that 63 out of 122 schools in the county had access to remedial teachers whereas 62 schools had no such access to a remedial service. The student population for those who had access was approximately 8,941 and in the 62 schools without any remedial service the school population was 3,494, a pattern replicated throughout rural areas.  In accordance with statistics prepared by the INTO, small rural schools are being continuously discriminated against by the Minister's policy initiatives on remedial education.  Small, rural schools in particular are short of proper remedial education, in some cases the children attending them do not have access to remedial teachers and, in the majority of cases, have very limited access.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the large cluster of schools that have to be served by one remedial teacher. We have had the example of one remedial teacher having to serve anything between four and nine schools.  It is not realistic to suggest that any remedial teacher can adequately service all children in such schools in need of remedial teaching; they are not in a position to give the type of coverage and service required.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 10 per cent of children in any given school are in need of remedial education, a conservative estimate since modern research shows that children can experience a wide variety of difficulties and learning problems in school and that many more now require access to remedial teaching, particularly in their early years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the overall position is not being helped by the appalling state of the schools' psychological service, illustrated by a recent report prepared by IMPACT, which demonstrated that there is no comprehensive schools psychological service.  Without the help of school psychologists, many children are not being identified as being in need of remedial teaching in the first instance and many more await months, even years, for assessment.  A proper psychological service is a prerequisite to an effective remedial education service.  Most teachers to whom one talks consider the present psychological service to be totally inadequate. Very often children are referred to psychologists when a teacher has difficulty in identifying a problem, or when a teacher believes that referral to a special school or class may be the most appropriate for a child with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents often request schools to refer their children for psychological assistance.  Very often psychologists can confirm the opinions of teachers or parents and diagnose the specific nature of an individual child's problem.  However, it is quite clear that entire generations of children with disabilities are being denied access to a proper psychological service.  The Government <Col N="845" /> has made no meaningful effort to provide a nationwide, school-based psychological service. Admittedly, two pilot projects have been established in primary schools in west Dublin and Tipperary, placing very strong emphasis on the prevention of difficulties in addition to case work. From the INTO perspective, the success of these projects was due to the fact that the psychologists appointed had widespread teaching experience. Teachers found that psychologists had a good understanding of the circumstances prevailing in the classroom which was reflected in their approach to assessment, case work, referrals and recommendations for class-room strategies. There is a clear case for the Minister's Department to ensure that psychologists, with primary teaching experience, are appointed to the service.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that last year the Minister reneged on her commitment to appoint additional psychologists to that service.  At the current rate of development, the INTO estimates it will take at least ten years before a comprehensive, school-based psychological service will be established here.  That is totally unsatisfactory for many children for whom the service will come too late.  Clearly, to ensure a proper remedial education provision the schools' psychological service will have to be expanded immediately on a regional basis to provide a comprehensive, school-based service in all primary schools, in tandem with the provision of the necessary support to the remedial schools service.</P>
    <P>Ideally educational psychologists with primary teaching experience should be appointed to such a service, which should have the authority and responsibility to refer pupils to clinical psychologists, counsellors or other support services as required.  The study carried out by IMPACT showed a devastating shortage of school psychologists.  This is a damning indictment of the Minister for Education's lack of commitment to the development of a school psychological service.  This comprehensive study concluded that the majority of pupils have little access to a school psychological service and that 80 per cent of primary school children have had no contact whatsoever with educational psychologists.  This means that many children with difficulties are not identified early enough. As their problems develop these children become demotivated and demoralised.  Some of these children never receive remedial education as they have not been identified as having problems in the first instance.</P>
    <P>By the time these children enter second level education the battle has been lost.  The psychologist-pupil ratio in primary schools which are served by the system is 1:7,500.  The IMPACT study highlights the lack of such a service, particularly in rural areas.  While the school psychological service is worthy of a separate Private Members' motion, I place particular emphasis on it in my contribution because of its <Col N="846" /> fundamental importance in backing up, supplementing and supporting a proper integrated remedial education service.  It is not possible to have one without the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister has engaged very expensive public relations consultants to advance her case in terms of the reform she claims to have introduced in education, particularly for the disadvantaged.  The more teachers and Deputies one talks to the more one realises that the service as it exists is a sham.  This is no reflection on teachers who are doing their best.  However, we ask too much of them and expect them to cover too many schools and to help too many students. We should face up to this reality and do something about it.  The Minister is codding the public and engaging in a cosmetic exercise.  The reality on the ground is very different from that outlined in press releases and in replies to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>A number of remedial teachers have given me examples of typical caseloads.  One teacher in the south-east serves four national schools and has a caseload of 60 pupils.  She states that even though a significant number of pupils are in need of remedial education not all of them can be given access to a remedial teacher.  This teacher, in consultation with the school authorities, had to take difficult decisions and decided to target resources towards the seven to nine age group. She visits the four schools twice every week and spends an extra half day at each school every fourth week.  She does not regard this as sufficient and believes these children require daily attention.  In addition, there is very little one-to-one teaching as she does not have enough time. She takes children in groups for 30 to 45 minutes in order to save time.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers normally deal with three categories of children &mdash; slow learners, children with special learning difficulties and children with special needs.  Further integration has meant that children with special needs who require remedial education form an increasing part of the school-going population.  Remedial teachers have very little time to deal with children with specific learning difficulties.  Children who suffer from dyslexia and other learning difficulties are not given the degree of attention and expert guidance they require.</P>
    <P>Another teacher serves two schools and has a caseload of 50 pupils, most of whom he sees two or three times a week.  The combined enrolment of the two schools is approximately 375 and his complaints are similar.  For example, he does not have enough time to deal with children who have problems with maths, the necessary resources are not provided and essential back-up services are not in place.</P>
    <P>The normal work of a remedial teacher includes the screening and testing of pupils, record keeping etc.  They also have responsibility for the development of school policy on remedial teaching for children with special needs.  It is generally recognised and accepted that liaison <Col N="847" /> between parents and remedial teachers is an essential part of the overall service and meetings between them are, therefore, very important. Remedial teachers who cover two schools are clearly faced with enormous difficulties.  I have heard complaints that pupils are not being given the attention they require and deserve.</P>
    <P>A third teacher is equally adamant that he does not have time to deal with all aspects of remedial education.  Pupils in his catchment area who have problems with maths are also a casualty.  He covers three schools with an enrolment of approximately 400 pupils and does not feel he has enough time to deal with children with special learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>The guidelines issued by the Department of Education bear very little relationship to the reality on the ground or the problems with which remedial teachers have to deal.  For example, they suggest that remedial teachers should deal only with children on the lower rung of the intelligence ladder.  This excludes children above the lower rung who still require some remedial teaching.  A general guideline is that the caseload of a remedial teacher should be approximately 40 pupils.  However, the average caseload of most remedial teachers, particularly those in rural schools, is much higher than 40.  The guidelines suggest that in the case of a cluster of schools the caseload of 40 should be reduced by two for each additional school, subject to a maximum reduction of eight pupils.  This again bears no relationship to reality.  Most remedial teachers and experts in the field regard a caseload of 38 pupils between two schools as excessive and believe it should be reduced.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with the utilisation of the demographic dividend.  Each year since 1987 the Department has had teachers available for redeployment.  The Minister does not often draw attention to the demographic dividend, which basically means that a significant number of teachers become available every year for redeployment as a result of falling enrolments.  In 1987 the then Government and Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, decided, in consultation with the social partners, to retain any excess teachers who became available because of falling enrolments within the system and to redeploy them.  This was used to appoint additional remedial teachers and to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio gradually over the period of the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The demographic dividend has also been used to develop the home-school liaison scheme initiated by Deputy Mary O'Rourke and to appoint resource and visiting teachers.  The Minister does not always refer to this in press releases as it takes from the gloss on her announcement of the appointment of additional remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> This brings me to the decision taken this year to utilise the demographic dividend in a certain way.  According to replies to parliamentary questions tabled by me and other Deputies, there were approximately 346 teachers available for redeployment for the year commencing September 1996.  The Minister was very late in publishing the staffing schedules and indicated that she would devote all the teachers to the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  Her non-consultative approach to this issue led to industrial action in a number of schools and to the threat of industrial action by the INTO in schools which would lose teachers as a result of her stubborn adherence to this decision.  The threat of industrial action and the successful lobbying by all sides, particularly the INTO, forced the Minister to retreat.  We ended up with the Breaking the Cycle initiative which allocated approximately 135 of the 346 teachers to 35 urban schools and approximately 118, in 25 clusters of five, to schools in rural areas.  Approximately 35 teachers from the 25 clusters will be appointed as co-ordinators, but we do not know what type of service they will provide for disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  The Minister may laugh, but if she were in Knocknaheeny or Churchfield in Cork, in Connemara or in certain parts of Dublin she would not laugh.  It is unacceptable that schools which experience extreme disadvantage in urban and rural areas have been denied an additional teacher or support under the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  Some schools have received eight additional teachers while neighbouring schools, with equal degrees of disadvantage, have not even received one.  Tremendous inequity has entered the system.  While nobody would begrudge the additional teachers to the schools concerned &mdash; they deserve all the help they can get &mdash; there is no justification for depriving schools, such as St. Mary's in Knocknaheeny or Padre Pio in Churchfield in Cork, of one additional teacher.</P>
    <P>I challenge anyone to dispute what I have said. I have received correspondence from schools in Connemara, Donegal and Dublin which should have received assistance, but did not.  I have had correspondence from a school in Letterfrack which was included in the Breaking the Cycle initiative and, while that entitles it to grant assistance, it will lose a teacher.  We are assisting schools in so-called disadvantaged areas by increasing capitation grants, but they subsequently lose teachers.  The loss of a teacher to the school in Letterfrack will be crucial to its ongoing success and development.</P>
    <P>In an excellent article in <i>Education and Living</i> dated 5 November, John Carr of the INTO welcomed the Breaking the Cycle initiative, but stated that a comprehensive system of remedial education must be a priority for rural areas.  The INTO believes it would take an additional 220 teachers to complete that service and to provide <Col N="849" /> genuine access to remedial education for children, particularly those in disadvantaged circumstances.</P>
    <P>Rather than appointing 35 co-ordinators to travel around the country visiting schools in rural areas, resources should be spent on appointing 35 remedial teachers.  I would have used this year's demographic dividend to appoint approximately 50 teachers.  A general reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio would assist remedial teachers because it would reduce numbers in classrooms and allow greater room for manoeuvre within schools.</P>
    <P>Breaking the Cycle was a great initiative for the editorial writers.  It had a great story to tell about a wonderful new initiative that would tackle disadvantage head on.  However, only 35 urban schools benefited.  Hundreds of other schools in similar positions did not get even one teacher.  It would have been a more equitable system if the schools selected had received three or four teachers and the remaining teachers were appointed to other schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When the Estimates are being approved, I inform the Minister of the demand for a proper and comprehensive remedial system of education. We need more remedial teachers urgently to cater for children with special needs.  If they are not catered for at an early age we will fail them. A mixed approach would be more beneficial in next year's demographic dividend than the one the Minister adopted last year.  She should listen to the social partners and not take unilateral action.  She should also heed what is being said by people throughout the country.  The Minister has a difficulty with consultation.  The last person she will consult is a TD.  Labour Deputies may benefit in that regard, but even some of them are frustrated at the lack of progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a high disregard for the House.  She rarely attends Adjournment debates and considers Private Members' motions an undue sufferance.  It is interesting to note the number of Deputies who put their names to this motion, particularly those from the western seaboard and other rural areas, and have expressed a desire to contribute to the debate. They are listening to complaints from parents, teachers and children about the lack of a proper service.  The day of the cynical press release which states that 85 per cent of our children have access to a remedial service is gone.  It is time to deal with the reality.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and urge the Minister to respond positively.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Martin, our party spokesperson on Education, for tabling the motion and making an excellent contribution.  His winding up remarks were very appropriate.  He outlined in a nicer way than I would the Minister's contempt for this motion.  She even left the House in the middle of Deputy Martin's contribution.  Private Members' Time is the only <Col N="850" /> resource afforded the Opposition to put forward matters of concern to them.  It is incumbent on Ministers to give courtesy and recognition to that valuable time and, unless they have to attend pressing State business, they should attend such debates.  While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, he does not have a connection with the Department of Education.  He is Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, with responsibility for the generation of windpower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister thinks we are talking a lot of wind.  However, I am pleased a Minister from Mayo came in listen to the debate. Although he left that county a long time ago, he returns there frequently.</P>
      <P>There has been much publicity about the number of remedial teachers the Minister appointed in her four year tenure.  Despite that, I meet deputations on a weekly basis from schools in a rural constituency in the west who believe they are entitled to some of the substantial resources in the Department of Education that are being allocated to cities and other large urban areas.  Many rural schools believe they are not getting their fair share.</P>
      <P>Why do we need so many remedial teachers? Many children of five and six years of age leave their homes at 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m. and do not return until 5 p.m.  In effect, they spend longer at school or in a school bus than the average industrial worker spends at work.  How can such students have the energy to do their homework? Such time spent travelling to and from and attending school contributes to educational disadvantage.  The fact that teachers in most rural schools have to teach multi-classes also contributes to educational disadvantage.  That is a most undesirable educational mechanism and, while recognising the decreasing pupil numbers, a certain element of that mechanism will continue to apply.  There is a need for more teachers.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's response to the INTO survey on substandard schools.  Last week the INTO claimed there were 47 substandard national schools.  In a response in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, the Minister said that work on one of those 47 schools had gone to tender.  If that is a record of which she can be proud, perhaps she was right to leave the House when she did.  She will get a message tonight and tomorrow that will put her record in the context in which it should be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of 47 schools deemed substandard by the INTO work on one has gone to tender.  I can only presume that school is Rathbane school, for which the Chair allowed time on the Adjournment Debate two weeks ago.  That debate and the associated national publicity on radio, television and in the newspapers resulted in the Minister taking note of the fact that there is such a thing as a substandard school.  The <Col N="851" /> planning process was taking an exorbitant time and the file must have been gathering a substantial amount of dust.  Something had to be done.  A Minister representing the constituency telephoned from a European capital on the day the story broke to take credit for ensuring that work on the school was about to go to tender in two weeks' time.  I can only presume from what I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that it is the school in question.</P>
    <P>Another 19 schools are at the architectural planning stage, the same stage Rathbane school was at until that story broke.  I ask the Minister to consider those 19 schools because I have no doubt they deserve the same priority as given to the school in north Mayo.</P>
    <P>Of the 47 substandard schools identified by the INTO the greatest percentage are in Mayo.  While the greatest number of schools designated for construction under the building programme are also in Mayo, I am not happy about that.  I want priority given to those other schools.  The Minister is obliged to devote her scarce resources to the essentials in building our educational infrastructure rather than expensive consultants' reports, commissions, spindoctoring and public relations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.  I support the motion condemning the Minister for her failure to appoint even one remedial teacher. We receive many representations from parents and school boards, school committees and school managers.  It is generally accepted that there is an urgent need for the appointment of many more remedial teachers.  The three areas of education to be considered when meeting the people concerned are the provision of remedial teachers, school buildings and school buses.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question on 18 April 1996 asking the Minister the number of schools in counties Cavan and Monaghan that applied for remedial teachers and are still awaiting approval and when approval of those teachers will be sanctioned.  A total of 22 national schools in Cavan and 19 in Monaghan applied for remedial teachers.  It is regrettable that remedial teachers will not be appointed to those schools this year.  Many people will be disappointed.  Schools are grouped for the purposes of remedial teaching, but no such grouping arrangement will apply this year as remedial teachers will not be appointed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been leaked that 17 new schools will be built under the school building programme. People asked if work would commence on the Urbleshanny school in 1996, but it is not on the list.  Of the 47 substandard schools listed, not one school in Cavan or Monaghan is included even though I am sure that a number of schools in those counties would fall into that category.  It is a slap in the face for school committees who have worked hard to get contributions towards the cost of building schools and ensured sites are available <Col N="852" /> and paid for to discover their work was in vain. They had many meetings with public representatives to urge them to push their case in the past year.  In the worst of times when Fianna Fáil was in office resources were available for school buildings every year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight's debate is important in that it draws attention to the value of and the need for remedial education.  Substantial numbers of children encounter literacy and numeracy problems.  There is quite a body of research on that area, but despite that there is a relatively poor public understanding of the importance of remedial education.  In my 20 years teaching prior to becoming a Member of the House I was never a member of the staff of a school that had the service of a remedial teacher.  To the best of my knowledge two of the three rural schools in which I taught still do not have such a service.</P>
      <P>Dyslexia is a term that is much used, abused and misunderstood in the area of remedial education.  It is a composite term used to describe several problems.  It frequently affects very intelligent pupils.  It is difficult to imagine the frustration and the diminished sense of self-worth it induces in young people, not to mention its effects on their adult lives which follows on from their lack of ability in reading or numeracy skills.</P>
      <P>At present because of the poor level of service many parents, some of whom can ill afford it, pay substantial amounts privately to teachers and specialists in the area of dyslexia for a service for their children.  That arises particularly with parents of second level children who are in exam classes and begin to find extreme pressure on them to perform.  In our role as parents we all, to some extent, suffer from seeking to consider our geese as swans.  For all parents there is some difficulty in admitting to the need for intervention in the education of their children.</P>
      <P>The reality is that a great many pupils in primary schools and a very large number in second level schools do not have access to a remedial teacher.  As other Deputies said, even of those schools which have a level of service, in most instances it is very small.  In larger schools there tend to be too few teachers while in rural areas remedial teachers spend a good deal of their time travelling between schools providing a shared service.  From my experience as a teacher and from speaking to my teacher colleagues, the value of a remedial teacher is diminished by the time spent travelling between schools, but also because it is difficult for teachers to integrate into a school class and to play a particular role in the school system, particularly in the multi-class situation.  There is a need for better in-service for remedial and other teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are major problems concerning the unsuitability of buildings in which remedial classes are held.  Many are held in corridors or cloakrooms which are most unsuitable.  Despite this, the level of service currently provided has had very positive results.  This, more than <Col N="853" /> anything else, illustrates the value of the service. My colleagues with the benefit of even a limited service tell me they are astounded and delighted at the level of success they see as a result. Everyone is aware that the amount of service available is too little and that too few teachers are involved.</P>
    <P>Then there is the situation of disadvantaged families and communities who suffer more than others in many instances.  Deputy Martin referred to the school psychological service.  Second level and vocational education committee schools are also in need of this service and the Minister should urge teachers who will be available to her over the coming years to provide it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Education for the significant improvements she has introduced in recent years in the area of remedial education and other innovations introduced for the benefit of children with special needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I became Minister for Education four years ago, I had two priorities for our primary schools.  First, I wanted to improve pupil-teacher ratios, capitation grants and support for all schools in our primary system and, second, I wanted to target specifically children with special needs arising from disadvantage, learning difficulties and physical disabilities.  The House will be aware that I have succeeded in keeping more than 1,000 teachers in the primary system who would have been lost because of falling pupil numbers.  These 1,000 teachers have been targeted both at a general improvement in primary schools and at children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that maximum class sizes have fallen from 39 to 35 over the last four years and that in disadvantaged schools maximum class sizes have fallen from 39 to 29 over the same period.  The House will also be aware that in schools which experience particular difficulties and are included in the Breaking the Cycle initiative, the maximum class size in junior classes is now 15.  These general improvements in class sizes have been accompanied by specific targeting of children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to bring to the attention of the House my record as Minister for Education in introducing significant improvements in the areas of remedial education and other innovations introduced for the benefit of children with special needs.  What is important is that the system is able to respond with an <Col N="854" /> appropriate range of measures which are tailored to meet the needs of the children and sufficiently flexible to allow them avail of services as and when required.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive agenda for the future development of education services for special needs children was clearly spelt out in the report of the Special Education Review Committee which was published in October 1993.  That report made many excellent recommendations on the future thrust of education provision for children with special needs.  In pointing to the way forward, the review committee proposed seven principles to serve as basic guidelines for the future development of the educational system.</P>
    <P>Principle No. 1: All children, including those with special educational needs, have a right to an appropriate education.  Principle No. 2: The need of the individual child should be the paramount consideration.  Principle No. 3: The parents of a child with special educational needs are entitled and should be enabled to play an active part in the decision-making process; their wishes should be taken into consideration when recommendations on special educational provision are being made.  Principle No. 4: A continuum of services should be provided for children with special educational needs ranging from full-time education in special schools.  Principle full-time education in special schools.  Principle No. 5: Except where circumstances make this impracticable, appropriate education for all children with special educational needs should be provided in ordinary schools.  Principle No. 6: Only in the most exceptional circumstances should it be necessary for a child to live away from home in order to avail of an appropriate education.  Principle No. 7: The State should provide adequate resources to ensure that children with special educational needs can have an education appropriate to those needs.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to implementing these principles.  My commitment in this regard is clearly reflected and confirmed in the White Paper on Education &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;.  The White Paper sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with special needs, both in an integrated environment and in special educational facilities.  The fundamental objective is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with special needs will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own areas and within the ordinary school system. Where children with special educational needs are fully integrated in ordinary schools, a range of support services are available.</P>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  The class teacher provides support which is the first line of assistance and support to pupils with special needs aided by the reduction in class size which I achieved over the last four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Remedial teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with less serious learning difficulties, generally in literacy and/or numeracy, by directly teaching individuals or small groups on a withdrawal basis.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 ex-quota remedial teacher posts to primary schools. A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  By any measure this represents a very significant improvement in the remedial teacher service over a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>Contrast this achievement with the record of the Opposition over the same period from 1989 to 1992.  I appointed 241 remedial teachers in the last four years; my Fianna Fáil predecessors appointed 80 in the previous four years.  Of course we must continue to improve the remedial service but it is a bit rich for Deputies on the Opposition benches to call for improvements now to make up for their years of neglect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the demographic dividend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision of remedial teachers is only part of my response to children with special needs.</P>
      <P>A more recent innovation aimed at further supporting special needs children on an integrated basis is the introduction of the resource teacher's model.  The resource teacher caters for pupils with more serious learning difficulties and disabilities, who require regular periods of sustained teacher input.  The resource teacher can be attached to an individual school or group of schools, depending on the level of assessed need of the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister there were only seven resource teachers.  So much for the Opposition's commitment to special needs children.  There are now 46 resource teachers, almost seven times the number allocated by Fianna Fáil.  The visiting teacher service is another service which has been enormously strengthened during my term of office.  The role of the visiting teacher is to provide special back-up support to schools in meeting the needs of children with particular disabilities.</P>
      <P>There are two visiting teacher services in place, one of which caters for children of the travelling community.  A total of 12 teachers are employed in this service, double the provision made by Fianna Fáil.  These teachers work closely with traveller families and schools to promote the enrolment of and participation by traveller children in pre-school, primary and post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second visiting teacher service is targeted at children with visual and hearing impairments and Down's Syndrome attending primary schools <Col N="856" /> on fully integrated basis.  A total of 39 teachers are employed in this service.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to further expand both of these services.  In the case of the visiting teacher service for travellers, I have approved the appointment of an additional three teachers.  These posts were advertised in recent days.  In the case of the visiting teacher service for children with certain disabilities, I have approved the appointment of an additional two teachers. These posts will be advertised shortly.</P>
    <P>Where the nature or magnitude of a child's special need is such that full integration in an ordinary schools would not be appropriate, the alternative of placement in a special class attached to an ordinary school is available.  Since the publication of the report of the Special Education Review Committee in 1993, there has been a significant increase in the number of special classes attached to ordinary national schools, particularly classes for children with mild mental handicap, children of the travelling community and children with speech and language disorders.  All such classes operate on the basis of a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio.  The precise ratio involved reflects the magnitude of the needs of the children being catered for.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment, I have provide for a one unit improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio across the entire range of special classes.  I have provided for a major improvement in the special capitation rates payable in respect of pupils attending special classes and special schools. When there was a Fianna Fáil Minister in the Department of Education the grant per child with mild mental handicap was a miserable £76.20. Today it is £195 for students under 12 and £316 for students over 12.  When there was a Fianna Fáil Minister in the Department of Education the grant per child with a severe or profound mental handicap was a miserable £92.70.  Today it is £383. When there was a Fianna Fáil Minister in the Department of Education the grant per child with visual impairment was a miserable £132.  Today it is £260 for students under 12 and £316 for students over 12.</P>
    <P>I could multiply these examples but I do not need to.  The few examples I have given show the hypocrisy of the Opposition in demanding priority for children with special needs, which has only been accorded to them during my term of office.  I have introduced an arrangement whereby pupils attending special classes are fully counted on the ordinary roll of the school.  This means that in addition to attracting the special class teacher, the schools in question have an improved prospect of attracting additional teaching staff on the basis of the ordinary staffing schedule.</P>
    <P>Where certain children with special needs are involved, it is necessary to supplement the teaching staff with back-up support from care staff.  Such a need arises where the children have difficulties in areas such as mobility and toiletting. <Col N="857" /> The child care assistant provides an important support service.  Child care assistants are employed in special schools for the deaf, blind, physically handicapped, emotionally disturbed, mentally handicapped and multiply handicapped.</P>
    <P>The child care assistant is an essential part of the care team for children in these special schools but was the need for these child care assistants recognised by Fianna Fáil when it had a Minister in the Department of Education?  The facts clearly show that it was not.  When I came into office I found there were only 82 child care assistants throughout the entire special education system.  In my four years in office I have tripled this number to 232.  This is still not enough. Additional appointments are needed but it is a huge advance to counteract the legacy of neglect left by previous Fianna Fáil Administrations.</P>
    <P>As well as correcting the legacy of past neglect I am engaged in planning for the future.  In 1993 the Special Education Review Committee recommended that a further 310 remedial posts be made available at first level.  I have already allocated 241 such posts.</P>
    <P>It is important that this substantial resource is used to best effect and deployed in line with evolving need.  It is now appropriate to review all these posts to ensure they are being used in the most efficient and effective manner.  Remedial teachers are allocated to schools to enable them reduce the numbers of pupils who might have difficulties in learning literacy and mathematical skills and to support them in teaching those who experience serious problems in acquiring these skills.  Research, for example the IEA English reading survey 1993, indicates that between 6.5 per cent and 9 per cent of pupils at 11 years of age, or fifth class, and at 14 years of age have serious learning problems in these areas.  The focus of the remedial teacher's work should be on those pupils who have the greatest needs both in terms of prevention and remediation.</P>
    <P>An initial survey carried out by my Department's inspectorate last year has raised concerns that some pupils who do not need it may be receiving remedial education.  This suggests there needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring the service is targeted at those who need it most.  The key target group would be the lowest functioning 10 per cent of pupils.  The survey has demonstrated there is a serious need to ensure the existing provision is correctly targeted.  There is a need to place a much greater emphasis on preventive strategies in schools and to focus on early identification strategies and differentiated teaching.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for my Department, in consultation with the education partners, to commence a comprehensive remedial education study in 1997.  The study will survey principal and remedial teachers focusing on the number of pupils attending remedial classes, the criteria for inclusion in and withdrawal from remedial classes, the organisation of remedial teaching in schools, the development and implementation of <Col N="858" /> policy on remedial teaching in schools, and record keeping and reporting.  It will review instruction programmes in remedial classes, examine the progress made by pupils and analyse data on remedial education participation.</P>
    <P>This study, which I hope will be completed by the end of 1997, is an enormously important step in basing future advances in the remedial teaching service on up-to-date research, knowledge of precisely how current remedial provision operates and precisely what progress has been made by pupils.  This research, which is to be conducted by the Education Research Centre in co-operation with the partners in education, will inform further advances in remedial provision throughout our schools.  I am pleased to inform the House of the significant progress which I have made in the provision not only of remedial teachers, but also of teachers for a variety of other pupils with special needs throughout our education system.  I am pleased to inform the House of the research which is now being undertaken to ensure that provision of a remedial service can be targeted as effectively as possible in the future.</P>
    <P>However, this is only part of the overall picture.  Children who suffer from educational disadvantage also have distinct needs and I have targeted resources in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  My targeting of resources has been informed by research.  It has been done according to independently established criteria and in a way which ensures that both teaching and financial resources are targeted at those in the greatest need.</P>
    <P>In 1995 I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed review of our current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.  The report presented by the Combat Poverty Agency was one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It examined the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacted on pupils in the education system.  It reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage.  The report also evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches, using a wide range of national and international research date.</P>
    <P>Among the key issues raised in the report was a concern that under the current criteria, the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the criteria be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural as well as urban settings.</P>
    <P>It also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The report also considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The present scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> In response to the Combat Poverty Agency's report, I launched a new targeted initiative which aims to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas. Schools were selected by the Education Research Centre for support under this new initiative by reference to new selection criteria which have been developed by the centre.  The new criteria take on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and address educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings.</P>
    <P>For urban schools, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 33 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage.  In each of the selected schools extra staffing has been allocated to allow for a class size of approximately 15:1 in all junior classes, up to and including second class.  The schools will also receive special grant assistance of up to £3,000 for the purchase of materials and equipment and up to £4,000 for local initiatives.  A newly appointed co-ordinator will support the development of the programme in the selected urban schools.</P>
    <P>A special initiative will also focus on schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas serving dispersed populations which have concentrations of disadvantaged children.  In this case, supports are being made available to 25 clusters of schools. Each cluster will be served by a newly appointed co-ordinator who will work with the families and teachers involved.  Children attending schools in the selected clusters will attract a special capitation rate of £75 per pupil.  The schools will also attract special grant assistance of up to £1,000 for the purchase of materials and equipment and up to £1,000 for local initiatives aimed at combating disadvantage.  Schools selected as a result of this process have been invited to submit five-year development plans. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Given the findings of the studies to which I referred, I am satisfied that the targeted initiative now being pursued represents the most appropriate response to the problem of educational disadvantage in our primary schools. However, the Breaking the Cycle initiative is not the only response I have made.</P>
    <P>The objective of the early start pre-school initiative, which I introduced in 1994, is to expose young children to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development. The pilot programme is a significant development.  All research evidence from experience in this country and abroad indicates that high quality pre-school education can play an important part in offsetting the effects of social disadvantage and in preventing educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> The early start pre-school pilot project was launched in 1994 when eight centres of greatest disadvantage, one in Cork, one in Limerick and six in Dublin were selected for inclusion.  The programme was extended to a further 32 schools in disadvantaged areas for the 1995-96 school year.  This brings the total number of schools with this service to 40.  Grants are provided as follows: £4,500 per classroom start up grant for the purchase of a range of suitable equipment; £1,500 per centre per annum for the development of parental involvement; and £75 per pupil annual capitation grant.  The pilot project is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre and is being monitored by the Department's inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme is a further initiative to combat disadvantage by building partnership between home and school.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the educational system in recognition of the positive impact of the scheme.  The home-school-community liaison scheme involves the operation of 105 coordinators serving 178 schools with approximately 51,000 pupils.  Contrast this with the situation I inherited from Fianna Fáil in education where there were only 15 coordinators, one seventh of the current 105.  The home-school-community liaison scheme is of vital importance in promoting a real partnership between school and home.  Support has been a theme of all the advances I have made &mdash; support for teachers, schools, parents and students.</P>
      <P>Another one of my initiatives was the teacher councils.  I have responsibility for ensuring that all pupils, regardless of their personal circumstances, have a right of access to and participation in the education system.  The measures I have taken have served, in some way, to alleviate the legacy of neglect I inherited from Fianna Fáil.  Let me remind the House specifically of Fianna Fáil's record in the allocation of remedial teachers.</P>

      <P>As I told the House, 241 additional remedial teachers have been allocated during my term in office.  This contrasts with Fianna Fáil's record in the previous four years.  In 1989 not a single additional remedial teacher was allocated.  In 1990 there was an allocation of 80 additional remedial teachers, but again in 1991 and 1992 not a single additional remedial teacher was allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> We will hear passionate demands from the Opposition benches for a greater allocation of teachers and resources when they have no responsibility.  Long may it remain like that.

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to add my support to the Fianna Fáil motion.  As a student teacher and a teacher I came into contact with children who had access to remedial care.  I saw the faltering footsteps of those children, not knowing what was ahead of them and perhaps feeling a little different, but as they received the special attention they needed and deserved there was a dramatic improvement in their ability.  I am surprised that, as a former remedial teacher, the Minister does not seem to appreciate the value of remedial teaching.  When I put down questions asking for the appointment of remedial teachers in my area she repeatedly replied as follows:</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>Since no allocation was made in the current year for remedial teachers it scares me to think that that process will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dozens of parents contact me on a weekly basis because they are worried about their children and wonder where they can go for help.  They ask if they are entitled to assistance for private teaching or if there are teachers available.  I am speaking not about one or two anxious or hysterical parents but about parents in general who contact me on a regular basis seeking help for their children.  Some people believe that if they go to an educational psychologist and are told that their child needs remedial help that will assist them in their case.  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister on the number of educational psychologists in primary schools in County Donegal and was told there is an educational psychologist for secondary schools.  I <Col N="862" /> take it therefore that, despite the fact that there are 18,924 children on the roll books there, there is no educational psychologist for primary schools in the county.  The one educational psychologist in the area covers counties Donegal and Sligo.  I would not call that a substantial advance in this service.  Some people welcome the fact that there is no educational psychologist for primary schools in the area because they believe that children who see educational psychologists may be labelled as needing special care or remedial help.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there has been an increase from 77 to 87 per cent in the number of children who have access to remedial teaching, but some parents who come to me wonder why their child is one of the 13 per cent who are discriminated against.  Of 178 schools in County Donegal, 74, or 42 per cent, have no remedial help whatsoever.  I can only speak for Donegal, but if the position is similar in the rest of the country it is terrifying.  Even though 104 schools in County Donegal have remedial help, there are only 37 remedial teachers serving those schools. When I asked about the number of hours devoted to remedial teaching in each school I was told the information was not available.  While theoretically 78 per cent of children in the county have access to remedial teaching, in some areas there is only one teacher serving five schools, one day per school.  In a school with 300 pupils or more, how can one person, on one day, satisfy the needs of the school?</P>
    <P>Five schools in the Buncrana area &mdash; St. Joseph's in Illies, St. Mura's in Buncrana, St. Patrick's in Drumfries, St. Oran's in Cockhill and St. Egney's in Desertegney &mdash; with a total of 651 students, asked for one remedial teacher, but their request was refused.  Since there are 325 children in one of those schools there should be a full-time remedial teacher there, not to talk about sharing a teacher with four other schools.  In other areas the position is the same.  Many areas throughout the county are crying out for help. There are three schools in Carndonagh and six schools in the Malin area looking for remedial help.  Despite the lack of finance and the fact that sometimes teachers are unwilling to take on the extra work because their day is long enough in the schools, people are willing to pay for the service because they realise that it is a most beneficial resource, particularly in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>I have been told that all available resources are targeted on the development of in-school services.  In the 74 schools to which I referred there are no in-school services.  The Minister boasts about schools that have disadvantaged status.  In Carndonagh, however, there are two schools, one of which, a boys' school, has disadvantaged status while the other, a girls' school, does not.  The children attending both schools are from the same socio-economic background and, in some cases, from the same homes.  Remedial teachers often have to travel <Col N="863" /> many miles from one school to another, thereby wasting valuable time.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the fact that Fianna Fáil, in consultation with the social partners, decided in 1987 to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and retain teachers in the system we would not have the present number of teachers.  Because of Deputy O'Rourke's move on the home-school links we have a valuable service.  As a former teacher, I would ask the Minister to expand that service.</P>
    <P>In 1995-6 little action was taken, particularly in regard to remedial teaching.  Schools, including some in County Donegal, were described by the INTO as substandard.  We do not want talks about talks, feasibility studies or task forces.  We want action and the problems addressed in schools like Scoil Cholmcille, Malin.  We want the conditions in these schools to be suitable for the children who deserve the best education they can get.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of a major new study into remedial education, despite the fact that it is four years since she came into office.  I am sure Deputy Bertie Ahern, when he was Minister for Finance, would have been happy under collective responsibility to provide funding to the Minister for this type of study.  There is also a need for a major input to remedial education, particularly at primary level; it will be too late if it is left to the second level stage.  I also want to see the list of schools in County Donegal that do not have any remedial help shortened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for sharing her time.  I was amazed to hear the Minister talking about all the resources she provided, particularly in primary education, because the dreadful conditions highlighted on television last week in Boofeenaun school, Crossmolina, and the reports yesterday on a school in Kilglass, in my parish, indicate how badly off we are in regard to school structures, which is relevant to the whole question of remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Keaveney I have received similar replies from the Minister.  Yesterday I tabled a question to her concerning the possibility of a remedial teacher for Lisheen a Heilta, Ardeevin and Glenamaddy schools, and possibly Williamstown School in County Galway, and the Minister replied that when she is in a position to extend the remedial service, the needs of these schools will be given consideration.  These schools have been waiting a long time for an announcement in this regard but the Minister continues to give the same reply about the numbers she has allocated in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to accept that a large number of pupils in County Galway are receiving a remedial service because in some cases teachers have responsibility for five or six schools.  There is very little accommodation available in some schools for use by remedial teachers.  In St. Augustine's national school, Clontuskert, the remedial teacher has to use a room measuring less than <Col N="864" /> five feet by five feet.  That particular school was on the Minister's capital programme list in 1995 but I understand it is not one of the 17 priority schools to which the Minister referred in response to the television programmes on the Boofeenaun and Kilglass schools.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers must have rooms in which they can provide their service.  One class in St. Augustine's national school in Clontuskert is being conducted in the dining room of the local manager's house, the local priest.  Remedial and resource teachers are appointed using the demographic dividend, as Deputy Martin stated, but schools must have proper classrooms for teachers who are required to travel to a number of schools in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the Minister had moved on the question of the pupil-teacher ratio, which is vitally important.  Mick Hanley recorded a song called &ldquo;All I Remember&rdquo;, the first line of which goes as follows: &ldquo;All I remember was dreading September and school&rdquo;.  I hope children no longer dread September and the prospect of school, but boards of management around the country do not look forward to September when the enrolment figures for the previous September are quoted when they request the retention of a teacher.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has responsibility for western development and I hope he continues to do what he professes to be doing, namely, retaining every school, post office, Garda barracks and courthouse from Donegal to Clare, the area he represents.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the issue of classroom assistants who have a vital role to play, particularly in regard to physically handicapped children.  These children are not often talked about and we do not hear about a five year plan for dealing with their needs.  Despite what the Minister said tonight the Department of Health, through the health boards, and the Department of Education in the past provided a number of classroom assistants in County Galway, which, particularly the town of Ballinasloe, would not have any classroom assistants if it had not been for FÁS which provides people with employment, usually on a 12 months basis.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case involving a classroom assistant who has worked for six months but because the FÁS scheme in which she is participating ends in December, she would have been required to leave the school and the children she was helping.  That would have been a great loss.  If Cerebral Palsy Ireland had not decided to continue the FÁS scheme for another six months until the end of June, there would not have been anyone available to help a physically handicapped child in that school.  That highlights the importance of classroom assistants.  These people are not being provided in my constituency by the Departments of Education or Health; they are being provided by FÁS and the CPI organisation.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the Minister's statement that every two-teacher school would retain their teachers <Col N="865" /> but the Minister should have examined the position of the one-teacher schools.  There are 163 one-teacher schools in the country; every county has a one-teacher school with the exception of Laois and Offaly.  The students in those schools also need assistants because it is difficult for one teacher to cope with a large range of subjects from 9.30 in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  The only technology that may be available to that teacher is a telephone which she can use to call for assistance if a child becomes ill or if some other emergency arises in the school. These teachers need help and I believe they should be given a second assistant because the Minister acknowledged that some schools may have two teachers but only 15 pupils, in the clusters of schools for the disadvantaged, while some one-teacher schools have 21 pupils.  That is a major inconsistency in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Many one-teacher schools are located in Gaeltacht areas and are managed by the Church of Ireland.  I would like to see the Minister providing extra help for both the teachers and the students in those schools.  Instead of freezing the pupil-teacher ratio I hope the Minister reduces it. If that was done on a phased basis it would make a great difference to the students and teachers concerned.  If it is not done, what will happen eventually is that the morale of the school will suffer, the numbers will fall further and the school will eventually close.</P>

      <P>There has been outrage in Mayo and in the Western Health Board region because of the reduction of hours for home helps.</P>
      <P>On 1 October a change was made by the health board to the home help scheme but it did not notify the relevant people until November.  For many years an increase in pay was sought by those in the scheme.  They were getting £1 per hour which was subsequently increased to £2 per hour, but the health board reduced the hours and did not notify them until a month later.  People found they were getting the same money because they were doing less hours.  That was not the spirit of the scheme.  It was done in an underhand way with no prior notification to the home helps, the GPs and the patients and no medical reason was given for the cutback.</P>
      <P>It was the worst time of the year for this type of cutback.  There is more illness during winter and it is therefore the time when home help is most needed.  The home help's basic work includes laying fires, shopping and washing to assist people confined to homes.  There are 832 part-time home helps in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave an extra allocation of £100,000 to the health board.  However, what it <Col N="866" /> did was unacceptable.  It is unacceptable to me as a public representative that a health board should reduce the hours without consulting the home helps and patients involved.  The health board wrote to the Minister saying it had comprehensive discussions.  That is not true. Many people came from Achill, Westport, Ballycroy, Ballina, Belmullet and as far away as Tuam to my clinic expressing outrage at the cutback in the home help scheme, especially coming up to Christmas.  Naturally enough, if a person from the health board asks an elderly person if they are fine, they will say the are because they do not want to be a burden to anyone.  Those who had the home help service needed it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the 825 people involved in the home help scheme in the Western Health Board area.  These people, although they might only be paid for two or three hours per day, never complain and do an excellent job.  Most of these people give more time to the job than they are paid for.  We should care for our elderly who have contributed to and assisted this State.  If they need to be cared for and want to stay at home rather than being put into a hospital, they should be able to do so.</P>
    <P>To those who made this cutback, I say it was shameful and taken at a terrible time of the year. I want the Minister to investigate who made the decision and ensure that the Western Health Board reverses its decision and pays at the rate of £2 per hour for the same hours people worked before October.  This is a scrooge element before Christmas and I condemn the people who made the decision.  They hurt many elderly people and the home help people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, since the publication of the report, The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly, the main focus of care for the elderly has been to enable older people to continue living in their homes for as long as they wish and are able to do so.  It is recognised that the home help service contributes enormously to the maintenance and dignity of frail and dependent older people at home.</P>
      <P>The National Council for the Elderly recently published a report entitled Home Help Services for Elderly People in Ireland.  The research undertaken points to the strength and value of the home help services.  For example, the report finds that the number of home helps has increased from just over 5,000 in 1978 to more than 10,500 in 1993.  The report also records that the satisfaction of clients with the home help service is overwhelming, while a further strength of the service is the speed and flexibility with which a person in need can be supplied with a home help.  While it is acknowledged that the report also draws attention to problems with the home help service, we should not underplay the real strengths and benefits of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide or support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
    <P>Health boards are not limited in the categories of persons they can assist at home and may charge for the service.  The services are, however, usually provided free or at a nominal charge.  The health boards consider individual cases on the basis of need and in the light of resources available to the scheme.  In practice, about half of the home helps and the vast majority of meals are provided by voluntary organisations with funding from health boards.  The remaining home helps are employed directly by health boards.  The balance between voluntary and health board input to the home help service varies from one health board to another.  Home helps are predominantly part-time, though a number of full-time home helps and home help coordinators are employed by some boards. Voluntary involvement also strengthens the sense of neighbourly obligation towards the elderly and encourages the self-development of the home help.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community-based good neighbour scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community services. Accordingly, the remuneration of volunteers does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  As operated in many areas, this is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.  The service is essentially a local client-based service.  The rate paid to part-time home helps employed throughout the country varies from place to place and is related to the requirements and type of task undertaken in each case.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Western Health Board has recently carried out a comprehensive review of its home help services which includes an assessment of the dependency levels of those in receipt of the service.  A framework is now in place to identify low, medium and high dependency levels of clients to which specific hours are committed reflective of their need. Based on their dependency rating, the home help client is to receive five, seven or nine hours home help per week.  This is in line with the average in other health boards.  Under the revised scheme, clients will not need to supplement the part-time home help unless they choose to do so themselves on a voluntary basis for help given beyond the assessed level of hours.  In addition, this framework has enabled the board to increase the <Col N="868" /> hourly rate of pay to £2 per hour, effective from 30 September 1996.  This increase was made possible by the additional funding of £100,000 made available by the Department of Health to the board earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The revised framework was discussed with the board's public health nursing staff and a number of existing home help clients to establish their views on the proposals.  Those canvassed expressed unqualified support for the revised scheme.  The board is satisfied this revised scheme has allowed it to standardise its home help services in line with other health boards and to provide a more equitable service to the elderly in their catchment area.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding for the home help service has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  The Department of Health in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.  A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officer group forms the basis for this examination.</P>
    <P>Following these discussions it was decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help service carried out by an independent body which will advise on measures to ensure the equity and high quality of the service in respect of providers and recipients.  The Department has invited tenders for this review and it is expected that the review should be completed in three to four months.  It should be noted that in the recently published health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, the role and potential of the home help service in adding to social gain is acknowledged.  Indeed the strategy states that over the next four years priority will be given to strengthening the role of the general practitioner, the public health nurse, the home help and other primary care professionals in supporting older people and their carers who live at home.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to this aim.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Dermot Ahern and Brendan McGahon.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue because of the serious disruption in the Louth County Hospital owing to the work to rule which has been in place for some time and is the culmination of frustration with the serious staff shortages which exist in the hospital. The nursing union there reckons there is a need for more than 20 additional staff.  Over recent years different consultancy responsibilities have been added to the range of services with no corresponding increase in the number of nurses. There has been a significant increase in the volume of work with the same level of staff expected to cope with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> Patients are being turned away from the hospital.  They are angry that because of the disruption they are unable to get very necessary medical treatment.  There is an urgent need for the Minister for Health to intervene in the dispute.  There is a danger that the matter could escalate resulting in a further deterioration in the services available at the hospital.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing us to raise this issue and my colleague for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>There is considerable anxiety among patients and their relatives.  Normal nursing duties are being done but other duties, such as answering phones, are not because of the work to rule. Hysterectomy operations are being postponed at a considerable rate and patients are required to go on hormone treatment at very high cost until they can have their operations.  A series of clinics have been cancelled, and this has caused extreme anxiety for patients who are about to undergo operations.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Department of Health is taking a keen interest in this matter because I tabled a parliamentary question last week to which I received a reply yesterday.  I exhort the Minister to ensure he and the health board pull out all the stops to settle this dispute.  There have been some improvements regarding consultancy staff in the hospital but there has not been an improvement in the level of back-up staff.  That is necessary and has to be acknowledged to be necessary by the health board and the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I join my constituency colleagues in expressing concern about the curtailment of services in Louth County Hospital. As a recent inmate in the hospital, I am aware of the shortage of staff, and the pressure under which existing staff work.  I am acutely aware of the huge contribution they make to the high standard of care available in Louth.  I also acknowledge the improvements made in the past few years by the health board and the present Minister, Deputy Noonan.  Not only is the continued existence of the hospital guaranteed, the health board has recently built an extension to the hospital and has upgraded the facilities, creating a more congenial environment for patients and nurses alike.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the nurses, particularly the night staff, work under extreme pressure to cope with the increased rate of admissions resulting from the upgrading of the hospital.  There is a great need, in the largest town in Ireland, to have contented nursing staff working without stress.  I appeal to the Minister to urge the health board to compromise and to resolve this matter.  I understand from speaking to the health board today that it hopes for a breakthrough in this dispute.</P>

      <P>I thank the three Deputies from Louth for raising this matter.  Such unity augurs well for the future of Louth County Hospital.</P>
      <P>The management of health services, including the employment of staff, is a matter, in the first instance, for each health agency.  The individual health boards are in the best position to determine how best to deploy their personnel having due regard to the different priorities and service requirements throughout their area of responsibility.  The deployment of staff within deployment ceilings and budget at Louth County Hospital, Dundalk is thus a matter, in the first instance, for the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The issue of strengthening staffing levels at particular locations is one considered by the health boards on a regular basis within the general context of balancing all service development priorities with the total amount of available funding.  In the normal course, staffing levels for individual hospitals and units within hospitals are adjusted to take account of overall service demands.  The North-Eastern Health Board received approval for 74 additional posts to date in 1996.  With specific regard to nursing staff, the number of nursing staff employed by the North-Eastern Health Board has increased by some 10 per cent from the end of 1991 to the end of 1995.  This increase is in line with the increase in nursing staff levels across the health sector. The dispute in Louth County Hospital, Dundalk relates to a demand by the Irish Nurses' Organisation for a significant number of additional nursing posts.  Any disruption of the health services is a matter of deep regret to me and, I am sure, to all public representatives.  In this case, the action by the nurses involved includes withdrawal from what they consider to be non-nursing duties, refusal to co-operate with the hospital information system and refusal to take internal calls.  That action has culminated in the necessity to cancel elective surgery and, since Monday last, outpatient appointments.</P>
      <P>There have been several meetings between the Irish Nurses' Organisation and health board management.  The most recent meeting was held yesterday afternoon.  The health board has made proposals to the union which involve the immediate provision of additional nursing and non-nursing resources at Dundalk.  This offer was made at a meeting yesterday evening.  The Irish Nurses' Organisation and staff are due to consider the offer at a general meeting scheduled for this evening.  They are probably meeting as I speak.</P>
      <P>Given that progress is now being made between both sides, I hope the matter can be resolved and expect that industrial action will be discontinued now that both sides are urgently seeking a resolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me an opportunity to allow the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister, to <Col N="871" /> give a full explanation for the delay in implementing a report on the testing of doctors for infectious diseases.  Last week's episode at the Mater Hospital might not have happened if some of the recommendations in the report had been implemented.  The Minister must accept responsibility for his failure to attend to this matter in the 14 months since the report was completed.</P>
    <P>Last week's alert at the Mater Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic was most disturbing and a matter of major public concern to the 400 plus cardiac surgery patients who were involved.  The alert arose after a doctor who had operated on the patients or assisted at the operations later tested positive for hepatitis B.  This is the second such scare in recent times in the Republic.  The last one, two years ago, followed the jailing in Britain of an Indian doctor who had worked at several Irish hospitals and who had continued to carry out surgery in the UK when he knew he was carrying the hepatitis B virus.</P>
    <P>Following that revelation the Minister for Health established an advisory committee in February 1995 to report on the transmission of infectious diseases.  That committee reported in September 1995 but its report has never been published and its recommendations have not been implemented.  I want the Minister to explain why he has taken no action on that report which deals with testing doctors for hepatitis B and other infectious diseases.  In sitting on the report the Minister has been grossly negligent on an issue of major public importance.</P>
    <P>Given the ongoing hepatitis C controversy, the Minister could not but be aware that action on this report was still outstanding.  The hepatitis C controversy must also have underlined for him the seriousness of the issues involved with the transmission of infectious diseases in a health care setting.  While I accept that the issues involved are complex and that there is a necessity for consultation with the various groups involved, one would expect that after a year some headway would have been made.  This is not the case and the Minister appears to be deliberately putting the report on the long finger so that he can avoid taking decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to deal with it.  On 21 November the Mater Hospital informed the Department of Health that a registrar in the cardio-thoracic service had tested positive for hepatitis B.  As a precautionary measure the hospital, with the involvement of the public health department of the Eastern Health Board, implemented a &ldquo;look-back&rdquo; screening programme for the limited number of cardiac patients whose procedures this doctor attended since last February when the doctor concerned began working in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Prior to taking up this position at the Mater, the doctor had some involvement in procedures in the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Hospital is also co-ordinating the screening programme for this hospital.  Following compilation of a list of all patients, information packs and letters of notification were sent to all referring GPs throughout the country asking them to contact their respective patients and outline the details of the screening programme.  This programme involves blood testing and a follow-up counselling service.  Some 444 letters were issued to the patients' GPs and to date some 70 people have been tested either through their GPs or in the Mater Hospital.  Results are available for 30 patients, all of which are negative.</P>
    <P>I assure members of the public who attended the hospital for any other type of operation or procedure that they have absolutely no cause for concern.  Patients who have been contacted in relation to the screening programme are being asked to participate as a precaution only.  The report of the infectious diseases advisory group raised many serious and complex issues in the whole area of infectious diseases.  Some issues were specific to the nature of the hepatitis B virus while some concerned other infectious diseases. There was considerable clarity and agreement on the steps to be taken in regard to testing new employees likely to be employed in high risk clinical settings.  There was less clarity on the approach to be taken in regard to existing employees.  It, therefore, has taken some time to translate the recommendations of the advisory committee into clear guidance to be given to employing authorities.  This process is now reaching completion and the Minister hopes to be in a position to issue the appropriate guidelines at an early date.</P>

      <P>This is not a reflection on the Minister of State but I am disappointed the Minister for Education is not present as it shows a consistent lack of interest in the problem at Clonmel High School.  When I raised the matter on numerous occasions last year she was not present.  When in Tipperary last year she would not call to the school to witness the urgency of the problem.  We had been told we would be looked after in the January budget.  Now, a year later, I expect the same answer, that we will be looked after in next year's budget.</P>
      <P>Some 695 pupils attend a school which was built for 300.  Next year there will be over 700 pupils in that school due to the transition year. Recent renovation works, while welcome, commenced in the middle of the summer but could not be completed before the start of the school year.  This caused serious disruption to the school programme in September and October and left the school with a deficit of six classrooms during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> Fianna Fáil offered accommodation but it was found to be unsuitable.  Nevertheless it showed our commitment and our generosity to the pupils of the school.  The completed renovations have resulted in the number of classrooms being reduced by two.  A year later, I understand the Department has not advanced the school planning process from stage 4 to stage 5 when it can go to tender.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the urgency of the problem, 75 pupils studying woodwork to junior certificate level and approximately 70 pupils taking construction studies to leaving certificate level have minimal facilities.  Some 250 technical graphic students do not have proper equipment, including a room or facilities in which to pursue their studies up to leaving certificate level.  Over 400 pupils are deprived of proper facilities for their education.  The art room will be converted to a storage room when the work commences. That gives some idea of the size and suitability of that room for its current use.</P>
    <P>Clonmel High School, one of the four secondary schools in the town, has a long tradition of success, high standards, discipline and exceptional teaching standards.  Any further delay in proceeding to planning permission and tender stages will cause uproar in a town with a population of 17,000, not to mention the catchment area.  No more prefabs will be allowed on site.  No improvement, even temporary, can be continued in this area.</P>
    <P>The patience and perseverance of parents, pupils and staff may not be guaranteed in the new year if these conditions persist with an expected intake of 138 pupils and many more who will be disappointed. Clonmel, pupils, teachers and parents deserve the new addition to the school to preserve the standards to which they have become accustomed through many years of teaching in that great <Col N="874" /> academic high school.  We expect it to be included in the budget for next year and if not someone will pay for it somewhere along the line.</P>

The stage four submission for this project has been examined by the Department's technical staff and a letter issued to the school authorities on 14 November 1996, requesting that the school's design team make certain amendments to the stage four submission. These amended documents were received in the Department on 29 November 1996 and are currently being examined.  Subject to the revised submission being in order, the Department hopes to be in a position to approve stage four with a view to proceeding to stage five of the design team procedures, that is, bill of quantities.</P>
      <P>When stage five has been examined and approved, the next stage is the invitation of tenders.  I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to have the planning of the extension completed as soon as possible with a view to being in a position to invite tenders as soon as funding is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 21 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> EU regulation 3013/89 aims to provide for the full establishment of a single market in sheepmeat, involving compensation, by means of an annual premium, for loss of income.  Despite the operation of the common organisation of the sheepmeat regime since 1992, market prices within the European Union have failed to converge to any worthwhile extent, though some narrowing of the divergence has occurred and average gross income per ewe does not show the same degree of divergence as in price levels.</P>
    <P>The late spring and early summer of 1995 was a very difficult time for the sheepmeat sector.  I sought and secured exclusive arrangements for Ireland in the form of a special premium to producers in the non-disadvantaged areas and a top-up in headage payments to producers elsewhere.  I have sent a detailed memorandum to Commissioner Fischler outlining the areas which need to be examined.  Among the proposals which I suggested was that there should be an automatic top-up of the premium or payment of the rural world premium to all producers where there is unusual market failure.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of the stabiliser co-efficient, the setting of the co-efficient at 7 per cent was part of a package agreed by the Council of Ministers in 1992.  It was part of an agreement which, <i>inter alia</i>, saw sheep quotas fixed on a more favourable basis than originally proposed. Nevertheless I have suggested to the Commission that a lower stabiliser is now justified in the light of the current EU flock profile.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission recently submitted a report on the operation of the quota system and, in that context, I will press for a review of the ewe premium system.  However, it should be recognised that this issue is being considered against a background of concern about the cost of the sheep meat regime and no support from other member states for a fundamental adjustment to the regime.  It is also the case that this year has been an extremely good year for Irish sheep producers, with record prices prevailing for most of the year.</P>

These would involve some limits on the overall level of payment, adjustments to a small number of grant rates and a better targeting of payments to meet the overall aim of the disadvantaged areas scheme. Discussions on these proposals with the Commission are ongoing.  I will, of course announce the details as soon as Commission agreement has been obtained.</P>

      <P>The EU has already approved a substantial compensation package worth £70 million for Irish producers who suffered income losses as a result of the lower market prices arising from BSE.  This scheme was administered by the premium-headage division of my Department.  Payments under the scheme, which was targeted at producers most severely affected by the crisis, were completed by 15 October last. The EU has agreed a further compensation package and this will also be administered by the premium-headage division of my Department. The combined value of these schemes in direct compensation to Irish producers is approximately £100 million and this will go along way towards alleviating the situation of producers who have suffered the most serious losses as a result of the crisis, including producers with heavy borrowings. In addition, Irish farmers will get an extra £15 million in extensification payments and the special deal for Ireland on the continuation of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium is worth £16 million to the incomes of winter beef fatteners. Producers who are still in financial difficulties in spite of these compensation measures should contact their local Teagasc office for advice.</P>

      <P>The Protocol concluded with the Russian veterinary authorities has been in place since 1 November and is operating satisfactorily. The events leading to the conclusion of this <Col N="879" /> agreement have been outlined in great detail. There was a stark choice between the closure of the Russian market to all Irish beef or temporary restrictions of exports from a small number of counties.  Russia was the largest third country market for Irish beef in 1995 and in 1996, and the closure of a market of such economic significance would have created enormous problems for the Irish beef sector.</P>
      <P>There has been no negative impact on cattle prices or on the beef export trade as a result.

      <P>My Department maintains a register of all persons approved for the importation of meat, meat products and other products of animal origin.  Importers of products of animal origin are also required to submit, in writing, to my Department details of each consignment in advance of import.  The information provided is used to monitor and record imports, and to assist with spot checks on consignments, when necessary.  In addition to stop checks, inspectors of my Department carry out regular checks of vehicles and premises to ensure that imports of products of animal origin comply with the animal and public health conditions laid down in national and EU legislation.</P>
      <P>Other agricultural produce, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals, are monitored and tested regularly by inspectors of my Department for pesticide residues in accordance with EU legislation.  Routine sampling of food is also carried out in retail outlets by environmental health officers of the Department of Health under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and other food hygiene regulations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 32 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Since I took office as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in December 1994, I have been committed to improving the level of efficiency and effectiveness in the Department's operations.  The first step I took was to publish a Charter of Rights for Farmers which is a commitment by me, by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and by the staff of the Department to a quality, user friendly service. I am satisfied that the charter is working well and that the farming community welcomes the improved service.</P>
      <P>The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services to farmers.  The payment targets set for 1995 and 1996 have been largely met and in some cases exceeded. Significant progress has been made on improving office accommodation in all our offices in line with the commitment to providing confidential office consultations for farmers and better accommodation for staff.  In this context work commenced this week on a £4 million extension and refurbishment to our offices in Castlebar and new local offices are being built in a number of counties.  In addition an improved telephone system is being installed in our local offices.</P>
      <P>The commitment to establish an appeals unit was met on target and I am pleased to say that this is working well.  The review group to monitor the implementation of the charter has been established and is meeting quarterly.  The farm organisations are represented on this group and I believe that this provides a very useful forum to monitor progress on all commitments given in the charter.</P>
      <P>In the light of progress achieved, I am disappointed that due to industrial relations difficulties, the charter commitment of having an information desk, or &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo;, in place has not yet been achieved.  However, the introduction of this service has been agreed in the context of a restructuring deal which is now being considered by staff of the union concerned.</P>

      <P>Considerable efforts have been made to ensure the removal of any obstacles to beef exports to Iran.  During its visit to this country, the Iranian Veterinary Organisation presented a veterinary Protocol.  Some elements of that Protocol are not acceptable to us. Following recent bilateral discussions between the Taoiseach and the Iranian Vice-President during the World Food Summit in Rome, it was agreed that an Irish technical delegation would visit Iran in the near future in an attempt to resolve outstanding issues.</P>
      <P>My objective, if at all possible, is to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the Iranian Veterinary Organisation but that will depend very much on its position in relation to the conditions which are not acceptable to us.  I have indicated my willingness to visit Iran but the timing of any such visit will be influenced by the extent of progress made in the technical discussions.</P>

      <P>Approximately 16,400 tillage farmers applied for arable aid in 1996.  Some 95 per cent of those applicants have now been paid and the remaining 800 or so will be processed in the next two weeks.  Payments issued to 6,210 applicants by 1 November 1996 and about 4,300 awaited payment on 1 December.  On 2 December, however, 3,471 of these were paid, leaving only about 800 unpaid now.</P>
      <P>While I am disappointed that all the deadlines set out in the farmers' charter could not be met this year, the delays incurred in 1996 were due to two significant factors: first, as a result of industrial action in my Department earlier this year, the commencement of processing of area aid applications was delayed by a number of weeks, and second, as part of the integrated administration and control system which is required by the EU in relation to all CAP compensatory and headage payments, Ireland was required to develop a new land parcel identification system, LPIS, in 1996.  Given the increased level of checks and controls associated with the new LPIS it was inevitable that some delay in making payment, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> EU regulations governing payments to tillage farmers under the arable aid schemes allow for these payments to be made in the period 16 October to 31 December in the year of application.  All but the most intractable problem cases of the remaining 800 unpaid cases will be paid in December 1996.</P>

      <P>The answer is no.  The legislative position is set out in Council Directive 92/116/EEC of 17 December 1992 amending and updating Directive 71/118 on health problems affecting the production and placing on the market of fresh poultry meat.  In a series of annexes to that directive are set out <i>inter alia</i>, the general and special conditions for the approval of premises for the slaughter and handling of poultry meat, for its packaging, storage and transport and for accompanying documentation. This legislative position is applicable throughout the European Union.</P>

      <P>The position is that Council Regulation (EC) No. 894/96, which came into force on 1 July 1996 provides for the exclusion from the various bovine headage and premium schemes of certain producers found to be in breach of the EU regulations relating to hormones and beta-agonists.  These regulations provide for the exclusion of producers from these schemes for one calendar year in the case of a first offence and for a period of up to five years in the event of any subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>Since July 1996, seven farmers have been found to be in breach of these regulations and consequently payments under the 1996 bovine headage and premia schemes will be refused in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made in providing computer facilities in relation to identification and tracing of bovine animals.  Deputies will be aware that I recently launched a new computer facility which has been made available to my control staff at meat plants and export points throughout the country to enable them to validate the identity of male animals being presented.</P>
      <P>In addition, arrangements are well advanced for establishing a single computer file which will bring together relevant information on all cattle from data which is already available on various departmental computer systems or which is amenable to being readily input to a computer. This new system, which will be known as the Animal Location File, ALF, will be available to the Department's control staff throughout the country around the end of the year.  It will include data from the following sources: database of headage/premium schemes, animals recorded in ERAD special category herds, animals registered under the new calf registration system, animal slaughtering at meat plants and local abattoirs and animals exported live.</P>
      <P>These measure will provide significant additional reassurance as regards the origin and status of cattle and beef.  The provision of a comprehensive and computerised system of full traceability for cattle, incorporating data on all individual animal movements, will take some time.  A departmental group will shortly complete its consideration of all aspects of the requirements of such a computerised system.  I will give priority to putting that system in place at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the electronic tagging of animals, I refer the Deputies to the major initiative, known as &ldquo;IDEA&rdquo; recently launched by the EU Commission in that regard.  The Commission will select and provide funding for projects throughout the Union involving large scale and extensive research on the use of electronic animal identification devices, inserted both externally and internally, over a three year period.  It is prudent to await the outcome of that research <Col N="884" /> and the resulting proposals of the Commission on the type of electronic animal identification system to be adopted for use in the member states of the Union.</P>
    <P>In regard to cattle identity cards, their use, with eartage identity, has been essential over the years for purposes of animal identification and disease testing arrangements, marketing of animals and premium/headage schemes.  A revised identity card was introduced earlier this year under the new national plastic tagging and computerised calf registration systems.  Cattle identity cards continue to be important for the purposes mentioned.  However, it may well be that when we have a comprehensive and computerised system of cattle traceability, up and running, the present card system may then no longer be required.</P>

    <P>The setting aside of land forms part of the EU system of support for producers of arable crops which was introduced as part of the reform of the CAP.  The rules relating to the scheme are laid down in European Union legislation and it is not open to individual member states to change these rules unilaterally.  The setaside rate is subject to annual review depending on the market.  The future role of setaside as a supply control measure will, no doubt, be considered as part of any future reform of the CAP.</P>

      <P>Illegal growth promoters seized under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, are now held in a dedicated and secure facility pending disposal.  My Department's practice is to tender for disposal of these substances among specialist contractors who then dispose of the material outside the State, in accordance with the relevant legislation governing the disposal of such products.  Similar arrangements are used in the <Col N="887" /> storage and disposal of other veterinary medicines seized under the Act.  A large quantity of animal remedies were disposed of at the end of 1995 and it is envisaged that further such products will be disposed of during 1997.</P>
      <P>The arrangements in place are working satisfactorily and I see no reason to change them.</P>

      <P>I am committed to ensuring the live animal export trade takes place in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare. Accordingly, in 1995 I made the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals During Transport) Order which lays down strict provisions in relation to the registration of transporters, conditions regarding loading and unloading of animals, stocking density levels, feeding and watering requirements and the use of trained and experienced staff as well as other general requirements.  The Deputy will be aware that, following a number of serious incidents in relation to exports of live animals to third countries, I also arranged a detailed review of the existing arrangements applicable to the carriage of cattle by sea.  This review was undertaken by officials of both my Department and the Department of the Marine, the Meteorological Office, marine consultants and representatives of live exporters and shippers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> Following the outcome of that review and with effect from 1 February 1996, I introduced the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Order, 1996.  This Order established strict criteria for the approval of boats used for the carriage of cattle by sea, including requirements as to stability construction and deck heights, set out the weather conditions in which such boats may operate and also regulated the drainage, lighting, provisions of supplementary power and other measures designed to protect the welfare of animals being transported by sea.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these two Statutory Instruments have placed the transport of live animals from the State on a secure and defensible footing and I have had a positive effect on the efficiency and safety of this trade.  I am not prepared to authorise any vessel or animal transport vehicle does not comply with the requirements of the two Orders concerned.</P>

The herds in question are immediately placed under official restrictions.  When suspect animals are slaughtered, the brains are immediately taken to the Department's central veterinary research laboratory for examination.  Where BSE is confirmed, the herdowner concerned is notified as soon as possible, as are other bodies in accordance with our obligations under EU and international diseases reporting requirements.

      <P>The current estimated total value of the various headage and premia grants payable to farmers in 1996 under 1996 and previous years' schemes is about £770 million.  Of this amount over £743 million has been paid out to date.  It is expected that a further £12 million will be paid before the end of the year leaving less than 2 per cent of overall grants unpaid.  These unpaid cases involve problems which are unlikely to be resolved between now and the end of December.</P>
      <P>Before payment can issue to any applicant under headage and premium schemes, other than the ewe premium and slaughter premium schemes and applicants with under 15 livestock units, a valid area aid application must be submitted.  As part of the integrated administration and control system, required by the EU, Ireland was committed to developing a new area aid related land parcel identification system, LPIS, in 1996.</P>
      <P>Given the increased levels of checks and controls associated with the new system, it has been a major achievement to secure the highest level of payments ever recorded at this time of year under the various headage and premium schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to give precise details on the number of individual farmers awaiting payment as most farmers apply under more than one of the schemes.  However, payments have been issued to date in the cases of 119,000 of the 131,000 area aid applicants.  Of the balance just over 5,000 are under query relating to milk quota details and some 2,750 are cases which are awaiting field <Col N="891" /> inspection reports.  The remaining area aid applications have problems relating to completion of the application form.  All outstanding cases are being dealt with urgently and payments will continue to be made as queries and problems are cleared up.</P>

      <P>The disallowances referred to were imposed as part of the clearance of the 1991 EAGGF account.  No irregularities are alleged in either case.</P>
      <P>In the case of the £2.78 million disallowance the European Commission considered that proofs of import which have been accepted by the Department were not adequate.  In the other case a disallowance was imposed because of delays in processing and releasing securities.  Both disallowances were strongly argued at the time with the Commission without success.</P>
      <P>Given that no wrongdoing on the part of the companies involved is alleged, I do not feel it would be appropriate or justifiable to name the nine companies involved.</P>
      <P>Since 1991 significant additional resources, including staff, systems and computerisation, have been devoted to the beef export refund area of the Department resulting in significant upgrading of administrative and technical structures.  This investment and upgrading of controls has shown positive results.</P>
      <P>Disallowances on the 1992 account in the beef export refund area amounted to just £76,000 out of an expenditure of £124 million &mdash; 0.06 per cent of the total.  Furthermore, following a more recent intensive systems audit by the Commission of beef export refund expenditure amounting to £428 million pounds, indications are that no disallowances are to be proposed.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am determined to see that there is no recurrence of the levels of antibiotic residue in pigmeat which were detected during the first and second quarters of this year.  A number of steps have been taken in this regard and I would like to fully outline these for the benefit of Deputies and the public generally.</P>
      <P>The Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, which became law on 1 August 1996, require that written records be kept by farmers and producers of every administration of antibiotics to their pigs. Among the details to be explicitly recorded are the expiry dates of the withdrawal periods specific to any antibiotics with which animals may have been treated.  The regulations further make it an offence to sell, supply or slaughter for the purposes of human consumption any animal before the expiry of such withdrawal periods.  My Department is ensuring that all concerned are aware of the regulations, which will be rigorously enforced.</P>
      <P>Consequent on my call on the pigmeat industry to bring forward measures to allay public concern in this area and which would complement the Department's control measures, the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors and the Irish Farmers' Association have agreed to operate, with effect from 4 November 1996, a new control regime having two principal elements.  Pig farmers and producers will supply to processor purchasers, in respect of each batch of pigs sold, a declaration that the said animals are antibiotic-free and, pig processors will undertake an enhanced programme of inplant sampling and will destroy any carcasses testing positive for antibiotics.  In such instances payment will be withheld from the supplier, whose future supplies will be subjected to even more extensive sampling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sampling and testing carried out by the processors will be additional to that carried out by the Department.  All the testing carried out by the processors will be subject to scrutiny and audit by the Department, to which all test results will be made available as a matter of course.  To ensure a consistent and valid approach to inplant testing by the processors, my Department has agreed that the meat control laboratory at Abbotstown will brief key technical personnel <Col N="894" /> nominated by each of the companies on testing methodology.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for effectively addressing and eliminating this problem does not rest solely with Government.  Government will of course play its full role but others also have clear responsibilities and must face up to them.  It is as much in the interests of those who produce and process pigmeat to ensure that the product is offered to the consumer free of antibiotics as it is the entitlement of consumers to expect that this will be the case.  This is not just what might be termed a &ldquo;consumer issue&rdquo; but rather one which confronts those within the industry, producers and processors alike, who have a genuine concern for its current and furture well-being.  Consumers will have been reassured by the commitments given by both the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors and the Irish Farmers' Association and are entitled to expect that such commitments are being fully delivered on by both organisations.  I will closely monitor developments to ensure that this is indeed the case.</P>
    <P>While IFA represents virtually all pig producers, there are some pig processors who are not members of the IAPP.  The Department has, accordingly, sought confirmation that these companies will also implement the IFA-IAPP agreed regime described above.  If they do not, my Department will have implemented an equivalent regime at these plants.</P>
    <P>As a fourth step, contacts have taken place between the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors and feedstuff suppliers with a view to eliminating the risk of residues arising consequent on animals having been fed with medicated feedstuffs.  Further discussions are expected and my Department has indicated to the IAPP its support and, if necessary, assistance in this process.  I will seek assurances that these contacts have had a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>As a fifth step, my Department is currently operating an enhanced level of residue surveillance at pigmeat plants.  All carcases sampled are detained pending test results. Carcases testing &ldquo;positive&rdquo; are condemned and will not enter the food chain.  Finally, control and inspection procedures operating by my Department in relation to pigmeat will in due course be monitored by the newly appointed Food Safety Board.</P>
    <P>Where breaches of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, are detected, whether in relation to failure to keep records, to observe withdrawal periods or to comply with any other provision, my Department will pursue prosecutions against those responsible.  The penalties which the court may apply for offences under the regulations extend to a fine of up to £1,000 and-or one year imprisonment on summary conviction or, on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £100,000 and-or ten years imprisonment for a first offence or a fine of up to £250,000 and-or ten years imprisonment for <Col N="895" /> second or subsequent offence.  I would like to take this opportunity to put those who might contemplate breaching the regulations on notice that my Department is committed to vigorously pursuing prosecutions in this area.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that Ireland's residue surveillance programme is conducted pursuant to and EC Directive, its procedures are in line with those operating in other member states and the annual plan is approved each year by the European Commission.  The results of sampling or testing are reported each year to the Commission and I have already publicly indicated that results of residue testing will be published on a regular basis in future.</P>
    <P>Preliminary indications are that pursuant to the action taken earlier by my Department there has been a significant reduction in the instances of residues in pigmeat compared to the exceptional situation earlier this year.  I expect that the arrangements introduced by IAPP-IFA with effect from 4 November 1996 will effect a further substantial improvement which will ensure the elimination of antibiotic residues in pigmeat. Deputies can be assured that I will be seeking the full, continuing co-operation of producers and processors alike to bring this situation about without any delay.</P>
    <P>I again stress the particular responsibility of pig farmers and producers in this context.  Common sense would dictate that producers should also build a significant margin of safety onto the withdrawal period, so as to be doubly sure that their pigs will be antibiotic free when presented for slaughter.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of my total commitment to having this problem eliminated, not alone in the interests of consumers but also in the interests of the pigmeat sector itself.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to establish the Food Safety Board of Ireland was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Health, in October last.  Pending the enactment of the necessary primary legislation to give effect to that decision an interim board has been set up under the aegis of the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's primary function will be to <Col N="896" /> monitor and assess the effectiveness of the controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance by the food industry with best practice in food safety and hygiene.  In this respect, it will have an independent auditing and supervisory role in relation to the food control and inspection functions of all Departments and agencies and the authority to make decisions binding on these bodies in regard to any aspect of those functions.  It will thus have final overall responsibility for ensuring that the control and inspection functions are established and carried out in accordance with best practice.</P>
    <P>It will not, however, assume any of the primary functions of these bodies and consequently the question of transferring staff and-or resources from my Department to it does not arise.  My Department and I will, of course co-operate fully with the board in the exercise of its functions.</P>

      <P>When a case of BSE is confirmed in an animal, it is policy to slaughter the entire herd in which that animal is located together with its birth cohorts and progeny.  Accordingly, when an animal has been bought in from another herd, the normal practice is that only its progeny and birth cohorts, if any, which remain in the herd of origin are slaughtered under my Department's depopulation policy.  This procedure is based on current scientific evidence which suggests that these animals are likely to be at a greater risk of subsequently contracting the disease.  However, in cases where the animal concerned has only recently moved from another herd prior to confirmation of the disease, it is the policy to slaughter out that herd also as well as the herd in which the animal was present at the time of confirmation of the disease.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a common organisation of the market in potatoes has been on the table since 1992.  As no progress had been made towards an agreement, the Irish Presidency introduced a compromise for consideration at its Council of Ministers' meeting on 18 November <Col N="897" /> 1996.  Following discussion in the Council it emerged that there was not qualified majority support either for the original or the compromise proposal.  It will now be a matter for the incoming Presidency to consider how to progress the matter.</P>

No payments have been made in either of these cases so far.  By virtue of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) Order 1992, I am empowered to postpone consideration of an application for compensation in respect of any animal, pending the institution or determination of a prosecution for an offence under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1996, or to make a deduction in such compensation, estimated to be the amount of any loss to the Exchequer where there is failure by the applicant to take reasonable precautions to protect against the disease.</P>

      <P>On 3 March 1996, I launched two new schemes to promote amenity and urban forestry.  These schemes are the urban woodland scheme and the amenity woodland scheme.</P>
      <P>Prior to this, two pilot urban woodland projects were established in counties Limerick and Wexford.  The Limerick project was a partnership between Shannon Development, Limerick Corporation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the local business community.  The Wexford project was developed under the Department's planned recreational forestry scheme which has since been replaced by the two new schemes which I mentioned above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards these schemes, 13 applications have been received under the urban woodland scheme <Col N="899" /> and ten under the amenity woodland scheme.  The areas referred to in the applications under the urban scheme are located in Cork (8), Dublin (2), Louth (2) and Wicklow (1).  The amenity scheme applications were received from Kilkenny (2), Mayo (2) and one each from Cork, Galway, Louth, Meath, Tipperary and Waterford.  These are currently being assessed, which involves detailed consideration of proposals and site visits in each case.  The assessment of cases on hands is well advanced and I expect to make decisions on funding for these early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The existing milk quota regime was reviewed at EU level in 1992 when the Council of Agriculture Ministers agreed that it should be extended to 1 April 2000.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has indicated that a review of both quota and price policies in the dairy sector will begin in 1997 and I have pressed the Commission to come forward with their proposals as early as possible.  As part of the preparation for this, I invited a representative group from the dairy sector and the academic world to work with my Department in reviewing the relevant longer-term issues and the range of options likely to best suit Irish conditions.  The work of this group is ongoing.</P>

      <Quest>the number of animals which reverted to the national suckler quota in 1995 and to date in 1996 under the 70 per cent rule; and his projections of the impact, if any, on farmers of the 90 per cent rule.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU regulations applicable in 1994 and 1995, producers holding suckler cow quota rights had to make use of at least 50 per cent of those rights in any one of two consecutive years.  Otherwise the part not used during the second year reverted to the national reserve where it became available for distribution to priority categories of producer identified by the quota review group under the 1996 national reserve.  Use in this context included making application for premium payments in respect of those rights or leasing out the rights or a portion of the rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, the EU regulations required that holders of suckler cow quota greater than seven use at least 70 per cent of that quota every year. Farmers with quotas of seven or less had to use at least 70 per cent in any one of two consecutive years.  Otherwise the part not used reverted to the national reserve where it will become available for distribution to priority categories of producer <Col N="901" /> identified by the suckler cow quota review group under the 1997 national reserve.  The exceptions to these rules were farmers who joined the farmer retirement scheme or farmers who could demonstrate that they could not make the required use of their quotas because of exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has recently decided that, with effect for 1997 and 1998 farmers with quotas greater than seven must use at least 90 per cent of their quotas each year.  The part not used will revert to the national reserve but will not be available for distribution to priority categories for a period of two years.</P>
    <P>Fifteen thousand suckler cow quota rights were returned to the 1996 national reserve because of non-usage in 1994 and 1995.  The position in relation to usage of quota rights in 1996 under the 70 per cent rule is not yet fully established. At this stage it is estimated that some 2,351 farmers with quotas greater than seven who applied for the suckler cow scheme in May 1996 did not make the required use of their quotas. The total number of rights involved is 17,556.  It is estimated that about 1,000 further unused rights will be identified following processing of suckler cow scheme application received in the October 1996 application period.  All farmers identified as not having made the required use of their quotas in 1996 will be written to over the coming weeks and asked to explain the reasons for non-usage.  Farmers who can demonstrate that they could not make use of their rights because of exceptional circumstances will be allowed retain their quotas in 1997.  It is expected that up to 50 per cent of the unused rights identified will fall into this category and that no more than about 9,000 rights will ultimately revert to the national reserve where they will become available for distribution, under the 1997 national reserve, to priority categories of producers recently identified by the quota review group and announced by me last week.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, at this stage, to predict what impact the 90 per cent usage requirement in 1997 and 1998 will have on the 1998 and 1999 national reserves.  Producers who have surplus quota can of course protect their quotas either by buying additional suckler cows, or by leasing or transferring any surplus quota.  My Department will notify individual producers over the coming weeks advising them of the new arrangements for 1997 and 1998.  In addition, those farmers who can demonstrate that they could not make the required use of their quotas due to exceptional circumstances will be allowed to retain the rights in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>A number of meetings have taken place between my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to proposed natural heritage areas (NHAs) farmer compensation of approximately £30 per hectare, subject to a maximum of 40 hectares, is available through a special supplementary measure to the rural environment protection scheme (REPS).  This is, of course, in addition to the basic REPS premium of approximately £125 per hectare.  Such farmers are required to comply with the conditions for the conservation of the proposed NHA.  Conditions have recently been agreed for the conservation of blanket bogs, heaths and upland grasslands proposed as designated NHAs under REPS.  The conservation conditions concerned were agreed by a committee I established which had representation from my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht as well as from farming and conservation interests.  I consider that, through the application of this REPS measure, farmers are protected against any potential income losses resulting from NHA designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is currently in the process of <Col N="903" /> transposing into national law the EU Habitats Directive which provides for the designation of special areas of conservation (SACs).  The matters of farming conditions to be applied in such areas and farmer compensation are, obviously, important elements of this designation process.  To this end discussions are currently ongoing between my Department, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and farming interests.  To date meetings have been held with both the main farming organisations and I understand further discussions are proposed.  The objective is to arrive at a package of measures which will compensate farmers adequately for any income losses resulting from SAC designations.</P>

      <P>I indicated to the Deputy in reply to earlier questions on this matter that I would arrange for a full investigation of this matter by senior officials of my Department.  Their report is now completed.  However, High Court proceedings have been initiated against my Department by a former employee of the company concerned in this case.  The outcome of these High Court proceedings may have implications for the Department's ultimate conclusions on this case.  In the meantime I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter at present.  As previously promised at a committee hearing I intend to correspond with the Deputy on this matter as it develops and I expect to communicate with him shortly.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, on foot of the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development, new mechanisms have been established to deal with the development of access and related infrastructural work on the offshore islands, which was identified as a priority issue and towards which the Government made available an additional £1 million this year.  Island access projects are selected and prioritised by the islands committees of the relevant local authorities. These projects are then assessed by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee and recommendations regarding funding subsequently made.  Funding in respect of each priority access project is allocated to the relevant local authorities in accordance with normal Government accounting requirements.</P>
      <P>While I am supportive of the proposal for an examination of the potential for an airstrip at Inishbofin, certain administrative procedures must be undertaken initially.  When these are completed, I hope to be in a position to announce the allocation of funding to this project.</P>

      <P>Lists indicating the current membership of the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, IAAC, and the National Committee for Development Education follow.</P>
      <P>In the case of the IAAC, the term of office of the existing committee has just expired and a new membership is due to be appointed.  The makeup of the new committee will reflect a balance between continuity, to ensure that the existing work of the committee is not disrupted, and some change, to facilitate broad participation in the work of this committee.  Care will be taken to ensure the committee membership includes the combination of experience and expertise necessary to address the complex issues of world development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> The Irish Aid Advisory Committee administrative staff comprises one full-time position of executive secretary and one part-time position of secretarial assistant to the executive secretary.</P>
    <P>The term of office of the current National Committee for Development Education will expire on 1 October 1997.  From the outset, the membership profile of the committee was intended to ensure appropriate representation from the various groups and organisations concerned with development education.  In making the appointments to the committee in 1994, and in filling subsequent vacancies, due weight has been given to ensuring this.  The majority of the members of the committee serve in a representative capacity and the following list indicates in each case the representative role played by the committee member.  The committee makes grants to fund development education projects; it also has a role in promoting improved development education.  To assist the committee in these roles, the NCDE has a full-time staff complement of five.</P>

      <P>There is a wide range of incentives for business development and risk investment.  These generally take the form of grant or subsidy schemes involving direct Exchequer subvention or tax reliefs involving tax revenue forgone. Information on the various grant and subsidy schemes currently available is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and other relevant Ministers.</P>
      <P>The principal tax incentives for business development are: the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing industry and certain internationally traded services; the 30 per cent rate of corporation tax for annual company or group income up to £50,000, introduced this year to assist small businesses operating in the services sectors; a reduced rate of capital gains tax of 27 per cent for equity investments of at least three years duration in small and medium-sized enterprises; capital gains tax rollover relief which assists entrepreneurs moving from one business to another by deferring any capital gains tax liability arising on such a move; capital gains tax retirement relief on the disposal of business interests by persons over 55 years of age; capital gains tax and stamp duty reliefs for company restructuring; capital acquisitions tax relief on the transfer of business assets by gift or inheritance; the business expansion scheme, which provides income tax relief for investors in companies operating in targeted areas of economic activity; the seed capital scheme, which is an income tax refund scheme aimed at encouraging enterprise in specified areas of economic activity; capital allowances for investment in plant, machinery and industrial buildings, including hotels, and tax incentives for investment in commercial, residential and certain industrial buildings in designated urban renewal areas and in designated seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to improving the tax environment for the business sector in the light of the evolving budgetary situation and the need to devote resources to reducing income tax, particularly for those in lower paid employment. Reductions in income tax will assist business development and employment by reducing payroll costs.</P>

The chairman of the Border Regional Authority is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee ensures that any concerns regarding the operation of the programme are addressed.  It has no such concerns in relation to the additionality of actions under INTERREG.  There are, inevitably, perceptual problems and these are addressed as they arise.  At a special meeting involving the Border Regional Authority's EU operational committee in July last my Department, in conjunction with Esben Poulsen of DG XVI, involved the operational committee in an ongoing process which will have the effect of bringing greater clarity to the question of the additionality of EU funding to the region.</P>

In my last budget I stressed the role that the work and enterprise of our society has in generating the necessary wealth to build and sustain a community so that the young and the old, the sick and the disabled, can remain part of our community with a sense of purpose and belonging.  However, I cannot make any commitment at this stage as to what may be provided for in my 1997 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The recent decision not to re-establish a paediatric liver transplantation in this country was taken following a detailed study by the Department, undertaken in consultation with management, medical and nursing representatives from Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, and St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin.  My Department also commissioned extensive international research into the issue and had discussions with leading specialists from the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Paediatric liver transplants were previously carried out at Our Lady's Hospital under the National Liver Transplant Programme which commenced in 1985.  By 1990 it had become apparent that the initial results achieved by the paediatric component of the programme were poor.  Four out of five children had died.  One of the principal reasons advanced was that Ireland did not generate sufficient cases to support a viable programme with appropriate expertise.</P>
      <P>From March 1991 paediatric patients from Ireland requiring liver transplantation have been referred to King's College Hospital, London, under an agreement with Camberwell Health Authority.  The Department has concluded, following a comprehensive review of the issue, that it would not be appropriate at this point to re-establish a paediatric liver transplant programme in this country.  The Department is mindful of the excellent and comprehensive service which King's College Hospital continues to provide, achieving success rates which compare favourably with other transplant centres in Europe.  Also, in line with the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the Department considers that the overriding priority in considering the development and organisation of a viable paediatric liver transplant programme in Ireland must be the quality of care and outcome for patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that one of the critical success factors in the delivery of a quality paediatric liver transplant programme is the level of transplant <Col N="913" /> activity in such a programme.  The Department has concluded, based on recommendations from the representatives of Our Lady's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital and from acknowledged experts in the field of paediatric liver transplantation, that the average number of suitable transplants under a transplant programme serving Irish based patients would not exceed two cases per annum.  It has been established that this level of activity would be very low in the European context, thereby raising a concern over the ability of a transplant programme with such low numbers to maintain the required level of expertise.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the social costs of undergoing a liver transplant at King's College Hospital are considerable.  Hospital accommodation and separation from other family members creates additional stress and expense for patients and their families.  Accordingly, my Department has invited proposals from Our Lady's Hospital and St. Vincents Hospital as to practical improvements which might be put in place to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is a strong commitment among the management, surgical, medical and nursing staff at Our Lady's Hospital to the provision of a quality paediatric liver service.  It is also acknowledged that Our Lady's Hospital continues to provide a comprehensive tertiary referral service including per and long-term post operative care for all the paediatric liver transplant cases.  The question of re-establishing a paediatric liver transplant programme will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <Col N="914" /> In 1996 the Western Health Board estimates that the cost of the home help scheme will be £1,727,954.  The cost in 1994 and 1995 was £1,437,664 and £1,594,954 respectively.  The number of home helps employed in the Western Health Board for each of the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 is as follows:</P>

    <P>The Western Health Board has recently carried out a comprehensive review of their home help services which included an assessment of the dependency levels of those in receipt of the service.  A framework is now in place to identify low, medium and high dependency levels of clients to whom specific hours are committed reflective of their need.  Based on their dependency rating the home help client is to receive five, seven or nine hours home help per week.  This is in line with the average in other health boards.  In addition, this framework has enabled the board to increase the hourly rate of pay to £2 an hour, effective from 30 September 1996.  This increase was made possible by the additional funding of £100,000 made available by my Department to the board earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The revised framework was discussed with the board's public health nursing staff and a number of existing home help clients to establish their views on the proposals.  Those canvassed have expressed unqualified support for the revised scheme.  I am satisfied that this revised scheme has allowed the board to standardise their home help services in line with other health boards and to provide a more equitable service to the elderly in their catchment area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following tabular statement.  The Deputy will be aware that I made available an additional allocation of £5 million for the waiting list initiative in September.  This allocation has allowed health agencies to increase the level of additional work undertaken to reduce waiting times for hospital treatment in the September-December period.</P>

      <P>Drumanagh promontory fort, which is the subject of a preservation order under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, is situated on privately owned lands.  During the course of regular inspections earlier this year, it was revealed that works were being carried out without consultation with the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service of my Department.  These works on the periphery of the site consisted of minor digging in search of a well and the erection of fencing to secure the lands.  The occupier of the lands was warned both orally and in writing to desist from any works which would infringe the terms of the preservation order.  Recent inspections indicate that this warning has been complied with and that there is no evidence of removal of stone from the 19th century martello tower.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my statement in the Dáil last week, the regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, to transpose the EU Habitats Directive into Irish law will not come into effect until February 1997, in order to allow for adequate consultation with farming organisations and other interested groups.  I am very aware of the concerns of the farming organisations in these sensitive negotiations and, having listened to the views expressed.  I can now confirm that I will sign the regulations next February.</P>

      <P>The Inis Mór water supply scheme is one of the projects included in an application to the European Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance for water and sewerage schemes under Stage 1 of the Connemara Environment Project. To date no decision has been received.  Pending the Commission's decision, and having regard to the existing level of commitments under the water and sewerage programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve the schemes included in the application.  Last year my Department approved a grant of £150,962 for site investigation works, including the drilling of test wells at Turloughmore.  These are currently being used to augment the island's supply during periods of peak demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 115 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to all children with special educational needs, including those who are integrated in mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that substantial progress has been achieved in this area.  Measures which I have introduced at primary level include: the appointment of an additional 241 remedial teachers bringing the total now in place to 1,188 and the appointment of an additional 39 resource teachers bringing the total number in place to 46.</P>
      <P>This year, my Department will recruit a further three visiting teachers for children of the travelling community and an additional two visiting teachers to cater for the needs of children who suffer from visual or hearing impairment and Down's syndrome children.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial and resource areas.  It is my intention to continue this process as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the policy outlined in the White Paper on Education, it is stated that the psychological service for schools will be expanded.  It is envisaged that the provision of <Col N="938" /> this service will be a function of the proposed education boards.</P>
    <P>My Department's psychological service was expanded substantially in 1995, when ten additional psychologists were recruited.  These psychologists were assigned to primary schools, with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  Any further expansion of this service will take place on a phased basis and in the context of Government decisions on public sector numbers.</P>
    <P>As further development becomes possible, the needs of children, including those with learning and other difficulties, will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>At present, the lead responsibility for psychological assessment services for children in national schools, where such are deemed necessary, rests with the regional health boards through the appropriate Director of Community Care.</P>

      <P>There are 37 psychologists employed in the Department of Education's service at present.  Of these, 20 are working mainly in second level schools, 14 are in primary schools, and there are three psychologists in a supervisory, senior, capacity.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the Department of Education's service is only available at present in a limited number of areas.  These are in Dublin, Cork City and in Limerick City.  Priority is given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  In addition, the pilot service established in 1990 in South Tipperary and in West Tallaght/Clondalkin has been continued as a permanent service.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Department of Education's service, the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee employs four psychologists, one of whom is at senior level, for schools within its scheme and County Dublin Vocational Committee employs two psychologists for a similar purpose.</P>
      <P>Psychological services are also provided by the health authorities.  For children in national schools, it is the responsibility of the appropriate regional health board director of community care to arrange for psychological intervention where such is deemed necessary.  These services are provided in clinical and other settings by the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>Psychologists are also employed by the National Rehabilitation Board and by many of the voluntary bodies who manage special schools. The funding for these services comes from the health authorities and information on numbers and ratios would be a matter for these authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, since all of the information required is not available to my Department, it is not possible to provide the number of <Col N="939" /> psychologists per 100,000 pupils as requested in the question.</P>

      <P>Judge Lynch originally wrote to me in July 1995 requesting that he be relieved of his membership of the Special Criminal Court panel but kindly agreed at that time to remain on the panel.  Judge Lynch subsequently made a request to be removed from the panel on 2 July 1996.  Following receipt of this letter, a draft letter of acknowledgement was submitted to my office but I returned this to the courts division with a request to see earlier papers as I was considering Judge Lynch's request.  In July, after receipt of Judge Lynch's letter, a draft memorandum for Government was also prepared in the courts section but was not finalised.  This matter is dealt with at page two of the Report of the Inquiry into the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch from the Special Criminal Court panel.  A new draft memorandum was sent to me by the courts division of my Department on 30 July 1996 in connection with the delisting of the judge.  This was accompanied by a covering note requesting my approval for action.  I authorised this <Col N="942" /> memorandum to be submitted to Government and it was approved at the Government meeting on 1 August 1996.</P>

      <P>The importance of the human resources factor in this overall framework cannot be underestimated and so, in an effort to ensure that our strategies in this regard are cohesive and realistic, my Department has undertaken careful examination of the current state of play regarding human resources development issues, and has investigated where national policy in this regard should lead in the future.  To assist in this work, numerous consultations with interested parties were conducted throughout the past year.  As a result, the drafting process has been extremely time-consuming.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question is tantamount to asking for the job approvals figures for the relevant agencies for the <Col N="944" /> past ten years.  As the Deputy may be aware, the practice of using job approvals as a measure of agency performance was discontinued in the 1980s, with the more realistic measure of first time jobs being substituted.  More recently, of course, net job creation is now also used.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of jobs which have materialised over the past ten years, this is equivalent to actual gross job creation by the agencies and these figures are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, unfortunately, to give an indication of &ldquo;outstanding jobs&rdquo; in terms of the difference between jobs approved and those created.  In any event, as indicated in the debate in the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on this topic last week, in the commercial world projects do not evolve precisely as planned and it is not realistic to think in terms of jobs that do not come on stream as being &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo;.  I also indicated in that debate that a once off survey of projects with more than 150 employees showed that by October 1996 (a) that 51 per cent of the jobs in projects announced in 1995 were in place and (b) that 28 per cent of the jobs in projects announced to date in 1996 were already in place.  Clearly, any implication that these announcements relate to &ldquo;phantom&rdquo; jobs is unjustified.  In addition, of course, agency performance clauses ensure that the Exchequer only pays for the jobs that do materialise.</P>

      <P>The source of Minister Fitzgerald's comments are the results of the Labour Force Surveys (ILO basis) of 1994 and 1995.  These surveys show that the number of persons more than one year unemployed, which is the general definition of long-term unemployment, fell from 127,400 in 1994 to 102,100 in 1995.  The Government has not to date been approached regarding the European Full Employment appeal and as such the question of signing such an appeal has not formally been considered by Government.  However, full employment is a goal of the Government and my Department is actively pursuing policies in this regard.</P>

The Commission approved this proposal in its entirety, and I announced the details in October 1995.

The inclusion of <Col N="949" /> these townlands would have caused the group of townlands in this area to exceed the land quality limit, and consequently they had to be omitted in order to ensure that the other townlands satisfied all the criteria and would be acceptable to the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>In 1978, following a wide-ranging Windscale inquiry under Mr. Justice Parker, full <Col N="950" /> planning permission was granted to BNFL by the UK authorities for the construction of the THORP Plant.  The EC Directive 85/337/EC of 1985 dealing with Environmental Impact Assessment did not take effect until 1988 in the UK.  Therefore, the THORP plant did not come within the terms of the 1985 Directive.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this the Government in 1993 took part in a public consultation process and at that time it was requested that an EIA be undertaken prior to the commissioning of THORP.  Subsequently, in March 1994 the UK High Court confirmed that the EIA Directive did not apply to the THORP project.  It is a grave disappointment, therefore, that despite Irish and other objections THORP was allowed to proceed without an EIA.</P>

      <P>A consortium of consultants is at present working on the detailed arrangements for a competition to be held for the peat-fired electricity generating station.  The competition will be for the award of a contract for the purchase of electricity from the new power station &mdash; the steam of income from the contract will enable the winning bidder to finance the construction and operation of the station, which will be owned by the winning bidder.</P>
      <P>The consultants are due to report with their proposals for the competition by the end of this month, and on the basis that their recommendation is accepted, the competition will be held in the new year.</P>
      <P>Until the consultants report it will not be possible to say precisely how long the competition will take or when the contract will be awarded &mdash; interim indications from the consultants suggest that the winning developer is likely to be identified towards the end of 1997.</P>

      <P>As President-in-Office of the Council of Transport Ministers, I will chair a transport council on 12 December, 1996.  The Commission White Paper on a strategy for revitalising the Community's railways will feature as a substantive item on the agenda for that Council.  As President of the Council, it is my responsibility to ensure a full and balanced debate, taking a neutral approach to the issues under discussion.</P>
      <P>Ireland has generally welcomed the White Paper, particularly because of the impetus it has given to the debate on the future of the rail sector at European level.  The White Paper highlights in particular the serious and continuing decline of rail's market share in relation to its main competing modes.  It sets out a broad range of measures and proposals aimed at arresting and reversing that decline.  Ireland fully supports these aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures and proposals in the White Paper are detailed, complex and wide ranging.  It is the Commission's intention to bring them forward on a phased basis over the next few years.  Many of the proposals will involve new legislation or amendments to existing legislation. These will have to go through the normal institutional procedures of the European Union, including approval by the Council of Ministers. Ireland will of course participate fully in the consideration of these proposals and will assess individual measures on their merits, and in the <Col N="952" /> light of the impact they can be expected to have on our national interests.</P>

      <P>Since the establishment of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, all member state airlines are free to operate on any international route within the European economic area without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.  The regional airports, including Galway Airport, are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Galway, Kerry, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.  So far operating contracts have been awarded for Galway-Dublin, Kerry-Dublin and Donegal-Dublin routes.  In so far as Galway Airport is concerned Aer Lingus is contracted to provide two daily round trips.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, in order to assist the regional airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airport during 1993 and 1995.  Furthermore, arising from financial and other difficulties being experienced by most of Ireland's privately owned regional airports, a review of policy relating to these airports was carried out by my Department earlier this year.  As a result of this review the Government approved a strictly time limited scheme of Exchequer grants totalling £2.35 million over the four years 1996 to 1999 for the six regional airports to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports.</P>

      <P>Given that Ireland's mining history dates back to the Bronze Age &mdash; 2000-500 BC &mdash; there are many worked-out or abandoned mines throughout the country.  Their condition varies considerably according to their history and geology.  It is primarily a matter for local tourism and heritage interests to consider whether any worked-out or abandoned mine could affordably, environmentally and safely be used as a heritage tourist attraction, for which planing permission would be needed.</P>
