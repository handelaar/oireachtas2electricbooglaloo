      <P>There are four matters to put to the House.  Is the proposal for the late sitting satisfactory?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 5 satisfactory?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 6 satisfactory? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Private Members' Business satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for interceding yesterday to resolve the problems encountered in dealing with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill, 1996.  I understand the House will sit earlier on Tuesday <Col N="1386" /> to deal with it.  That is satisfactory and appreciated.  In light of the commitment in the programme for Government to put structures in place and provide funding to deliver effective and accountable local government, when can we expect to see the Government's proposals and any legislation necessary dealing with the funding of local government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the secret is.  I am sure the Taoiseach knows if there are legislative proposals.  Will they form part of or be published in advance of the budget?  We are only three weeks away from the start of the new financial year and councillors throughout the country are dealing with the issue of local authority finances for 1997.  This is a matter of great importance to the local administrative system.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A major reform of local government is being undertaken in respect of its functions, internal functioning, democratic mandate and how this is expressed.  We are also dealing with the issue of its financing.  A combination of administrative and legal changes may flow from this.  The Government first has to decide on the policy issues involved.  We expect to do this very soon.  Any administrative or legal changes which flow from them will be carried through with speed.  As the Deputy correctly said, the Government has made local government reform one of its priorities.  It is one of the key elements of the programme for Government on which it will deliver.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the compellability of witnesses legislation.  As the Taoiseach is aware, a committee of this House cannot carry out an effective inquiry unless that legislation is passed.  When I raised this matter yesterday with the Minister for Finance and said that this Bill is still in committee because the Government did not bring forward amendments he said I was putting a twist on it, but that was not the case.  I checked with the committee and the Bills Office and was told that the Government amendments have not been brought forward.  When will we see them?  In the meantime will the Government put in place proposals to ensure that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which will inquire into the allegations relating to Dunnes Stores, can carry out an effective inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government presented this Bill to the House and to the committee, and the committee decided it wished to raise a number of new questions about possible further changes to the Bill.  These are in the form of a report, based on consultancy or advice taken by the committee.  The proposals from the committee were very seriously considered and the Government amendments, which are being prepared and which I hope will be ready before Christmas, represent a response to suggestions by the committee.  The Bill could have been enacted in its original form more quickly, but the committee, quite properly, believed it should undertake a thorough review of the issue and made further proposals.  Those proposals have been considered by the Government whose response will be in the form of amendments which we expect to present before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance told the House yesterday that the Government cleared its amendments more than three weeks ago was that an inaccurate statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy may not take that as an inaccurate statement.  The Government cleared the policy questions underlying the amendments three weeks ago.  Those amendments, which are highly complex, have to be drafted in a form which is robust and sustainable from the point of view of the working of a committee which must exercise the powers conferred on it.  As the Deputy is aware from the preparation of legislation, there are two processes, the policy issues are decided in the form of policy questions and then drafting takes place.  The Minister for Finance referred to the fact that policy decisions were taken on the submission from the committee on all the issues. There were no policy questions to be decided, we have decided the nature of the amendments to be introduced.  They are being drafted by the draftsman and I hope they will be ready before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that until the legislation is introduced a committee of this House cannot carry out an effective inquiry or summon anyone who is not a Member of the House to appear before it to give evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the In Re Haughey case, committees of this House do not have power to compel witnesses.  Even though that has been the case since 1970, while all parties were successively in Government, it was never dealt with.  It is now being dealt with.  While I fully understand the Deputy's impatience, it is important to recognise that this problem has existed all the time she has been in the House, including the time she was in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government believe that new legislation is necessary, or has the Taoiseach proposals to deal with the matter of contract killings?  There have been 14 such killings as well as one in recent days and none of the people who perpetrated those crimes has been apprehended.  Is the Government considering this matter?  Obviously existing legislative measures are not successful and the Garda is unable to come to grips with a very frightening development, mainly in city areas.  It is of grave concern that so many people are being gunned down in broad daylight as well as at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is one of organised crime.  The legislation passed by this House, to which the Opposition contributed during the summer, is part of a very effective package of legislation put in place to deal with organised crime.  Highly professional people administer that legislation and if they advise us that further powers are needed over and above the extensive powers that already exist, they will be provided as a matter of priority.  When next weekend's summit of EU leaders is reported on in the public press Deputies will see that organised crime, within the country concerned and cross-border, is a matter of grave concern in every country in Europe.  It is a high priority issue for political action at every level.  No state can cope with it on its own; we intend to act together as a European Union to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the same view as the Taoiseach on the confiscation of assets, but it appears that since the legislation was passed &mdash; I am not being critical since it is only a few months since it was passed &mdash; the concentration has been on a few people.  Most of those involved in organised crime are well known in communities and the confiscation of assets of a number of those people is probably the way to successfully deal with the matter.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will use his considerable influence to get the authorities to focus on the people involved.  Even <Col N="1389" /> before a person is shot the world knows the details, but there seems to be an inability to deal with the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's point of view on the basis of media reports which highlighted one or two cases.  The Deputy may have the mistaken belief that only one or two cases are being pursued, but the authorities concerned have very widespread use of the powers in hand in regard to a wide range of individuals who may be involved in organised crime.  Naturally every action they take is not publicly reported because, as I am sure the Deputy will understand, prior public advertisement can serve the purposes of those seeking to evade the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed only by reports in the public domain, some of which state that there are four gangs in this city, three of which are under investigation.  In my constituency there are about 20 gangs which are well known and nobody is going after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach said that there are complexities in the drafting of amendments on policy issues relating to the compellability of witnesses legislation.  After all the protracted activity in committee and at Cabinet, will the DPP be compellable to appear before a Dáil committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy issues have been decided, there are no complexities in that regard. It is simply a question of drafting and that is proceeding as a priority.  Our objective is to have the amendments before the committee before Christmas.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation, the Government voted down a Private Members' Bill early in the year which would have enabled the cap on prizes given by charitable lotteries to be removed.  The Taoiseach said he would take action when the report of the committee was available.  That report has been laid before the House.  Under the powers currently available, will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister to raise the limit from £10,000 to at least £100,000 per week, even on an interim basis, to allow charitable lotteries regain some of the moneys they have lost recently?</P>

After Committee Stage in the Seanad we sent the Bill to the local authorities seeking their advice, to facilitate them and to help them ensure they could put the licensing system in place more effectively.  They decided one week would be better than two.  Senator Mulcahy, among others, made a strong case to have it reduced from two weeks to one week.  This will help the licensing system to operate more effectively.  If the period was too long it might be used to avoid licensing the horses.  The period of one week was generally agreed.</P>

We have come <Col N="1400" /> up with a good Bill having taken all aspects into consideration.

(1)  An authorised person or a member of the Garda Síochána who has reasonable cause to suspect that a horse is in such pain, distress or acute state of neglect or so severely injured or diseased as to be in need of veterinary attention, may require the owner or keeper of the horse, or if the owner or keeper is not readily available, a person apparently in charge or control of the horse, to immediately, or as soon as may be, obtain any necessary veterinary attention from a veterinary surgeon for the horse.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with this amendment which seeks to insert a new section. If a garda or somebody else gets veterinary <Col N="1405" /> attention for a particular animal do they have the qualification to decide whether an animal needs attention and, if so, who pays for the attention?  If a garda, an authorised officer or whoever makes a wrong judgment and there is a consequent cost, who pays?  Is the owner of the horse liable or does somebody else pick up the tab?</P>

      <P>The motivation behind this section was animal welfare.  I have no doubt it will be well received by all the animal welfare associations.  It is not confined to control areas, it will apply to the entire country.  The important factor is that an authorised person or a member of the Garda Síochána must have &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; to suspect that a horse is in pain, distress or in an acute state of neglect.  The authorised person or a member of the Garda Síochána will advise the holder or the owner of that animal to seek veterinary attention.  In the event of that person not getting veterinary attention he could be committing an offence and the horse could be confiscated from that person.  It is a strong provision from the point of view of animal welfare.  The owner of the horse will pay for the veterinary attention.  If he did not allow the horse to get into a state of neglect he would not have to pay anything but if the horse is in need of veterinary treatment, the owner, as in all cases, will have to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there an obligation on the Garda Síochána under this section to get whatever necessary veterinary attention is required for the animal or is it under another section?  This section does not seem to place responsibility on the authorised person or a member of the Garda Síochána to seek necessary veterinary attention for the animal, if the person responsible for the animal is not seeking that necessary attention.  The new section which the Minister proposes to introduce gives the Garda Síochána or the authorised person the authority to request the owner or the person who is keeping the horse to seek veterinary attention for the animal.  In the event of that person not seeking the attention this section does not seem to place any responsibility on the authorised person or the Garda Síochána to get it.</P>

      <P>The passing by the Dáil of this Stage of the Bill brings to fruition an extensive process of consultation, research and drafting.  It is the end of a process on which the Government embarked in December 1994 under the programme, A Government of Renewal.  The Bill gives effect to this Government's commitment in the programme to introduce legislation to control wandering horses in urban areas.  It has been drafted and amended to care for the interests of the public, especially motorists, living in urban areas as well as the welfare of horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate that this legislation will provide a more secure and stable environment within which those who are prepared to properly maintain and <Col N="1410" /> control their horses, with due regard to the interests of their neighbours and other members of the community, may derive full use and enjoyment from them.  There is nothing in the Bill which need impede or obstruct anyone who wishes to put in place arrangements for the enjoyment of horses by young people which are based on proper maintenance and control of animals.  In addition, this legislation substantially strengthens the framework of legal protection for horses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those who were supportive of our efforts to have this legislation enacted, including Members of the Oireachtas, many of whom made a range of excellent contributions which have been beneficial to the Bill.  I express my thanks and appreciation to the staff of my Department who worked so hard for such long hours to prepare the Bill for its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I particularly want to thank Deputy Kenneally who introduced his own Bill earlier, as well as Deputies Molloy and Costello who were very helpful on Committee Stage.  Senators also contributed and we effected some important changes to the Bill following advice we received in the Seanad.  Agencies outside the House also deserve recognition.  These include the DSPCA and the ISPCA which helped to provide invaluable advice and direction for which I thank them.  Recent consultations with local authorities throughout the country were helpful in providing us with important advice, as a result of which we corrected omissions that otherwise would have rendered the Bill less effective.  I recognise their interest in the Bill and their response to our call for advice.</P>
    <P>It is an historical day for the House that we have enacted this pioneering legislation.  There is nothing else like it anywhere and its framework will be copied by other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the comments of the Minister of State and thank him and his officials who have been most helpful throughout this long and tortuous process.  It had to be so because, as the Minister of State rightly said, it is new and pioneering legislation and no one would forgive us for not discussing it fully and teasing out the various points to put the best possible legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>When the problem of wandering horses arose recently in my constituency, I was asked when the legislation would be enforced.  People were getting frustrated as the Bill went through the Seanad and the Dáil where it was amended.  I recognise the necessity for all that work which improved the Bill.  I hope it will become effective very soon so that something positive is done to deal with this ongoing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> I thank the Minister of State and his officials for all their help on this matter.  From a procedural point of view, we have a list of Government amendments also and I wonder if they will be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they were incorporated in the Bill.  The most important aspect of this Bill is that we have the money to enact it.  Some £2 million has been included in the Estimates to enact the legislation.  We have been successful both in getting the Bill as well as the finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister of State.  His approach on this legislation was laudable in that he brought all the Deputies who were interested in the legislation together at drafting stage when there was an opportunity to have a considerable input.  That was both wide-ranging and helpful from our point of view.  I pay tribute to Deputy Kenneally who dealt with the legislation from the beginning and made a substantial contribution to it.  With the passage of the legislation, we now consider its implementation.  I am delighted that the local authorities have responsibility and joint funding for fees and ancillary State support.</P>
      <P>What will become of youngsters living in urban housing estates in Ballyfermot, Finglas, Cabra and Ballymun who already own or are involved with horses?</P>
      <P>Members are aware this scourge has caused certain parts of the city to resemble the wild west. We must consider the possibility of providing alternative projects.  Dublin City Council has investigated the corral project and has been in contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in connection with FÁS, the vocational education committee and the local authority acquiring land for this purpose.  This is an important point because, while we prescribe substantial penalties in respect of wandering, lost or abandoned horses there is a tremendous love of horses in my area.  I request the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to become involved in this matter.  It seldom provides grant assistance in connection with urban matters.  This issue involves the provision of support for a corral project for horses in an urban setting.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and Deputies Kenneally and Molloy for their work on this important Bill.  The Minister of State stressed that the welfare of animals will be catered for but he also referred to the public, motorists and people living in urban areas.  I am glad the Bill will soon be enacted, as I am sure are Deputies who live in urban areas, because it provides for registration, confiscation and severe <Col N="1412" /> penalties, which people want introduced as a matter of urgency.  The Minister of State should now consider progressing the issue of the identification of animals.</P>
      <P>I am glad £2 million has been provided in the Estimates to implement these decisions.  If there is a lack of finance, problems will occur.  I urge the Minister of State to consider the start-up date. It would be better if this legislation can be brought into operation sooner rather than later. Local authorities and the Garda often confiscate horses but they are released on to the streets to cause further trouble more rapidly than prisoners from Mountjoy Prison.  I congratulate the Minister of State and also Deputy Kenneally for introducing the initial Bill.  The legislation introduced by the Minister of State is comprehensive, well drafted and a great deal of work went into its framing.  I congratulate those involved and we look forward to speedy implementation of these new measures early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Silence might indicate something so I will join with colleagues in making a number of brief comments.  I appreciate the great care and attention displayed by the Minister of State and his officials in constructing this legislation, which, I hope, will be brought into immediate effect.  I am glad the Minister of State indicated that financial provisions have been made in the Estimates for 1997 to make funding assistance available to local authorities to implement the Bill.  Previous attempts to deal with the problem of wandering horses, particularly in urban areas, have not been very successful.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that there should be effective legislation to curb wandering horses because of the threat to the lives of residents in urban areas and the possibility for maltreatment of animals.  I hope that, between the authorised persons and the Garda, difficulties will not again arise with regard to their ability to round up horses where that is required.  Fears about the personal safety of officials or gardaí involved inhibited this work in the past.  There were also questions regarding whether adequate insurance cover was provided for such individuals in respect of any injuries they might receive during the course of their operations.</P>
      <P>Problems may remain but I urge the Minister of State to bring the Bill fully into effect at the earliest opportunity.  Will he inform us, at his earliest convenience, with regard to the allocation of £2 million provided in the Estimates for 1997 and the circumstances in which local authorities will have access to such funding?  I hope the Minister of State's expectations will be fulfilled when the operation of the Bill is reviewed.</P>

      <P>I am deeply interested in this legislation because parts of my constituency are wracked with the problem of wandering horses.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for introducing the legislation and for sticking to his task during the past two years.  My constituents must contend with this problem on a daily basis and I do not know why they were obliged to wait so long for this legislation.  This problem arose in the early 1980s but previous Governments were not quick to expedite matters. It is outrageous that it took such a long period to place this legislation on the Statute Book.  One must conclude that the horse industry, which is a very powerful vested interest, exercises some strange power over many Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I hope the legislation works.  The parks superintendent in my area has reservations regarding the roundabout way that licensing, etc., will apply in certain areas.  With the provision of funding in the Estimates, I hope that, under the Bill's provisions, the parks superintendent, his staff and the Garda will have access to resources to take action in respect of open spaces and parks, such as Stardust Memorial Park in Coolock, which is being wrecked by wandering horses.  This has been an appalling saga but I congratulate the Minister of State for sticking to his task so well.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials for their excellent work in bringing forward this legislation.  It was stated that the Bill is unique because there is nothing similar on the Statute Book.  Perhaps it will provide a framework for future legislation of this type.  It is important that we have created precedents which may help to resolve similar problems in the future.  The Minister of State engaged in an extensive consultation process, particularly with local authorities, Deputies and organisations outside the House, and the Bill is all the better for it.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in the constituency of Dublin South-West highlight this problem and it is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 wandering horses in Tallaght and Clondalkin, which is frightening.  I congratulate Deputy Kenneally who, as the Opposition spokesperson on this issue, has been consistently positive in respect of the Bill and made a major contribution to it.  Wandering horses on the C Ring route in Dublin south west pose a frightening threat to motorists at night time.  The legislation must be implemented as soon as possible so that this problem can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and all those involved in the preparation of the legislation and I look forward to its speedy implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the format of the birth certificate.  The Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863, introduced a system of civil registration of births.  Form A annexed to that Act set out the particulars to be registered.  That format continues to be used today.</P>
      <P>The format of the birth certificate reflects the social attitudes and mores of the era in which it was designed.  It shows the father's address but ignores that of the mother and records the father's occupation but not that of the mother.  It also asks for the mother's &ldquo;maiden name&rdquo;.  The child's surname is not shown, which gives rise to the widespread presumption that the child takes its father's name.  This format may have been considered entirely appropriate in 1863 when few women worked outside the home, non-marital births were rare and virtually all women assumed their husband's surname on marriage.  However, it is not in keeping with present day society and with the status of women in that society &mdash; for example, today many women work outside the home.  Many women change their name on marriage, as do some men, but this is by no means a universal practice.  It can no longer be assumed a child will be given its father's surname.  In some instances the child will be given its mother's surname, while in others a joint surname is preferred.</P>
      <P>In today's environment the format of the birth certificate is anachronistic and discriminatory. The contents of the birth certificate have been the subject of mounting criticism in recent years. Many people have conveyed to me their sense of outrage that their child's birth must be registered in this way.  Their annoyance is not lessened when they are informed that this is a statutory requirement and that the relevant Act is over 130 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women identified the birth certificate as an area of discrimination against women and recommended that the necessary statutory changes be made to alter its format.  Shortly after its creation, my Department assumed responsibility for a comprehensive review of the legislation on the registration of births, deaths and marriages.  It was obvious from the outset that, because of the age of much of the legislation concerned and the complexity of the issues involved, this review would take some considerable time to complete.  As there was a pressing need for a stillbirths register which <Col N="1415" /> would act as a focus for the grief of bereaved parents, I decided not to have the stillbirths issue await the outcome of the general review but to bring forward the necessary legislation separately.  The Stillbirths Registration Act was enacted early in 1994 with all-party support.</P>
    <P>The general review of the registration legislation is a complex process which cannot be completed in the short term.  As the format of the birth certificate was clearly discriminatory and could be amended in a relatively simple measure, I took the view that this change should also be dealt with in a separate Bill.  I am, of course, fully committed to progressing the general review which is likely to result in extensive changes to the registration legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 1 and the Schedule are the main elements of this Bill.  I will deal with these together as they are closely related.  Section 1 provides that a new format of register entry, as set out in the Schedule, will apply to births registered or re-registered after the commencement date.  Although the Bill makes no reference to the birth certificate itself, the birth certificate automatically reflects the details of the register entry.  The new format set out in the Schedule is similar to the form of the stillbirth certificate.  It is gender neutral.  The new certificate will show the occupations of both parents and will record the mother's address as well as that of the father.  There will no longer be any reference to a &ldquo;maiden name&rdquo;.  Instead, any former names of both mother and father will be recorded.  These will include any changes of name on marriage, by deed-poll or by any other means. Unlike the existing birth certificate, the new certificate will show the child's surname.</P>
    <P>The absence of a surname on the existing birth certificate has led to a widespread belief that a child automatically takes the father's surname. This is not the case as surnames are acquired by reputation and usage and there is no legal requirement or presumption that a child must take its father's name.  However, in order to nail that myth and in keeping with the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, it was decided to include the child's surname in the new format.  Under section 1(3) the surname registered for the child can be that of either mother or father or both. However, a different surname can be registered if either parent so requests and if the Registrar General considers that the circumstances so warrant.  This facility is intended to cover unusual circumstances where the restriction of the choice of surname would create difficulties.  It is not envisaged that this would arise frequently.</P>
    <P>Under the new format, it will still be possible to add a forename or forenames after the initial registration.  This facility covers names given in baptism as well as the small number of cases where no forename is recorded at the initial registration.  The new format will apply to both registrations and re-registrations which are <Col N="1416" /> effected after the commencement date.  There are two types of re-registration.  Under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, the parents of a child legitimated by those parents' marriage are required to have the child's birth re-registered. The second type of re-registration was introduced by the Status of Children Act, 1987.  If the parents of a child are not married to each other and the child's father is not shown in the original register entry, this type of re-registration can be used to add paternity details.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, in the case of re-registration of a birth which has already been registered in the new format, the surname of the child on re-registration remains unchanged.  To avoid unnecessary re-registrations, the requirement to re-register under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, is waived if, as a consequence of the change in format, the new entry would be identical to the previous entry relating to that child.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is a standard provision which allows the Registrar General to prescribe various forms for use for the purposes of this Bill.  Section 3 is a technical provision which is necessary to effect a change in the format of the birth certificate.  It allows the Registrar General to decide how and when register books are to be surrendered by registrars and new ones supplied.  Existing legislation is extremely prescriptive about such matters and does not permit the surrender of incomplete register books.  The introduction of a new format of entry in the births register necessarily entails the opening of new register books.  Without the flexibility provided for in this section, it would not be possible to alter the format of the birth certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 repeals the existing form of the entry in the births register &mdash; Form A annexed to the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863 sets out the particulars to be registered. Sections 5 and 6 contain various amendments and repeals of forms consequential on the change of format of the birth certificate.  Section 7 contains standard provisions about short title, citation, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>This is a short and relatively simple Bill which in essence replaces one set of particulars with another.  It is an important Bill because it has the power to affect every future parent in the State. I have already adverted to the criticism of the present format of the birth certificate and I have received letters describing it as &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo;, &ldquo;grossly insulting&rdquo;, &ldquo;offensive&rdquo;, &ldquo;outmoded&rdquo;, &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;highly unsatisfactory&rdquo;. The new format recognises the equal status of mothers and is appropriate to today's society and to the status of women in that society.  It brings the birth certificate from the mid-19th century to the present day and it gives effect to one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill and I congratulate the Minister and his officials for updating the 1863 legislation.  I am glad that for the first time since 1863 mothers will have equal status on the birth certificate as it was frustrating to treat them differently in this regard. The original legislation was in a different format from that proposed in this Bill.  For the first time, the register will record the address and occupation of the mother and father.  Until now, women were treated as junior partners and the law treated them as chattels.</P>
      <P>We are updating legislation which was enacted on 20 April 1863 during the Victorian period.  The Act for the registration of births and deaths in Ireland states:</P>
      <P>Whereas it is expedient that a complete System of Registration of Births and Deaths should be established in <i>Ireland,</i> as in other Parts of the United Kingdom: &ldquo;Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows...</P>
      <P>It then gives the format and procedures which have been in operation since that time.  This is an interesting historical development for those interested.  The form to which the Act refers gives the date and place of birth, the name, if any, the sex, the name and surname and dwelling place of the father, the name and surname and maiden surname of the mother, the rank or profession of the father, the signature, qualification and residence of the informant, the registration date, the signature of the registrar and the baptismal name, if added after registration of birth, and date.</P>
      <P>We are proposing a new format which is gender neutral and recognises the equal status of women in society.  This Bill deals with the occupation of the father and the mother.  The Schedule deals with the particulars to be registered in a register book, which include the number, the date and place of birth, the sex of the child, the forenames and surnames of the child &mdash; the surname of the child is a new inclusion &mdash; the mother's forename and surname, address and occupation &mdash; the surname is also new &mdash; any former surnames of the mother, the father's forename and surname, address and occupation, and any former surnames of the father, which is also new.  Women and men are now treated equally in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should we include occupation in the particulars to be registered?  Is that not also outmoded?  The Minister said the current register represents outmoded thinking because times have changed and there are many new circumstances. One of these new circumstances is that occupations have changed.  Jobs are no longer for life and many people are unemployed.  Must they write &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; in the Register?  Is it right to categorise people in such a way?  Is this not part <Col N="1418" /> of the 1863 thinking which put people in classes? The 1863 Act refers to the &ldquo;Rank or Profession of Father&rdquo;.  This highlights the social classes which existed at the time.  We have dropped the term &ldquo;rank&rdquo; from the Bill and we have included the occupation of both parents, which should make the Minister happy.  However, is it right to include occupation for either parent?  Will there not be a large numbers of people unemployed for some time?  Who wants to acknowledge that at the time the child was born they were unemployed?  Are we not all equal citizens?  Why should a person be ranked or classified in that way?  It is all right for someone who has a profession or working in the Civil Service.  One might have a nice profession and be a lawyer, a dentist or even a public representative, although I am not sure if that would be a good classification.  I subscribe to the late John F. Kennedy's view that serving in politics is the ultimate in public service and would take issue with anyone who would disagree.</P>
    <P>What type of profession has a spouse who works full-time in the home?  What would he or she write under the heading &ldquo;Address and Occupation&rdquo;?  Would the 628,000 women who work full time in the home write &ldquo;full-time in the home&rdquo;, &ldquo;home-maker&rdquo; or &ldquo;home person&rdquo; under that heading?  Do the provisions of this Bill recognise the work done in the home or are we creating problems by asking such questions on a birth certificate?</P>
    <P>The work environment is much more flexible than in 1863.  In the past people were often known by their occupation.  As a man from the heart of the country, the Acting Chairman, Deputy Foxe, will be familiar with the term &ldquo;Pat the post&rdquo; and many other names by which people were described because of their occupations.  That is no longer the case.  A person's occupation has less value as a distinguishing characteristic than in 1863 or even 20 or 30 years ago.  We remove one type of discrimination by making the legislation gender neutral, but we discriminate in terms of people's occupations.  When trying to provide equal treatment for everyone, why are we concerned about the occupations of parents when their children are born?  I had different occupations when each child was born in our family, and I am sure the same applies to many other Members.  While I welcome the updating of the legislation, I am concerned about that matter.</P>
    <P>A child's surname can be that of the mother or the father.  The Minister pointed out there are already various ways a child can adopt different names, but it is possible to trace a person by name.  However, this may become more difficult as society progresses.  People may need to trace their antecedents for medical reasons.  That matter should be considered more fully on Committee Stage.  We are taking all Stages today, otherwise the Bill would not be passed until some time next year.  This is not ideal because analysis of legislation between Second and Committee Stages can lead to many worthwhile suggestions <Col N="1419" /> from Members, with which the Minister can deal on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposals a person could have a double-barrelled name and parents could have two of their children named &ldquo;Jones&rdquo; and another two named &ldquo;Smith&rdquo;.  Tracing the family tree would be complicated under such circumstances.  People in Spain and other countries in the EU are allowed carry on the names of their fathers and mothers.  While many women here carry on their surnames after marriage, it can lead to complications.  The family tree is likely to become a family bush, but modern society is more to blame for that than the Minister.  A distant relation of mine who returned from the United States had traced our family tree for more than 180 years.  That will be difficult to do in the future.</P>
    <P>It might be desirable to cater for the many new forms of associations, partnerships and short-term relationships of, say, five or ten years.  For medical reasons, the children of such relationships will need to be able to trace their ancestors.  The current system does not cater adequately for such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised in the media about the inclusion of a section for Christian names, the heading used is &ldquo;Forename&rdquo;.  There is a section to include one's baptismal name.  The Minister is attempting to cater for range of circumstances and I have no objection to that.</P>
    <P>The explanatory and financial memorandum outlines staffing and Exchequer implications. There are no staffing implications so the Minister for Finance and everybody else can be happy about that.  The memorandum also states that some additional costs may arise from the preparation of new forms and certificates, but the Exchequer implications will not be significant.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been gender-proofed and there is a section which requires the Department to state the implications this has for gender proofing, so it is a valuable development in that regard.  What about the family impact statement?  There is no such statement here although this legislation has major implications for families.  Indeed, the Minister spoke of change, about mothers and the different kinds of families and said the Second Commission on the Status of Women had expressed great concern about the present arrangements.  However, there is neither a family impact statement nor a routine outline of the implications for families.  That is an important question.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Commission on the Family recommended that all Government papers and decisions should be accompanied by a family impact statement.  The commission referred to this being already done in a straightforward way in Australia and Canada, and perhaps in a slightly different way in Canada. This Bill certainly has implications for families and, while the Minister has covered some of them indirectly in his speech, it would have been <Col N="1420" /> helpful if there was a formal family impact statement attached to the Bill.  If future social legislation was accompanied by a formal family impact statement, it would be a welcome development.</P>
    <P>On the change of &ldquo;maiden name&rdquo; to &ldquo;surname&rdquo;, the inclusion of the maiden name in the Victorian Act was considered to be offensive and people were upset about it.  I congratulate the Minister on removing an inequality that came from an era when it was automatic for the woman's name to change on marriage.  I welcome that change.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spelled out clearly the reasons for the steps he is taking.  One question which came to mind was whether it was possible to merge and consolidate the Stillbirths Registration Bill enacted early in 1994 with all-party support with this Bill subsequent to its enactment.  The Minister mentioned the desirability of dealing with stillbirths' registration because of the pressing need for a register which would act as a focus for the grief of bereaved parents and that is why he decided not to await the outcome of the general review.  That was the right approach.</P>
    <P>I only wish more Ministers would attack problems in that way.  There is a totally ridiculous situation at present with regard to charitable lotteries while there is a general review of all lotteries.  We know that in the end, either the ceiling will be raised for the charitable lotteries or the cap will be removed altogether.  I favour the removal of the cap but in the meantime it would be very desirable to at least raise the ceiling by regulation.  Instead, the Government insists on waiting for a review of all the complex issues involved.  The Minister did not do that in this case.  Instead, he took the practical step of introducing and enacting the Stillbirths Registration Bill.  It crossed my mind that it might be desirable at an early date to consolidate the two.  Perhaps the Minister might consider it.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained the intention behind each section.  As he said in reference to section 1(3), it will still be possible under the new format to add a forename or forenames after the initial registration.  This facility covers names given in baptism as well as the small number of cases where no forename is recorded at the initial registration.  That should address some of the questions which have been raised by people outside the House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is pleased to support this Bill and we will facilitate its speedy enactment.  I congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative to provide for the equal treatment for women on the new birth certificate and I invite him to consider the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  As the Minister said, it is short and relatively simple.  Nonetheless, it is important.  It attempts to modernise the law relating to the registration of births and, consequently, birth certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That this has taken so long probably reflects <Col N="1421" /> the general attitudes towards women over the years.  For so long we were prepared to soldier on with outdated, inappropriate legislation and relics of history, not only in this area but also with regard to marriage.  As the Minister said, this measure has been brought forward in reaction to the recommendation of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and I am glad he has taken it on board.  On reading the commission's report it was interesting to put this measure in context, as Deputy Woods did.  The report highlights the inequalities that remain in place in regard to birth certificates, in particular, that the mother's occupation is not recorded and it is automatically assumed that in the case of marital children the child will take the father's surname or the joint surname, but that anachronism will no longer exist.  It came about because of the relevant statutes and regulations which gave effect to it.  As we have heard, the information recorded is in accordance with the format of the register laid down in the annex to the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863, which provides for the recording of the rank or profession of the father, but a similar provision is not made in respect of the mother. On getting a copy of the commission's report, I was surprised to note the legislation is so steeped in history and, as we heard, it dates back to Victorian times.  It is amazing that it has taken something like the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women to highlight these anomalies in our legislative system.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the points made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women which are important in regard to one aspect of the Bill.  The long birth certificate follows exactly the format of the birth entry while the short birth certificate, an abridged form, does not include details other than the name and surname of the child, the sex, date of birth and the registration district.  It does not mention the occupation of either parent.  An entry in the register of births contains details of the surname of the mother and the father, if the latter is specified, but it does not record a surname for the child.  Similarly an entry in the adopted children's register contains details of the surname or names of the adoptive parent or parents but no surname for the adopted child. The long birth certificate, which is an exact copy of the relevant entry in the register, does not contain any reference to the relevant child's surname.  In respect of each entry in the register of births or the adopted children's register a short birth certificate may be issued in accordance with the terms of the short birth certificate regulations of 1953.  The format for such a certificate provides for the assignment of a surname to the child and such assignments are effected by the issuing official in accordance with article 8 of the regulations, that is, if the child is a marital child, she or he is assigned the surname of the father and if a non-marital child, she or he is assigned the surname of the mother or, if the birth was <Col N="1422" /> registered jointly, the surname of either the mother or the father as requested.  I raise this matter because I wish to refer to the area of adoption later.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended revised regulations of a non-discriminatory character should be drawn up and at birth parents should have a choice of registering their child with maternal, paternal or a joint surname.  The Minister has accepted that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the long birth certificate, the child's surname should be recorded, the term &ldquo;maiden surname of mother&rdquo; should be replaced by the term &ldquo;surname of mother&rdquo; and the occupation of the mother should be recorded in addition to the occupation of the father.  I am pleased that the Minister has accepted those recommendations as they are extremely important.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Bill was part of the comprehensive review of the legislation governing the registration of births, deaths and marriages, which is incomplete.  I agree with Deputy Woods that on completion of the Bill, the legislation on stillbirths and this Bill could be included in one Act, which would make sense. The Minister was right to proceed with the legislation on stillbirths because undoubtedly there was great grief and much concern about that matter.  It gave solace to many parents.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some of the remarks made by Deputy Woods concerning the recording of occupation as I do not consider that inappropriate.  I read through the Official Report of the Seanad on the debate on this legislation and it was interesting to note one of our colleagues in the Seanad referred to the importance of the social impact of the registration of occupation.  The Senator said that for health care workers and others it is an interesting statistic.  It is interesting information to compile in terms of social history and it may be possible to use it constructively.  I do not have any difficulty in that regard, but I have one in regard to the discriminatory nature of the registration between mothers and fathers.  From that point of view I have no difficulty with that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the Minister was right to say that many women saw the format of the birth certificate as demeaning, grossly insulting, offensive, outmoded, discriminatory and highly unsatisfactory, with which I agree.  One does not think about a birth certificate unless one needs to apply for a passport or some other document, but one does think about it when one has children.  I was amazed at the format of the birth certificate. I should have realised that the legislation governing it dated back to Victorian times.  My children are now aged 15 and 17 and the form of the birth registration has changed.  That format of birth registration was demeaning to women and needed to be changed.</P>
    <P>I chose to retain my family name.  My husband has a different surname and sometimes he thinks that is a very good thing.  I have been married for <Col N="1423" /> just over 20 years and I remember the amazement of quite a number of people when they heard I retained my name.  Immediately following my marriage people were far too polite to say anything and did not rebound in amazement when I told them I was keeping my name, but subsequently I found many of them found it difficult to handle.  My two children, who are girls, cannot understand that.  They think it is their choice to decide whether to take their husband's name if they marry.  The attraction may be in the name and its lyrical sound rather than holding on to a family name.  It is a matter of identity and choice.</P>
    <P>Women can choose to adopt their husband's name or to retain their birth name, particularly if they are in a separate profession.  I do not find anything extraordinary in that.  Fortunately, it does not seem to be extraordinary any more, but ten to 15 years ago many women had great difficulty in dealing with it.  For example, women did not know if my retaining my name was making a statement about other women.  I had to reassure them it was not, that it was making a statement about me.  It also created difficulties for many men because I remember acquaintances, even friends of my husband's, giving him a ribbing because I would not take his name.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the names of both parents be recorded on the birth certificate and that a different surname can be registered.  Many people are under the impression that, legally, one must take one's father's or husband's name.  As the Minister mentioned, that is not the case.  It has become the custom during the years.  Going back 20 years a friend of mine wished to retain her own name on marriage but was persuaded by a close acquaintance that she would not be allowed back into the country if she did not change her name to that of her husband on her passport.  I do not understand the logic behind this but it may have something to do with the fact that if someone was seen to register on their honeymoon abroad in two names, eyebrows would have been raised.  That attitude was peculiar to the time.  She has since readopted her own name.  In Spain and some other European countries it is more usual to take the family name of the woman.</P>
    <P>While this is a simple and straightforward Bill, it is of significance to the cause of gender equality.  Men and women are equal from birth. It is extraordinary, therefore, that there was inequality in the format of the birth certificate.  I am glad this has been rectified.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the report and recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The right of adopted persons to examine their birth register entry has been a source of contention.  There is a balance to be struck between the rights of birth parents and adopted persons.  How has this matter been treated in the review to which the Minister referred?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> The Progressive Democrats proposed an amendment to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill to provide for the establishment of a voluntary contact register.  Have there been any further discussions and are we any nearer to the establishment of such a register?  I hope the problems can be ironed out as the matter will not go away and needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.  I realise we are facilitating the passage of this Bill by taking all Stages today but I ask the Minister to look at it and expedite the establishment of a voluntary contact register.  I considered tabling an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the contents of the various sections of the Bill.  Section 1 states that the requirement to re-register under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, is waived if, as a consequence of the change in format, the new entry would be identical to the previous entry relating to the child.  I welcome this change.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is remarkable that the existing legislation dates back to Victorian times. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this measure which will modernise the law in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking to this minor but significant legislation.  It deals with a matter &mdash; the registration of births &mdash; which has been left unattended for 130 years and which can be dealt with expeditiously.  People may not give it priority but it is of tremendous significance to many.  This underpins the need for a Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The existing legislation dates back to 1863. There has been only one change in the format of the birth certificate since then when, on the foundation of the State in 1922, an Irish version was introduced.  It is extremely important that it be revised on equity grounds.</P>
      <P>The certificate includes the heading &ldquo;rank or profession of father&rdquo;.  It does not include a similar heading in respect of the mother.  That is the most glaring anomaly.  The dwelling place of the father but not that of the mother is requested.  Her maiden name, however, is sought.  This is outdated in the present social climate.</P>
      <P>In 1863, when the universal registration of births was first provided for, there was a patriarchal society.  Since then the position of women in society has changed enormously.  There is now legislation in place underpinning their entitlement to equal treatment in all areas of life. In many instances only the surname of the mother appears on the birth certificate; for a variety of reasons the father's name is missing. This matter needs to be addressed also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The birth certificate is a valuable source of <Col N="1425" /> information for the immediate family, sociologists, historians and genealogists.  As representatives of the State, we must decide the format of the birth certificate and ensure that all the relevant information is included.  It is appropriate to gender-proof the certificate and determine the optimum information available on the father, mother and child.  Everybody will benefit as a result.  At present there is a separate section on the form for the name, surname, dwelling place and rank or profession of the father but there is no reference to the mother in that respect.  In the proposed format there is a section for the forename, surname, address and occupation of the mother as well as the father. It is important that there is equality in terms of information on the mother and father.</P>
    <P>Section 1(b) states that any such other surname as requested by either the mother or father may be included if an t-árd cláraitheoir &mdash; the registrar &mdash; is satisfied that the circumstances so warrant. That matter must be seriously considered.  There is a question of the rights and entitlements of both parents, but there is also a question of the entitlements of the child.  Is the child entitled to information and to what information is he or she entitled?  Should the names of both parents be registered in a formal fashion?  At present there is no such entitlement or obligation.  If one parent requests, and it is agreed that the names of both parents be registered on the form, that may be done even if only one parent intends to rear the child.  The question arises whether it should be an entitlement or a requirement to have both names included.  A child is entitled to know who its parents are.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify section 1(b). The names of both parents may be included on the birth certificate if the registrar is satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, but prior consideration must be given to the entitlements of the child.  For example, should there be an entitlement that the father's name be registered? That is hardly a matter that should be left to the discretion of the registrar; it seems to be a matter for this House to decide.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate further on that issue.  As it stands, the Bill adequately covers the requirements of both parents but I am not sure it is satisfactory in terms of the information that would be supplied to the child.</P>
    <P>The format of the birth certificate is in need of updating.  Considering the manner in which society has changed, it is incredible that 130 years have passed without changing the format.  I was pleased that the Second Commission on the Status of Women strongly recommended a change in format.  Present mores are very different from those of the past, particularly in regard to the status of women in society, not only in terms of women keeping their own names after marriage but also in women's rank and profession.  In the past 12 months, of the approximately 1,000 jobs created, there was a ratio of 4:1 in favour of women.  It is relevant, <Col N="1426" /> therefore, that the woman's profession be recorded on the birth certificate.</P>
    <P>The question of rank is another matter.  At present the father's rank is requested on the birth certificate.  I would like to know the origin of that wording.  Does it imply that the person ranked in the upper or lower echelons of society? Presumably on the one hand there are people with professions, those who work in society, while on the other, there are those who do not work in society but are persons of standing.  The wording underlines the fact that the certificate is totally out of line with modern times.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem with the old form of registration relates to discrimination between the sexes, the fact that there was no gender proofing of the birth certificate, or indeed of death and marriage certificates.  The Minister referred to the 1994 legislation on stillbirths and said that he is in the process of working on much more complex legislation dealing with registration, which is welcome.  The present birth certificate is an anachronistic document which is inadequate because much of the information requested is not available.  With the change from a patriarchal society to egalitarianism, it was necessary to make available more detailed information.  Both points are relevant, the assurance that the information society requires is included and that such information reflects the social mores of the day. They fall into two major categories; the content of the legislation passed and the gender proofing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on producing this excellent, timely legislation.  I hope there will not be any problem in expediting it through the House.  I ask the Minister to examine section 1(b) more closely in terms of the information that is necessary to be recorded from the baby's point of view as distinct from that of the parents.</P>

      <P>In common with my colleague, Deputy Woods, I can see little wrong with this measure.  Few people can maintain that after 130 years there are not variations or improvements which can be made to the registration system or to the presentation of the traditional style of birth certificate.</P>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue measure to tackle an area of inequality which may not seem important but which, to the mothers of the children involved, seems to extend the already lengthy list of areas in which women might be seen to be second class citizens.  Like the Minister, I too note that society has changed greatly, and not always for the better.  The Minister had a not inconsiderable hand in implementing some of that change and in time the people will not thank him for all the measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that fewer births are taking place inside marriage.  I have strong views on the kind of society we should be fostering and in many respects my vision for the country is not the Ireland of today.  I am, however, enough of a realist to accept that we must react to and make provision for that kind of change in Ireland, and <Col N="1427" /> the Minister's modest proposal today merely reflects that.</P>
    <P>In the same way as we made assumptions about some of the information which should be entered on a birth certificate in the past, so too did we make many assumptions about life in Ireland over the past century and a quarter.  The birth certificate was designed at a time when there was little change, or prospect of change, in the society of the day.  I do not suggest that society was better in those days; far from it, the hardships were unspeakable and the public attitudes no better, but we have genuinely improved the lot of people generally, particularly in regard to the quality of their lives.  Measures which should and are meant to be a major improvement in reality only prevent us as a society from sinking further into despair. Our society is running faster and faster to stand still.</P>
    <P>I was amused to read the Minister's opening statement on Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad.  In speaking about the format of the birth certificate he stated:</P>
    <P>This format is an anachronism of the late 20th century.  It is ill-suited to the diversity of modern society and to the enhanced status of women within that society.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well applaud his efforts, or his perceived achievements, in gaining an improved status for women but for many that new-found status and freedom only allows them to enter the workforce as poorly paid, cruelly exploited second-class workers earning third-class wages because economic circumstances dictate that they must work.  The Minister and his socialist colleagues might well turn their attention to that particular inequality and perhaps guarantee in real terms equal pay for equal work and a parity of esteem for the working wife or mother who is not within the recognised professions.</P>
    <P>I was equally amused at the speed with which the Minister decided to introduce this legislation. He stated:</P>
    <P>Work on the general review of registration legislation is ongoing, but it will be some time before it is complete.  As indicated above, the form of the birth certificate is generally acknowledged to be outmoded and discriminatory and has been the subject of increasing criticism in recent years.  The measures needed to amend its format are relatively brief and simple.  Therefore, I decided that this change should not await finalisation of the general review but should be the subject of a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister sense that he and the Government may not be around after the forthcoming election to implement the later general review and is getting through that portion which is ready?  Do I sense a little panic setting in across the floor that the future may not be a bed of roses?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> I realise those with responsibility for or who have an interest in the genealogical process will want as much information as possible entered on any new certificate.  Without this formal recording of information in the past we would not have such a wealth of information today or the wherewithal to trace ancestors or gain confirmation from entries such as the &ldquo;Rank or Profession&rdquo; of the father.  Generally, assistance is given to those who wish to trace their ancestry and full records have proved useful for those seeking such information. The Minister now proposes to include on the new style of certificate the occupation of both parents. I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Woods on this subject.  The Minister's proposal is all very well but if he is seeking true equality he must eliminate every possibility of there being cause for inequality in years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister is part of a Government which presides over a register of 260,000 unemployed people.  Society, wrongly, treats unemployment as a stigma.  Will children born to those people have to live with that perceived stigma for the rest of their lives and have it broadcast publicly through their birth certificates?  What relevance does it have for today's citizens?  The point was made in the Seanad that information concerning what is essentially family background may have relevance from a medical point of view, but can the doctor not ask the patient for such information, a spouse, child or other person who would know, rather than having it noted on the birth certificate?</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's opinion that the term &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; may not need to be used in certain cases.  For instance, where a person trained in a particular discipline or worked previously in a particular employment, such description could be used even though the person may not have been actually working at the date of birth of the child. Many people have not been fortunate enough to have had a job or to have trained in any trade or profession, and there will be no alternative to entering the description &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; in such cases or, worse still, in respect of both parents. On balance, it is safer to leave it out altogether and I ask the Minister to drop that provision from the new certificate.</P>
    <P>I have always been intrigued with the principle of having two separate forms of birth certificate. I know the short from certified only the bare essentials in regard to name, sex, date and place of birth and could be used for non-statutory purposes.  As it made no mention of percentage it was a more diplomatic document and saved embarrassment for those who were delicately referred to in the past as &ldquo;people whose birth certificate was not in order&rdquo;.  Less kind language was often used also and caused much embarrassment to the people who found themselves in that unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention to maintain the two forms of certificate and can he say what purpose it fulfils today or under this new legislation?  Traditionally, there was a difference <Col N="1429" /> in the cost of the two certificates.  Will the short certificate continue to be cheaper?  Will the price of certificates increase significantly as a result of this new legislation?  Surely they are expensive enough and the Minister might consider charging only a nominal sum for the issue of a birth certificate.  Often the need for such certificates arises at a time when there is already a heavy demand on family finances, such as at examination time or when children are entering third level education.  Surely the income from such fees is negligible in the overall context of the State's finances.  Public bodies could easily forgo it in favour of the more straitened circumstances of the students' families.</P>
    <P>In view of the huge advances in information technology, surely it is time to hold a central record of all births, marriages and deaths.  That would hardly be beyond the capacity of a central computer which a local registrar could access.  I realise there would be a cost factor, but the benefits would be great, not least in giving a speedy and comprehensive service to the public. If the need to hold registration books were done away with and the information readily available wherever there is a computer terminal, the more remote areas could be serviced through a local health board office.  With the current mobility of labour it is often necessary for people to write or, in cases of urgency, travel long distances to the office of registration to obtain this service.  This can result in great difficulty for a person whose home county is a hundred miles away and who requires a certificate in a hurry.  In any event, the principle of ready availability of information dictates that such certificates should be readily and easily available.  I ask the Minister to take this suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>I agree with the objective of this Bill.  If it makes life easier or more bearable for some people it will be worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Our own births were registered and we register our children's births, but the vast majority of us are unaware that the format has remained unchanged since 1863.  It is unbelievable, given the social, economic and cultural changes that have taken place in that time, that this is the first attempt to change the format of birth registration.</P>
      <P>It is only right that we should thank the committee that formed the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It is because of a proposal in their report that we are addressing this issue.  Birth certification is an important part of our lives.  Much of what we do in later life involves providing our birth certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Birth certification is also important for statistical purposes.  I do not, therefore, agree with some of the views of Opposition Deputies regarding the registration of the occupation of parents.  I welcome the fact that there will be equal recognition of the father and the mother in the new method of registration.  It was remiss of us, at a time when many women worked in the <Col N="1430" /> home and did not have an occupation outside the home, that that occupation did not merit mention on their children's birth certificates.  I see no problem in women having to state their occupation as that of housewife.  The vast majority of women are very proud of that occupation.  Many women wish they could be fulltime in the home.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to eliminate inequalities but, sadly, it leaves the greatest inequality of all; it does nothing to ensure that every child knows who his or her parents are.  The greatest human right is to know who one's parents are.  There is nothing in this Bill that compels parents to admit parentage, and it is most unfair that any human being should go through life with just one parent registered on the birth certificate.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Stockholm on behalf of the Select Committee on Social Affairs where we met organisations and government representatives to discuss the question of child care, I was interested in their method of registering the birth of children.  They insist that every child has a basic right to know the identity of his or her mother and father.  Except in exceptional circumstances where parenthood cannot be proved people can receive no social welfare payments until such time as the birth and parentage of the child are acknowledged.  This is something we should seriously consider here, given that so many children are born outside marriage and that it is a basic human right to know who one's parents are.  It is too easy for parents to abscond, to deny parentage and to ignore the fact that a child of theirs was born.  We should not allow that to continue.  We should investigate ways whereby parentage must be acknowledged.  Because we do not do this, single parent families are left to fend for themselves with no support other than from the State.  I also strongly believe that anybody who has the means to support their children should be obliged to do so.  There should be no means of escape from that responsibility.  I would welcome changes in this area not only from the point of view of providing support for children but also from the point of view of the child's basic human right to know the identity of his parents.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  I am glad also that he proceeded to make provision for the registration of stillbirths before the review was carried out. Parents who have had the traumatic experience of stillbirth felt sad that there was no acknowledgement that their baby was born and the emotions caused by that lack of acknowledgement added to their despair at a very sad time of their lives.  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the parents who formed a group and sought this change.  Although it is just a piece of paper, for the parents it is an important and treasured memory of the fact that a child was born to them who unfortunately did not live.</P>
    <P>The changes being brought about by the Bill <Col N="1431" /> are welcome.  Acknowledging the occupation of the mother provides the equality that is needed. To date people's social status was judged on the occupation of their father &mdash; that was the only occupation that was acknowledged.  I would like to acknowledge the manner and efficiency with which workers in our maternity hospitals ensure that every child is registered.  The difficulties that would emerge if births were not registered would be frightening.  They do the job exceptionally well.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the cost of obtaining a birth certificate and I accept there are administrative costs involved.  Everybody needs a birth certificate at some time and many people find it a great expense.  In many cases a copy will not suffice and the original is required.  Reducing the cost of a birth certificate should be examined. For example, a large number of children in a family may all apply for jobs or State examinations for which they need birth certificates and there is a consequent expense on the family.  The cost should be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for changes to birth certificates already registered.  This applies particularly to cases in which the name of the father had not been included.  I have had representations in the past on this matter.</P>
    <P>Many people come to this country from abroad to have their children born here.  In many cases the birth takes place here for purposes we might not admire &mdash; they may wish the child to obtain an Irish birth certificate and, subsequently, an Irish passport.  Has the Minister any proposals to deal with this practice?</P>
    <P>The Bill is overdue.  Its need was brought to attention by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It eliminates some inequalities but it does not deal with the greatest inequality of all.  A means should be found to make it compulsory for the child's mother and father to be named on the birth certificate.  It is a basic human right and we must do something to achieve it because the children cannot.  It thank the Minister for publishing this Bill so speedily given that a review was necessary in relation to it.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill.  I hope there will be more Bills designed to simplify bureaucracy.  No change has been made to the registration provisions since 1863.  I received a representation recently from people who deal with the registration of births, marriages and deaths and the Minister should examine the level of their income.  They get 68p, which is taxable, to do the job.  It is time they were paid a decent amount.  Since the new family law <Col N="1432" /> legislation came into force this year those dealing with marriages now have to send three letters &mdash; one each to the people being married and one to the priest.  A great deal of work is involved.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill recognises the rights of women.  They do an excellent job and it is right that they should be recognised.  I am always amazed at why Departments and other bodies require a woman's maiden name and so much other information on forms.  If we continue in this way there will not be enough buildings to hold all the paperwork.  I am aware that bureaucracy may keep people employed, however, I hope that even more bureaucratic procedures will be simplified.</P>
      <P>People generally need birth certificates for specific purposes or occasions.  In the past in rural areas births were often not registered for many months which led to many problems.</P>
      <P>We were told for many years that simplification of the process of motor registration was not possible.  However, it has been done successfully and cars are now registered by the year, a county code and a number.  I am glad the Minister has simplified the registration of births in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill brings up to date an archaic format which has outlived its time. Indeed, some of the terminology in use is offensive.  Will the Minister give an assurance that this legislation will not limit the value or the use of birth certificates for genealogical research, which is growing in popularity.  It has become an industry involving people in Ireland and many people of Irish origin from all over the world. New technology has been introduced in the research and the Churches are due credit for making records available.</P>
      <P>There is a possibility that the introduction of the option as to the use of the maiden name may limit the value of birth certificates for use by future generations.  The matter needs careful examination to ensure the birth certificate remains as vital an instrument as in the past.  I am not sure if there is a loophole or a difficulty with this matter but it should be examined.</P>
      <P>With regard to space on the certificate, the inclusion of the names of previous spouses may necessitate greater space in the future.  I compliment the Minister on the legislation.  I hope continued use will be made of up to date technology to improve access to records.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues raised by Deputies in these questions were covered in my statement to this House on Wednesday last to which I would refer Deputies.  Regarding Monday's summit meeting in London, the British Prime Minister and I had useful discussions on Northern Ireland and European issues, the latter being covered in my reply to Questions Nos. 12 and 13 today.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I reviewed progress on the multi-party talks and both our Governments remain determined to secure further progress. The two Governments believe the talks provide a unique opportunity for a balanced political accommodation to be reached.  We would therefore urge all the participants to do everything necessary to bring about movement into substantive three-strand negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I also reviewed the prospects for an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire and, on that basis, for bringing about our shared aim of fully inclusive negotiations.  In that regard, it is important that there is a definitive and clear understanding on Sinn Féin's admittance to negotiations in the wake of an unequivocal restoration of the August 1994 ceasefire.  With the aim of securing that, the Government will continue to work with the British Government, John Hume and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Government's position is that if the IRA clearly calls an unequivocal ceasefire in words <Col N="1437" /> that are believable, and provided nothing is done that is inconsistent with this ceasefire or with the Mitchell principles, then Sinn Féin should be admitted to participation in the talks, in accordance with the ground rules we have agreed.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the two Governments should build on the substantive areas of agreement between us.  For our part, I can assure the House that the Government will do everything it can to achieve progress on that basis.  In saying all that, I want to make absolutely clear yet again that there is no justification whatsoever for paramilitary violence from any quarter.  The IRA should restore its ceasefire now.  Apart from being morally wrong, totally without any legitimate mandate and directly inimical to the interests of all the people of Ireland, further violence would also undermine efforts to secure Sinn Féin's participation in the talks at the earliest moment on the basis of an unequivocal IRA ceasefire.  Any further violence will only delay the day when we have fully inclusive negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify that he sought British agreement to the setting of a date before the end of January for Sinn Féin's participation in all-party talks, provided that the basic condition of a new unequivocal and irreversible ceasefire date was met?</P>
      <P>It serves no useful purpose to pretend that both Governments are at one when clearly they are not.  Does the Taoiseach accept as a fair assessment what John Hume said &mdash; that his meeting with the British Prime Minister generated nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that what emerged from Monday's meeting was a strong reaffirmation that the basis on which all parties, including Sinn Féin, can enter the talks is set out in the ground rules for those talks agreed by the Irish and British Governments and in the 28 February communiqué which was also agreed by both Governments.  It is not open to either side to reinterpret, add to or extend those agreements which are firm and clear.  As far as the ground rules are concerned, paragraphs 8 and 9 set out the basis upon which Sinn Féin can qualify for entry to the talks.  It is important for us to recognise that the ceasefire was called in August 1994 without any date, rules or an independent chairman for talks.  We now have a talks process in place with a chairman in the person of Senator George Mitchell from the United States.  We have procedures for those talks which protect minorities by ensuring that majorities will not be able to impose their will on them.  We also have a clear commitment in statements from both Governments that Sinn Féin will be admitted to those talks once they comply with the terms set out in the ground rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the challenge now for the republican movement, given that we have a natural break in the process arising from the normal Christmas <Col N="1438" /> recess, is to see that this is a great opportunity for them to call a ceasefire to allow the ground rules requirements to be complied with so that they can be admitted to the talks early in the new year. They have an opportunity now and it is for them to seize it and take their own responsibilities rather than seek to project them on to others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the unusual absence of a communiqué after Monday's Anglo-Irish summit is being interpreted as a diplomatic failure with serious disagreements between both Governments?  It would be better for the Taoiseach to publicly acknowledge his inability to persuade the British Prime Minister that he was unable to get him to settle on a date.  Is the Taoiseach telling the House that his interpretation of the summit is that if there is a ceasefire a date has clearly been agreed that the British Government would stand over?</P>
      <P>The difficulty from the republican side is that they heard Prime Minister Major state, on 4 January 1994, that if they renounced violence for good and showed they meant it, Sinn Féin would have a clear prospect of entering the talks process with the other constitutional parties. Unfortunately, during a 17-month ceasefire the British Prime Minister did not listen to what they said.  We all agree it was wrong for the ceasefire to break down but will the Taoiseach accept there is a serious question mark as to whether that offer of talks made on 4 January 1994 was genuine or phoney?  Would he agree that there was nothing at all phoney about the lives that were saved during those 17 months, and that people deeply resent the British Prime Minister rubbishing the success of the August 1994 ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the lives that were saved were ones that would otherwise have been taken by the IRA.  It is important to bear in mind that if the IRA took those lives they would have been responsible for so doing.</P>
      <P>As far as the issue of a communiqué is concerned, in the last two weeks I have had a series of meetings preparing for the summit with the British Minister, the French President, the German Chancellor and others.  No agreed communiqués were issued after any of them and, in fact, it would have been exceptional to have done so.  The Deputy is mistaken in trying to attach any significance whatever to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not.  The Deputy interrupted my earlier contribution.  The British Prime Minister made it clear to me that his intention is to achieve a situation in which there will be inclusive talks.  Sinn Féin must be present because the talks would otherwise not be inclusive.  The objective of the British and Irish Governments is to work toward inclusive talks. To facilitate this, the first step which must be taken involves a new IRA ceasefire.  The IRA called a ceasefire in August 1994 without any talks, procedures or independent chairman in place.  There is now an independent chairman, an agreed procedure and a talks process and the IRA is aware that it can enter those talks when it complies with the ground rules.  That will happen quickly.  The conditions sought by the IRA in the past have been put in place.  I hope Deputy Ahern agrees that the primary onus at this stage of Irish history is on the republican movement to call a ceasefire.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have forborne from using that word in replying to the various questions put to me and I will not depart from that rule.  However, as I stated on previous occasions, the inescapable logic of the peace process points the republican movement in the direction of an IRA ceasefire. That movement cannot fulfil the peace process upon which it set itself without a ceasefire.  The republican movement is aware that it cannot fulfil its political objectives without a ceasefire. Furthermore, as I stated in Downing Street, the political leadership of Sinn Féin includes many talented people who have no need to continue to use the crutch of violence, or the threat of violence, to make their case effectively through political methods.  They have the ability and distinctive talents which enable them to advance their case with persistence and determination through the medium of politics alone.  The republican movement should pass the most effective vote of confidence of all in its leadership by calling a ceasefire.  As a result, that leadership would be able to take full part in the political process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement between the two Governments takes the form of a ground rules paper and the communiqué issued on 28 February.  There is nothing in the ground rules paper about quarantine periods, dates or time limits.  The paper simply lists the conditions which must be fulfilled.  I stand on the agreements we have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the rather cynical question put to me by the Taoiseach, he should read the speech I made last Wednesday to discover what I said.  Every Member urges the establishment of a new ceasefire before Christmas.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that such a ceasefire would lead to the involvement of Sinn Féin at inclusive, all-party talks at the commencement of the new session at the end of January?  Is that the Government's position?  If it is, it would be helpful were it placed unambiguously on the record.  What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the British Government's statement that it will only take advice from British, not Irish, security services in respect of a ceasefire?  I seek answers to these important questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing cynical about the question I put to the Deputy.  In situations such as this, people who are unable to make up their minds about whether there should be a ceasefire or whether they should take particular steps have a facility to transfer the responsibility and create a situation in which it seems someone else is responsible for their not making a particular decision.  The IRA should call a ceasefire now because it has a golden opportunity to allow Sinn Féin to take part in talks.  This opportunity is far better than the one which existed in August 1994 because there is a talks process, an independent chairman, agreed procedures and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which can be immediately reconstituted following a ceasefire to bring them into constructive communication with all other parties on this island.</P>
      <P>From the experience of the previous ceasefire, the IRA is aware that the Irish Government is willing to respond on the issue of prisoners.  It is also aware that the British Prime Minister and the Irish Government are committed to bringing it into the talks.  The IRA should seriously consider this matter and make a decision rather than seeking to place the responsibility for that decision elsewhere.  In politics a situation is never achieved when a decision is taken where the conditions are absolutely perfect.  By definition, politicians always make decisions in imperfect conditions.  From his own experience, Deputy Ahern will agree that one never takes a political decision in perfect conditions where all the answers are available and one knows what will happen as a result.  The business of politics is about making decisions in conditions of uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> When Sinn Féin and the republican movement reflect on the certainties now in place &mdash; the talks process, Senator Mitchell's presence as chairman of those talks, the ground rules and procedures and the reconstitution of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; they will receive adequate reassurances to call a ceasefire rather than ask for another certainty to be added to those already provided.</P>
    <P>I believe this represents a reasonable answer to the Deputy's question.  I took note of the speech he made last week which provides a balanced statement of his party's position.  I am convinced that his party, like all parties in the House, is working for peace and has no sympathy for those who use violence.  I agree, without qualification, that that is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I must persist in raising questions.  It has been the position for many months, not merely in recent days following the Anglo-Irish summit, that the request of Sinn Féin and its political leaders is for certainty with regard to entry into all-party talks.  It has been the Government's position, and that of every Member of the House, that we want a ceasefire and the end of targeting, punishment beatings and the training of IRA recruits.  To achieve this, whether we like it or not, those in the IRA are seeking certainty that what happened following the ceasefire in August 1994 &mdash; this is not imagination or innuendo, it is fact &mdash; regarding the establishment of a talks process will not happen again.  As the Taoiseach stated, it was never placed on record but there was a belief that talks would begin at some future time.  It was believed that talks would begin in three or four months but nobody believed it would take 17 months.  I will not ask about the British Government's position as it seems to be concerned about other matters, for example, the general election etc.  Is it the Government's position that Sinn Féin, with its support, should take its place at the talks before the end of January 1997 if there is an unequivocal and irreversible ceasefire and an indication that training and punishment beatings will stop?  Is this what the Government said to Mr. Major last Monday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing I can do is quote what I said in Downing Street as it clearly sets out my position:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Government's position is that if the IRA calls an unequivocal ceasefire in words that are believable and provided there is nothing done that is inconsistent with this ceasefire or with the Mitchell principles then Sinn Féin should be admitted to participation in the talks in accordance with the ground rules we have agreed.  The first step, however, is a credible ceasefire.  The onus is on the republican movement to restore the ceasefire credibly at the earliest moment.  I want to see Sinn Féin's <Col N="1442" /> participation in the talks at the earliest moment too on that basis.  In practical terms, given the imminence of the Christmas recess, I hope that this will be possible early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>By early in the &ldquo;new year&rdquo; I mean towards the end of January.</P>

      <P>Whatever about not reading the English newspapers, I presume the Taoiseach has had a cursory look at today's Irish newspapers which indicate that the IRA is in the business of preparing a campaign of atrocities between now and Christmas.  Will the Taoiseach agree that all the discussion in the House will be set completely at naught if a rash of atrocities are committed by the IRA between now and Christmas?</P>

      <P>I wish to take up a very important point raised by my party leader which is not given the importance it deserves.  During the past 25 years between 80 and 100 people lost their lives each year in the North.  We all support the assurances sought by the British Government that the ceasefire will be unequivocal.  However, has consideration ever been given to the fact that between 80 and 100 lives were saved during the period of the ceasefire?  Does the British Prime Minister place any emphasis on this point and what value does he place on the lives of Irish and British citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that the British Prime Minister puts a very high value on the lives of people.  For example, he put a particularly high value on the lives of Inan Bashir and John Jefferies who were murdered by the IRA at Canary Wharf.  The British Prime Minister, as a person representing his people, is very concerned, as I am, to protect the lives of his people and of Irish people.  The reason we have devoted so much time to finding a structure which would enable Sinn Féin to participate in inclusive talks is that we want an IRA ceasefire.  It is worth pointing out that the British Prime Minister continued to work for inclusive all-party talks even after the IRA murdered Inan Bashir and John Jefferies at Canary Wharf.  Even after that incident, he agreed a fixed date for the talks and the ground rules for the talks which do not allow minorities to be oppressed because they provide a detailed formula for sufficient consensus which requires to be agreed by both communities.  This took a lot of time to negotiate but it represents a major asset in terms of healing minority-majority relations both within Northern Ireland and on the island as a whole.  To use the community term, we have all of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to point out that although the August 1994 ceasefire was a marvellous achievement it has been built upon by the creation of a talks process which has all the elements to which I referred.  Despite the Canary <Col N="1443" /> Wharf bombing and the deliberate provocation represented by it to try to drive him from peace &mdash; this is the only calculation I can assume was made by those who allowed this bomb to go off in the middle of London &mdash; the British Prime Minister continued to agree the various measures I have outlined.  The talks have started and we will continue to work to find the best possible basis so that Sinn Féin can come into them and to give the maximum reassurance that they are serious and its place in them will be a very real and dynamic one.</P>
    <P>It is time for those in the republican movement to put trust in their political leaders' ability to argue their case on the basis of argument and persuasion without any recourse, need for recourse or threat of recourse to violence at any time in the future.  They should have sufficient confidence in themselves to have a ceasefire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a severe breakdown in trust between the British Government and Sinn Féin-IRA because of the renewal by the IRA of its campaign.  Will the Taoiseach agree there has also been a breakdown of trust among those on the other side of the equation &mdash; that is, among Sinn Féin-IRA and the broad mass of Nationalist Ireland &mdash; who perceived no major movement during the 17 or 18 months of the ceasefire?  Given this two way breakdown of trust, the Government has a pivotal role to play in pushing forward the agenda and restoring trust between those two groupings.  I appreciate that the Government may be pushing that agenda as best it can behind closed doors, but would it not be preferable to push it publicly and to involve outside agencies such as the US Government which played a pivotal role in convincing Sinn Féin in the run-up to the 1994 ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Deputy.  The reason the Government has allowed talks with Sinn Féin to continue at official level, despite the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe by the IRA, is that we believe there is distrust on both sides and that we have the capacity to reduce the level of distrust experienced by Sinn Féin <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British Government and to reduce as far as possible, despite Canary Wharf, the level of distrust in British Government circles of the long-term intentions of the republican movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that there are limits to what one can do in this regard.  If actions belie sentiments people tend to take the actions more seriously than the sentiments expressed.  The difficulty with Canary Wharf and Adare and with the preparation and priming of bombs is that they belie sentiments expressed about peace.  The responsible adults in the republican movement who carry out these actions know they are likely to be interpreted as provocation, yet they carry them out.  They have a responsibility to answer <Col N="1444" /> that question for themselves and for the Irish public and not seek, as is constantly the case, particularly in regard to Northern Ireland, to shift the responsibility to someone else's shoulders.  It is not confined to the Republican movement.</P>
    <P>People on the other side of the political divide say they would do different things if decommissioning happened tomorrow.  However, they know it will not happen tomorrow and that they must take the first step.  The process of transferring the responsibility to somebody else is endemic in this political situation.  It seems the first reflex of anybody faced with the requirement to make a decision is to try to find some way of transferring the responsibility for that decision to someone else's shoulders.  It is time the protagonists took responsibility.  In particular, it is time the IRA and the Republican leadership took responsibility for the peace process &mdash; it is not just Mr. John Major who is responsible for it &mdash; and called a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>This Government has maintained contact at official level with Sinn Féin so that we can convey that message to it, but also to convey indirectly to the British Government its fears and concerns, which we have done repeatedly.  The various reassurances that have been given here about the way in which the talks will be open to all, the ground rules and so forth are the direct result of our efforts to ensure the talks will be genuinely inclusive.  There was a call for a fixed date, which we set for 10 June.  Sinn Féin knows that if the IRA calls a ceasefire, Sinn Féin will be in the talks quickly.  The Deputy knows Sinn Féin is aware of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government has stated it will monitor any ceasefire and it will make a decision on the basis of reports from its security intelligence.  Is the Taoiseach confident that such reports will not be used, as they were in the past, to delay Sinn Féin's entry to the talks? The Taoiseach is more aware than I, that it is not only the Republican movement which has received arms and been involved in training in recent months.  The British Government does not seem overly concerned that some people, who may be close to those in the political process, are engaged in such activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was used as a tactic to delay the talks, it would be a case of bad faith. Every security service must be prudent.  If people say one thing and do another, one must ask why. There is an inconsistency if the IRA prepare bombs while saying their ceasefire will hold in all circumstances.  It is inconsistent to say there is a ceasefire which will hold in all circumstances knowing that at that moment a lorry is being bought somewhere to be used as a bomb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we resolve that inconsistency?  The first thing we need to see is the terms of an IRA ceasefire.  We need language in the IRA ceasefire which is convincing not just to those who want to be convinced but also to those who do not want <Col N="1445" /> to be convinced.  A genuine effort must be made in the language used to call a ceasefire, to ensure it is believable and, as far as possible believed by those who feel threatened by the IRA.  That requires an effort by the Republican movement to understand the fears of others and to see how they can be allayed by what is said.</P>
    <P>There is also the need for a clear and unequivocal statement on the Mitchell principles. I am aware Sinn Féin said it accepted the Mitchell principles, but it did not say it in the clear language one hoped it would have said it.  There was some static around the way in which it was said.  It is important that its dedication to the Mitchell principles is clear this time.  There should be acceptance of the Mitchell principles in any statement by the IRA.  It is not enough for the political side of the movement to accept the Mitchell principles; the whole movement must accept them.</P>
    <P>I am not laying down conditions; I am trying to be as helpful as I can to people who want to fulfil paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules so that Sinn Féin will come into the talks.  I am suggesting how they might do that in a way that will give reassurances while allowing Sinn Féin straight into the talks.  It requires a decision to call a ceasefire which must be framed in a way that is convincing, and conduct in the immediate aftermath of that decision which does not belie the decision itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress in the multi-party talks, particularly <Col N="1446" /> since their resumption in September, has been frustratingly slow.  It has not yet been possible to reach agreement on the handling of decommissioning and thereby to complete the opening plenary session and move into substantive three-stranded negotiations.  The two Governments are united in their commitment to the implementation of all aspects of the report of the international body as the best possible basis for progress in decommissioning.  We continue to hope that all other participants will agree to work with us on that basis and discussions on this matter are continuing in Belfast.  No dates have as yet been agreed either for a Christmas break in the talks or for their resumption in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Despite the disappointing pace of developments in the talks, it is important to emphasise that if operated with goodwill and commitment they still offer the potential for progress towards the achievement of a lasting and comprehensive negotiated settlement.  The ground rules and rules of procedure, guarantee the right of all participants to advance their views on all issues of concern, and create a negotiating structure in which all of the key relationships can be considered in parallel.  They also ensure that any agreement, even before it is put to the people for ratification, must be acceptable to the political representatives of both communities and to both Governments.  The existence of a potentially fully inclusive talks process, with prestigious international independent chairmanship, is a substantial asset and should be safeguarded, as far as possible, whatever the short-term difficulties.</P>
    <P>The conditions for Sinn Féin's entry into the political talks currently under way in Belfast were carefully set out by both Governments in the communiqué of 28 February 1996 and in the ground rules and have been reiterated on many occasions, not least here in the past three quarters of an hour by the Taoiseach.  In our contacts with the British Government, most recently at Monday's Anglo-Irish summit, we have made it clear that we believe Sinn Féin should be included in the talks once those conditions have been met, and that we are anxious to see that objective achieved as soon as possible.  That is a strong argument for the earliest possible reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire which should never have been broken.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said on Monday, and has just repeated in the House, if the IRA clearly calls an unequivocal ceasefire in words that are believable, and provided there is nothing done that is inconsistent with this ceasefire or with the Mitchell principles, then Sinn Féin should be admitted to participation in the talks in accordance with the ground rules we have agreed. In practical terms, we hope this will be possible early in the New Year.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Major, has made it clear that he is unwilling to commit his Government to a specific timetable, which would have been our preferred approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> However, he has also made it clear that he does not intend any undue delay.  Obviously, the sooner a ceasefire is called, the faster the goal of Sinn Féin's entry to the talks can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As this issue has been debated at length between the leader of my party and the Taoiseach, I will merely ask a few supplementaries.  It is an understatement to say the talks process has been frustratingly slow.  Is there a realistic hope that, with the good office of George Mitchell, the decommissioning issue might be resolved before the talks break for Christmas?  A date has not been fixed for their resumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks process is frustratingly slow.  It is difficult and painstaking, but as we are making progress people want to stick with the process.  The only way to resolve these issues is through negotiation and discussion.</P>
      <P>Our position on decommissioning continues to be based firmly on the implementation of all aspects of the Mitchell Report.  That report commands widespread support across a range of parties and is probably the only achievable way forward.  With the assistance of the chairman, Senator Mitchell, and his colleagues, we are engaged in detailed discussions with the other participants in the talks and while I cannot predict if there will be a breakthrough before Christmas, that remains our priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that, apart from the question of decommissioning, confidence building measures are important at this stage?  Does he also agree that in addition to the potential for confidence building measures to accompany a ceasefire on the British side, in terms of security and release of prisoners, there is also great potential for the Republican movement to build confidence by indicating that punishment beatings have stopped, that those who have been banished from Northern Ireland under pain of punishment or killing are free to return and that all forms of paramilitary preparatory activity, such as targeting, intelligence gathering and so on, will cease?  Does he agree those achievements would be much more convincing than particular formulations of the decommissioning process in creating an atmosphere of trust that the violence is over for good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that decommissioning is the key to making progress in the talks and in terms of building confidence.  If we could get agreement in the talks process on how to deal with the decommissioning issue in a satisfactory manner, we could move with confidence to discuss other issues.  The question of confidence building is part and parcel of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference where we discuss a range of issues, including <Col N="1448" /> punishment beatings, on a regular basis.  All and sundry abhor punishment beatings.  Matters such as surveillance, tracking preparation for a return to conflict, deployment of security forces, policing, parades, emergency legislation, the position of prisoners and other social and economic issues were discussed at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference on 20 November.  There is a glaring lack of confidence between the communities in Northern Ireland borne out of history, distrust and sectarianism, which manifested itself recently in a nasty form in Ballymena.  With the British Government, we work on a daily basis to stimulate the communities on both sides to take the necessary steps to build confidence.  An important aspect of the cessation of violence, or the threat of violence, which we are seeking would be a clear indication that the phenomena mentioned by the Deputy are irrefutably forsaken.  Confidence in a ceasefire would be quickly undermined if the activities we tend to associate with paramilitaries continue.</P>

      <P>All Members want the ceasefire restored, it should never have broken down.  We also wanted talks to take place during the 17 months of the ceasefire, but that did not happen. There has been a breakdown of confidence.  The Government made it clear today, through the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that there should be a definite date for the commencement of talks, with participation of Sinn Féin in the event of an unequivocal declaration of a ceasefire, including an end to punishment beatings, targeting and so on.  How can the Tánaiste realistically talk of confidence building measures when, in publishing the Estimates for Northern Ireland yesterday, Sir. Patrick Mayhew talked in a cynical way about an end to the peace dividend and major cutbacks in areas that would help to build confidence between the communities in Northern Ireland. This is sending out all the wrong signals.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and John Hume, a major player in this process, have argued for a definite date for inclusive talks.  Members of the House also want a definite date for such talks. John Hume believes Monday's meeting generated nothing.  Why is the Government failing to get across to the British Government the need for a definite date for inclusive talks? What is wrong that this point cannot be got across?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret that we are unable to reach a shares position on this matter. As stated on numerous occasions, the primary onus rests with the IRA to unequivocally restore its ceasefire, which should never have been broken.  We believe that if that happens under the stated terms, and the Mitchell principles are adhered to, within a short time Sinn Féin should be included in the talks.  The circumstances are right now for the IRA to make that move and it should be done as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's overriding objective in the field of arms exports is the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and technologies for military use.  At the global level, there are no general guidelines or multilateral agreements governing the transfer of weapons.  The Government believes it is essential that states accept the need to exercise restraint and responsibility in their exports and imports of conventional arms and agree to observe certain principles in the matter.  We have, accordingly, sought during the Irish Presidency to gain a greater degree of acceptance at EU level of the need for action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our own perspective as a small country with no armaments industry and no military obligations towards other countries differs considerably from that of major arms exporting countries, which include a number of our EU partners.  Under <Col N="1450" /> Article 223 of the Treaty any member state can take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material. This means that, in legal terms, arms export policies in EU member states remain national policies.  Thus, any proposals which would significantly constrain the prerogative of national decision-making on specific arms exports will almost inevitably be resisted, in particular by the major arms exporting member states.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, despite these difficulties it has been possible to make some progress on this issue.  Under the EU's agreed common criteria on arms exports known as the Luxembourg and Lisbon criteria, member states are encouraged, in the framework of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, to inform and consult each other increasingly on matters of arms export control policy.  This ongoing process is intented to develop a common approach leading to a harmonisation of national policies.  The Irish Presidency has been able to secure agreement on initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measures for application of the criteria for internal use by arms export licensing authorities.  This is a start, but further work is needed to achieve an eventual common interpretation of the criteria.</P>
    <P>At a wider international level, the Wassenaar Arrangement has recently been established with a membership of 33 countries, including all 15 EU member states as well as all other major exporters of conventional arms, dual-use goods and technologies, with the exception of China.  It has, therefore, the potential to play an important role in developing international restraint in exports of arms and related dual-use goods and technologies, through the mechanisms of information exchange and peer review.  As EU Presidency, Ireland has been making considerable efforts to ensure that the Wassenaar Arrangement is in place and operational at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In my reply to a similar question on 31 October, I informed the House about the steps taken to secure approval of a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use goods.  I indicated that, as arms exports remain subject to national export controls, it is for each member state to take the necessary steps nationally to control exports of all items on the munitions list of the Wassenaar Arrangement.  Ireland has taken this step through the signing by the Minister for Tourism and Trade of the Control of Exports Order, 1996, on 3 December.</P>
    <P>The Government is also continuing its efforts at the United Nations to promote its objectives in the area of international arms transfers and controls.  At the Disarmament Committee of the UN General Assembly, which concluded on 15 November, Ireland joined a representative group, including developing countries, as an original cosponsor of a new German initiative concerned <Col N="1451" /> with consolidating peace through practical disarmament.  This German resolution was adopted by consensus.</P>
    <P>This year's Disarmament Committee session also saw the adoption of a new resolution on anti-personnel landmines.  This non-consensus resolution was adopted resoundingly with 141 countries in favour.  It urges states to pursue vigorously an effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines with a view to completing the negotiations as soon as possible.  This is a highly significant vote giving further impetus to the international movement to ban anti-personnel landmines, a particularly abhorrent form of conventional weapon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, having proposed a Private Members' Bill here on anti-personnel landmines, I welcome the move at the United Nations.  There has been some movement from the Government on the matter and I acknowledge that also.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs outline the progress of the EU Commission's policy document on the armaments industry, &ldquo;The Challenges Facing the European Defence-Related Industry, A Contribution for Actions at European Level&rdquo;?  Will he inform the House if, and to what extent, this document has been discussed under the auspices of the Irish Presidency?</P>
      <P>Among other measures, of course, this particular document would allow for the channelling of a greater proportion of EU Structural Funds into weapons research.  In addition, an objective of the Western European Union armaments organisation would be to boost research and development in weaponry to facilitate the international arms trade and the placing of arms contracts.  How does that square with Ireland's stated policy on the arms trade? What has Ireland, as Presidency, done in relation to that Commission document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware, and I made it very clear in my reply, that these matters are primarily a matter for each member state.  In a reply in recent months I elaborated on the fact that there are widely divergent views within the member states, as the Deputy would well know. In the Common Foreign and Security Policy Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports, for example, the ongoing effort to build on the Luxembourg and Lisbon criteria is progressing extremely slowly because of the divergence of views within the member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland achieved agreement during its Presidency on initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measure of application of the criteria.  It is a slow, painstaking progress because of the divergent views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect of interest is, of course, that <Col N="1452" /> there are major arms exporting countries within the EU, of which the Deputy is well aware.  The agreement we reached, the Wassenaar Arrangement which I outlined, could become more important for the exchange of information of arms but, of course, much of this information is considered to be very sensitive both within member states which export arms and, indeed, outside the EU.</P>
    <P>In that respect, the Government set out its views in this House in relation to what happened in the EU on 3 December.  It is a slow process. As Ireland does not export arms, our position is, and will continue to be, quite open in relation to what we are trying to achieve within the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the serious implications for human rights of the global arms trade, will the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House if the Government is satisfied that respect for human rights is adequately provided for in the EU Commission policy document?  This mentions human rights in passing by referring to the need for export limits in inhuman weapons. Will he inform the House whether the Government is satisfied with the decision taken by the Commission to limit rather than ban the trade in weapons acknowledged to be inhuman? Will he outline the steps, if any, which have been taken by the Government, in its capacity as EU Presidency, to address these issues?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government elaborated on its position in the White Paper in relation to the conduct for conventional arms transfers.  Of course, if we were in a position to do so, we would like to see a much stronger EU position. However, as I said to the Deputy, because this is dealt with primarily by member states those countries involved in arms transfers are not prepared to go as far as the Government would wish, but the Deputy is well aware of the situation from his involvement in Government.  We have, as he knows, guidelines for the international transfer of arms.</P>
      <P>Human rights are to the forefront in all agreements and documents of the EU and that will continue to be the case.  The Government will obviously work closely with the non-aligned movement.  There is much work to be done but we are going slowly, and not as quickly as I, the Deputy or this House would wish, in the right direction.</P>

      <P>The European Parliament resolution of 15 November on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to which the Deputy refers was noted by the General Affairs Council on 6 December.  It will be duly taken into account by the Council in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>The importance the Government and the EU attaches to full co-operation by all parties with the tribunal's activities has been reflected in a number of Government statements and EU Council Conclusions during Ireland's EU Presidency.</P>
      <P>In a comprehensive EU policy paper drafted by the Irish Presidency and adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28 October, improved co-operation by all sides with the tribunal is identified as a key priority during the period ahead.  Summing up the position of the Government and the EU at the meeting of the Peace Implementation Council in London on 4 and 5 December, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>full co-operation by all parties with the <Col N="1454" /> International Criminal Tribunal in the efforts to bring war criminals to justice is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace is to be consolidated.  All parties must abide by the commitment they have made to hand over indicted suspects without delay.  It is also important that the international organisations and agencies active on the ground should examine how they can make a more effective contribution to the efforts of the Tribunal in this regard.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the London conference, endorsed by the EU and all of its member states and the European Commission, state that the provision of economic reconstruction assistance is clearly linked to co-operation in this area.  The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Republica Srpska leadership, have been reminded that their obligations under international law take precedence over any provisions in their national or local legislation.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Union has made clear that the development of relations between the Union and those countries will be influenced by their attitude towards co-operation with the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Government fully shares the view expressed in the European Parliament Resolution on the importance of the role of the International Police Task Force.  Ireland has demonstrated its commitment in this area in a number of ways, notably through our contribution of a contingent of 31 members of the Garda Síochána to the IPTF, including its Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald, and also through hosting in September an International Conference on Law Enforcement Assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina, attended by representatives of some 40 countries, which resulted in significant pledges of training, financial and personnel support for that force.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to be a strong and unequivocal supporter of the International Criminal Tribunal and the effort to bring war criminals to justice.  This support is demonstrated not only in political and diplomatic terms but also in very practical ways.  In addition to previous voluntary contributions, and to payment of our annual assessed UN contribution for the running costs of the tribunal, the Government has in the past few weeks contributed a further $100,000 to assist the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the reply is worthy in its intentions, one must ask what Europe has been doing in light of the painfully slow progress made by the International Criminal Tribunal in former Yugoslavia to bring to justice those guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and human rights abuses.  Does the Government recognise the urgent need to establish a permanent international criminal court under the auspices of the UN to expedite that process?  Will the <Col N="1455" /> Tánaiste inform the House what steps, if any, have been taken by the Government in its capacity as EU Presidency to ensure the establishment of such a court without further delay?  There is not much point in having the International Criminal Tribunal if Karadzic and Mladic are still at large and are being ignored by the IFOR troops and others on the ground in former Yugoslavia.  All that has happened so far is that we have had a number of appalling cases involving relatively minor players compared to the major players who are still at large.  What is being done to move the process forward?  It is a question of the international community apparently making the appropriate noises but not taking any action when action is possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that Ireland is not participating in IFOR and we have no input into operational matters for that force or the force that will be deployed to follow it unless there is a change of policy on participation. We are not on the ground in the former Yugoslavia.  IFOR has stated clearly that there is an agreement between the commander of IFOR and chief prosecutor for the tribunal that within the limit of its mandate and resources IFOR will provide assistance to the tribunal by protecting sites of interest to investigators and providing a secure environment for their work.  It has also stated that in the event that troops encounter suspects they will detain them and hand them over to The Hague tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned Karadzic and Mladic. Our position is clear and unambiguous and has been repeated on a number of occasions.  The Government believes all indicted war crime suspects should appear before the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague to face the charges against them.  Along with our EU partners we believe that full co-operation by all parties with the tribunal in an effort to bring war criminals to justice is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace is to be consolidated.  We, with our international partners, will continue to pressure the governments of the region to honour their commitments, in particular the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, who signed the Dayton Agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs.  It has been made clear in the conclusions of the Paris meeting, the steering board of the Peace Implementation Council and the London meeting that the provision of international economic reconstruction assistance to the parties is closely linked to their co-operation with us in these areas.</P>

      <P>In the context of Serbia, will the Tánaiste indicate what exactly the European Union is doing about the fact that Serbia will not recognise the democratic choice of its people as expressed in the recent ballot in the local elections?  What sanctions and other measures <Col N="1456" /> does the European Union under our Presidency intend to take to ensure that Milosevic recognises the choice of his people in the ballot box and respects human rights, such as the right to an uncensored media, which he has so patently failed to do during the past three weeks when demonstrations have been held by the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Serbia and the appalling situation regarding the refusal of Milosevic to recognise the results of the election, the European Union was about to give trade preferences to Serbia, but on the basis of what we witnessed and what we are still seeing happening on the streets of Serbia, the clampdown on the media, free press and radio, we have refused to advance the decision on that.  That is a message that will go home very strongly because the trade implications of that are quite serious for that country.  We have also made contact with the government.  I had a meeting with the Foreign Minister in Brussels last week and I made it plain to him that the European Union wanted the elections to be reinstituted and the results to be accepted.  Since then the Deputy will be aware that the supreme court refused to recognise the results of those elections.  It is very important that the elections be re-run in the near future in agreement with government and opposition parties.  There has been some progress since then on the reinstatement of free radio which is back on the air.  That has happened in the past number of days.  That is of importance as access to a free and fair media is very important.</P>
      <P>From the European Union's point of view we will maintain pressure on the government there. We have done so in our declaration from our meeting in Brussels last Friday which sent a very strong message to the government there that we want respect for human rights, the establishment of democracy and the acceptance of the election results which gave significant victories to the opposition party.</P>

      <P>I was struck by what the Minister said that, as a result of the suppression of the local election results in Serbia, the EU Presidency stated there was to be a moratorium on proceeding with the trade preferences which otherwise were to be given to Serbia.  If we are serious about the human rights commission and the war crimes tribunal, should we be in negotiation with Serbia on trade preferences? Are we saying it is more important that the local election results in Serbia are reinstated and observed than it is for the Serbian Government to exert all the pressure it can on Republica Srpska to yield up prisoners, especially when Slobodan Milosevic is a signatory of the Dayton Agreement?  Why is it that we can exert extra leverage to have the local election results reinstated and not do so to have the jurisdiction of the war crimes tribunal and the international courts enforced?</P>

      <P>Enormous pressure has been exerted worldwide on Milosevic and his Government to yield up those suspected of war crimes.  This will continue.  The position of the European Union is that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will eventually have to take its place among the international community of nations for the sake of stability and prosperity in the region but it has been made very clear that it cannot do so unless it observes basic standards of democracy and human rights and that it will continue to be isolated until conditions improve. There are enormous difficulties and strains both within the Government and politics in Serbia on which the United States is exerting enormous pressure.  The question of whether sanctions will be necessary has been mentioned.  As I said to Deputy Burke, there have been some improvements, particularly in relation to the radio station, but much more needs to be done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to have serious concerns about the human rights situation and the pace and manner of the transition to democratic rule in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>The Government, with its partners in the European Union, has consistently acted to express its serious concern to the Nigerian authorities about human rights violations in their country.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, Ireland strongly supported the adoption of the EU Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995 on Nigeria which imposed an arms embargo, visa restrictions and the suspension of EU development assistance with immediate effect. We also fully supported the recent extension of the Common Position measures for a further six months from 4 December 1996.  During the current Presidency, I have conveyed the Union's ongoing human rights concerns to the Nigerian authorities directly and through our Ambassador in Lagos, thus ensuring that our human rights concerns have been kept to the fore.</P>
      <P>At the EU General Affairs Council meeting in July under my chairmanship, it was agreed that the Union would continue its identification and examination of further measures that could be taken against Nigeria and to keep developments in the country under close review in consultation with other interested countries and bodies.  Since then, as Presidency, we have been actively engaged with the EU and other interested parties in this ongoing process of consultation and close review, which includes within its remit the continuing human rights situation in Ogoniland and throughout Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the European Union has welcomed a number of potentially positive developments in relation to human rights in Nigeria such as the resumption of dialogue with the Commonwealth, the release of a number of political prisoners and the establishment of a Commission on Human Rights, serious cause for concern remains.  This has been reflected in the terms of the resolution on the human rights situation in Nigeria which was co-sponsored by the European Union and duly adopted by the Third Committee of the <Col N="1459" /> United Nations General Assembly on 29 November.</P>
    <P>The situation in Nigeria continues to be monitored closely under the review framework of the EU Common Positions with the additional focus agreed under the Irish Presidency at the General Affairs Council in July.  The Government will continue to work, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, for the early restoration of democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria and we will pursue our concerns in the United Nations and other appropriate international fora.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With our EU partners, we have been closely monitoring developments in Nigeria and will press for the presence of EU monitors at any relevant hearings.  That is one of the most direct ways of ensuring fair trials.  We will also give strong support to any measures which may prove necessary, including further sanctions, to ensure full respect for human rights and international legal norms.  The undertakings given by Nigeria to the United Nations Secretary General and the Commonwealth will have a bearing on future Ogoni hearings.  I cannot give the Deputy any guarantees on a timescale for the re-establishment of democracy in Nigeria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined my own views on the question of an oil embargo to the House on a number of occasions.  Ireland and a number of our EU partners favour the introduction of such an embargo in furtherance of democracy and human rights in Nigeria.  As I said to the Deputy previously, to be effective it would have to have global support.  A unilateral EU oil embargo would not have a great impact as it would not extend to the major markets for Nigerian oil. That is why the Government supports the idea of EU consultations with other states on such an embargo.  There are different views within the European Union on that matter and some member states were prepared to go no further than the agreed position.  To the best of my knowledge, we do not import oil from Nigeria <Col N="1460" /> and therefore we are not affected.  The common position we have adopted, which was repeated recently, is the strongest position attainable by the 15 member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The United States has played a key role in the search for lasting peace and for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland.  The Government welcomes the ongoing constructive support of the United States administration which has been forthcoming at every stage in the peace process.  In this policy we know the administration has had the full backing of the many friends of Ireland from both parties in the Houses of Congress.</P>
      <P>The statement to which Deputy Ahern refers was delivered by Vice-President Gore at an Irish-American Presidential Forum in New York in late October.  In his remarks on that occasion Vice-President Gore pledged a continued US role in the search for a lasting peace.  Indeed, in his first press conference following his successful reelection, President Clinton reaffirmed that his new administration would be of assistance to the Irish and British Governments in this endeavour.</P>
      <P>Alongside its support in the political arena, the US has sought to underpin the peace process through its support for economic development in the southern Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  Starting with the appointment of Senator Mitchell as a special adviser for economic initiatives in Ireland, there has been a number of economic activities over the past two years.  The latest such initiative was the Pittsburgh Trade and Investment Conference held in October, a followup to the Washington Conference of May 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important strand of the US economic contribution to Northern Ireland and the Border counties has been their continuing support for the International Fund for Ireland.  Their generous contributions to the International Fund total 270 million US dollars to date, making the US the largest contributor in cumulative terms to the Fund.  We look forward to the continuing <Col N="1461" /> constructive and helpful engagement of the incoming US administration.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to express our appreciation for the role played by the outgoing US administration.  We are particularly indebted to National Security Adviser Tony Lake for his dedication to the cause of peace.  We wish him well in his new appointment.</P>

I would also express our gratitude to President Clinton and Vice-President Gore for the major role they are playing in the peace process.  I hope they will continue to concentrate on it in their new term of office.  We very much welcome the involvement of former Senator Mitchell.  Is the Tánaiste aware of the meetings between Vice-President Gore and the Leader of the Unionist Party?  Is he aware of any efforts to get the Leader of the Unionist Party to use his influence in regard to the appalling activities every Saturday night outside the church at Harryville, Ballymena?  The Unionist Mayor has played a positive and constructive role in that regard.  Will the Tánaiste use his offices, through the Anglo-Irish Conference and particularly the talks in Belfast, to call on Mr. Trimble and other participants in the talks to take a role in the Harryville controversy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the incoming US administration will be as involved in a constructive role in the peace process as has the administration of the past four years.  We look forward to a continued and productive relationship with the President and the administration and I see no difficulty in that.  I am aware of the recent meeting between Vice-President Gore and Mr. Trimble.  It is important that Mr. Trimble had an opportunity to brief the White House from his perspective.  I am not privy to the contents of that discussion but I am sure the very nasty incidents in Harryville were discussed.  We have raised that matter with the British authorities.  I commend the Mayor, churchmen and politicians who have taken a stand on this appalling issue.  I hope Unionist politicians, some of whom were ambivalent initially but now seem to realise how serious and out of hand the situation has become, will act to ensure there is restraint so that churchgoers are allowed come and go freely to their place of worship.  That is the worst sectarianism that has surfaced since last summer and I hope there will be no further difficulties in that regard this weekend.</P>

      <P>During Ireland's Presidency of the EU we have continued with the negotiations with Iran during the last three Presidencies on this issue and have worked to arrive at a satisfactory resolution with the Iranian Government.  While some progress has been made and Iran now understands the EU's position better than ever, we have not reached the stage where we could claim there has been any breakthrough.  As Presidency, we have also availed of other opportunities to raise the issues &mdash; for example, the critical dialogue session which took place here on 29 November provided an opportunity for us to put forward the Union's view to the Iranian side in a full and frank way.</P>
      <P>The meeting in New York in September with Foreign Minister Velayati focused predominantly on other aspects of EU-Iran relations.  However, I know from the meetings I have had with Foreign Minister Velayati over the past three years that he remains fully aware of our concerns on the matter and the priority we attach to it.  The Government also regularly raises the matter in our bilateral contacts with the Iranian authorities, such as during the visit of the Speaker of the Parliament, Natek Nouri, to Dublin in November of last year.  More recently I raised the question with Deputy Speaker Rohani during his visit last month.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Rushdie in Dublin yesterday.  He naturally remains extremely concerned at the continuing threat to his safety posed by the fatwa.  I reiterated to him the European Union's firm view that it was unacceptable that a threat is made against the life of an EU citizen in this way and that the fatwa remained an obstacle to the development of relations between the EU and Iran.  I stressed to him Ireland's and the Union's commitment to the pursuit of a resolution of the issue through negotiations with Iran.  I hope that if it remains impossible to resolve the matter during the remainder of the Irish Presidency the work we have done will help bring a solution closer during the Dutch Presidency.</P>

      <P>That answer is a classic example of &ldquo;judge me on what I say rather than what I do&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste wrote to Mr. Rushdie in July suggesting a meeting and it was not until yesterday, effectively the last week of the Irish Presidency, that they met.  Europe has done nothing about the fatwa on Salman Rushdie not only during this Presidency but successive Presidencies.  It is a question of trade and, as Mr. Rushdie said, he is deeply unimpressed with the efforts of Europe.  The blame does not lie totally on the Tánaiste's shoulders; this matter has <Col N="1463" /> continued through successive Presidencies.  It is typical of the Irish Presidency that while the Tánaiste contacted Mr. Rushdie in July he did not meet him until what is effectively the last week of the Presidency.  That amounts to words, not action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused at Deputy Burke's intervention.  The fatwa was imposed in 1989 and if Deputy Burke is insinuating that nothing has been done or that efforts have not been made, he is either ignorant of the facts or refuses to recognise them.  A great deal of work has been done throughout a number of Presidencies in trying to lift the unacceptable fatwa on the life of Mr. Rushdie.  An invitation was issued to him to have discussions in July but it was not taken up until about a month ago.  A meeting was arranged for a month ago but it had to be cancelled at short notice.  I met him yesterday in Dublin and we had a long discussion.  Needless to say he is unimpressed due to the fact that there is trade between Iran and the member states of the European Union and the lifestyle he has to lead because of the continuing death threat.  We have made efforts in this regard, however, and we will continue to do so.  In fairness to Deputy Burke he is not putting all the blame on me on this occasion.  The threat has existed since 1989, the Deputy's party held the Presidency in that time and I would like to compare notes as to the work done in the background during that time and what has been done in recent months.</P>

Would there not be some merit in having a formal repudiation of this threat enshrined by way of Protocol in the European Convention on Human Rights so that the adherent member states of that convention could collectively wave in the face of the Iranians on every occasion the fact that it is now effectively part of the law of the new Europe that such behaviour is unacceptable? That would give far greater moral force to threats to take retaliatory economic measures to ensure such fatwas are stopped.  If it became part of the fabric of European law that this threat was unacceptable, it would give moral force to the European Union in particular to tell the Iranians that we are now under pressure to uphold this law and to impose sanctions if it is not withdrawn.</P>

A report was made to the General Affairs Council on 6 December which noted the progress made towards the realisation of the objective of establishing the centre.  The Council urged that examination of key outstanding aspects be speedily completed so that the centre can be established in 1997, which has been designated as the European year against racism.</P>
      <P>It can be taken that the main task of the centre will be to provide the Union and the member states with objective, reliable and comparable data on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, to improve the exchange of information and experience in this field.  It will establish a European information network to be known as &ldquo;Raxen&rdquo;.  In carrying out its tasks it will work closely with other international organisations and in particular with the Council of Europe.  As the Deputy will appreciate, until there is full agreement on the statute I cannot be absolutely precise on the nature and mandate of the proposed monitoring centre.  Certain issues on which member states hold strong views remain to be decided.</P>

      <P>I agree everything possible must be done to combat the problems of racism and xenophobia, but will the Tánaiste agree that rather than establishing an additional agency to monitor human rights abuses as a result of racism and xenophobia it would be more expedient to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing agencies?

The Council of Europe, for example, is working in this <Col N="1465" /> area and there has been a great deal of discussion between the Council and the European Union. Most member states are anxious to ensure not only that this valuable work continues but also that the new observatory co-operates closely with the Council of Europe.  The EU's racism observatory will have a different focus and will concern itself closely with the EU and its member states in particular.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Bill.  I compliment Minister Taylor for the courageous way he has tackled a number of important social issues and the reasonable approach he has taken in bringing about reform. I also compliment the Minister on legislating for a stillbirth register which has given great comfort to parents in that very difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Ninety per cent of birth registrations are straightforward.  About 10 per cent give rise to problems, and an infant is powerless to have an input to what details are provided about its birth. It is important, therefore, to ensure that the fullest information is available, so that 20 years or generations later, when people come to trace family relationships, they can be clearly established.  There should be no way for parents of a child to side-step the obligation to give their full names &mdash; John Smith of a particular address may not be sufficient in future generations to identify him because there could be a number of John Smiths.  The full name, including the second Christian name should appear on the register. The mother's full Christian maiden name should also appear on the register so there can be no doubt in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to the use of double-barrelled surnames which, as far as I am concerned, is nonsense, although people are entitled to adopt such names if they wish.  It may be properly established that a child's name is John Smith-Reilly. Who Smith and Reilly are is another question, although it would probably be easy enough to determine which was the mother and which the father.  It may be different in the case of what are now termed single parent families &mdash; that, of course, is a misnomer; there is no such thing as a single parent because it takes two parents to have a child.  A helpless infant has no say about what goes on the birth register in that case.  Therefore, the full names of the mother and father should be clearly identified.  That may be difficult, but if it is not done it is unfair to the infant who, in years to come, may want to know who his parents were.  It is not acceptable that the name of only one of the parents should be placed on the register.  The State should have a duty to establish who the parents are to protect that <Col N="1467" /> infant's rights.  When people decide to marry they need to be sure that they are not marrying their half brother or half sister through the neglect of the State in identifying exactly who they are.</P>
    <P>Those problems were brought to my notice by people who feel strongly about them.  The Minister, who is a caring Minister and has given much thought to social issues, might consider the points I have raised so that we can be as open and transparent as possible.  There is an acceptance in society of unmarried, single parents who are entitled to bring up their children.  However, they are also obliged to give their child its full birthright, full statistics as to who its parents are. It will be important later in the child's life and in generations to come.  It should be possible for people to know exactly who their forefathers were and to what families they are related.  That can only be done if the correct information is put on the register and everybody takes precautions to ensure that the rights of the infant are protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister identifies this Bill as being a very small one, insignificant in many ways, and wonders why so many people want to speak on it.  When I heard this Bill was going through Second Stage today, I wanted to speak on it because legislation like this makes the difference as we go through life and history is written.  Women who have not had occasion to register a child up to now will not be aware, when they come to do so, that the procedure was ever different.  When I tell young women in their leaving certificate year about the demands of the feminist movement in Ireland in the late 1960s and early 1970s they are usually shocked; they cannot imagine a time when there was no support payment for women deserted by their husbands or men deserted by their wives.  They cannot imagine a time when women did not have the choice between keeping their child or surrendering it for adoption.  They had no choice.</P>
      <P>The unmarried parenthood of today is not a new phenomenon; women simply did not have the choice of keeping their babies before.  The young women I speak to find that incredible. They find it equally incredible that one of the demands was for a home for each family.  When we look back in ten years' time people will be astonished that until 1996 we allowed women to be written out of history.  One wonders why there are few heroines in history, and why up to this point women have not played a more significant part in social history.  The present registration system is one of the reasons, although not a major one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The birth certificate gives the father's occupation.  If the truth were told most women would consider the father's occupation at the time of the birth as &ldquo;onlooker&rdquo;.  It is an important social statistic but it is equally important that the mother's occupation be noted for future social statistics.  I hope that I will be able to alter the <Col N="1468" /> birth certificates of my four children to include my occupation which, at the time, was mother and housekeeper &mdash; an honourable profession which is undervalued.</P>
    <P>Statistics on the professions of fathers are available.  They range from dockers and coopers to lawyers and doctors and include politicians. However, the only statistics for women relate to their maiden name, which effectively means the woman's name before she became a non-person. When women got married they became non-people &mdash; they took someone else's name &mdash; and all that distinguished them from their husbands was their maiden name.  It was akin to the churching that took place in living memory whereby women were considered to be unclean in some way.  Our civil law, social activity and religious behaviour were intermingled.  The farther away from that we can get the better, although much work remains to be done in this regard.  The issue of reform of marriage certificates is a matter that merits examination.</P>
    <P>It should be the choice of the two parents whether their child should have a single or double-barrelled surname.  It must not be imposed by law but must remain a matter of choice.  Recognition of the role of the mother is equally important.  There will not be a problem in the future with tracing family trees or, indeed, family bushes.  Children are as interested in their mother's family history as in their father's family history.</P>
    <P>Women must be written back into history.  We do not disappear as soon as we marry.  Women were not absent from all the major events of history.  Given that we make up half the population we could not have been absent.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the legislation for the stillbirths register, for which women will be eternally grateful.  There is great pain involved in going through a pregnancy and the baby being lost and this is exacerbated if there is no recognition of it.  It is perhaps a small event in history but it is a major event in the life of a person.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider establishing a birth defects register.  Although there have been great improvements in the health of children at birth and in early childhood, there is concern about clusters of birth defects.  People to whom I have spoken on this matter are not looking for compensation or someone to blame. They would like a register to be established so that if a child is born with a defect the parents can be referred to someone else who has had a similar experience and who may be able to help them.  Peer counselling is very important in the early stages of trauma.</P>
    <P>A form is filled out on the event of a birth which gives details of birth defects and copies of it are sent to the Department of Health and the CSO.  However, a birth defects register should not be the same as a births register because those born with a defect might thereby be subject to unwelcome scrutiny.  A birth defects register <Col N="1469" /> should be separate and it should be available to the Department of Health and the CSO so as to make the necessary data available without identifying the individuals involved.  It should also be available to maternity hospitals so that help would be at hand for parents of children born with defects and they might be reassured that they were not to blame.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill but it is legislation such as this which alters the course of history.  I was infuriated when I found that I could not record on my children's birth certificates the same type of details as their father.  One does not realise that this is the case until one goes to register a child. I am always equally infuriated by the hurried search for a man to whom to give one's daughter in marriage, although I am sure that will change with attitudes and does not require legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions.  Although short, the Bill is important.  About 50,000 births are registered each year and each of them has had to be registered according to a format devised over 130 years ago.  In most areas of public administration forms have been updated and revamped to suit modern needs and conditions but in the case of birth certificates there has been no change since 1864.  It is agreed by all Deputies that change is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The Bill will put in place a format which reflects today's environment, not that of the mid 19th century.  Instead of relegating the mother of the child to a secondary role it gives her an equal status with the father.  It will end the discrimination which has been the source of such annoyance for so many people and will also thereby give effect to one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Deputy Woods seemed to suggest there was a stigma attached to putting down a person's occupation as unemployed.  I do not know whether he intended that but there is no stigma to being unemployed.  That is a situation that society devolves on people and I see no stigma in it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred to the choice of surname and giving equal treatment to both parents.  If we did otherwise one parent would be favoured over the other.  It is important and essential that there is gender neutrality and we have provided for it in the Bill.  Surnames are required by use and reputation so there can already be problems with tracing a family tree. People may change their names during their lifetime thus making it difficult on occasion for their descendants to trace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to a newspaper article, following the Seanad adjudication on the Bill, which gave a completely misleading impression of the thrust of this Bill which is to modernise the certificate by including details of the mother's address and occupation, surname of the child and so on.  The article contained the comment &ldquo;birth <Col N="1470" /> cert Christians to go&rdquo;.  That is totally inaccurate. There is no reference whatsoever in the existing birth certificate to a Christian name.  The existing birth certificate records the child's name whereas the new format will show the child's forename and surname.  Under the new format it will still be possible to add a baptismal name to the certificate, as applied under the old format.  The new format will record any forename added after registration which will cater for baptismal names and the small number of cases where no forename is recorded at the initial registration. The word &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; was not mentioned in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the lack of a family impact statement in the explanatory memorandum.  He rightly points out that in its interim report the commission on the family calls for a family impact statement to accompany policy proposals.  This is obviously a matter to be considered by Government.  This Bill will affect families positively inasmuch as it promotes equality within the family.  The particulars to be registered are formulated in such a way as to recognise the diversity in family life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, Deputy Lynch and others referred to stillbirths and the stillbirths legislation.  Deputy Woods asked if the legislation could be consolidated.  I see no particular advantage in consolidating the Bills at this stage but in the context of the general review of registration that might be considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh referred to adoption certificates.  The new format proposed will not apply to entries in the adopted children's register. The format of entries in the adopted children's register is laid down in the Adoption Act, 1952. This Act is not cited as part of the births and deaths registration Acts and this Bill is not concerned with adoption law, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh and others referred to the short form of birth certificate.  That is prescribed by the Minister for Health in regulations.  It was agreed that the Minister for Health would change the short birth certificate to bring it into line with the format set down in this Bill.  That will be done by the Minister for Health, as he is entitled to do by law, in regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh referred to access to birth certificates by adopted persons.  Adopted persons can get their birth certificate if they know the particulars of their birth to enable that person to identify it in the register entries.  Any person can get anybody else's birth certificate if they have sufficient detail.  However, the right of adopted persons to the details of their birth is a matter of adoption law which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952, would need to be changed to give adopted persons the right to birth details. Adoption policy will not be part of the general review of registration legislation.  By the same token, the introduction of a contact register would be a matter for the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> Deputy Costello referred to the circumstances in which a person might be given the surname of a person other than either or both their parents. I do not envisage that arising in many cases.  An example of where it might arise would be in the event of a need to register a child of Icelandic parents.  In Iceland there is no surname as we understand it.  The name refers to the father's forename, for example, Sven Magnusson, being Sven the son of Magnus.  There is no surname in the sense that we understand it.  If an Icelandic couple had a child in Ireland, the question of providing a surname would arise and the new provision could be availed of for that purpose.  It might arise also if there was some oddity in the surname which the parents did not want to transmit to their child.  This would not deny the child's access to details of the parents because their names would be shown and will continue to be shown on the certificate.  Another example of where this provision could be used is if parents whose name was in English wanted to give their child an Irish surname.</P>
    <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn referred to a child's right to know its parents.  She may have been talking about adoptions or non-married parents. I refer her, and any other Deputies who may be interested, to the rules on this question which are laid down in Part IX of the Status of Children Act, 1987, which deals with names and the registration of parents who are not married.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the high cost of birth certificates.  This is a matter for the Department of Health who set those charges.  I do not underestimate the financial pressures on families on the occasions on which they need birth certificates.  The long certificate costs £5.50, the short certificate costs £3.50 and social welfare recipients can get either certificate for 70p.  Also one certificate can be used on more than one occasion as usually the relevant authorities do not retain them.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred to the question of a births defect register.  That would be a matter for the Minister for Health but I certainly have some sympathy with what the Deputy says and I understand the point she is trying to make.  I will refer the matter to my colleague, the Minister for Health, for consideration by him.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank all Deputies for their constructive contributions to this Bill.  I am glad it has received their general appreciation as a necessary and welcome measure.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage we raised a number of different issues relating to section 1 which I would like to tease out a little further. Deputy Theresa Ahearn raised the question of the names of fathers and mothers being included on every birth certificate.  There is a problem with that, however, and there will be in future.  I indirectly mentioned the same point in relation to health and medical statistics and information.  We now have so many different kinds of family that it is important to keep a proper and complete record of these relationships.  If we do not, in a few years' time we could have serious problems because some people, admittedly a limited number, will not know exactly who their siblings are.  Deputy Ahearn said the names of fathers and mothers should be on every birth certificate.  I know there are all sorts of other implications there but looking at the underlying situation from the medical viewpoint, what does the Minister think of that issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Deputy Woods is talking about the question of what names go on the certificate where parents are not married to each other.  That situation is dealt with in section 48 and succeeding sections of the Status of Children Act, 1987, which deal with the parameters for putting the father's name on the certificate.  It deals with the question of when it is agreed and the requirements of proof.  Obviously, it is not simply a matter of the mother saying someone is the father.  It is easy to say that but it may not be correct.  The rules have to be laid down in some detail and they are in Part IX of the Status of Children Act, 1987.  I am not proposing to make any amendments to that in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that covers quite a number of different situations but looking at it simply from a health viewpoint, it still leaves some things unanswered.  With so many kinds of family in future, it will be important for children to know who their brothers, half-brothers and half-sisters are.  If they do not, there could be a difficulty from a medical point of view if they find they are marrying their brothers or sisters.  The suggestion is made from that point of view but I would not make any more of it than that.  The issue is raised from time to time, although I know the Status of Children Act goes some way towards meeting that requirement where it is feasible and desirable.  However, there is still an underlying situation.</P>
      <P>I want to raise another point in relation to this matter.  In Denmark, RSI numbers are allocated at birth.  In fact, the Danish RSI number is based on the time, date and place where someone is born.  When I was Minister for Social Welfare, RSI numbers were allocated to young people on reaching 16 years of age.  It may well be that in future we will follow the Danish example, going right back to the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will, but it certainly will not arise under this Bill which is much more limited in its thrust.  I take Deputy Woods's point about the importance of having a record of both parents from a medical point of view and I sympathise with that position.  At the same time, one must be certain that the correct parents are recorded on the certificate.  That is the other side of the coin but I take the point, which is an important one.  We will have an ongoing look at that question for the general review of the registration system.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  Another subsection of this section deals with the question of occupation which I raise as a general point.  I wonder why we need to categorise people by their occupations.  What value does that information have?  As a matter of interest, I did not say that a stigma was attached to unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A subsequent speaker said that.  I felt that while someone might be unemployed when their child is born, they might be employed at other times.  The original 1864 Act refers to what is intended; &ldquo;rank or occupation&rdquo;.  It clearly classifies people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not &ldquo;rank or occupation&rdquo;. &ldquo;Rank or profession&rdquo; are the words used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  It refers to &ldquo;rank or profession&rdquo; of the father, but &ldquo;profession&rdquo; has since become &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;.  I am surprised the Minister, as a member of the Labour Party, does not realise the class implications.  It sets that down every time one has to produce it.  I do not want to go back to the points we discussed earlier and I will not disagree with the Minister.  However, the reality is that the occupation of the father and mother will be included on the birth certificate.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Lynch, certain women will be identified as housewives but many of the mothers I know would be annoyed and upset by the Deputy's use of that term.  These women see themselves as full-time workers in the home.  The Minister stated that certain categories of people find different things offensive and there are those who have their own views about the amount of work carried out in the home.  One of the problems we face is that this work has not been quantified but I hope this will be rectified in the near future.</P>
      <P>I do not know how necessary or valuable it is to include this type of information on birth certificates.  In the 1860s people did not often change their occupation.  The person referred to in the example was a carpenter.  As late as the 1940s over 50 per cent of the population worked in agriculture and could be effectively described as agricultural labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the future, birth certificates will list details <Col N="1474" /> of the occupations of both the father and the mother.  People seeking grants, etc., must produce their birth certificates and these will now contain more personal data about themselves and their families.  This strikes me as antiquated and odd and I wonder about the wisdom and value of continuing to use that designation.  How valuable is it today?  Perhaps the Danes have a better way to relate the circumstances of people's birth.  I will not engage in further debate on this issue but I believe it is outmoded and creates a class distinction across society.  The legislation aims to remove discrimination on the basis of gender but why not remove all discrimination at one time?</P>
    <P>Section 1 is substantive while those that follow involve routine provisions.  Subsection (3)(b) refers to:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust people will continue to follow a standard approach in respect of their father's or mother's surnames.  Deputy Nealon was worried about genealogy which has become a source of employment in the west.  Cottage industries have developed to deal with queries from people living in America, Canada and Australia who are interested in tracing their heritage.  I hope they will not end up looking at a family bush rather than a family tree.  If people exercise the options available under the legislation, there will be much confusion and listing people's occupations will not help to resolve matters.  However, the <Col N="1475" /> provisions in section 1 are generally good and I support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of young mothers giving birth.  Young fathers can have children by separate partners which gives rise to the advent of half brothers and half sisters and I do not believe it is of benefit to children to be born into such circumstances.  Is that situation adequately dealt with by current legislation?  Will it be mandatory to name fathers on birth certificates in the future?  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the law in this regard but is there sufficient legislative onus to ensure that both parents' names are included on birth certificates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the proportion of births involving people who are not married which include the names of both parents on the birth certificate.  A potential difficulty exists because it would not be sufficient to name a person as the father of a child unless they gave their agreement in that regard.  The rules governing such cases were set down in 1987.  In a case where both parents request the inclusion of both names on the birth certificate, there is no problem in doing so.  Where that does not happen, the considerations and requirements set out in sections 48 and 49 of the relevant Act come into play.  I do not know the proportion of cases where only one parent's name is registered.  As I informed Deputy Woods, a problem exists and we will consider the matter to see if further improvement is reasonably possible in the course of the overall review.</P>

      <P>It is surprising that it has taken so long to introduce this modernising measure.  We must be more prepared to introduce similar measures which cost little but which mean so much to so many people.  The number of people who have expressed their immense gratitude and appreciation to the House for the introduction of the stillbirths register is remarkable.  This is what makes participation in politics worthwhile.  I am delighted this important measure has been passed by the House.  It will make a difference to many people in the years ahead.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Inquiry into Alleged Payments by Dunnes Stores Limited: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Molloy on 10 December 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind:</P>
    <P>i.  serious public concern arising from newspaper reports concerning alleged payments by, or on behalf of, Dunnes Stores Ltd. and/ or Mr. Ben Dunne to members of the Oireachtas and public officials in the period prior to December 31 1993, and</P>
    <P>ii.  widespread public concern that the truth or untruth of the aforementioned newspaper reports should be established</P>
    <P>Resolves that it is expedient that a Tribunal be established, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, as adapted by or under subsequent enactments, and the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, to inquire urgently into, and report and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of public importance:</P>
    <P>i.  whether, and in what circumstances, the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Michael Lowry, was in receipt of payments or other benefits made available by, or on behalf of Dunnes Stores Ltd. and</P>
    <P>ii.  whether newspaper reports published between November 25 1996 and December 6 1996, concerning alleged payments by Dunnes Stores Ltd. to, or for the benefit of members and former members of the Oireachtas or members of their immediate families and other public officials, or members of their immediate families, are true in substance, and what the motives and circumstances of any such payments were.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be asked to report on an interim basis, not later than the tenth day of any oral hearings to the Taoiseach on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the number of parties then represented before the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearings and the work of the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be <Col N="1479" /> capable of being estimated at that point in time) of the Tribunal proceedings;</P>
    <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Taoiseach at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>and that the Taoiseach should inform the person selected to conduct the Inquiry that it is the desire of the House that the Inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible, and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it, and if possible, within 90 days.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendments:</P>
    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>(1)  notes that the Government has negotiated and signed an Agreement with Dunnes Holding Company in relation to the handing over of the Price Waterhouse Report on Dunnes Stores to an independent person, Mr. John Gerard Buchanan, a former judge of the Circuit Court, who will:</P>
    <P>(a)  examine it and extract from the report details of any payments made to, or transactions entered into, in relation to Members or former Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, or any local authority, health board or other similar body, or employees or board members of public bodies or persons remunerated directly or indirectly out of public funds or to their relatives or to political parties, and</P>
    <P>(b)  report to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges and to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges full details of all such payments, transactions and/or references to any such persons or bodies, including in such report full details of any explanations in relation thereto as may be furnished to him by Dunnes Holding Company or such person and any observations or recommendations he may consider appropriate;</P>
    <P>(2)  awaits the outcome of the consideration by the Dáil and Seanad Committees on Procedure and Privileges, or a sub-committee thereof, of the report from Judge Buchanan;</P>
    <P>(3)  considers that this method of establishing the facts in relation to the Price Waterhouse Report is the fastest and most efficient possible, and notes that it does not preclude any further investigation, by whatever means is considered necessary by Dáil and Seanad Éireann or by other relevant authorities after publication of the facts in the report; and</P>
    <P>(4)  welcomes the commitment of the Government to the early enactment of legislation to provide openness and <Col N="1480" /> accountability in the funding of the political system.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. J. Higgins).</P>
    <P>2.  To delete the second paragraph ii and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;ii.  whether, and in what circumstances, Members and former Members of the Oireachtas, or members of their immediate families, and other public officials or members of their immediate families, received payments referred to in the Price Waterhouse Report and related documents (and in particular, payments referred to in the report of Judge Buchanan to the Ceann Comhairle) from, or on the part of, Dunnes Stores Ltd.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to the frequently used phase &ldquo;who guards the guards?&rdquo;. The Government proposes that the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; the housekeeping rules committee of the House &mdash; should oversee Members, former Members, Senators and members of their families.  That would send out all the wrong signals to members of the public who want the issue thrashed out properly.  Fianna Fáil supports the motion as amended by its amendment because justice must be done, and be seen to be done, on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposal would put the former Judge Buchanan, the Ceann Comhairle and members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in an unenviable position.  They are being asked to do the impossible, to adjudicate when that is not possible because of the rules of natural justice.  They cannot compel people to appear before the committee.  It was interesting to note that none of the Government Ministers who contributed last night referred to the compellability of witnesses legislation, which is important for this House.  In two weeks after that legislation was published, with the help of one other person, I spent a great deal of time drafting 11 amendments to the Bill, one of which proposed that journalists appearing before a committee of the Oireachtas should have the ability to plead inability to divulge the source of their information.  I proposed that they should have the same privilege as Members of the Dáil. I often wondered since if that amendment caused the go-slow in the passing of that legislation.  My amendments did not see the light of day, but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance said yesterday they hoped to publish the Government amendments to that legislation in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, referred to an agreement signed between the Dunne family and the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government the day before yesterday.  Will the Minister or Minister of State who concludes the debate indicate if the Government would be prepared to publish that agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> The committee proposed by the Government cannot make findings.  This matter was well thrashed out in the 1994 committee, of which I was a member.  It sat for many hours and became known as the &ldquo;Danny Wallace committee&rdquo;, formed as a result of the fall of the last Government.  I am sure most Members would accept that committee was reasonably successful. Even though it was hamstrung in that it could not make findings, it put all the facts into the public domain and members of the public made their judgment.  While it was a case of Fianna Fáil against the rest, I am sure all its members would accept it ended in a draw.</P>
    <P>That committee was successful because everybody who appeared before it co-operated and it dealt only with political issues.  In this case serious allegations have been made inside and outside the House about whether people received payments and if they did whether they came with strings attached.  If it were not for the participation of politicians and advisers in the 1994 committee, it would not have been so successful.</P>
    <P>An advice note tendered to that committee on the legal consequences of the committee making findings referred to the famous Jock Haughey case in which Chief Justice O Dálaigh stated:</P>
    <P>...a person whose conduct is impugned as part of the subject matter of the inquiry must be afforded reasonable means of defending himself.</P>
    <P>The advice note outlines four minimum protections identified by the Chief Justice as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the person accused should be furnished with a copy of the evidence which reflected on his good name.</P>
    <P>(2)  that he should be allowed to cross-examine by counsel his accuser or his accusers.</P>
    <P>(3)  that he should be allowed to give rebutting evidence.</P>
    <P>(4)  that he should be permitted to address again by counsel the tribunal in his own defence.</P>
    <P>None of those protections was available to the people who appeared before the 1994 committee and that is the main reason the committee was not in a position to make findings of fact.  The advice note given to that committee went on to state:</P>
    <P>In deciding what should be included in its report to the Dáil I think the sub-committee must bear in mind that if it decides to carry out a fact finding exercise based on the evidence which has been brought before it, then the courts will require it to carry out its functions in a judicial or quasi-judicial manner.</P>
    <P>Such requirement includes an obligation to apply fair procedures and to arrive at its conclusions in an unbiased and impartial <Col N="1482" /> manner.  In regard to the latter requirement it is important to note that the Courts in a number of judgments have interpreted the law to require that not only must justice be done but that it must be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>Hence, the committee the Government is suggesting is one which would not allow anyone coming before it those four basic minimum requirements as laid down by Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh in the Jock Haughey case.  That is why I said on more than one occasion it puts not only the committee but Judge Buchanan in an unenviable situation.  If he contacted any of the people referred to on this list and said he would expose them at this committee, any of them would be quite entitled to get their solicitor to go to the nearest court to apply for an injunction.  I am advised such a person would, as of right, get that injunction on the basis that the committee before which it was proposed he or she would go, would not mirror the requirements of Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh in the Jock Haughey case.  They would be entitled to refuse to come before that committee.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for all of this.  In 1975 the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examined allegations made in this House by two Deputies, Deputy Molloy and former Deputy Crinnion, in relation to the Minister for Local Government at that time.  The Taoiseach might recall those instances.  The Dáil referred those allegations to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but that committee rejected a Garda inquiry into the allegations by a majority decision and decided to investigate whether any breach of privilege had occurred.</P>
    <P>The Deputies and the Minister were invited to the committee and agreed to attend but the two Deputies involved refused to participate on the basis that they felt that a doubt hung over the privilege attached to the proceedings of the committee.  The committee and the Taoiseach decided that very day to move a motion in the Dáil appointing a tribunal because these Deputies refused to make a statement before the committee.</P>
    <P>This precedent is important and we, on this side of the House say that, rather than get bogged down in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and its subcommittee, the Government should have started by appointing a tribunal because that is the only way we will get to the bottom of all this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I found Deputy Dermot Ahern's speech quite interesting and I will return to some of the points he made in the course of my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The common view in the contributions to this debate, by Deputies from Government and opposition parties, has been that the political process as a whole and the reputations of those who work in it have been tarnished by matters allegedly contained in a report prepared by Price Waterhouse for Dunnes Stores.  I am determined <Col N="1483" /> everything that can possibly be done will be done to remove that tarnish and establish the facts.</P>
    <P>There is only one reason the Government opposes the motion in the name of the Progressive Democrats.  We are anxious to deal fully and openly with the allegations made, but in a way which is efficient and effective.  The proposal to set up a tribunal now on the basis of newspaper reports would not meet the requirements of efficiency and effectiveness. These reports are extensive, sometimes contradictory, often speculative and generally based on anonymous sources.  They do not on their own or in association with an unexplained report, form a reliable basis for the establishment of a tribunal under the tribunals of inquiry legislation.  However, the allegations made are damaging and there is an urgent need to have them investigated.</P>
    <P>As a first step in that process of investigation, the Government has entered into an agreement with Dunnes Stores and, to ensure that everyone knows exactly what is involved, I will place the full text of the agreement in the Library.  In accordance with that agreement, the Price Waterhouse report has been conveyed to an eminent, independent person, Judge Buchanan, who is tasked with making all relevant sections available to committees of the Oireachtas. Nothing in the Buchanan exercise now under way, will inhibit or prevent the Government or the Oireachtas from taking any further action they think fit.</P>
    <P>Before going further, it is appropriate that I should place on record my thanks, and that of the Government, to Judge Buchanan.  As soon as he was approached he agreed to undertake this task and to do so without delay.  His integrity and independence is without question, and his ability is recognised on all sides.  While there may be criticism of the process we are using, no one, inside or outside this House, has questioned the suitability of Judge Buchanan for the task.  It is important to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the process is clear.  It is to bring the relevant information from the Price Waterhouse report into the public domain in a way which does not trespass on the prerogatives of other authorities such as the Revenue Commissioners, protects the names and reputations of persons who have no connections with political or public life, and protects the legitimate legal and commercial interests of Dunnes Stores and others.  I acknowledge the cooperation of Dunnes Stores in making this process possible and note its offer to further cooperate with Judge Buchanan as he carries out his task.</P>
    <P>What exactly will happen when relevant and reliable information derived from the Price Waterhouse report is put in the public domain cannot be accurately predicted at this stage.  We must await the information.  What can be predicted is that, on foot of the publication of the <Col N="1484" /> information, the Government will take whatever additional steps are necessary, first, to establish any further facts that need to be established and, second, to move to deal with any improprieties that might be brought to light, either on the part of elected representatives or of public servants, subject to the normal processes of law which must be complied with.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedures and Privileges of this House, and its corresponding committee in Seanad Éireann, is the appropriate body to which to refer allegations involving impropriety on the part of Members of the Oireachtas.  If these committees are unable to establish the facts, as Deputy Dermot Ahern suggested might be the case, or to deal with the consequences of them, there are procedures through which any deficiencies can be remedied.</P>
    <P>I accept that the privilege and compellability legislation is relevant here.  One of the reasons that legislation is being introduced is precisely to remedy the deficiencies to which Deputy Dermot Ahern referred which arose from the <i>in re</i> Haughey case.  Admittedly, it has taken us collectively 25 years to deal with that deficiency in the powers of committees of the House which was made manifest in the finding of Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh in the Haughey case, but we are doing it now.  It is too late in some senses but we are doing it; it was not done in any previous Dáil.</P>
    <P>I was questioned about this matter this morning on the Order of Business.  We took the policy decisions about three weeks ago and the amendments to the Bill are now almost entirely drafted.  I think there is one amendment which we must examine again but the work is well advanced and it is receiving high priority in the drafting process.</P>
    <P>There are well established legislative and procedural measures for dealing with allegations of impropriety on the part of any person paid out of public funds.  These are enforceable, as part of the normal criminal law, with all the requirements of due process inherent in the law.</P>
    <P>These measures for dealing with impropriety by any person paid out of public funds are contained in the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889-1916, as adapted by an Order of the Dáil of 1928.  These Acts include a provision whereby any person holding an office remunerated out of the central fund or of moneys provided by the Oireachtas &mdash; that includes Deputies, Ministers and public officials &mdash; shall be guilty of a misdemeanour punishable by imprisonment or fine or both, if he: (a) corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to the affairs or business of his Department, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour in relation to such affairs or business; or (b) corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or <Col N="1485" /> forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to the affairs or business of the State, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the affairs or business of the State; or (c) knowingly uses with intent to deceive the head of his Department any receipt, account or other document in respect of which his Department is interested, and which contains any statement which is false or onerous or defective in any material particular, and which to his acknowledgement is intended to mislead.</P>
    <P>That legislation further provides that where it is proved that any money, gift, or other consideration has been received by a person holding an office remunerated out of the central fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas from a person or agent of a person, holding or seeking to obtain a contract from a Government Department, the same shall be deemed to have been received corruptly as such inducement or reward as is mentioned in the Acts, unless the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that I made inquiries of the head of the Attorney General's office as to whether this legislation, which dates in its most recent enactment from 1928, is effective.  My advice is that to the best of the knowledge available, it is effective.  The legislation is clear.  It clearly comprehends any receipt of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has although I cannot give chapter and verse on that.  I am advised it is effective and if any moneys were received, as disclosed in the Price Waterhouse report or any other report, for a purpose encompassed by any of the listed factors I mentioned, that would constitute corruption.  It would constitute a criminal offence and would be pursued regardless of the status of the individual under the criminal law.  It is important also to recognise that the Dáil, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or any other committee of the House is not a court of law.  There is separation of powers here and if somebody is to be prosecuted for a criminal offence in an unprejudicial way, that must be done through a court of law, but that is a constraint all who respect the rule of law would welcome, appreciate and understand.  We must do everything we can to bring all the facts into the public domain and then the action that needs to be taken can be taken.  If it is political action in respect of a matter that is not a criminal offence but which is within the area of political unacceptability, then political steps can be taken. If it is a matter within the area of criminal law, then that must be dealt with through the courts. The Dáil cannot set itself up as a court and the courts cannot set themselves up as a legislature. There is a clear division here and that must be respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the anti-corruption legislation, which covers all persons paid out of public funds, <Col N="1486" /> there are specific instructions to civil servants in relation to outside business interests.  These are embodied in circulars issued in 1929 and 1936, which are brought to the attention of all civil servants when they join.  Essentially, these rules prohibit an officer from engaging in or being connected with any outside business or activity which would in any way conflict with the interests of his or her Department or be inconsistent with his or her official position or tend to impair his or her usefulness as a public servant.  Where an officer is in any doubt as to the propriety of undertaking a particular outside business or occupation, he or she is required to consult the head of his or her Department.  Where, in the course of his or her duties, a civil servant comes into contact with a matter affecting a business organisation in which he or she has an interest, he or she should immediately disclose the nature of the interest to the head of his or her Department.</P>
    <P>A breach of the rules in this area would leave a civil servant open to disciplinary action under the well established procedures of the Civil Service disciplinary code.  Depending on the seriousness of the violation, the penalty imposed could include dismissal.</P>
    <P>There is also the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and Statutory Instrument No. 57 of 1996 made under that Act.  This requires that Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas and certain established civil servants make annual written statements in respect of personal interests, and those interests of a spouse, child or step-child of which they are aware, which could materially influence them in the performance of their official duties.  A gift or gifts totalling £500 or more from anyone other than a relative or friend, if that could materially influence a person in the performance of his or her official duties, is an interest that has to be disclosed.</P>
    <P>Those are the legislative provisions, regulations and guidelines covering public servants and politicians.  There is no reason to doubt their effectiveness in dealing with any improprieties that might arise when the facts have been established.  Again if there are deficiencies, the Government is determined to remedy them.</P>
    <P>Any difficulties that might arise are more likely to relate to establishment of the facts rather than to the application of disciplinary procedures which are clear.  As I have made clear, the process in which Mr. Justice Buchanan is involved is the first and I believe the most appropriate initial, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;initial&rdquo;, step to establish the facts.  The House can be assured that as soon as the facts as opposed to speculation and innuendo begin to emerge the Government will move swiftly to take whatever further action is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw public attention to the distinction between legitimate funding for political activity and anything which might involve corrupt practices.  By international standards we have in this country a relatively <Col N="1487" /> inexpensive political process.  It relies mainly on voluntary contributions to political parties and to politicians by individuals and companies.  For example, the annual cost of running the political party I lead in a non-election year is about £800,000.  In a general election expenditure by individuals and parties varies, but it would be fair to estimate that, averaged out, the cost of putting a candidate forward by the main political parties is in the region of £15,000 to £20,000 per candidate.  A general election can cost a minimum of £0.5 million in our case and has cost much more in the past.</P>
    <P>I am putting those figures in the public domain for the first time so that there will be a general understanding of the scale of the funding required by parties or individuals.  The total contribution today from public funds to all the parties combined is about £650,000 per annum. That is less than the cost I mentioned required to run one party with which I am directly familiar. This is paid by way of allowances to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats.  The system is somewhat arbitrary.  A party with eight members in the House gets £150,000 a year while one with six members does not get anything.</P>

      <P>The gap between the total cost of running the political process and the subvention received from the State has to be filled in some way.  It cannot be entirely met by the funds raised in the normal course of events from annual membership fees from individuals or through local voluntary activity including raffles, sales of work, golf classics and other such events. For some time the main parties have had to make up the balance of ordinary ongoing finance as distinct from finance for elections through voluntary corporate donations.  That has been my experience since 1990 when I became responsible for a political party.  The party cannot be run on the basis of the ordinary annual income that comes in.  Leaving elections aside, it is not possible to provide the type of service at the levels of salary required to be paid to get competent people just to keep the party ticking over out of the ordinary annual income.</P>
      <P>It has been necessary every year to look for corporate donations just to run the ordinary day-to-day activities of the party.  I have no doubt that is true of some, if not most, of the parties in this House.  It is certainly true of mine, the only one with which I have direct familiarity.  There is nothing improper about this.  It is the norm in democracies worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not surprisingly, public disquiet on occasions <Col N="1488" /> such as this is greater than it might otherwise be because there are no statutory controls on the amounts political parties and candidates can spend, no ceilings on contributions from companies or individuals and, most importantly, no requirements either on companies, individuals or the political recipients to make public the amounts received.  That was never done until recently.</P>
    <P>I can say with certainty that no corporate or individual contribution has ever influenced a Fine Gael Minister or a Government of which Fine Gael is or has been a part.  The number of Ministers who might be aware of the sources of contributions is very small.  For their sakes and that of the integrity of the system, the information is tightly held.  Fine Gael has, in exceptional circumstances, returned donations where it was felt they might have been made with a subliminal intention of currying favour in regard to a particular decision.  It was felt it would be better not to take the money.  I have no doubt that is true of all the other parties in this House. In saying this I am not laying claim to special virtue.</P>
    <P>I fully understand, however, the public disquiet.  To deal with this, the Government has been considering for some time both the public funding of the political process and the regulations which might govern the private funding of such activities.  Details of the decisions taken by the Government at its meeting today were announced this afternoon by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government has moved on two fronts to deal with the tarnishing of the good name of politics and politicians.  I hope in doing so we can allay public concern.</P>
    <P>We have taken what we believe are the most effective possible steps to establish the facts arising out of the media allegations about payments to political parties and politicians by Dunnes Stores.  We are determined to do everything possible to get to the bottom of the allegations.  If, as a last resort, it becomes necessary to establish a tribunal under the relevant legislation, that will be done.  It will be done, however, on the basis of the most reliable possible information available and constructed in such a way as to ensure it can do its work quickly with the least possible public expense.</P>
    <P>We have decided also to increase the public funding of political activity and will introduce accountability for the private funding of political activity.  The necessary legislation will be brought before the House as early as possible in the new year.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to specific questions raised about Deputy Michael Lowry.  As the House is aware, Deputy Lowry has asked for time to enable him to give a full response to allegations made against him.  He has resigned his post as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to facilitate the preparation of such a response.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> The allegations appear to relate to Deputy Lowry's commercial relationship with Dunnes Stores and Mr. Ben Dunne.  To my knowledge there is no evidence against him relating to any allegation of political impropriety in the conduct of his public duties either as a Deputy or Minister.</P>
    <P>To answer the specific questions put by Deputy Bobby Molloy, to the best of my knowledge neither Mr. Ben Dunne nor any company in which he had or has an interest benefited financially from any decision made by Deputy Lowry during his period as Minister.  If Deputy Molloy or anyone else has any information to the contrary and gives it to me, it will be fully investigated immediately.  The Minister for Finance has confirmed that, in his time as Minister, he is not aware of any Fine Gael or any political representations seeking changes in the tax law made to him or his Department on behalf of Dunnes Stores or the Dunne family.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has put other questions which can be appropriately answered by Deputy Lowry only.  I understand it is Deputy Lowry's intention to ask for permission to make a personal statement in the House on 19 December and that he will, if required, subsequently make himself available to answer questions before an appropriate committee or sub-committee of the House.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the questions raised by Deputy Dermot Ahern.  On the committee's ability to find facts, in so far as they relate to a revenue matter, the appropriate way to find them is through the Revenue Commissioners.  In so far as they relate to an offence contrary to the legislation I have cited, they are a matter for the courts.  Where they fall into neither category, in other words, where there is no appropriate legal arrangement and it is primarily a political matter, any deficiency in the powers of the committee to deal with it will be remedied either by the privilege and compellability legislation or separately, as necessary.</P>
    <P>This is not an indication that we will allow a committee of the House to do the work of the courts, the Revenue Commissioners or any other duly constituted authority for the enforcement of the law.  I do not believe Deputy Ahern would expect me to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The purpose of the Buchanan process is to allow the information to be sifted through to eliminate from the list those not involved in public affairs, where the payments made are of no concern to the House or public <Col N="1490" /> business, and to afford those who fall into the other category an opportunity to furnish an explanation to the judge, be it entirely innocent or otherwise.  This will give them an opportunity to clear their names in their own words before the committee receives the report.</P>
      <P>Having studied the report, if the committee still feels there are questions to be asked of a particular individual, it may be that he or she would have no difficulty in answering them solely to assist it in its work in respect of somebody else or some other aspect of the inquiry it wished to take up.  There will be no pejorative implication in anybody being asked to assist the committee in its work, no more than there will be in any individual being asked to assist any committee of the House in its work.  That is reasonable.  If there is any illegality involved, the appropriate way to deal with it is through the courts.  Deputies trained in law will appreciate that the Dáil cannot set itself up as a court.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of tribunals of inquiry in recent history.  While history does not teach us exact lessons, it gives us experience which can prove useful.  The beef tribunal had extremely widely drawn terms of reference.  The kitchen sink was literally thrown in.  It cost a huge amount of money and found comparatively little in terms of firm decisions or recommendations.  The reason it cost a huge amount of money was that its terms of reference were literally made up on the floor of the House.  They were added to literally by the hour as the debate proceeded.  As a result, we ended up with a tribunal which cost a mint, in order to get a Government out of difficulty on a particular day in the Dáil.  In contrast, in the case of the hepatitis C tribunal it appears the terms of reference were drawn rather more carefully.  The preliminary work was done, which did not reveal all the relevant facts but which at least refined the issues down to a point where we knew precisely where the gaps were in the information.  The House was, therefore, able to draw the terms of reference of that tribunal much more narrowly and precisely so that we could find out in an effective way the information we wanted.</P>
      <P>I would say to Deputies who are anxious to get to the bottom of the matter and who are sceptical, perhaps justly so, as to whether one can get all the information through a normal process of inquiry in the House, it is best to ensure that is done, if a tribunal is necessary, having refined the terms of reference in the most precise fashion possible.  The process we are now going through is the quickest, most cost effective way of getting the facts.  Although the Opposition will obviously support the motion &mdash; I have no quarrel with that &mdash; it will see at the end of the day that the approach we are adopting is the best one.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chuid ama a roinnt le mo chuid comhlachtaithe an Teachta Dála Cullen agus an Teachta Dála Dempsey.  When discussing this issue it is as well <Col N="1491" /> to remind ourselves once again, lest we forget, that the reason we are having this debate, the reason for the suggestion by the Progressive Democrats of a tribunal, which is supported by our party, is that it has been alleged that a Member of this House, a former member of the Government, received payments in excess of £200,000 for extensions and renovations to his family home.  It is important to keep that in our minds because events of the past ten days might well have been put in place to try to cloud that issue.  The allegations have never been denied.</P>
      <P>I was interested this evening to read the statement of the Northside Seven who, knowing that the former Minister is to make a personal statement next week, decided to pre-empt it and capture the high moral ground.

      <P>In regard to the investigation of the allegations, rumour and innuendo, it is very important that the matter be cleared up as quickly as possible.  Like my colleagues I believe that, despite what I am sure will be tremendous work by Judge Buchanan in sifting through and scrutinising the Price Waterhouse report and related documents, which I hope he has received, a committee of this House which is weighted politically cannot be asked to act in a quasi-judicial way in making a determination, and in any event under Standing Orders committees are not capable of making determinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that former Members and people who were never Members of the House, in this instance Mr. Ben Dunne, cannot be compelled to appear before a committee of the House.  It makes a nonsense of the committee, therefore, if it can interview only a small number of politicians, many of whom perhaps received their contributions in a perfectly legitimate way as election expenses.  I strongly believe that the Government should think again about its attitude to the Progressive Democrats motion.  It places an inordinate burden of work on the Ceann <Col N="1492" /> Comhairle and his office, particularly given that they are already under so much pressure.</P>

      <P>How will we get public officials to come before a committee of this House when we cannot compel them to do so? There have been ten days of rumour and innuendo about who is and who is not on the list, and there is probably no politician in either of the two Houses of the Oireachtas who has not at one time or other been on the list.</P>
      <P>Politics as a profession has taken a battering in recent years, particularly in the past ten days.  The public believe that politicians are either on the make or on the take, and that is a huge attack on our profession, a profession of which every Member of both Houses is very proud.  We must move very quickly to re-establish the integrity of politicians and ensure that the public can once again have confidence in politics as a profession. If we do not do that, we are attacking ourselves and preventing new entrants from coming into the profession because they believe that once they decide to stand for election they are immediately tainted.  That is a real fear people have and it is time we set about increasing the esteem in which the public hold politicians.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the former Minister that he will come into the House next week and make a personal statement.  I regret that was not done sooner because it has helped to create frustration for everybody in politics.</P>
      <P>When we talk about tribunals everybody thinks of the beef tribunal.  Deputy O'Donnell and I had much argument with the Government, particularly the Minister for Health, about a tribunal to investigate the hepatitis C scandal. That tribunal is now working very quickly, efficiently and effectively and that is acknowledged publicly.  Why could a tribunal such as that suggested by the Opposition not work equally efficiently and effectively?  It could compel witnesses to come before it.  Much of the preliminary work would be done by Judge Buchanan and all his papers could be presented to the tribunal in the same way as much of the preparatory work was done for the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>

Deputy Lowry resigned from Government, according to him, because of a perfectly legitimate business deal.  On the radio the following Monday he repeatedly assured us that it was a perfectly legitimate deal, and many of his colleagues in Fine Gael, and indeed some in Labour and Democratic Left, have told us that again.  The question people are asking is if everything was above board and legitimate, why did he resign?  If it was perfectly legitimate why does he not know how the extension materialised at his home in Tipperary and why did he have to go to a conclave of advisers in order to let us know two, three or four weeks down the road how that happened?  He does not know whether it is for services rendered, extended credit or a loan facility.  According to the interview with Marian Finucane, he does not even know whether he owns the house or the extension built on to it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Taoiseach said there were too many people in prison.  It announced a proposed bail referendum and abandoned it at the insistence of Democratic Left and Labour.  There was a time when those in Fine Gael would have stood up to this kind of nonsense.  They would have asserted themselves and stood up for what they believed in, but not any more.  They are in Government without power and are afraid to stand up for their beliefs. They are a sad spectacle.  If ever the Fine Gael Party needed somebody like Ciáran Fitzgerald in their midst, the former Irish rugby captain, it is now; we know what he said about pride.</P>
      <P>What about the Labour Party, the party of such high moral authority, the party which feels it can lecture everybody in this House about honesty and integrity?  It tells us this Government will last because there is trust between the parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a free press, but we also need a responsible one.  The series of apparently unfounded stories which appeared over the past week were the product of the infamous black propaganda wing of the Fine Gael Party which is alive and well, as it has been for generations.  Everybody knows about it.  Its propaganda is ususally very personalised vilification, a whispering campaign around the doors at election time and between elections. They are past masters at it, but they have been found out this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Journalists should expose corruption and <Col N="1498" /> anything else that is wrong, but they should be wary of stories from Fine Gael sources, whether they come from a Member or from influential communications experts outside.  This motion deserves the support of the House.  It deserves the support of the Labour Party based on their words in the past.  Their actions tonight will speak more eloquently than any of their words over the past three or four years.  I hope I will see them going through the correct lobby.</P>

      <P>The magnificent seven, the &ldquo;men <Col N="1499" /> from Del Monte&rdquo; are up at the back ready to squeeze another bit out of the can.  This evening we heard the concerns of the north-siders and the statement calling on the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, to make a statement to the House.  It is interesting they say that their constituents are deeply concerned.  There is no mention that they themselves are concerned.

      <P>The response this evening was that the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, will make a statement this week.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that he should choose the last day on which the Dáil will sit this year to come to the House to explain himself.  He is doing so in the full knowledge that questions are bound to arise from his statement and that there will be no colleagues around to question him.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The only exercise Deputy Carey gets is coming into this House to jump to conclusions.  He should hold on and listen to the facts.  This evening the Taoiseach fell into the same trap when he implied that there were allegations of impropriety on the part of <Col N="1500" /> Members of the Oireachtas.  There are no specific allegations against specific Members of this House.  The only fact available to the House is that the former Minister had to resign his office on the basis of evidence presented in the newspapers.  I reject being tarnished by his actions.  I am beginning to feel that one of these days I will have to approach Dáil Éireann wearing a long trench coat to hide myself coming through the gate to an honourable profession.  I would point out to the media and other professions that the standards we have to live up to in public life are much higher than those of other professions.  People would do well to bear that in mind when they speak about a profession of which I and many others are proud.</P>
      <P>By not setting up a tribunal that would have some chance of getting at the truth behind the newspaper allegations, the Taoiseach and Fine Gael have once again failed to show publicly that they have the capacity and desire to get at the truth.  A sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will not get to the bottom of this.  I predict that questions will be raised about some politicians which will lead to questions on other issues probably contained in the Price Waterhouse report.  With due respect to Judge Buchanan whom I respect for taking it on, it will be a thankless task which will not deliver to this House or into the public domain what might be contained in the Price Waterhouse report.  There is no point in pretending it will.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Government were wrong to choose this road.  At a minimum they should have taken the line that was chosen by the Wallace committee which at least presented the opportunity for people to be questioned directly and which led to the answers coming into the public domain.  That clearly will not happen in this case, and it is a sad reflection on the Government that it had not the courage to do something that would have provided some of the answers.</P>

      <P>In this House on 24 May 1991, at col. 2460 of the Official Report, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said: &ldquo;Every citizen who pays taxes ... has an immediate interest in this unfolding debacle.&rdquo;  He also said: &ldquo;... we are about to demonstrate to our international trading partners that [we do not] tolerate financial chicanery....&rdquo;  He went on to criticise Fianna Fáil for what he said was a campaign of <Col N="1504" /> vilification against his party.  He proudly claimed the Workers' Party, of which he was then a member, was the first to call for a tribunal of inquiry into allegations of irregularities in the beef industry.  His party was at the receiving end of the vilification on that occasion, yet he and his colleagues were giving it out in doses last night. However, they will not deflect me from the issues in hand.</P>
      <P>The issue at hand is the honesty and integrity of our political system.  I take grave exception to those who believe that ordinary standards of openness or truth are the high moral ground because they are not.  Parties may not have one view in Opposition, be the great champions of openness, transparency and accountability and talk about Government as though behind a pane of glass, yet when hit by controversy in their own ranks adopt a different and inconsistent attitude.</P>
      <P>Since this issue arose the Government has mishandled and misjudged it.  At the beginning the Taoiseach attempted to play down the allegations reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29 November.  He said he had a brief chat with his Minister, a brief glance at the newspaper and that it had all happened before Deputy Lowry became a Minister.  He said that if an explanation was necessary he was sure Deputy Lowry would provide it.  From that point every effort has been made to blame everybody from my party to the media.</P>
      <P>Because Fine Gael is getting a bad press does not mean we have a bad press.  We must remember it was Susan O'Keeffe and the &ldquo;World In Action&rdquo; programme that brought to light the irregularities in the beef industry.  On foot of that the Taoiseach was delighted to vote for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into that industry.  He said tonight that newspaper reports are not sufficient grounds on which to have a tribunal but they were in 1991.  Thanks to journalist Chris Moore our attention was drawn to the scandal of the Fr. Smyth affair.  Thanks to Liz Allen we learned of the Brink's-Allied story, not because of anything that happened in this House.  We cannot pick and choose when we decided to support the media.  Thanks to Sam Smyth we have had the resignation of Deputy Michael Lowry.  I do not take any personal glee in saying that.</P>

      <P>The route suggested by the Government as a means of finding out what happened is convoluted and destined to go nowhere.  The committee that will be put in charge of carrying out the investigation has a Government majority; it meets in private; it has no power to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses or documents; and if anybody misleads that committee it will not be an offence.  For all those reasons that committee is not a satisfactory way of trying to find out the truth.  More importantly, to ask a committee of Dáil Deputies to inquire into allegations in relation to politicians is like asking the Blood Transfusion Service Board to inquire into the allegations of the contamination of the blood supply or asking the beef industry to inquire into irregularities or allegations about irregularities in that industry.  It is not credible that an in-house toothless committee should carry out an inquiry into something about the reputation of politicians.  For that, if for no other reason, the public will not have faith in any report or inquiry that committee will carry out.</P>
      <P>It is important to have a political system that is honest and a system of public administration that is fair and above reproach.  Those are essential in any democracy.  We have been fortunate here in that we have had, and do have, an honest political system and a system of public administration of which we can all be proud.  If there are improprieties and if there are individuals who took money improperly they need to be rooted out because all of us will fall as long as we are associated with such people.</P>
      <P>Renovations carried out to the house of a Minister or Deputy or payments through an offshore bank account to a former Member do not amount to political donations.  We should not confuse two issues.  We are talking about serious allegations.  The only thing that has been substantiated is what we read on 29 November in the <i>Irish Independent</i> where we saw photostats of cheques.  The story has not been denied or contradicted, we are simply waiting for an explanation.</P>

      <P>Last week I suggested the Government use the powers in the Companies Act.  Our legal advice is that under section 19 of that Act the Minister can appoint an authorised officer to go into any company and get any documents he wishes.  He can do that if he believes there was any misconduct or fraud.  If <Col N="1507" /> company accounts were falsely recorded that is fraud and sufficient grounds for the Minister to use the powers in section 19 of the Act.  That is a preliminary measure before a decision would be made to go to the High Court to appoint an inspector.  We have no power in this House to require the Minister to do that, it is a matter for the Minister or the Government.  Therefore we could not put down a motion to that effect, though I did make inquiries in that regard.  The Government said that procedure would not work and would not be legal and I accept that.  For that reason we availed of the only other course open to the House, the power to appoint a tribunal. Nobody has disputed that a tribunal would be legal and thorough.  Everybody likes to talk about the beef tribunal but as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, a tribunal is sitting a short distance from here about which Fintan O'Toole, a journalist with <i>The Irish Times</i>, said that after one hour of evidence we learned more than in two years either through this House or the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report.  Facts we did not know for 20 years are now emerging.  It is doing its work in an efficient, speedy and thorough fashion and is a model for how a tribunal in this matter could work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cost, I believe no price is too high to pay for the truth.  We will pay a heavy price if we leave any stone unturned in ensuring that the allegations that have been made are fully investigated.  A committee of this House has neither the resources, the power nor the wherewithal to investigate simple transactions, never mind complex ones.</P>
      <P>In relation to political funding, I will not repeat private conversations.  Anyone who engages in repeating private conversation is dishonourable but for some reason the Minister for Social Welfare saw fit last night to refer to a private conversation.  I never approached the Minister for Social Welfare and I hope he corrects the record. I had a conversation with him but I did not approach him.</P>

Public money should be used to fund this House and our parliamentary institutions to ensure Deputies have adequate <Col N="1508" /> back-up research facilities, to ensure the work of this House can be conducted on a fair and impartial basis.  Regardless of size all parties have basic requirements.  In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, every single party, even the late Senator Gordon Wilson, got the same amount because it was recognised that parties have basic needs, regardless of size.  A system of funding that gives the larger parties seven or eight times more than the smaller parties is not fair.  That is the proposal.</P>

      <P>Members of parties and their supporters should do that.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, says we cannot have it both ways.  Under his proposal we will have it both ways because there will still be private donations up to £4,000 without disclosure in the case of companies, and up to £500 to individuals without disclosure.  There will still be substantial funding to the tune of £6.5 million over the life of one Dáil and that is having it both ways.  The taxpayers will be the only losers arising from everything that has happened here so far.</P>

I regret that is, apparently, what the House will do.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Applications for Legal Assistants.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Advertisements were recently placed for the positions of third and fourth legal assistants in the Office of the Attorney General. It was stated in the conditions of application that applicants must be barristers and have practised in the State for at least seven years for the post of third legal assistant, or at least four years for the position of fourth legal assistant.</P>
      <P>The report of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on the Office of the Attorney General, which was published on 15 February 1996, stated that the position of legal assistant should be open to both branches of the profession.  The committee, as stated in the introduction to the report, considered it timely to examine issues in relation to the Office of the Attorney General in light of difficulties in that office in late 1994.  It is clear that a major recommendation of a Dáil committee is being ignored by the Office of the Attorney General. Poor administrative arrangements in that office led to the difficulties which preceded the report of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have the height of respect for barristers and recognise their special skills and experience <Col N="1513" /> which come from practice at the Bar, one can hardly say they are better administrators than members of the solicitors' profession who use their acquired skills on a daily basis.  Last year, for the first time, solicitors were appointed to the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman which is under the direction of the Attorney General.  The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, also allows solicitors of ten years' experience to be eligible for appointment as judges of the Circuit Court. This was previously the preserve of the barristers' profession.  As a result, three solicitors now sit on the Circuit Court bench.  Those members of the solicitors profession who serve four or more years on the Circuit Court bench are also eligible for appointment to the superior courts.  Furthermore, a working group met last Tuesday to consider all aspects of solicitors' eligibility for appointment to the position of judge of the superior courts.</P>
    <P>What is it about the work of a legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General which renders the entire solicitors' profession unsuitable for consideration for one of these posts?  I am not suggesting that solicitor applicants should be given more favourable treatment but such public service positions should be open to competition from both branches of the profession.  This would broaden the pool of talent available from which to select.</P>
    <P>The duties of legal assistant referred to in the advertisement are not such as to debar well educated solicitors from applying.  Lawyers in other areas of the public service, such as those in the Department of Foreign Affairs, are doing work of a broadly similar nature and solicitors are eligible for appointment to those posts.  Many solicitors with ten or 15 years' experience work for demanding, high powered corporate clients and they may have represented their firms internationally.  He or she might be an expert in legal draftsmanship, have conducted arbitrations on their own, have acted as an inspector under the Companies Act or been appointed by the Government to conduct legal inquiries.  However, they are all ineligible to apply.  On the other hand, a person who has sat in the Bar library for four years, without extensive experience other than seeking adjournments or making minor applications, can apply.</P>
    <P>This restrictive practice must be ended and all positions must be open to both branches of the profession.  When this happens, those charged with the responsibility of selecting candidates for appointment will be free to exercise their discretion in relation to the experience of the candidates and to decide whether a particular individual is suitable.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of the advertisement, which was published in the national press, the Civil Service Commission stated that it is committed to a policy of equal opportunity.  The Civil Service Commission may be committed to such a policy but it appears the Attorney General is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I understand the Deputy's concern arises from a letter he and other solicitor Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas received from the Director General of the Incorporated Law Society concerning this issue. The Attorney General also received a letter from the Director General of the Law Society dated 26 November 1996 which related to &ldquo;the recruitment of barristers only for Legal Assistant positions in the Office of the Attorney General&rdquo;.  The Attorney General acknowledged receipt of this letter in a letter to the Director General dated 3 December and, in a letter dated 6 December, the Attorney General outlined in considerable detail the reasons for the approach adopted.</P>
      <P>He said the following lawyers work to, or under the direction of, the Attorney General: legal assistants in the Office of the Attorney General &mdash; there are 19 such positions and recruitment is confined to barristers; the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman &mdash; there are 12 positions in this office and recruitment is open to barristers and solicitors; the Chief State Solicitor's Office &mdash; there are 50 permanent positions and, at the moment, approximately another ten contract positions in this office which are all confined to solicitors; country State solicitors &mdash; there are 32 positions around the country in this part of the service, all of them confined to solicitors.  Out of the 123 lawyer positions in the service, 12 are open to barristers and solicitors, 19 are confined to barristers and 93 are confined to solicitors.</P>
      <P>One cannot help feeling that at the heart of this debate is an unresolved question in the mind of the Incorporated Law Society as to whether a unified profession would be a good thing.  The fact that there may be areas where the services provided by both professions overlap, or where arguably a client would have equal confidence in a particular task being performed by a barrister or solicitor, does not take away from the fact that every practitioner in both professions knows there are areas of work which are more properly and better performed by solicitors on the one hand, and other areas where the tasks are better and more properly performed by barristers.</P>
      <P>It is important that if we are to progress in discussing this matter we should correctly understand the Incorporated Law Society's view on this question.  Is it the society's view that a dual profession is best and that there are areas of legal practice which are better performed by barristers, on the one hand, and other areas where the tasks are better performed by solicitors?  This question has not been answered by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the most general terms, barristers provide specialist legal advice and services of advice and representation, both oral and written, in connection with litigation.  The majority of the practitioners in both professions, with the possible exception of a small number of large <Col N="1515" /> solicitor firms which might reasonably expect to have enough work for full time advocates on their staff, favour the current arrangement.  If the society has a different view, it should correct this impression.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is also of the view that both the Bar and the solicitors' profession have, in recent years, improved the arrangements whereby established practitioners can transfer from one profession to another.  Thus, a barrister who, after a number of years' practice discovers that he would prefer to be doing the work of a solicitor, can change and <i>vice versa</i>.  There are a number of examples in both professions of persons who now function as highly successful solicitors or barristers having commenced their career in the other branch of the profession.</P>
    <P>If one accepts the fundamental view that there is different work for barristers and solicitors and that we are better off with a dual profession &mdash; if this is not accepted we are facing a much greater controversy &mdash; then it is a matter of deciding whether any particular employer requires skills which are typically to be found in one profession rather than the other.  There are other differences between barristers and solicitors to which reference can be made.  Since the early 1970s solicitors have had rights of audience in all courts but they have been rarely exercised.</P>
    <P>The work of a legal assistant is concerned with specialist, sometimes highly specialist, advisory work and advising on the conduct of litigation. These, in the Attorney General's view, are matters where the experience of having been a practising barrister is much more material than that of having been a practising solicitor.  Even the Incorporated Law Society acknowledges that in certain areas of legal work it is appropriate that barristers would be engaged.  The Attorney General observes that the Incorporated Law Society was represented by a number of distinguished barristers in a recent high profile High Court matter.  Neither, however, is this confined to litigation.  Thus, from time to time, the society obtains specialist advice from barristers on matters which are not immediately, primarily, or ever will be the subject of litigation. Conversely, barristers regularly retain solicitors to advise upon and conduct important aspects of their personal legal affairs.  Most barristers never have to retain another barrister on a professional basis; almost every barrister will retain a solicitor on a number of occasions during his life.</P>
    <P>In the Chief State Solicitor's office a whole section is given over to advisory work.  It is not the case that solicitors are not asked to perform advisory work.  When files come to the Attorney General's office, they frequently have been advised on, in the first instance, by a solicitor, which mirrors the practice in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is of the view that practice at the Bar allows a familiarity with not just the formal rules by which the court operates, but the informal understandings and practices <Col N="1516" /> which are a part of every legal system.  Someone coming to this office after five or ten years practice at the Bar will have an understanding of litigation, of how particular judges are likely to treat particular issues and a special knowledge of the skills, and strengths and weaknesses, of practitioners at the Bar.</P>
    <P>In those instances where legal advice &mdash; which is more properly within the customary professional remit of a solicitor &mdash; is required, or where input from a solicitor's vantage point would be valuable or helpful, he has no hesitation in calling on the advisory section of the Chief State Solicitor's office to furnish that advice.</P>
    <P>The Bar continues to provide highly qualified candidates with experience of the actual conduct of litigation and of the courts and the judges.  It is the Attorney General's view that it is that sort of advice he requires from the 19 legal assistants who work closest to him.</P>

      <P>I bring to the notice of the House the urgent matter of regular flooding in Dunmanway, County Cork.  Dunmanway is a beautiful town and was so designated when it won the Tidy Towns competition a few years ago. However, its citizens live in fear and trepidation every time there is a heavy shower of rain.  When there is heavy rainfall the houses of Dunmanway and their contents are ruined and citizens must use sand bags to protect them.  The relevant Minister should have regard for the fear in which those people live.  As the local authority submitted a proposal about this problem to the Office of Public Works a few years ago, it is appalling that the relevant department has not carried out the necessary works.  I understand it would cost approximately £500,000.  We are told the buoyant economy will lift all boats.  If there are any spare boats around, the unfortunate residents of Dunmanway will need them because of the serious flooding in the area.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister gives a positive reply to the effect that the work will be carried out immediately.  With modern farming practices, when drainage takes place up river it causes flash floods and other serious problems for citizens of our towns.  The Minister should not vacillate or procrastinate any longer because the citizens of Dunmanway are losing patience.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for giving me an opportunity to speak on this important matter.  The saga of the Dunmanway flooding has been going on for many years.  Representations have been made to several Governments to get the necessary finance to alleviate the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> Dunmanway is an old historic town and is proud of its environs.  The citizens of the Long Bridge area have lived in fear for the past ten years because of a constant threat of their property being flooded.  It is time common sense prevailed.  I hope the Minister looks favourably on this request and grants the necessary finance to enable works to commence immediately.  The fears of the citizens of Dunmanway must be allayed.  I want an assurance from the Minister that the necessary works will be carried out immediately.</P>

      <P>Following the passing of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, which I introduced when I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, a list of some nine areas which suffer periodical localised flooding was drawn up for priority consideration for drainage schemes.  The flooding of Dunmanway was among those first nine areas and the Commissioners of Public Works have been involved since then in the investigation of the causes of the flooding problems in Dunmanway and devising a means of alleviating the problems encountered.</P>
      <P>One of the criteria for selecting areas for inclusion on the first priority list was that the commissioners had previous knowledge of flooding in an area and had information to deal with the matter.  The flooding in Dunmanway was well known to the commissioners as they had undertaken an investigation of the problem and prepared a report on the matter on behalf of Cork County Council in 1990-1.  However, owing to the demands on their available staffing resources in 1995 the commissioners appointed a firm of consulting engineers to undertake the necessary investigations and to prepare a preliminary report outlining a range of options for dealing with the problem and making recommendations on the one most favoured.</P>
      <P>The incorporation of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 into law amended the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 to make it a legal requirement for the carrying out of a detailed environmental impact statement for each drainage scheme and for the report to form part of the statutory scheme documentation.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Act also includes this requirement and hence the investigation of flooding problems and the preparation of drainage and flood alleviation proposals for the Dunmanway schemes required that a detailed assessment of the existing environmental conditions in the area had to be established in the first instance.  This effectively meant that pure engineering proposals could not be finalised until their impact on the existing environment was determined.  As the assessment of existing conditions normally requires at least a full annual cycle, the progress of scheme designs and options were slower than originally envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presence of major areas of environmental <Col N="1518" /> and ecological interest in the Bandon Valley immediately downstream of the Long Bridge in Dunmanway, the discovery of protected species and habitats in the area in question and the recognition of the Bandon river as an important salmonoid river limited the engineering possibilities available.  Notwithstanding this, the commissioners are advancing proposals which primarily involve the construction of embankments and back drain systems upstream and downstream of the Long Bridge, with the mobilisation of three additional arches in the bridge and associated excavations.</P>
    <P>Because of the competing demands on available Exchequer resources and the public capital programme, capital investment projects such as localised drainage-flood relief schemes are required to undergo assessment to prove their economic merits.  Accordingly, a cost-benefit analysis of the Dunmanway scheme proposals needed to be carried out before they could be passed beyond the preparatory stage.  I am happy to say that such an assessment has now been undertaken which shows a positive return for the proposed works.  A design for this scheme is well advanced and preparation of scheme documentation is nearing completion with a view to bringing the scheme to public exhibition stage early in the new year and getting to works stage in April 1997.</P>
    <P>The statutory public exhibition of the scheme documentation will provide opportunities for all interested parties to comment on the scheme proposals and to submit such observations to the Commissioners for their consideration.  The Commissioners are required to consider these observations and, where practicable, to have regard to them in the scheme design, after which the scheme must be submitted to the Minister for Finance for statutory confirmation.</P>
    <P>Works on the Bandon River, Dunmanway, drainage scheme will commence when all the statutory and other procedures have been complied with and the necessary funds for works will be met from the Vote for the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. Curracloe national primary school was built in 1985 to accommodate three classes and 79 pupils. The school now has 108 pupils and a staff of four teachers, a principal, three assistant teachers and a shared remedial teacher.  It is quite obvious that the Department of Education was not doing much forward planning in 1985 when it built a school which, 11 years on, is too small.</P>
      <P>Next year's projected enrolment is 115 pupils and a pupil figure of 91 is the present figure required to retain the three assistants.  At present, the remedial teacher teaches in the kitchenette of the school which measures seven feet by eight feet.  This is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> The school has applied to the Department of Education for an extra room and I tabled a question some time ago to the Minister for Education regarding this extra classroom.  She recognised the need for an extra classroom but, because of the current level of contractual commitments under the primary school capital programme, she was not in a position to sanction one classroom for Curracloe national primary school despite the fact that, as Deputy Walsh said with regard to the previous Adjournment matter, the Departments were awash with cash. Obviously, this Minister does not recognise the importance or need for an extra classroom in Curracloe.</P>
    <P>Curracloe is adjacent to Wexford Town.  It has a rapidly expanding population and there is a large increase in building in the area.  Indeed, the school inspector for the area feels the school will probably reach the size which justifies four assistants and a principal in the very near future. The projections for the next four years which have been sent to the Department show that the retention figure for three assistants and a principal is easily managed.  More people are coming to live in this expanding area on a regular basis and it is high time the Minister and the Department recognised the importance of this extra classroom.</P>
    <P>I have a list of 300 names of parents and pupils of Curracloe all expressing serious concern that they are being ignored by the Department of Education.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Bernard Allen, tonight but I find it amazing that the Minister has never seen fit to take any of the number of matters on Education which I have raised on the Adjournment over the past two years.  She treats back-bench Deputies on all sides of the House with total contempt.  We are only reflecting the views of parents, pupils and teachers and the Minister should do us the courtesy of coming in here to answer.</P>
    <P>The situation which exists in Curracloe national primary school is totally unacceptable. The school is not looking for hundreds of thousands of pounds.  It is looking for a small sum of money to build an extra classroom to facilitate the teachers and children in an expanding area of population.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at this request as the local inspector, who represents the Department of Education in County Wexford, has agreed that this is required urgently and his views should be taken seriously and treated as urgent.</P>

      <P>I am grateful that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's current position in relation to the accommodation needs of St. Margaret's national school, Curracloe, County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present this school has a staffing level of a <Col N="1520" /> principal plus three assistants plus a shared remedial teacher and an enrolment of 108 pupils. The accommodation at the school consists of three permanent classrooms, a general purposes room and ancillary accommodation.</P>
    <P>In April 1996, the board of management of the school wrote to my Department seeking approval for the provision of one additional classroom and a remedial-cum library/medical room.  To assess likely accommodation needs at the school over the next number of years, my Department's planning section and inspectors undertook a review of enrolment trends and the existing accommodation.  This review is being considered in the building unit of my Department at present and, when it has been evaluated, my Department will contact the school management to discuss the available options.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured of the Minister's desire to see an improvement in the accommodation at this school and I again thank him for the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

      <P>Alternatively, while I have the greatest respect for the Minister of State at the Department of Education, one of her junior Ministers at the Department of Justice should have taken the matter if she was unavailable.</P>
      <P>The District Court office at Ballina, County Mayo, has a complement of two District Court clerks and a clerical officer.  One of the District Court clerks went on a career break.  In early October, a civil servant, who previously worked with the Department of the Environment in Ballina, was transferred to the District Court office there.  She was replacing the court clerk who went on a career break.</P>
      <P>District Court clerks are statutory officers who must be appointed to their posts and assigned to a particular district or office.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice to appoint and assign a District Court clerk, pursuant to the Court Officers Act, 1926.  Section 46(2) of that Act states &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, every District Court clerk shall be appointed by the Minister and shall, (unless he is a pensionable officer) hold office at the will of and may be removed by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not come as a surprise to anybody who has taken even a passing interest in the actions and omissions of the Minister for Justice that she did not bother to make the appointment.  Political cynics and connoisseurs alike will agree that a Minister for Justice who allows the Special Criminal Court to be improperly constituted for several months will in all probability consider the failure to properly assign and appoint a District <Col N="1521" /> Court clerk a trivial matter.  However, it is not a trivial matter; it is a most serious matter.  One of the most important functions of a District Court clerk is the issuing of summonses which can ground all criminal proceedings from the most trivial to the most serious.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate civil servant concerned, who thought she was a District Court clerk but was not, courtesy of the Minister for Justice, was signing and issuing summonses by 1 November 1996 but it is possible that she might have started doing so earlier. Once again the Minister for Justice failed to spot her own error and inquiries had to be made in the Department of Justice on 5 December 1996, to ascertain whether the civil servant concerned had been properly appointed and assigned.  It was surely no coincidence that on that very day, 5 December 1996, the appointment and assignment of the civil servant as District Court clerk to District Court Areas 2 and 3 was made.</P>
    <P>The matter first came before the Court at Ballina, County Mayo, yesterday, 10 December 1996, when the District Justice suggested that he strike out all the summonses &mdash; which, because of the time limits involved, necessarily had to be issued before 5 December &mdash; and they could then be reissued.  It was pointed out that some of them could be reissued because they are related either to indictable offences or there was still some time available within the six month period for the issue of the summonses to have them done properly. Other summonses, however, are now out of time and these would include drunken driving summonses.</P>
    <P>The garda superintendent correctly insisted, that the matter be proved and, consequently, all cases where summonses were issued by the civil servant concerned were adjourned to Ballina District Court on 14 January 1997 and liberty was given to issue a witness summons against the principal officer of the Department of Justice directing his attendance at that court and to bring with him all documents relating to the appointment of the new District Court clerk.</P>
    <P>In addition to the summonses before the District Court in Ballina, County Mayo yesterday, there may be others for future sittings of the court in Ballina and in at least ten other courts.  It is possible a large number of summonses issued by the civil servant have yet to come to light.  Nobody knows how many of them will be out of time and, therefore, will be incapable of being reissued.  It is also impossible to say what else the civil servant may have done in the mistaken belief that she was a validly appointed and defined District Court clerk.  It is clear that the extent to which any problems can be rectified depends on ascertaining very quickly what was done in the eight weeks before the appointment was made.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister for Justice has learned nothing from the Special Criminal Court fiasco. Her appalling bungling in this matter led to invalid summonses.  This abysmal level of <Col N="1522" /> ineptitude would be bad enough in any other Department, but is wholly unacceptable in a Department as sensitive as the Department of Justice.  Sadly, further blunders of this kind are inevitable for as long as the Minister, Deputy Owen, presides over this shambles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Proceedings in the District Court in respect of an offence may be commenced by the appropriate officer of the District Court issuing a summons as a matter of administrative procedure.  Summonses are issued under the general superintendence of the appropriate District Court clerk and the name of an appropriate District Court clerk appears on the summons.</P>
      <P>A new executive officer was appointed to Ballina District Court office on 10 October 1996. It is standard practice when new staff, whose duties are likely to include acting as District Court clerk, are being appointed to District Court offices to formally appoint them to act in that capacity.  Although this was not done in the case in question I understand that on the authorisation of the chief clerk in the District Court office in Ballina the signature of the executive officer appeared on the summonses.</P>
      <P>Formal appointments to act as District Court clerk are made under section 46(2) of the Court Officers Act, 1926.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts the Minister for Justice authorises named departmental officials to authenticate the appointment.  This is a long-standing practice.  The appointment is effected by the issue of a document from the personnel division of the Department of Justice.  The omission to issue the necessary document to the chief clerk in Ballina on this occasion was due to error on the part of an executive officer in the personnel division.  Because of the routine nature of the processing of the document of appointment, including the document appointing an executive officer assigned to a court office as an appropriate District Court clerk, they are issued directly to the relevant court office by the personnel division and do not require submission to or signature by the Minister.  This again is in accordance with long-standing practice.</P>
      <P>The two officials concerned in this instance, the chief clerk in Ballina and an executive officer in the Department of Justice, have been asked to furnish an explanation as a matter of urgency for the lapse that occurred.  In the meantime the advice of the Chief State Solicitor has been sought on the legal implications arising.</P>
      <P>I understand a number of cases where summonses bore the signature of the newly-appointed executive officer in question came for hearing at Ballina District Court yesterday and were adjourned until 14 January 1997.  I understand also that on legal advice the Garda authorities have decided to make fresh applications for summonses in respect of all cases where the issue of summonses is still within the time permitted by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> A check of the relevant files in the Department of Justice has shown that on many occasions over the years &mdash; prior to the appointment of the present Minister for Justice &mdash; the formal document appointing officials to act as a District Court clerk frequently took place several years after the officers in question acted in that capacity.  The document of appointment in these cases was backdated following advice <Col N="1524" /> received from the Attorney General's office in 1986.</P>
    <P>My advice is that as the recent cases to which I referred are now <i>sub judice</i> it would not be appropriate at this point to comment on the possible legal aspects of the issues which have arisen.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 December 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to previous questions I repeated my congratulations, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, to Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos-Horta, on the awarding to them of the 1996 Nobel Prize for peace.  This award, which was presented in Oslo yesterday, must send a strong signal to the people of East Timor that they are not forgotten by the international community and be a source of great hope to them that their situation can be improved.</P>
      <P>European Union policy on East Timor is based on the common position adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996.  In accordance with the terms of that common position, Ireland, as Presidency, is actively supporting international efforts to promote respects for human rights and a just and peaceful solution to the East Timor question, which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as President of the Council of Ministers, I have availed of appropriate opportunities, in particular the meetings with ASEAN and other Asian countries in Jakarta last July, to focus international attention on the issue of East Timor, and the EU common position on this subject.  I have stressed, in particular, the EU's call on the Indonesian Government to adopt effective measures leading to a significant improvement in human rights in East Timor, especially by implementing fully the relevant decisions adopted in this connection by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has designated East Timor as a priority issue for our Presidency and we have held discussions with our EU partners to consider appropriate follow-up action on foot of the common position.  Such action largely focuses on support for the continuing talks, under the <Col N="1527" /> auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General, between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers, who are due to meet again on 21 December 1996 in New York, and on the all-inclusive intra-Timorese dialogue, which is likely to be convened for a third round early next year. The Minister of State for development co-operation at my Department, Deputy Burton has also indicated the Government's willingness to make a financial contribution available for further intra-Timorese meetings.</P>
    <P>During discussions of the situation in East Timor at the General Affairs Council in Brussels on 25 November 1996, Ministers expressed support for the ministerial talks between Portugal and Indonesia, and the hope that there would be some tangible progress gained from these talks. The Council also requested the European Commission to make proposals on certain development projects by the EU in East Timor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council agreed common positions in respect of regulations on the fight against AIDS-HIV in developing countries; environmental operations in developing countries as well as a regulation on assistance to refugees in developing <Col N="1528" /> countries in Asia and Latin America at its meeting of 28 May this year.  These common positions took full account of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at its First Reading of each draft regulation.  As the Parliament only completed its Second Reading of these regulations on 21 November, it now seems unlikely that amendments made by the Parliament will be forwarded to the Council for consideration before the end of Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The amendments proposed by Parliament will be taken into account by Ireland when these regulations come before the Council for discussion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allocation of 45 million ECU allocated under the draft regulation on the fight against AIDS-HIV, this is only one of a number of budget lines which can be used to finance programmes in this area.  The range of EU financed development activities in the social sectors, particularly in health and education, as well as national indicative programmes under the European Development Fund also include provisions in respect of AIDS-HIV.</P>

      <P>During the past decade the scale, character, frequency, location, cost and complexity of manmade humanitarian emergencies around the world has changed and the number of persons in need of humanitarian assistance increased almost 60 per cent in the last ten years.  The social and economic cost associated with humanitarian emergencies, including the number of deaths, has been staggering.  It is estimated that there are some 41.5 million refugees and internally displaced people who are dependent on humanitarian aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the increase in the number of humanitarian crises the United Nations Secretary General established the Department of Humanitarian Affairs in 1991 as a focal point in <Col N="1529" /> the UN system to co-ordinate the response to these crises and to provide early warning of potential disasters.  The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs publishes a list of ongoing humanitarian emergencies worldwide and summary of requirements and contributions to those emergencies.  The list currently includes emergencies in sub-Saharan Africa, South and East Asia, Caucasus and Central Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans.  I am arranging for this list to be lodged in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>My Department, working in close partnership with the EU member states, continues to monitor all these crises.  The European Union is now the foremost single donor of humanitarian aid and has played a vital role in mobilising support both for the short-term humanitarian aid and for the longer term purposes of rehabilitation and development.</P>
    <P>In view of the mounting humanitarian crises in 1992, the European Commission set up the European Community Humanitarian office &mdash; ECHO &mdash; to co-ordinate emergency aid efforts, and to provide rapid and appropriate support during the first six months of an emergency.  In 1995 over 60 per cent of ECHO funding was targeted to refugee problems and funding of 692 million ECU was provided to over 60 crisis stricken countries.  The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs prepares consolidated UN Inter-Agency appeals, on behalf of all the UN agencies and the International Red Cross, and coordinates the programmes of the UN agencies in response to humanitarian emergencies.</P>
    <P>My Department allocates grants to support the relief efforts of international aid agencies and NGOs each year from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund.  This year £8.0 million will be disbursed from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund to almost all the major humanitarian crises which have taken place in 1996.  Each year a complete table of all grants listed is detailed in Annex 20 of the Irish Aid Annual Report.  I also refer the Deputy to the European Commission 1995 Annual Report on Humanitarian Aid.</P>

      <P>I share the concern underlying the Deputy's question.  Zaire's condition has enormous implications for the region and indeed for Africa as a whole.  There is deep worry in the region that the current conflict in Zaire could possibly lead to the break-up of the country.  At the Nairobi summit of the Heads of State of the <Col N="1530" /> region on 5 November, the territorial integrity of Zaire was stressed as a central principle.  This is very much the position of the European Union also, as we have made clear in several declarations in recent months.  It was a position we also stressed to the Government of Zaire in discussions with them on 10 November by the Troika of Development Ministers, led by my colleague, Deputy Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>As to the steps planned to prevent a further deterioration in the political situation in Zaire, the EU has underlined repeatedly that only dialogue can bring a lasting resolution of the problems of Zaire and indeed of the region. Accordingly, with the active involvement of the EU Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, we have been seeking to promote dialogue at all levels.  In particular, we have sought to encourage the process involving the Heads of State of the region, with Mr. Julius Nyerere, the former President of Tanzania in the role of facilitator.  During his visit to Dublin two weeks ago, I reiterated the Union's full support for his efforts as well as those of the regional leaders.  The next meeting of the regional Heads of State to discuss the situation in Zaire is expected to be held in Nairobi next Monday, 16 December.  Mr. Ajello will be present in Nairobi on behalf of the European Union.  It is hoped that Zaire and Rwanda will be represented at that meeting.  The Heads of State will encourage the resolution of the internal problems in Zaire by dialogue.  They will also seek to broker a dialogue between Zaire and Rwanda on the difficulties which exist between those two countries arising from the present conflict in eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>The European Union supports the democratic transition process, which has a key role to play in the resolution of Zaire's problems.  A central element of that process will be elections which are due to be held in 1997.  The Union recently agreed a joint action under which the EU will establish a European Electoral Unit in Kinshasa and provided a contribution of two million ECU to the special fund which has been established by the United Nations to assist Zaire in the holding of the elections.  Work on the establishment of the Electoral Unit is proceeding actively at present.  I should stress that EU assistance to Zaire in this regard is conditional on commitments which have already been entered into by the Zairean authorities being fulfilled.  The Troika of Development Ministers also stressed to the Zairean Government during their recent meeting the importance the Union attached to allowing all Zaireans to participate in the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More broadly, there is a need for a comprehensive framework within which these problems and those of the region as a whole can be addressed in a comprehensive way.  As was stressed in the recent debates in this House, a humanitarian solution alone is no solution.  While it is right that a major focus of our efforts in the short term must be on the secure delivery of <Col N="1531" /> humanitarian aid to those in need &mdash; and that is the context in which the work of the temporary multinational force is proceeding &mdash; we must also ensure that the underlying problems are addressed in a coherent way.  We will, therefore, continue to press for the early convening of an international conference on peace, stability and development in the region, under the auspices of the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. This conference could look at all of these issues in a comprehensive, integrated way and bring forward plans for a durable, lasting settlement. The EU and the international community generally would be involved in this process in a supportive way, with a central role being taken by the region itself.  This approach will address, in a longer-term way, the issues at the heart of the current conflict in Zaire.</P>

      <P>The political and security situation in Algeria has been of grave concern to the Government and to our partners in the European Union since the outbreak of the cycle of violence in 1992 which left more than 50,000 people dead. The Union has repeatedly called on all sides to the conflict to cease all acts of violence to allow for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation.  While acknowledging that it is for the people of Algeria to resolve the current conflict on the basis of reconciliation, the European Union has given its support to initiatives aimed at encouraging dialogue between those who reject terrorism and violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> At the current session of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, the Irish Presidency, in a statement on behalf of the European Union, drew attention to developments in Algeria, particularly in relation to human rights.  The Presidency condemned all acts of violence whatever the source, particularly terrorist attacks against the civilian population. The statement reiterated the Union's hope that stability and peace, a peaceful dialogue and free and fair elections will prevail in Algeria.</P>
    <P>The Union is doing what it can to encourage all parties to work towards developing the democratic process in Algeria.  It is committed to working with Algeria in the context of the Barcelona Euro Mediterranean process in which Algeria is a participant and which commits all members to develop the rule of law and democracy in their political systems and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The European Union recently decided to begin negotiations on an association agreement between the Union and Algeria.  Support for human rights and democratisation will form an essential part of any agreement worked out with Algeria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as EU Presidency, participated fully in the preparatory work for the Lisbon Summit and in the drafting of the Lisbon Declaration, including the Declaration on &ldquo;A Common and Comprehensive Security Model for the Twenty-first century&rdquo;.  A copy of the Lisbon Declaration has been placed in the Dáil Library.  The final text reflects many of the ideas and suggestions that Ireland put forward on behalf of the EU.  In summary, the declaration reflects the commitment of all OSCE states to create &ldquo;a common security space free of dividing lines in which all States are equal partners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fundamental elements of this common security space are the comprehensiveness and indivisibility of security and the allegiance to shared values, commitments and norms of behaviour, which have been developed and acknowledged by OSCE participating states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> Central to this approach is the concept of mutually reinforcing co-operation between security institutions, which has already been endorsed by the OSCE, and which is seen in a practical light in the former Yugoslavia, where the UN, the OSCE, NATO, EU and Western European Union have all played mutually reinforcing roles in the cause of peace.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Declaration on the Security Model which reaffirmed that the OSCE has a central role in the new European security architecture, the Lisbon Summit Declaration includes the decision by OSCE-participating states to continue their efforts to enhance the efficiency of the OSCE as a primary instrument for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.  It was agreed that the chairman-in-office should report on progress achieved, in relation to strengthening the OSCE's institutions and structures, at the OSCE Ministerial Council to be held in Copenhagen in December 1997.</P>
    <P>The Declaration on the Security Model, with the agreement reached on an agenda for further work on the Security Model, represents the commitment of all OSCE states to enhance security co-operation, through the OSCE and in partnership with other international organisations.  This is in keeping with the approach set out in the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy and the commitment to develop further the OSCE's central role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court was established on 11 December 1995 under Resolution 50/46 of the United National General Assembly.  Its mandate was to consider substantive issues and to draft texts in preparation for a diplomatic conference which would be charged with the adoption of a convention establishing a permanent international criminal court.  The preparatory committee was widely seen as the last important stage before the convening of a diplomatic conference.  The committee has met twice so far, in March-April and in August of this year.  In addition, the progress of the committee's work was reviewed by the General Assembly at its 51st session this autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland held the Presidency of the European Union both during the August session of the preparatory committee and subsequently during <Col N="1535" /> the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly.  As such, Ireland was responsible for co-ordinating the European Union's position on this issue.  It may therefore be useful to draw a distinction between what Ireland did to support the establishment of an international criminal court in its capacity as President of the European Union and what it did in its national capacity.</P>
    <P>The European Union supports the establishment of an international criminal court. It stated its position clearly in this respect in the memorandum accompanying my Presidency address on behalf of the European Union to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 24 September 1996.  In its Presidency role, Ireland delivered a statement last October on behalf of the European Union in the Sixth (legal) Committee of the UN General Assembly.  In its statement, the European Union reiterated a number of fundamental considerations pertaining to the establishment of an international criminal court.  These included the safeguarding of the court's independence, the limitation of its jurisdiction to the most serious crimes, the complementarity of its jurisdiction to national systems of justice and the provision of proper standards of due process.  The European Union concluded its statement by looking forward to the holding of a diplomatic conference for the establishment of an international criminal court after the preparatory committee had finalised its work.</P>
    <P>From a national perspective, Ireland believes that a permanent international criminal court is necessary to enable the international community to bring to justice those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law. Accordingly, I have strongly advocated Ireland's commitment to the establishment of such a court in my last three statements in a national capacity at the United Nations General Assembly.  I have also stated this commitment on a number of occasions to this House, most recently in a written reply, dated 2 October 1996, to Deputy Raphael Burke.</P>
    <P>In its national capacity, Ireland participated actively in both sessions of the preparatory committee.  It contributed to the debates on issues of principle as well as to the more detailed discussions on technical legal matters.  Ireland played a significant role in the formulation of the conclusions and the recommendations of the preparatory committee.  At the most recent General Assembly, Ireland supplemented the statement which it had made on behalf of the European Union, with a national statement.  The latter focused on internationally agreed human rights standards, the proposed relationship between the Security Council and a future court and the holding of a diplomatic conference. Subsequently, Ireland was fully engaged in the negotiations surrounding the General Assembly resolution on this topic.  The resolution provides for four more meetings of the preparatory <Col N="1536" /> committee between February 1997 and April 1998.  More importantly the resolution also provides for the holding of a conference of plenipotentiaries in 1998 with a view to finalising and adopting a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports holding a diplomatic conference in 1998.  There is widespread recognition that certain key political and legal issues will only be resolved in the context of a diplomatic conference.  I share that belief.  I do not believe that a further statement on the matter is warranted at this point, but I wish to indicate most clearly that Ireland will maintain its active involvement towards the establishment of this court which I believe has the potential to prove itself one of the most important international legal institutions of our time.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated in response to a written question of 27 November on the same subject from Deputy Burke, the Euro-Mediteranean Committee for the Barcelona Process plays an important role in taking stock and evaluating the follow-up to the Barcelona Process.  At its most recent meeting on 19 November the committee continued its work of updating the list of priority actions covering all three areas of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and carried out further work on a strategy paper for future cooperation by the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which it is intended to present to the next meeting of Foreign Ministers to be held in April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current list of priority actions is available in the form of an events calendar and I have arranged for Deputy Leonard to receive a copy. Events held during Ireland's chairmanship of the committee included a conference on local water management hosted by France in Marseilles on 25-26 November, at which Ireland was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, and a Ministerial Conference on the Management of Mediterranean Fish Stocks in Venice on 27-29 November attended by the Minister for the Marine.  Forthcoming events include an Experts Meeting on Economic Transition, a conference on private investment and ministerial conferences <Col N="1537" /> on science and technology, the environment and industrial co-operation.</P>
    <P>As stated also in my reply to Deputy Burke of 27 November, the Senior Officials group responsible for the implementation of the political and security component of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which met most recently on 20 November has formulated a draft action plan which outlines initiatives in a number of areas.  These include the enhancement of stability and the reinforcement of democratic institutions, confidence building measures, human rights and the fight against organised crime and other transnational security threats. Under the Irish Presidency of the European Union, agreement has been reached on the implementation of a number of concrete confidence building measures.  The positive and constructive contributions made by Mediterranean partners to discussions on these issues has been very welcome.  Despite a difficult political context in the region in recent months, notably in relations between Israel and her Arab neighbours, the political dialogue envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration has developed and matured.</P>

      <P>The Irish EU Presidency warmly welcomed the peace agreement signed in Abidjan on 30 November between the President of Sierra Leone, Mr. Kabbah, and the leader of the opposition Revolutionary United Front (the RUF), Mr. Sankoh.  The peace agreement brought to an end more than five years of civil war in the country and opens a new chapter of hope for the long suffering people of Sierra Leone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government shares fully the Deputy's concern to ensure the protection of human rights and the consolidation of peace and democracy in Sierra Leone.  As to the precise mechanisms for monitoring human rights, these are matters for further consideration in the period ahead.  One initiative under way in this area is a proposal for the establishment of a ceasefire monitoring force. We understand that a joint request from the Sierra Leone Government and the RUF is likely to be made shortly to the United Nations.  Such a monitoring force would require a resolution of <Col N="1538" /> the UN Security Council.  We believe that such a force, if agreed by both sides, could have a valuable role to play in the consolidation of the peace process and in creating the climate of confidence necessary to foster democracy in the country.  Ireland will do everything it can, both as EU Presidency and thereafter, with our Union partners, to support the new, positive process that has begun in Sierra Leone and to help ensure full respect for human rights by all sides.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent report by Amnesty International which highlights its concerns regarding the violation of human rights in Turkey.</P>
      <P>The Government and its partners in the European Union are seriously concerned about human rights in Turkey.  Indeed, this concern is shared by all the institutions of the European Union and the wider public within the Union.  We have made clear to the Turkish Government that the observance of the rule of law and full respect for human rights and basic freedoms in Turkey underpins the future development of relations between Turkey and the European Union.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity to raise personally our concern on this issue with the Turkish Foreign Minister at several recent meetings and I have urged the Turkish Government to give serious attention to the need to adopt and implement, as soon as possible, measures to improve human rights and basic freedoms in Turkey.  Such measures would include the proposals announced by Deputy Prime Minister Ciller on 17 October to shorten detention periods and tackle the reported incidences of abuse and torture of suspects in custody.  The adoption of such measures offer the prospect of further progress in improving the protection of human rights in Turkey.  We would also wish to see the early introduction of legislation to give effect to the constitutional amendments in this area adopted last year.</P>
      <P>The Government and its partners in the European Union will continue to urge the Turkish Government to make progress in the area of democratisation and human rights, to the benefit of both the citizens of Turkey as well as Turkey's relations with the international community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Declaration on Zambia of 31 October 1996 referred to in the Deputy's question relates to the presidential and parliamentary elections held in the country on 18 November which were boycotted by a number of opposition parties.  While recognising that the elections took place in a peaceful and orderly manner, the European Union deeply regrets that they were not held on a basis acceptable to all parties.  We are seriously concerned that the absence of political consensus might result in a decline in the previous standards of governance in Zambia.  The EU and its member states have, over the past five years, strongly supported the Zambian Government's economic and political reform programme and we now look to the Zambian Government to reinvigorate this reform programme.  The Irish Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union to this effect on 20 November.  In addition the declaration called on the Zambian authorities and all political parties to engage in dialogue in order to overcome their differences peacefully and to avoid confrontation.  The Irish Presidency is availing of every opportunity to convey its concerns in this regard to the Zambian Government and opposition parties and will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>The EU has also expressed its concern about the conflict in Afghanistan in a declaration which was adopted at the General Affairs Council of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg on 28 October. In this statement, the EU calls for the immediate cessation of these hostilities to prevent further destruction and loss of life, and strongly urges all parties to seek a peaceful settlement through negotiation that will ultimately result in a political solution that would bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.  Of particular concern to the EU is the widespread violation of human rights in Afghanistan, especially discrimination against women and girls.  The Resolution 1076/1996 (22 October 1996) of the UN Security Council denounces such discrimination as well as other violations of human rights in Afghanistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> The final declaration at the Teheran Conference on 29-30 October 1996, at which the Irish Presidency represented the EU as observers, emphasised the role of the UN.  This accords with the EU's approach: we would like to see the fullest possible support for the UN Special Mission in Afghanistan (UNSMA), headed by Mr. Holl.  The EU will continue to monitor the situation in Afghanistan closely, in close co-operation with the UN and UNSMA.</P>
    <P>As regards Guatemala, I am pleased to report that negotiations between the Government of Guatemala and the URNG have been successfully concluded and final peace accords between the parties are due to be signed on 29 December 1996.  The European Union acknowledges the spirit of reconciliation shown by all parties in bringing to an end the long conflict which that country has endured.  The people of Guatemala may be assured that they will have the good will and the practical support of the European Union in facing the great social, economic and political challenges which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I stress that the European Union attaches great importance to the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  This is a condition which must be applied in all situations, including the case of prisoners.  Following the issue of the declaration on 7 November regarding prison conditions in Venezuela the ambassador representing the Presidency in Caracas discussed the matter with the relevant authorities.  We have been assured by the Venezuelan Government that it attaches a very high priority to the reform of the penal code and the prison system.  The EU will continue to monitor the pace of progress and will give as much practical help and encouragement as it can.</P>

      <P>The Government and the EU remain gravely concerned about the situation in Serbia and, with our EU partners, we are monitoring developments there very closely.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the dignity and restraint with which the political opposition in Serbia and their supporters have conducted their protest against the authorities' decision to annual election results which had given them victories in a number of major cities on 17 November.  The sheer magnitude of these demonstrations show clearly the level of dissatisfaction which exists at that unacceptable decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Presidency of the EU, we have issued a number of statements and declarations on the <Col N="1541" /> deteriorating situation, expressing our concern over the undemocratic annulment of some local election results by the authorities, deploring the authorities' actions in silencing independent broadcasters, demanding that Serbia respects the right of the people to protest peacefully, and urging that restraint be exercised.</P>
    <P>In light of the developments in that country, the Union has decided to postpone granting trade concessions to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and we fully support this.  We firmly believe that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must eventually take its place amongst the international community of nations, for the sake of stability and prosperity in the region, but it cannot do so unless it observes basic standards of democracy and human rights, and it will continue to be isolated until these conditions improve.  I again reiterate that it is the view of the Government, and the European Union, that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's attitude towards the issues of respect for human and minority rights, and the observance of democratic norms, will be key factors in determining our future relationship with that country.</P>

      <P>The outline draft treaty will be submitted to the Heads of State or Government at the European Council meeting in Dublin later this week.  It is designed to provide a good basis for the further work of the Conference with a view to seeking final agreement under the Netherlands Presidency at Amsterdam on a treaty which would equip the Union to address the challenges ahead and to respond to the aspirations of its citizens.</P>
      <P>In most cases the outline draft treaty takes the form of suggested treaty texts.  In a small number of important areas, notably certain sensitive institutional questions and the issue of flexibility, the Presidency have reflected the generally held view that, with a further six months of negotiations ahead, it would be preferable not to put forward specific texts in treaty language at this stage.  However, the Presidency has highlighted the importance of these issues in its outline draft treaty.  It has sought to analyse and clarify the issues, to set out in detail the present state of discussions and where appropriate to outline options with a view to helping the Netherlands Presidency to find solutions in the later stages of the Conference when the final trade-offs must take place.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 45 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regularly raise prison issues with British Ministers within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I confirm that these issues were again raised by me at the most recent meeting of the Conference on 20 November 1996.  At this meeting I raised on humanitarian grounds the conditions in which the republican prisoners are being held in prison in Britain.  The Irish Embassy in London also closely monitors the situation of republican prisoners <Col N="1543" /> and raises humanitarian issues relating to individual prisoners with the British authorities on an ongoing basis.  It assists in visits to the republican prisoners by Members of the Oireachtas.  Consular visits are also made to the prisoners and an official of the Embassy most recently paid a consular visit to all the relevant prisons in the period 18-20 November.  The Embassy subsequently met the British Home Office and Prison Service for a full discussion of issues relating to the conditions and treatment of the republican prisoners in Britain which were raised by Members of the Oireachtas and the prisoners themselves.  Since then a further consular visit has been made to a female remand prisoner on 4 December 1996 and the Embassy has made representations to the British authorities regarding her medical needs.</P>
    <P>In all our contacts with the British authorities, the humanitarian difficulties for the prisoners and their families have been highlighted.  As the Deputies are aware, many republican prisoners, including most of the prisoners on remand, are classified as exceptional risk category A.  These prisoners are subject to a system of closed visits and endure other poor conditions of detention.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have responded that the conditions and treatment of republican prisoners, including those on remand, result from the category under which they are held.  They have stated that these prisoners' categorisation is periodically reviewed.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, many of the difficulties surrounding the treatment of the republican prisoners in Britain could be overcome by implementation of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons in line with its humanitarian objectives.  I am aware that many of the republican prisoners have applied for transfer to this jurisdiction under the Convention of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. A meeting between the relevant British and Irish officials to review the operation of the Convention between the two countries is to be held shortly.  I would reiterate once again that the Government stands ready to receive all those republican prisoners wishing to transfer to prison in this jurisdiction under the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Government shares the concerns which have been expressed by Deputies of all parties about humanitarian aspects of the treatment of republican prisoners in Britain.  I assure the Deputy that matters relating to the republican prisoners held in prison in Britain will continue to be raised with the British authorities through the appropriate channels at every level.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 47, 62, 66 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>As set out in the Government statement of 28 November, we remain fully committed to an inclusive negotiating process, on exclusively democratic terms and in conditions of peace, so as to reach an honourable and generally accepted accommodation of the Northern Ireland conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach and I have made clear on many occasions, responsibility for the unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire rest <Col N="1545" /> with the IRA itself.  There exists no justification, moral or political, for its campaign of violence.</P>
    <P>The conditions for Sinn Féin's entry to the political talks currently under way in Belfast were carefully set out by both Governments in the Communiqué of 28 February 1996 and in the ground rules, and have been reiterated on many occasions, as I pointed out to Deputy Callely in my reply to his Question No. 36 of yesterday.  In our contacts with the British Government, including at Monday's Anglo-Irish summit, and in our discussions with other participants in the peace process, we have made clear that we believe Sinn Féin should be included in the talks once the conditions set out in the ground rules are met, and that we are anxious to see that objective achieved as soon as possible.  That is a strong argument for the earliest possible reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire which, as I have said, should never have been broken.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has put forward its views on this and other issues on many occasions.  There is undoubtedly a lack of trust on all sides at present, and this is one of the main reasons progress in the political talks, as in the peace process generally, has been disappointingly slow.  As I indicated to Deputy Callely in yesterday's reply, the position of the two Governments on the issue of decommissioning is based firmly on the implementation of the report of the International Body, in all its aspects, and we are continuing to work to persuade all other participants to take the same approach.</P>
    <P>In regard to confidence issues, including the deployment of the security forces, policing, parades, emergency legislation and the situation of prisoners, as well as social and economic issues, the Government continue to make use of the machinery established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to advance our views, and the most recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, on 20 November, allowed for discussion of many matters of concern.  In our view, these issues should be seen as relevant primarily to the development of an overall sense of trust and confidence in Northern Ireland, and in that regard are capable of having a positive impact on the political situation.  We were pleased to note the British Prime Minister's assurance, in his statement of 28 November, that his Government is &ldquo;committed to raising confidence, both through the talks and through a range of other measures alongside them&rdquo;.  As the Prime Minister correctly pointed out, a process of mutual confidence-building is proposed by the report of the International Body.  We also noted his observations that &ldquo;if the threat reduces again, the opportunity for further confidence-building measures returns&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the broad outlines of Government policy on these issues from the debates we have had here over the past two weeks, both on the situation generally in the Great Lakes region and on the motion approving the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service in the temporary multinational force for eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>The steps which we are taking both in our Presidency capacity and bilaterally are at two levels &mdash; the immediate humanitarian requirements and the longer-term process of addressing the underlying problems which have given rise to the humanitarian crisis.</P>
      <P>In respect of the humanitarian situation, the European Union is continuing intensive efforts in support of the work of the international agencies and NGOs, including a number of Irish organisations, to bring relief to those in distress in eastern Zaire and to assist in the orderly, voluntary, return of refugees to their countries of origin.  The House will be aware that, as part of the EU's response to the crisis in the Great Lakes region, including in eastern Zaire, the Development Council meeting chaired by my colleague, Deputy Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, on 22 November agreed a series of measures to provide both immediate and long-term humanitarian and development assistance.  A package of 170 million ECU for the Great Lakes region was proposed. Work on this plan is now at an advanced stage. The European Commission is also working on a strategic and comprehensive plan of action for EU assistance to the Great Lakes region.  This plan will support social and economic rehabilitation, the reconstruction of independent and equitable justice systems, rebuilding and reinforcement of administrative systems and constitutional institutions, and regional peace-building efforts.  We have already briefed the House on the steps in support of these measures being taken by the Irish Government bilaterally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the multinational force sanctioned for humanitarian purposes by UN Security Council Resolution 1080 of 1996, I welcome the <Col N="1547" /> fact that this House last Wednesday passed the motion approving the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to participate in this force.  I believe that such a force has a potentially important role to play in the process of providing humanitarian assistance and in facilitating voluntary repatriation in the volatile and difficult situation obtaining in eastern Zaire. While fully sharing the views of Deputies about the urgency of the mission, I also agree with the Minister for Defence when he stressed during that debate the need to ensure the full safety of our troops, a process that inevitably requires careful and thorough planning.  Discussions with the Canadian authorities are continuing about the details of our participation and I know that the Defence Forces are keen to finalise arrangements in that regard as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Defence told the House last week, a phased, a progressive and flexible plan for the deployment of the MNF's has been worked out and agreed by the participating countries. Under this plan, the MNF's role will evolve to match the changing circumstances in eastern Zaire and its deployment will proceed on a step-by-step basis, in the context of the overall objective of facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the orderly, voluntary repatriation of refuges and displaced persons.  At the moment, the work of setting up the headquarters of the MNF in Kampala, Uganda, is continuing.  The voluntary return of hundreds of thousands of refugees to Rwanda has undoubtedly been a most positive development, but many thousands more remain at risk in eastern Zaire.  The international agencies have been continuing to try to bring assistance directly to those people and, in light of the rapid evolution of events, the situation in that regard is being reassesed on a daily basis.  The MNF is liaising closely with the international agencies, under the leadership of the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator, in this process of re-evaluation to ensure that the force plays its full part in assisting the agencies in their work in eastern Zaire.  One way it is doing this at present is through the provision of information to the agencies on the location of refugees and displaced persons obtained from aerial reconnaissance.  Among the further options being looked at by the MNF is the possible delivery of humanitarian assistance into eastern Zaire by air-drops or ground convoys.  No decisions have yet been taken in this regard, but the establishment of the HQ in Kampala should considerably enhance the planning and information-gathering for such options.</P>
    <P>A further important element in the evolution of the situation will be the report of the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General, Ambassador Chretien, which is expected to be delivered to the Security Council very shortly.  It is likely that this will provide the context for a wider evaluation of the further steps that are necessary in terms of <Col N="1548" /> the delivery of assistance to those in need in eastern Zaire.  The Secretary General is also working on proposals for a possible follow-on operation which would succeed the multinational force and these proposals are to be submitted to the Security Council by 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about the length of time that full deployment of the MNF is taking. The reality is that we are dealing with a complex situation which is evolving at a rapid pace.  The circumstances which obtained, say, one month ago are very different to those of today.  Against the background, I believe that the step-by-step, flexible approach being adopted by the MNF is a sensible, prudent one which balances the humanitarian needs of the situation with the safety of the participating troops.</P>
    <P>The European Union, and Ireland as Presidency, have been playing an active part in this process.  One specific instrument through which this is being done is the Joint Action which was adopted by the EU on 22 November.  The Joint Action draws together the contribution which the Union could make to the efforts which the UN has undertaken to solve the crisis in the region.  In parallel, a Council Decision was taken requesting the Western European Union to elaborate and implement aspects of that Joint Action.  These are important measures in terms of ensuring a Union approach to the crisis that is as cohesive and effective as possible and work on their implementation is proceeding.  I should add also that Ireland is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the steering group of the MNF.  This is the body which has political oversight of the force.</P>
    <P>For the remainder of our Presidency, Ireland will continue to work actively, both within the Union itself, within the UN system, and on the steering board of the MNF to ensure that every effort is made to alleviate the suffering of the remaining refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in eastern Zaire are, of course, part of wider, deeper problems in the region as a whole and it was common ground between all parties in this House during the recent debates that a humanitarian response, important as it is in the short term, is not a solution to broader political problems.  That is why it is absolutely right that, in tandem with the humanitarian effort, work at the political and development levels must proceed with urgency also.  That is also why, during the remainder of our Presidency and during the further six months in the Troika thereafter, we will continue to press for the early convening of an international conference on peace, stability and development in the region, under the auspices of the UN and the Organisation of African Unity.  This conference could look at all of these issues in a comprehensive, integrated way and bring forward plans for a durable, lasting settlement.  The EU and the international community generally would be involved in this process in a supportive way, with a central role being taken by the region <Col N="1549" /> itself.  I am convinced that through this approach real progress can begin to be made in ensuring that an end is finally brought to the terrible cycle of violence and suffering which has plagued Central Africa for generations.</P>

      <P>Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a key issue for the EU in its institutionalised political dialogue and in its relations with the countries of Latin America, including Colombia.  EU Ambassadors are tasked with monitoring the situation with regard to human rights abuses and with reporting on these matters so that the EU can respond appropriately.  An agreement to establish an office in Bogota, under the auspices of the UN, to monitor human rights abuses and to offer technical assistance has been signed with the Government of Colombia.  The EU will continue to press the Colombian Government to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to fully honour its commitments in that regard under the relevant international instruments and conventions.</P>
      <P>Ireland next year as a member of the UN Commission on Human Rights will be concerned to ensure that proper attention is paid to the human rights situation in Colombia.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's and the EU's response to the splitting of the Belarusian Parliament into two rival Houses, both claiming legitimacy; the Government's and the EU's response to reports that the resounding vote in favour of President Lukashenko during the controversial referendum on Sunday, 24 November 1996, was fraudulent; and the steps, if any, being taken by the EU to ensure that the rule of democracy is protected in Belarus.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union is deeply concerned at developments in Belarus.  On 24 November President Lukashenko pressed ahead with a referendum on a new draft constitution which would substantially increase Presidential powers at the expense of both Parliament and the Constitutional Court, despite the clear lack of consultation with Parliament.</P>
      <P>According to official figures, there was a turnout of 84 per cent and a vote of 70 per cent in favour of the President's version of a new constitution.  However, there is no confidence that the conduct of the referendum was in accordance with democratic practice.  There have been a number of reports of serious irregularities and there is considerable concern that the referendum was conducted by an <i>ad hoc</i> electoral commission set up by the President for this purpose, rather than by the standing Central Electoral Commission.  The Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Mr. Gonchar, was ousted from his post by President Lukashenko although he had been appointed by Parliament.</P>
      <P>The new constitution was signed by President Lukashenko on 18 November, although the constitutional court had ruled that the referendum should be consultative only.  The Constitution has since begun to be implemented with the establishment of a new Lower House of Parliament.  The old Parliamentary building has been closed and members have been prevented from returning to it.  A number of deputies of the old Parliamentary Assembly continue to voice their opposition to these developments.  The president of the constitutional court and two other members have resigned, and there have been further public protests in Belarus.</P>
      <P>The situation in Belarus has been of concern to the Union for some time.  On 24 October the European Parliament decided that no further steps would be taken towards ratification of the partnership and co-operation agreement between the European Union and Belarus or towards further implementation of the interim agreement, until clear signals had been given by the Belarus authorities of their intention to respect fully basic democratic and human rights.</P>
      <P>The Union's concerns have been conveyed to the Belarussian authorities on several occasions &mdash; by Troika demarche in Minsk on 14 October, in a Council Declaration on 18 October, by personal letter of 21 November from the President of the Council and in an EU Troika meeting with President Lukashenko at the OSCE Summit in Lisbon, led by the Taoiseach, as President of the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting, the Taoiseach conveyed to President Lukashenko a strong message from the Union regarding the constitutionality of the recent referendum in Belarus and the changes <Col N="1551" /> based upon it.  The Troika's detailed criticism were rejected by President Lukashenko, who maintained that the international community was misinformed about the situation in Belarus.  The Troika proposed that a fact-finding mission should visit Belarus.  This proposal was further confirmed by the General Affairs Council on 6 December and a letter is being sent to President Lukashenko in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, it has continually been stressed to President Lukashenko that the European Union strongly desires a close and co-operative relationship with Belarus and is anxious that Belarus continue along the path of economic and democratic reform.  The Union's readiness to provide all practical assistance to Belarus in implementing political and economic reform, has been made clear, but it has also been emphasised that it is essential for Belarus to demonstrate its own commitment to democratic principles and parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The situation in Belarus continues to remain under close consideration by the Union including the question of further appropriate Union action.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to support strongly the peace process being conducted between the parties in Angola under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol of 20 November 1994.  Much progress has been made during the two years since the signing of the Protocol with strong support from the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, the European Union and other members of the international community.  The two years of the Protocol have been the most stable experienced by Angola following decades of conflict which have taken an enormous toll on its people. However, despite the evident progress, a lasting settlement in Angola is not yet assured and the EU, along with other members of the international community, is actively seeking to ensure that the current crucial phase of the peace process can be consolidated.</P>
      <P>The concern of the international community at the slow pace of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol was reflected in the terms of Resolution 1075 which was adopted by the UN Security Council on 11 October.  Since the adoption of Resolution 1075, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative to Angola, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, has been engaged in a series of intensive consultations, including with President José dos Santos, Mr. Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, regional leaders and the Vice-President of South Africa, in his efforts to bring forward the peace process alongside a phased reduction in the total strength of military personnel deployed under UNAVEM III.  In his report to the UN Security Council of 2 December, the Secretary General has recommended the resumption of the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III military units in February 1997, with a view to a complete drawdown within a period of six to seven months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary-General has also reported that UNAVEM III has continued its public awareness campaign and other activities to promote human rights, some of which are aimed at restoring confidence and dialogue between the parties and at fostering national reconciliation.  The Angolan Government was also assisted in providing human rights training for selected personnel to serve in provincial institutions as well as for civic education monitors in the provinces.  These activities have encouraged the organisation of human rights committees at local level.  As of 28 November, 57 allegations of human rights violations had been submitted to UNAVEM III and were investigated by its relevant units.  The Secretary General has highlighted this important <Col N="1553" /> issue as well as those of goverance, public accountability and capacity-building in the law and order field as deserving of increased attention in the present phase of Angola's peace process.  In so doing, he has also expressed his appreciation of the generous contribution made by the European Union in its provision of human rights experts and the recent renewal of their contracts until February 1997 and has expressed the hope that this support will be made available beyond that date.</P>
    <P>While recognising that the gains made to date under the Lusaka peace process need to be consolidated and that a continued UN presence will be required after February 1997, the Secretary General has confirmed that the activities of UNAVEM will be increasingly concentrated on political, police and human rights monitoring, vital humanitarian activities including de-mining, as well as public information programmes.  He has undertaken to elaborate further on these tasks and to make recommendations on the mandate, structure and size of a follow-up UN presence after the withdrawal of the bulk of UNAVEM's military units.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the support which we have been providing to date in human rights and other areas, I have every confidence that the European Union will given positive consideration to recommendations which the Secretary-General may make.  Our immediate priority continues to be that of ensuring that the necessary conditions are created to prevent any resumption of the conflict, thereby facilitating the peaceful establishment of inclusive democratic institutions and full observance of human rights and the rule of law in Angola.</P>

      <P>The Government is concerned by reports of the ill-treatment of prisoners in Israel.  We are particularly concerned at the recent decision of the Israeli Supreme Court that Secret Service investigators can use physical force in questioning Palestinian detainees, as well as previous decisions permitting the Israeli security services to use physical pressure in the interrogation of suspects.  There have also been recent disturbing television reports of an incident involving beatings and abuse of detainees by Israeli security forces.  While Ireland and its partners in the European Union acknowledge Israel's legitimate security concerns, these concerns cannot be used <Col N="1554" /> to justify measures which are contrary to the norms of international law and respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>The European Union has close political and economic links with Israel and the EU is committed to maintaining and deepening this relationship.  In this context, and on the basis of a common commitment to the furtherence of the Middle East peace process, a new generation Euromediterranean Association Agreement was signed with Israel on 20 November 1995.  The new agreement is based on an open acknowledgment that respect for the principles of democracy and human rights will guide the domestic and external policies of both parties and that these principles constitute an essential element of the Agreement. The Government firmly expects that Israel, like other states with which the European Union intends to conclude such Euromediterranean partnership agreements, will agree to engage freely in discussions with the EU on human rights issues.  In my meetings, during the Presidency, with the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu and the Foreign Minister, Mr. Levy on a number of occasions in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, I stressed the EU's concerns about the future of the peace process, including the situation of Palestinian prisoners. The EU will continue to underline to the Israeli Government the importance of improvements in human rights, including concrete steps to improve the treatment of prisoners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 60 and 72 together.  Irian Jaya &mdash; West Irian or West Papua &mdash; is the western half of the island of New Guinea which was a part of the Netherlands Indies before the Second World War.  Inhabited by Melanesians, who are ethnically different from the Malay peoples predominant in the rest of Indonesia, it maintained a separate identity from the remainder of the Dutch colony.  Partly on these grounds and partly to assuage the humilation of defeat in the Indonesian war of independence, the Netherlands decided in 1949 to retain control of the region, envisaging its eventual self-determination.  This decision, bitterly resented by Indonesia, led to more than a decade of diplomatic activity, which culminated in the transfer of the colony to Indonesia under UN auspices in 1962-63.  Indonesia named the region Irian Barat or West Irian, but in 1972 changed it to Irian Jaya.  Under an agreement of 15 August 1962 between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the opinion of the indigenous population was to be heard in an &ldquo;Act of Free <Col N="1556" /> Choice&rdquo; five years after integration.  This took place in 1968.</P>
      <P>At the Twenty-Fourth Regular Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1969, Resolution 2504 (XXIV) on the Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands concerning West New Guinea &mdash; West Irian &mdash; was adopted by 84 votes in favour, including Ireland, none against, with 30 abstentions.  This resolution recalled specifically the agreement of 15 August 1962 between Indonesia and the Netherlands and acknowledged the role of the UN Secretary General in this Agreement; recalled the report of the UN Secretary General on the completion of the United Nations temporary executive authority in West Irian and further recalled that the arrangements for the Act of Free Choice were the responsibility of Indonesia with the advice, assistance and participation of a special representative of the UN Secretary General as stipulated in the 1962 Agreement.  It stated that both parties to the agreement, Indonesia and the Netherlands, had recognised the results of the Act of Free Choice and abided by them.  Finally, the resolution took note of the fulfilment by the UN Secretary General and his representative of the tasks entrusted to them under the 1962 agreement.  I have received a request to raise with the United Nations the validity of the Act of Free Choice and I have also taken note of the resolution of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of 31 January 1996.  However, in the light of UN General Assembly Resolution 2504 (XXIV) it is difficult to see how this matter can be raised with the United Nations, at this remove, with any expectation of success.  Human rights in Irian Jaya continue to be monitored closely.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 67 together.  According to information I have received from the International Criminal Tribunal, there have been no new arrests of indicted suspects during the past two months.  Of <Col N="1557" /> a total of 74 indicted persons, only seven have so far been arrested or handed over to the tribunal. This is a very disappointing statistic and the Government is determined that more pressure should be brought to bear on those who have obligations to ensure that those charged with war crimes should appear in the Hague.  The Government continues to hold the view that full co-operation by all parties with the International Criminal Tribunal in the efforts to bring war criminals to justice is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace is to be consolidated.  All parties must abide by the commitment they have made to hand over indicted suspects without delay.  It is also important that the international organisations and agencies active on the ground should examine now they can make a more effective contribution to the efforts of the tribunal in this regard.</P>
      <P>We also support the policy that the provision of economic reconstruction assistance is clearly linked to co-operation in this area.  The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Republika Srpska leadership, have been reminded that their obligations under international law take precedence over any provisions in their national or local legislation. Similarly, in the case of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the EU has made clear that the development of relations between the EU and those countries will be influenced by their attitude towards co-operation with the tribunal.  The Government will continue to be a strong and unequivocal supporter of the International Criminal Tribunal and the effort to bring war criminals to justice.  This support is not only demonstrated in political and diplomatic terms but also in practical ways.  In this regard, in addition to previous voluntary contributions, and to payment of our annual assessed UN contribution for the running costs of the tribunal, the Government has, in the last few weeks, contributed a further $100,000 to assist the work of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callely refers to the role of the United Nations.  At present, in Bosnia, this is limited basically to the International Police Task Force, the mandate of which is to oversee the activities of local police forces and promote the development of democratic policing and respect for human rights.  The Government attaches great importance to the role of the IPTF and has demonstrated its commitment in this area in a number of ways, notably through our contribution of a contingent of 31 members of the Garda Síochána to the IPTF, including its commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald.  In September Ireland hosted an international conference on law enforcement assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was attended by representatives of some 40 countries and which resulted in significant pledges of training, financial and personnel support for that force. The Government supports a strengthening of the <Col N="1558" /> role of the IPTF, including granting it powers to investigate malpractices within the police forces and to recommend sanctions against individuals or police forces who violate human rights.  This will be necessary if it is to carry out more effectively the important tasks which it has been given in relation to implementation of the peace agreement.</P>

      <P>The use of information technology in my Department has increased both personal and organisational effectiveness and has provided better communication links with other Departments and outside bodies.  The overall objective of the Department's IT plan is to ensure that the IT system contributes effectively to the achievement of the Department's objectives in the context of the Strategic Management Initiative.  The report of the co-ordinating group of secretaries, Delivering Better Government, highlights the potential IT to further improve efficiency and service delivery by supporting redesigned work practices, reporting arrangements and information management.  A working group on information technology has been established under the strategic Management Initiative to consider how this potential can be realised and, in particular, to review the current and potential use of information technology in the Civil Service and to make recommendations for its more effective application and review the implications and benefits of the emerging &ldquo;information society&rdquo; for the Civil Service and to make recommendations on the role of the Civil Service and the actions required in the light of that role.  The group has commenced work on these issues and is expected to report shortly to the co-ordinating group overseeing implementing of the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, there are for the international force for eastern Zaire to include a specialised international civilian human rights component to monitor the voluntary nature of any repatriation and ensure that the international force does not participate in any forced repatriation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government unequivocally supports the principle of voluntary repatriation in respect <Col N="1559" /> of all refugees and displaced persons, including those of the Great Lakes region.  With our EU partners our priority concerns are to ensure that their immediate humanitarian needs are met and that those who have returned to their homelands are reintegrated peacefully without threat of their rights or security.  In keeping with existing EU policy in relation to the Great Lakes region we will continue to support appropriate measures to safeguard the human rights of those who have fallen victim to the crisis in Eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>The mandate of the multinational force established under Security Council Resolution 1080 of 15 November in response to the crisis in Eastern Zaire is to &ldquo;facilitate the immediate return of humanitarian organisations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organisations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;to facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons&rdquo;.  In the case of both refugees and internally displaced persons the authorisation provided by Resolution 1080 thus stipulates their &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; return; there is no question of the force playing a coercive role in regard to such repatriation.</P>
      <P>We understand from the lead-country in the multinational force, Canada, that its Commander, General Baril, has appointed a legal and human rights adviser to the civilian liaison team which is advising him in the execution of his duties.  This should also serve to ensure that the force carries out its functions in the context of full respect for human rights.  While the repatriation process in Rwanda has to date gone relatively smoothly, it is to be expected that there will be tensions in relation to property rights and other matters. With our European partners the Government fully accepts the urgent need for human rights monitors.  This is reflected in the positive response which has been given to the appeal for funding to support the deployment of a further 300 human rights monitors recently made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. These will augment the human rights monitors already deployed under the UN Human Rights Field Operation for Rwanda which Ireland and the European Union have strongly supported. The Government's ongoing support for human rights monitoring is reflected in the fact that the £2.25 million package being provided by Ireland in response to the current crisis in Eastern Zaire includes £250,000 in support of additional monitors as well as support for the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reintegrate returning refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following last month's decision by the European Union to provide 170 million ECU in support of immediate and long-term humanitarian and development assistance, the European Commission is also preparing a <Col N="1560" /> comprehensive plan of action for EU assistance to the Great Lakes region which will seek to support social and economic rehabilitation, the reconstruction of independent and equitable justice systems, the rebuilding and reinforcement of administrative systems and constitutional institutions and regional peace-building.  It is hoped that the comprehensive approach thus being taken by the European Union will, with appropriate human rights monitoring and safeguards for refugees and other vulnerable sectors of the population, help to create the necessary conditions of a lasting settlement in the Great Lakes region at both political and humanitarian level.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the incidents to which the Deputy refers.  We are pursuing inquiries in the matter through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  While accepting the need to take account of current security, the Government believes that any security measures should be applied with care, restraint and due regard for their effects on the everyday lives of local communities.  We have made this clear on a number of occasions within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, including at the most recent meeting at ministerial level on 20 November 1996.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the British Home Secretary announced on 14 May 1996 that evidence of contamination had been discovered at the Forensics Explosives Laboratory, at Fort Halstead, Kent.  This discovery raises the possibility that the convictions of a number of IRA prisoners on explosives charges in Britain since 1989 may be affected.  The Home Secretary requested Professor Brian Caddy of Strathclyde University to conduct an inquiry into the <Col N="1561" /> casework and procedures of the Forensics Explosives Laboratory in Fort Halstead, Kent.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern about the possibility that any person might have been convicted on the basis of doubtful evidence was expressed at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 22 May, 1996. On my instructions, officials in my Department and in the Irish Embassy in London have been monitoring this matter closely since then.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have recently indicated to us that they expect to publish the report of the independent inquiry by Professor Caddy together with a British Government statement in the matter in the very near future.</P>
      <P>We will continue to follow developments in this matter closely in the period ahead.  In particular, we will urge the British authorities to ensure that referral to the Court of Appeal proceeds in an expeditious manner, should the Caddy inquiry cast doubt on any conviction.</P>

      <P>Ireland's outspoken concern for the human rights situation in China is a matter of record.</P>
      <P>I have raised the matter with my Chinese opposite number, most recently as leader of the Troika of the European Union on 23 September in the margins of the UN General Assembly.  The Taoiseach took up the matter in his meeting in Rome on 15 November with China's Prime Minister, Mr. Li Peng.  On both occasions we sought to urge the Chinese side to engage with the European Union in a further round of the human rights dialogue which has been in place since 1994 as an integral part of the political dialogue between China and the European Union.  I am still hopeful that it may be possible to resume this important dialogue before the conclusion of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread concern at the conditions under which, according to reports, some toys are manufactured in China.  In this context, I have <Col N="1562" /> noted the remarks made recently by Mr. Harry Wu during his visit to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The policy of Ireland and the European Union towards China is based on a sympathetic understanding of the immense challenges which China is facing in the continued development of a vast populous country.  We believe that a balanced constructive dialogue between China and the European Union is the best way forward in reflecting China's needs and the priority which Ireland and its European Union partners place on the issue of human rights and the development of the rule of law in China.</P>

      <P>2.  European Convention on the Abolition of Legislation of Documents Executed by Diplomatic Agents or Consular Officers (1968).  This convention makes it possible to use foreign documents in the same manner as documents emanating from national authorities.  It was signed by Ireland in November 1996; it is hoped to proceed to ratification at an early date.</P>
      <P>3.  7th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (1984).  The Protocol &mdash; signed by Ireland in 1984 &mdash; identifies a number of additional rights, notably rights of lawfully resident aliens, the right to have a criminal conviction and sentence reviewed, the right of compensation after a miscarriage of justice and the equality of spouses in relation to their children and their marriage.  The provisions contained in the Protocol are the responsibility of a number of Government Departments.  The Protocol will be ratified at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  11th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (1994).  This Protocol &mdash; signed by Ireland in 1994 &mdash; replaces the Commission and Court with a single permanent Court.  The Dáil approved the <Col N="1563" /> terms of the Protocol on 4 December 1996.  The instrument of ratification will shortly be deposited with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>5.  Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (1995).  This legal instrument &mdash; signed by Ireland in 1995 &mdash; contains principles to which State parties adhere as well as certain programme-type provisions, setting out objectives that parties undertake to pursue through legislation and appropriate policies.  The mechanism for reporting by States of the measures which they have taken under the convention has not yet been agreed by the Committee of Ministers; the convention will be ratified at the earliest possible date after this mechanism has been established.</P>

As part of the review of the urban renewal scheme the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, appointed a consultancy team to assess the experience gained over the last ten years.  The brief of the consultants was to look at the impact of the scheme in fiscal, social and architectural-urban design terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report was published by the Minister of <Col N="1565" /> State, Deputy McManus on 5 December 1996. The Minister of State said that the publication of the study marks the beginning of a period of consultation in relation to future policy in which she invited all those interested in urban renewal to participate.  This consultation process will be concluded with a conference for all the interested parties early next year.  Both the study and the outcome of the consultative process will be key factors in the determination of future policy on which the Minister of State expects to put a submission to Government in the late spring next year.  It would be inappropriate, in the interim, to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation as part of any future scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to achieving ongoing improvements in efficency and effectiveness through the use of information technology to support its business objectives and priorities in line with its current IT Plan and SMI Strategy Statement.  To this end staff are provided with a wide range of software products, both off the shelf and in-house developed, to assist them in carrying out their work.  The software is operated on a network of personal computers, linked by a communications infrastructure which connects all the buildings in which the Department's staff are located.  Extensive use is made of information technology in all areas of the Department, including my own office, where it assists in the operation of a range of functions such as tracking of correspondence and Government memoranda and decisions and the work of the press office.</P>
      <P>The use of information technology to support the work of my Department will continue to increase over the next few years.  In particular, there will be extended use of software to facilitate more efficient team working and to improve the management of information within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trends and developments in information technology are monitored on an ongoing basis by <Col N="1566" /> the Centre for Management and Organisation Development (CMOD) of my Department with a view to identifying technologies of relevance to the Civil Service.  I expect to see technology being increasingly used in all areas of Civil Service activity where it leads to improved efficiency and effectiveness.  In this regard, technology will be used to improve the delivery of services enabling increased responsiveness and greater flexibility in meeting the needs of the users of public services. Special emphasis has been placed on the role of information technology in helping to bring about the various improvements being sought under the Strategic Management Initiative and <i>Delivering Better Government,</i> the programme of change for the Civil Service which the Government announced earlier this year.  One of the Working Groups set up to develop programmes of action under <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is addressing the use and potential of information technology in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): After discussions with the South-Eastern Health Board, a consultant paediatrician was sanctioned by my Department in May 1996 for St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.  All such sanctions are subject to approval by Comhairle na n-Ospidéal which is the statutory body charged with the regulation of appointments of consultant medical staff.</P>
      <P>I understand that Comhairle na n-Ospidéal at a recent meeting considered this post and also a consultant paediatrician post for St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.  I further understand that Comhairle was not satisfied with the proposals in respect of paediatric services as submitted by the South-Eastern Health Board and accordingly did not approve the appointments.  In the circumstances, the South-Eastern Health Board has been asked to reassess the position in relation to the total delivery of paediatric services within the board with a view to submitting proposals which are acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have committed considerable extra resources to the South Tipperary area for general hospital <Col N="1567" /> services.  I am committed to bringing hospital services, including paediatric services, up to acceptable levels having regard to what is available in other areas of the south-east region and at a national level.</P>

      <P>The document referred to by the Deputy entitled &ldquo;Wise Use and Conservation of Wetlands&rdquo;, COMDOC (95) 189, together with the Ramsar and Bonn Conventions provide a comprehensive framework within which wetlands can be protected and enhanced.  As a means of implementing this policy I will shortly be making Regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, to transpose Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora into Irish law. These regulations will give protection to the most important wetlands by designating them as special areas of conservation and preparing management plans for their protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many wetlands of scientific importance for migratory birds have now been designated as special protection areas under the birds directive and amending legislation under the Wildlife Act, which I hope to introduce early in the new year, will provide a statutory basis for the conservation of sites of national importance.  Twenty one sites <Col N="1583" /> have been listed under the Ramsar Convention as wetlands of international importance.  I recently arranged for the signature by Ireland of an International Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds under the Bonn Convention which will give added protection to water birds and their wetland habitats.  A national strategy under the Convention on Biological Diversity is being prepared by my Department which, <i>inter alia</i>, will develop further policy for the wise use and protection of wetlands.</P>
    <P>There are many other elements of Government policy which pertain to the wise use and conservation of wetlands.  In this regard I would mention for example the Water Pollution Acts, Waste Management Act, 1996, IPC licensing, the very significant investment in sewage treatment, the phasing out of the dumping of sewage sludge at sea, the requirements of environmental impact assessment and of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme.</P>

      <P>An overall review of the urban renewal schemes as they have operated to date is currently under way.  As part of the review, a consultants' study on the impact of the schemes in economic, social and architectural terms has been completed.

Copies of the study are available in the Oireachtas Library.  It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation as part of any future scheme until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation, it is open to the local government electors of a town to initiate procedures for town commission status.  Such status would involve elected town commissioners, a limited functional range and an additional charge on rates on commercial property to meet operating and service costs.  The local government classification of towns and the question of new local structures were among the matters considered by the Local Government Reorganisation Commission in its report <i>Towards Cohesive Local Government</i>&mdash;<i>Town and County</i> published last June.  Copies of the report have been supplied to the Oireachtas Library and distributed to Oireacthas and to local authority members.</P>
      <P>The commission pointed to the substantial costs of additional town authorities which would have to be borne by ratepayers and taxpayers and the need for these and other relevant implications to be taken fully into account in assessing such proposals.  It recommended that modernised procedures should apply for the establishment of new town authorities in towns with a minimum population of 7,500.  The commission was also of the view that the aspirations of smaller towns for increased town focus could be better achieved through improved structures of interaction with the county council, without setting up a separate formal local authority.  In this connection, it should also be noted that local government law already includes provision for the recognition by county councils of approved local councils and for assistance and co-operation with such approved bodies.  The question of the future local government classification of towns will be among the issues to be addressed in the context of a comprehensive action based programme for the renewal of local government which I intend to publish shortly.</P>

      <P>The package of measures which was announced on 2 December was aimed at combating the growing problem of traffic congestion in Dublin city by the application of new traffic and parking management measures, an increased emphasis on traffic law enforcement and by providing a better environment for the operation of the city's bus fleet.  The package contains measures of a general nature and was not intended to cater for the needs of particular groups.  However, the emphasis on encouraging short-term parking as opposed to all day parking should improve the availability of parking places and this should be of particular benefit to disabled drivers who may park at meter and disc parking places without payment of parking fees.</P>

      <P>This communication is designed as a first step in <Col N="1586" /> establishing a strategic framework at EU level for the wise use of wetlands and the conservation of their functions and assets.  In this regard, the communication seeks to advance the objectives of the Union's Fifth Environment Action Programme, Towards Sustainability, as they relate to protection of nature and biodiversity and management of water resources, and to deploy existing EU legislation in this area, in particular, directives on the conservation of wild birds, natural habitats and wild fauna and flora. A key objective of the communication is to encourage a co-ordinated and integrated approach at all levels of administration and between all relevant sectors so as to cater more fully for wetlands.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the communication when it was debated on 4 March 1996 and supported Council's conclusions emphasising the need, <i>inter alia</i>, to take wetlands into account when drawing up strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.  A national strategy for biodiversity is being prepared by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht following ratification by Ireland of the Convention on Biodiversity earlier this year.  This strategy will have implications for local authorities in relation to their physical planning and environmental functions and these aspects will be pursued with them when the strategy is published.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, local authorities have extensive environmental and planning controls at their disposal to ensure that appropriate action can be taken to address potential sources of pollution or inappropriate development that could affect the quality of water required to sustain wetlands.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> students may now spend up to three years in senior cycle.  They may follow a two-year leaving certificate programme immediately after junior certificate or they may opt to follow a transition year programme before a two-year leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which an individual pupil may repeat a year at second level were advised to schools in May 1995 in the form of Circular M2/95 &mdash; Repeat of a Year at Post-Primary Level.  This circular clarified and consolidated the arrangements outlined previously in the light of the extension and restructuring of the senior cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pupils who have sat the leaving certificate examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils <Col N="1592" /> to repeat leaving certificate year two and the appropriate leaving certificate examination on payment of the appropriate course and examination fees.  However, these charges may not apply or may be reduced where the parents hold a current medical card.</P>
    <P>An important overall objective of the restructuring of the senior cycle is to provide for the holistic development of all students through the development and provision of new programmes such as the transition year programme which is now available in most schools.  Schools are not permitted to offer a three-year leaving certificate programme, since this would undermine the transition year objective.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy when he raised the matter on the Adjournment on Wednesday, 27 November 1996, the school referred to is privately owned by a religious order of nuns.  Any decision in relation to its future, including a decision to close, is a matter for the management authorities of the school in the first instance.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that, if the school closes, adequate alternative arrangements are put in place for the pupils of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> It was only very recently that my Department received notification of the proposed closure from the school authorities.  The notification indicates that what is intended is the phasing out of the school over a number of years starting next September, when there would be no intake of pupils into first year.  Existing pupils will be allowed to complete their current cycle in the school.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for representatives of the school management to meet officials from my Department in the near future.  Following this meeting, my Department will identify the necessary steps to be taken to ensure that suitable alternative arrangements, including transport provision, are made for the post-primary education of pupils from the area.</P>

Estimated numbers of petitions received are calculated from time to time and such calculations as are available are also provided.</P>
      <P>In relation to the status of a fine which is the subject of a petition, a petition does not place a stay on the order of the District Court judge. Notwithstanding the fact that a petition has been lodged by or on the defendant's behalf, if the fine is not paid within the time allowed by the judge, a warrant will be issued to enforce the court's decision as is the normal procedure in cases where fines are not paid on time.  Section 1 (1) of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991 provides that a warrant must be issued within six months of the due date of payment of the fine imposed. However, while there is no statutory requirement on the Garda Síochána to defer enforcement of a warrant in respect of a fine which is under petition, it is normal practice for them to do so upon production of an official acknowledgment of petition and to await the outcome of a petition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 122 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is heavily dependent on the use of information technology for its operations as all of the main income support systems have now been computerised.</P>
      <P>On-line transaction processing systems have been developed based on central processors connected over a network to terminals located in the Department's offices.</P>
      <P>In general the central processor-networked terminal model of computing has been very successful.  It has provided a very robust, flexible, secure, high performance platform at relatively low cost.  The chosen hardware and software strategies have enabled the Department to grow its IT capabilities in an incremental and cost effective way.  The network design has provided a reliable infrastructure which has enabled telecommunications costs to be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>Computerisation has facilitated the development of features such as a single central database of customer personal details, the use of a unique identifier &mdash; RSI number &mdash; integration of schemes and the use of the social services card in establishing identity and accessing payments.</P>
      <P>The strategy adopted has yielded benefits in terms of ability to deliver payments securely and within acceptable time limits as well as significant gains in efficiency and better control.</P>
      <P>The development of the Department's IT systems in the future will have, as a central focus, the need for further integration of services and service delivery within the Department and with services delivered by other agencies involved in the provision of social services.  The development of more effective service to the customer is central to the Government's Strategic Management Initiative and the programme for the Delivery of Better Government.</P>
      <P>A major review of the Department's IT strategy was carried out in 1995 as well as a detailed review of networking needs to identify how IT systems could be modernised and upgraded to meet future needs.</P>
      <P>The computer industry is also constantly changing and suppliers of IT products and services are adopting new business strategies.  My Department is conscious of the need to take advantage of opportunities offered by these new strategies and advances in technology while, at the same time, protecting its main production systems against undue risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IT budget allocated to the Department covers the following items of expenditure: computer hardware, network equipment, maintenance charges for hardware and software <Col N="1599" /> components, office equipment, and IT training. Consultancy costs covering assistance with software development and reviews of strategic IT and-or business nature.</P>
    <P>The overall amount of expenditure on these items is as follows: Expenditure in 1995, £11.7 million; estimated expenditure in 1996, £9.0 million; estimate for 1997, £8.7 million (excluding any carry-over from 1996).</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 124, 125, 126, 127 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit in February 1990 in respect of an accident at work on 3 November 1989.  Following an examination by one of the Department's medical assessors on 4 July 1990, he was awarded disablement pension assessed at 30 per cent with effect from 11 May 1990.  He was advised of his <Col N="1600" /> right to appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office but did not do so.  He had a further medical examination by a medical assessor on 4 July 1991, and was again assessed at 30 per cent disablement and he appealed that decision.</P>
    <P>Following a review medical examination on 27 February 1992, he was assessed as being 30 per cent disabled for life with effect from 3 April 1992.  However, he appealed this decision and was awarded 40 per cent disablement for life with effect from the same date.  This award cannot be backdated beyond April 1992.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned considers that his condition has deteriorated, he may submit a request, accompanied by detailed medical evidence, to have his case reviewed.  He has already been advised in this regard but to date no new evidence has been submitted.</P>
    <P>The person concerned also claimed disablement benefit in June 1993 in respect of an alleged accident at work on 28 January 1980.  This claim was disallowed as there was insufficient evidence to substantiate it.  This decision was upheld on appeal.  The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and may be reviewed only in the light of fresh facts or new evidence.  Such evidence would include documentary evidence of the accident having occurred, the accident having been reported to the employer, injuries sustained and the fact that such injuries were as a direct result of the alleged accident at work.</P>
    <P>Based on records of credited contributions for the period in question the Department is satisfied that the person concerned has received his full entitlement to unemployment benefit for the period May 1981 to January 1983.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was also in receipt of unemployment benefit from March 1989 and exhausted his entitlement to unemployment benefit on 27 June 1989.  He applied for unemployment assistance on 28 June 1989 and was paid a weekly rate of £26.60.  His weekly rate of unemployment assistance was increased to £34.90 on 19 July 1989.  He subsequently signed off on 17 August 1989.</P>
    <P>The person concerned applied for a blind person's pension in December 1995.  Evidence of visual impairment was submitted and examined by the Department's ophthalmic inspector on 9 February 1996.  The inspector determined that the person's degree of impairment did not meet the statutory conditions as to blindness and consequently his application was refused.</P>
    <P>The person concerned appealed the decision but the appeals officer upheld the decision to refuse a pension.</P>
    <P>He subsequently submitted further evidence of his visual impairment but, due to an administrative error, this was not forwarded to the Department's ophthalmic inspector for reassessment.  This medical evidence has now been sent to the inspector for his urgent consideration, and when this and the relevant means assessment is finalised, the person concerned will be notified of the outcome without further delay.</P>

      <P>An application for grant aid for afforestation was received in my Department in January 1995 in respect of 81 hectares in the area in question.  The proposed planting did not require planning permission.  My Department viewed the proposal from archaeological, heritage, fisheries and landscape perspectives through, <i>inter alia</i>, consultations with the National Monument Service, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Regional Fisheries Board and the county council.  Representations were also received from local residents.  Following an assessment by my Department, which took account of all of the views received, grant-aid was approved in April 1996 in respect of a reduced area of 34 hectares.  Certain silvicultural and environmental conditions were also attached to the approval.</P>

      <P>The Erne catchment, which is divided approximately evenly between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is located mainly in counties Fermanagh, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan but also encompasses a part of counties Tyrone, Donegal and Longford.  The development of fisheries in the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland portions of the catchment is vested in the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board respectively.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland are the responsible authorities in so far as the implementation of the Fisheries Measures of the INTERREG II programme are concerned.  A project involving the rehabilitation of salmon on the Erne catchment was approved under that measure in December last year.  The project was drawn up by the relevant agencies North and South including the Electricity Supply Board, the Marine Institute, the Fisheries Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>This project, which involves total investment of £1.77 million, aims to reintroduce salmon to the Erne tributaries with a view to producing a self-sustaining population and the creation of angling tourism and employment.  The position at present is that the Northern Regional Fisheries Board and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland are continuing to carry out habitat and electrofishing surveys and, as in previous years, will be stocking out smolts and juvenile fish.  Over 70,000 smolts and 1.5 million unfed fry will be stocked out between now and the end of 1999. The Marine Institute will shortly micro-tag smolts while University College, Galway, will carry out a genetic examination of salmon taken this year. While EU funding for this programme has been secured until the end of 1999 it is envisaged that salmon rehabilitation operations on the Erne will continue beyond that to some degree.</P>
      <P>I also understand that two projects involving developments in the Erne catchment have been submitted by the Northern Regional Fisheries Board and the relevant statutory agencies in Northern Ireland for funding under the Cross-Border Development Sub-programme of the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  This sub-programme is jointly administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance and personnel in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The licences granted to the vessels in question contain a condition which explicitly prohibits them from fishing in certain ICES areas.  I am satisfied that the vessels in question have observed this condition and do not engage in fishing except in those areas in which they are permitted to do so.</P>
      <P>If any of the vessels were to fail to comply with the condition, it would constitute an offence under section 222B of the Fisheries Acts and could result in prosecution or the revocation of its licence.</P>
      <P>As regards the second question put by the Deputy, I should point out that sea fishing licences cannot be sold.  An owner wishing to sell his vessel must surrender his licence and the new owner must apply afresh for a fishing licence.</P>
      <P>In the case of the vessels licensed under the special scheme, a condition of the licence prohibits the sale of the vesels before 1 January 1998.  However, where a vessel licensed under the scheme has been lost, the Department has permitted the purchase of a replacement vessel by the owner in partnership with other fishermen.</P>
