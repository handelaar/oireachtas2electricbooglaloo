It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply to No. 8: (i) Members may table amendments, on notice, to Appendices 1 and 2 to the First Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Reform of Dáil Procedure dated 19 June 1996; (ii) (a) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Democratic Left Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (b) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (c) Members may share time; (d) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 4.45 p.m. today to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes; and (e) the debate, if not previously concluded, shall be interrupted at 5 p.m. whereupon the amendments to the report shall be taken pursuant to paragraph (1) (iii); (iii) the <Col N="1692" /> amendments to the report shall be considered in Committee of the whole Dáil not later than 5 p.m. and shall be moved and disposed of in proper order provided that any division demanded on any amendment shall be postponed until 6.45 p.m. today whereupon the proceedings on all such amendments and on No. 8 shall be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put from the Chair not later than 6.45 p.m. Private Members' Business shall be No. 21 &mdash; motion re. hepatitis C (resumed) and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>Overnight the Provisional IRA admitted responsibility for the terrible deeds in Lisburn on Monday. On behalf of Fianna Fáil I want to condemn, in the most severe terms, those terrible acts against the people of the North and the people of this island generally.  This morning it appears that the efforts of many people have been set at nought, but it is at times like this that political leaders, particularly the two Governments, must act.  There is a feeling that, since 1 September, the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have not moved the peace process forward. Therefore, it seems an appropriate time to have a summit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should say something this morning.  Last night's admission by the IRA that it carried out the bombings in Lisburn on Monday is a sickening reminder that it <Col N="1694" /> intends to continue to use violence to pursue its political goals.  We must make it clear that it will not bomb its way to the talks.  In particular, we must appeal to the loyalist parties to resist this clear provocation.  Equally, constitutional politicians and Governments must ensure that the peace process and the talks process do not slide into oblivion. We must ensure that politics works. With that in mind, I suggest that the two Governments and the two main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party, should meet under one roof, at a mutually acceptable venue, and seek to reach a consensus, to establish what unites them rather than what divides them.  If they could do that it would add a powerful momentum to the process and break the stalemate that has now arisen.  It is difficult not be pessimistic, but we cannot allow ourselves to let this process die.  In particular, there is an enormous onus, not just on the Governments but on the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party, the two main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, to rescue that process which is under way.</P>

      <P>Is it the view of the House now that the procedures be set aside and that the matter be debated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern and Deputy Harney have made brief statements. It would be sufficient that I be allowed to make a brief statement also. We need not go to the trouble of setting procedures aside and having a structured debate.  If it is acceptable to the Opposition Parties I would like to say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will have heard this morning that the <i>Irish News</i> in Belfast, reflecting mainstream Nationalism opinion in Northern Ireland has a front page editorial entitled &ldquo;How the IRA Betrayed the People of Ireland&rdquo;.  The Lisburn bombing is, indeed, a cynical betrayal by the IRA of the peace process. The IRA has now completed the terrible triangle &mdash; we have had IRA <Col N="1695" /> bombs in Britain, an IRA murder in Limerick in the Republic, and now we have had IRA bombs without notice in Lisburn.</P>
    <P>This betrayal came from an organisation that told democratic politicians its original ceasefire would hold in all circumstances. Now it seems that the IRA intends to continue to maintain the option of violence to be used as and when it is deemed politically useful.  The Lisburn bomb puts in stark relief the hard question whether the armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other is the unchanged and unchanging political strategy of the Republican movement. Was there ever a fundamental departure from that strategy by the movement as a whole?</P>
    <P>The Irish State cannot be hostage to tactical manoeuvres by a violent movement which is only willing to give up the option of violence if it gets the terms it has dictated to everybody else, and is willing to continue to use violence as one of its tactics from time to time to get those terms.</P>
    <P>Those were the classic tactics of the National Socialists and Fascists during the 1920s and the 1930s.  The strategy of the ballot box in one hand and the gun in the other was, after all, first originated by the Nazis.  David Ervine is right.  These bombers and their supporters also betray the ideals of the great Irishman Wolfe Tone who wanted to unite Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.</P>
    <P>We need to send a clear and unambiguous message from this House that violence from any quarter is futile and we do not condone it in any circumstances. I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, that we have a debate tomorrow in this House for this purpose so that all can make clear that the violence and the tactic of violence used by the IRA has no support in this Republic.</P>
    <P>I accept it is important that the Governments must continue to act to give leadership in the political process. As the House knows, and as the world knows, the difficulty in regard to moving the talks forward in Belfast has been <Col N="1696" /> one of how to deal with decommissioning. The two Governments together have put forward proposals to deal with that.  We tabled proposals to break the deadlock that was preventing us moving on to the agenda as two Governments together.  I invite the parties, all the parties in the talks, to return to that initiative of the two Governments designed to break the deadlock so that we can move on to substantive talks.  Anything that this Government can do in conjunction with the British government will be done.  We are in continuing contact with the British Government on a daily, and almost hourly, basis on the evolving situation.  I can assure the House of that.  Everything that can be done to provide political movement for those who are willing to take the political road will be done, but that must also be accompanied by absolute clarity on the fact that there can be no ambiguity or halfway house for anybody between violence and politics in this democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the shouting match, but this issue is important and we should make our views clear in this House.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil I again condemn Monday's acts.  It is a new move in the process since 9 February.  We have had acts of violence but none as blatant and done in the name of the Provisional IRA as happened on Monday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join everybody in saying that even though this morning it seems that the efforts of John Hume, Albert Reynolds and the Governments who have worked so hard on this matter over the past few years have been set at naught, that does not have to be the case.  We must try to keep the process alive.  It is not dead, although it is in trouble.  All political leaders, particularly the Governments because they are in the driving seat, must work to move forward.  I agree that the SDLP and the Unionists, and particularly some individuals within the talks <Col N="1697" /> who have managed successfully to frustrate the best efforts of everybody for months, have to be challenged.  The point should not be missed that the talks were to start on 1 January 1995, not on 10 June 1996.  We have lost a long period where there have been no productive talks.  The world does not understand how in that period we had no agenda.  If there are those at the talks who are frustrating the process to the extent that we might go back into a vacuum that inevitably leads to violence then those people within the talks as well as those outside should be fingered.</P>
    <P>I condemn the acts of the Provisional IRA.  The decision it made in August 1994 was the correct one.  There is no room in the modern world or in the modern Ireland, North or South for the bomb and the bullet.  That phase has passed.  Those who try to drag us back into it do not serve anybody who has the name of Irish man or Irish woman in any kind of true spirit.  In condemning this deed I say to the Government and the Taoiseach &mdash; I acknowledge that he said he will keep in contact &mdash; in the most constructive way I can that the phone calls we hear about or side meetings for 15 minutes in this type of climate are not the best signals.  A summit would show that world which is focused on us that we as politicians in the democratic political process want to move things forward.  If the Taoiseach does that he will have the support of this side of the House.  I believe Prime Minister Major cannot refuse him as soon as the conference is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil does not recognise my party as being represented here but, on the understanding that I represent a party outside this House, it is important that the IRA find no solace or endorsement, through any means, for what has happened.  While I welcome the other parties' suggestions for meetings to ensure the political process works, I understand the initial ceasefire was brought about by behind-the-scenes contacts and very difficult and hard <Col N="1698" /> work and negotiation.  I would like to be assured that that is happening as vigorously as possible alongside whatever political work is taking place in the public arena.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a more mundane matter on forthcoming legislation, I understand a credit union Bill has been in preparation for eight years.  Will the Taoiseach give an indication as to when it may be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter in which Deputy Briscoe is interested.  It is true that this legislation has been in preparation for a very long time.  We are hoping to have it ready before Christmas, but there is a problem in regard to whether we will be able to have the fully drafted version ready before Christmas.  It will certainly be very early next year.  It is complex legislation running into 188 sections, perhaps more.  Obviously, there is much pressure on drafting resources.  Drafting of the children Bill which has in the region of 240 sections is being completed.  Despite the substantial additional recruitment in the past year, drafting resources are at a premium.  I can assure the Deputy, in deference to his interest in the matter, that I will take up the question of the credit union Bill with a view to having it introduced as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not excluded. We have not actually got the terms of reference ready.  When we are considering them certainly the Deputy's suggestion will be constructively considered. On the face of it I do not see any reason it should not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be producing a Bill because, strictly speaking, one cannot produce a Bill which, at the time it is introduced or produced, is contrary to the Constitution.  All we can do is produce proposals for a Bill, which we have done.  We will provide as many answers as we can to any questions that may arise in regard to the proposals as published.  There will be no shortage of information.  All the information that would be available in a Bill will be available but it will not be in the form of a Bill for the reason I have outlined.</P>

      <P>(1)  That, in respect of the First Report of the sub-Committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Reform of Dáil Procedure (T. 291) dated 19th June, 1996, and with effect from Tuesday, 15th October, 1996&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the amendments and additions to the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business and the sessional orders recommended in Appendix 1 to the Report be adopted; and</P>
      <P>(b) the proposals set out in Appendix 2 to the Report, including the amendment to the Orders of Reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies set out at paragraph 1 thereof and the amendment to the Orders of Reference of the Committees set out at paragraph 10 thereof, be adopted.</P>
      <P>(2) That, in relation to the Orders of Reference of the Select Committees on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, Finance and General Affairs, Legislation and Security and Social Affairs&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the provisions of paragraphs (17), (18), (20), (21) and (22), <Col N="1701" /> inserted by Order of Dáil Éireann of 1st march, 1995, shall be deemed to apply to, and to have always applied to, a sub-committee appointed by the Select Committee; and</P>
    <P>(b) paragraph (19) of the Orders of Reference of each Select Committee be amended by the insertion of `or a sub-Committee thereof' after `taken before it'.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the co-sponsors of the motion who, as members of the sub-committee, worked to achieve a consensus in formulating the report.  I thank the Clerk and assistants to the sub-committee for their excellent services and the Clerk of the Dáil whose wise counsel was available at all times to the sub-committee.  I also thank the officials from the Department of the Taoiseach who assisted me in preparing proposals for consideration by the Government and in liaising with the Clerk to the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>Although a large measure of consensus was achieved in formulating the report, the sub-committee realised that there were issues on which all-party agreement could not be reached. Accordingly, we agreed that amendments may be tabled in the House to the report.  A number of such amendments have been tabled and I will reserve my remarks on these until I reply to the debate so that the movers will have an opportunity to argue in favour of their case.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the principal elements of the report of the sub-committee, I would like to make a few brief comments on the Government's proposals for Oireachtas reform.  Deputies will recall that Oireachtas reform formed a key part of the Policy Agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> negotiated between the three parties now in Government in December 1994.  Pursuant to that, the Government, on 24 January 1995, published proposals relating to committees, matters of concern, Dáil sitting hours, promised legislation and <Col N="1702" /> streamlined voting procedures.  The proposals relating to committees were subsequently approved by the Dáil and Seanad in March 1995.  The Whips of the various parties agreed on informal arrangements on Dáil sitting hours and committee meetings and the Government published a list of promised legislation for the first time on 24 January 1995 &mdash; this has been updated on a number of occasions subsequently prior to the commencement of each Dáil session.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties, however, indicated at the time that the Government's proposals relating to matters of concern and streamlined voting procedures were not acceptable to them as framed.  Accordingly, those proposals were not proceeded with.  On my appointment as Government Chief Whip at the end of May 1995, I took up consideration of the remaining commitments in relation to Oireachtas reform as set out in A Government of Renewal. I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle suggesting that a comprehensive review of Dáil Standing Orders be undertaken. This led to the decision of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges on 5 July 1995 to establish a sub-committee on the matter.  By this time, a sub-committee of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party had published its proposals for Dáil reform.  The Fianna Fáil document graciously acknowledged that many of its proposals had previously been proposed by the parties now in Government when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>On 25 October 1995 when speaking on the Dáil motion relating to the relaxation of the repeat rule for written parliamentary questions, I stated that the Government was working on a comprehensive package of Oireachtas reform measures.  This package, which took account of the proposals put forward by Fianna Fáil, was published on 6 February 1996.  Deputies will be aware from the minutes of the meetings of the sub-committee, which are appended to the report, that the Government's proposals <Col N="1703" /> and those of Fianna Fáil, with a submission from the Progressive Democrats on the Government's proposals and a submission prepared by the Clerk of the Dáil on technical amendments to Standing Orders, formed the documentation which was considered by the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the sub-committee readily agreed to most of the proposals put forward by the Government. These relate to: (1) the widening of the role of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges established to review Dáil Standing Orders and to examine proposals on Dáil reform; (2) the extension of the remit of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies to include Bord Fáilte, FÁS, the industrial development agencies, the National Roads Authority and Teagasc; (3) the investigation by existing committees of matters of serious public concern; (4) the formalisation of a role for the Dáil and Seanad Committees on Procedure and Privileges in overseeing procedures of committees &mdash; this will require the committees to report to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at least every six months; (5) an option for debating reports of committees; (6) the financing of up to five Private Members' Bills each year; (7) the rationalisation of arrangements in relation to responsibility for parliamentary questions in so far as ministerial policy for agencies is concerned; (8) the relaxation of the rule for disallowing parliamentary questions which are anticipatory of debate; (9) the introduction of a revised rule that ordinary and priority questions should not be taken together; (10) the provision for interventions during, and on, Dáil debates; (11) the provision of a question and answer facility in debates; (12) the provision for the making of declarations or affirmations in respect of the offices of the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle; (13) the televising-broadcasting of debates; (14) the use of Teilifís na Gaeilge channel for Oireachtas proceedings; (15) the examination of video conferencing; and (16) <Col N="1704" /> the provision of a revised format for the Order of Business and the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that, in response to points made during the deliberations of the sub-committee, I was able, on behalf of the Government, to accept revised proposals relating to: (1) the introduction of streamlined voting procedures, in so far as they relate to the suspension of a Member; (2) revised arrangements for Expressions of Sympathy in the Dáil; (3) rationalisation of time allowed for Question Time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays; (4) rationalisation of time for Taoiseach's Question Time; and (5) the allowance of second contributions on Report Stages on Bills and on Financial Resolutions, as well as accepting many of the proposed technical amendments to Dáil Standing Orders which are detailed in the report.</P>
    <P>The willingness by the Government to accept revised proposals indicates its openness to consider proposals, including those made by the Opposition, and to amend proposals which it had put forward.</P>
    <P>It may have been a much more expeditious procedure if the Government had pushed its proposals through the Houses of the Oireachtas without reference to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I remain convinced, however, that the approach adopted in seeking to get the maximum consensus was the correct one even if the process is somewhat tedious.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to some of the principal features of the report.  To underpin the impartiality of the offices of the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is proposed that there should be a provision for declarations in respect of both office-holders on their taking up those positions.  I have been assured by the Attorney General that the proposals are in order.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the practice in relation to ministerial responsibility for matters raised on the adjournment and parliamentary questions on agencies under the aegis of Government Departments, has differed from Department to <Col N="1705" /> Department.  There will, in future, be a consistent line in that Ministers will take responsibility for replying to adjournment debates and parliamentary questions in so far as Government or ministerial policy laid down for agencies under their remit is concerned, as distinct from policy laid down by the board and day-to-day administrative activities.</P>
    <P>The time available for the Taoiseach's Question Time is being more evenly divided and an additional 20 minutes is being provided on Wednesdays, thus enabling extra time for Ministers' questions.</P>
    <P>On the question of interventions during, and on, debates, such a procedure operated up to the late 1950s.  It is felt that its reintroduction will give rise to a more spontaneous exchange of views and enable Members to clarify statements made during a particular debate.</P>
    <P>Clearer powers are being given to the Ceann Comhairle to suspend a Member in a case where he or she disregards the authority of the Chair.</P>
    <P>Heretofore there was no system whereby reports from committees were tabled for debate.  It is proposed that all such reports will be tabled to allow the option for debate.</P>
    <P>One of the things we lack in assessing the committees is reports on how they operate.  I wrote earlier this year to the chairperson of each committee asking for suggestions from Members on reform.  In doing so, I was conscious that I might be accused of interfering in their operations but I felt it was appropriate to allow Members to indicate their wishes.  I invited them to convey any proposals for reform to me either directly, through the Liaison Committee or otherwise.  I regret I did not receive a single reply.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to lay down some specific arrangement for the taking of expressions of sympathy.  It is proposed to provide financial assistance for the drafting of up to five Private Members' Bills each year.  This is an innovation and all Members will be eligible to participate in a lottery for such assistance. <Col N="1706" /> It is also proposed to allow Members to speak a second time on Report Stage of Bills and on Financial Resolutions, subject to a strict time limitation.</P>
    <P>The remit of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is being extended to include nine other bodies in the tourism and industrial areas as well as Teagasc and the National Roads Authority.  In paragraph 2 of the motion we are proposing a slight amendment to paragraph 10 of appendix II of the sub-committee to allow for substitution by members of the Opposition at committee meetings.  This already applies in respect of members of Government parties. In paragraph 2 of the motion we are responding to a request of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security regarding the powers of sub-committees. This amendment was agreed with the relevant committees.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this is the first report of the sub-committee.  We propose to continue our comprehensive review of Standing Orders.  We will be thinking in terms of producing an updated version of Standing Orders.  I am of the opinion that the procedures as they relate to parliamentary questions require close examination.  Parliamentary questions are a vital tool in our democratic system. Anyone who closely studies the way it operates cannot say that it is satisfactory from either the viewpoint of Government Ministers or individual Deputies.  This, however, is for further consideration.  In my capacity as chairman of the Broadcasting Committee I am having various issues such as televising and broadcasting of debates, the use of the Teilifís na Gaeilge channel for Oireachtas proceedings and video conferencing and information for Members referred to in the report actively followed up.</P>
    <P>The Government is reasonably satisfied that we are far advanced in implementing practically all of the commitments in Oireachtas reform set out in A Government of Renewal. However, we realise that reform is a constant part of life and we must regularly review our procedures.  It is with <Col N="1707" /> enthusiasm that the committee will proceed. Many of the changes being introduced have been debated for years but consensus has only recently been achieved.  We must move to a new level in the debate to take account of the Government's strategic management initiative.  The central theme of the document launched by the Taoiseach on 2 May, Delivering Better Government, is the provision of quality service to the customers of the Civil Service at all levels. In order to do this, a framework of change is set out which encompasses legislative changes in order to devolve authority, accountability and responsibility and make the process more concrete.</P>
    <P>A key element in underpinning the process of change will be a greater emphasis on openness and transparency in the working of Government.  The role of the Houses of the Oireachtas is crucial in this context and the report makes a number of references to the need for change in the existing systems and procedures. It is now appropriate that the areas of change should be further considered and a programme of action proposed.</P>
    <P>A number of issues relating to the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas are raised in the Strategic Management Initiative Report as follows: the need for continued reform of the committee system in support of the change to greater openness and transparency in public administration &mdash; the need for greater clarity in relation to the role and remit of individual committees was considered essential; the need for clearer understanding of the relative responsibilies of Ministers and civil servants in relation to the formulation of policy, on one hand, and implementation of policy, on the other; accordingly, in relation to Oireachtas Committees, it is envisaged that Ministers and Ministers of State will address issues relating to the determination of policy, including the policy advice they had received relating to the production of outputs; appropriate arrangements for <Col N="1708" /> accountability of civil servants at Secretary and at senior levels to Oireachtas Committees for action on implementation of policy and for ensuring value for money, which would include the publication of strategy statements for Departments which would be subject to scrutiny and examination by an appropriate Oireachtas Committee &mdash; the remit of the various committees and, in particular, the role of the Public Accounts Committee needs to be considered in this regard; adequate protection for those giving evidence before Oireachtas Committees; and the question of Ministers answering parliamentary questions on policy and the arrangements for implementing it.  It was stated that the development of appropriate mechanisms to answer queries on daily operational decision from Members of the Oireachtas will be required.</P>
    <P>I am extremely interested in Members' views on these elements and in particular the views of committees on their future roles and remits.  I believe the debate should commence now so that we can prepare proposals for consideration and implementation in due course.  Judging from previous debates, I know Members will be tempted to raise extraneous matters such as the impact of electoral reform on Oireachtas reform.  I appeal to them to resist this temptation as there will be other occasions on which such issues can be debated.  Indeed, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution might be an appropriate forum in which to raise issues such as electoral reform.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that we can expect contributions from Members who will probably express themselves on current Oireachtas procedures, particularly relating to the committees.  Before they are tempted to do so, the committee will be most impressed if any such contributions are forthcoming from those Members who use the procedures to the full.  All Members are now eligible to attend committee meetings and to contribute to the proceedings.  If they fail to do so, they cannot be taken seriously if <Col N="1709" /> they deride what is available to them by way of such facility.</P>
    <P>There are many vague notions about Oireachtas reform.  It is time for those with ideas to expand on them and bring them forward into the public arena for consideration.  I look forward to Members' contributions.  I assure them that all views will be carefully and fully considered.  On the other hand, there is an obligation on the assiduous members of committees to let us hear of their views on how the procedures of the committees can be improved.  As I stated earlier, committees will be required to submit reports to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges every six months from now on.</P>

      <P>It is an indication of the real need for proper reform in this House that, unlike the Minister of State, I cannot provide a written script.  He is aware that being in Opposition is extremely time consuming and unrewarding at times.  The fact that the Opposition does not have proper facilities lies at the core of the need for proper Oireachtas reform.  However, that is an issue for another day.</P>
      <P>From time to time Members are lambasted by the media because, with the advent of televising Dáil proceedings, they tend to read from scripts.  Some elements of the media have derided us in this regard.  It has been my experience that when Members do not produce scripts, however, it is unlikely that the media will report what they say.  So be it.  That is one of the disadvantages of televising events in this Chamber.  On the other hand, from meetings of the various sub-committees of the House &mdash; particularly the committee which investigated the collapse of the previous Administration &mdash; it is obvious that the general public has a huge interest in the proceedings of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Minister of State, I thank all concerned for their efforts to put together this very extensive document on Dáil reform.  I pay particular tribute to the staff of the House who surprised <Col N="1710" /> everyone by the way in which they were able to produce and reproduce drafts of the document.  I also thank the Minister of State and the other Whips.  It is quite innovative that a joint motion has been put down by the five Whips.  To a certain extent it shows an all-party approach.  Having served as a Whip in various guises during the past ten years, it is my opinion that it is not for the Government to dictate the pace of Dáil reform, Members of the House should do so.  When the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was being set up I suggested it should not be changed when parties move from one side of the House to the other.  While I accept the Government should have the ultimate say, if such matters were discussed on an all-party basis it would demonstrate a much more independent view on the manner in which matters are dictated here.  The fruits of our work can be seen in the document before us.</P>
    <P>I want to thank in particular the sub-committee members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  When the Government produced its initial report on Oireachtas reform we set up a subcommittee chaired by Deputy O'Hanlon of which Senator Wright, Deputies Dempsey, Noel Treacy, the late Deputy Lenihan and myself were members.  Up to the last days of his tenure here Deputy Lenihan was extremely vigilant about Dáil reform and made a tremendous contribution to the meetings of that subcommittee.  As the Minister of State said, we made a significant input to the document before us.  The majority of its proposals emanated from suggestions made at meetings of the Fianna Fáil subcommittee which examined all documents and Government proposals on the question of Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>Having made those nice comments, I must now criticise the Government on its performance in this area.  The document, A Government of Renewal, provides Members on this side with an education from time to time.  Page one of that document states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> Government, too, belongs to the people.  But the relationship between Government and the people it serves has been damaged by a lack of openness. That relationship must be renewed...</P>
    <P>In its first pledge on taking office, the Government stated it would &ldquo;reform our institutions at national and local level to provide service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information&rdquo;. As quoted in one of our leading newspapers this is the most secretive Government of recent times.  Despite the honeyed words about answering all questions, week after week at Question Time Ministers and the Taoiseach lump together questions in such a way that it is not possible to ask a sufficient number of supplementaries.  Some Ministers refuse point blank to answer questions. In Opposition, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, demanded answers to questions, but refuses to give answers when in Government.  During the Lowry affair the Ministers used every rule in the book to avoid answering questions.  Were it not for the build up of pressure to answer valid questions asked in the past week or so, the Government would not have capitulated.</P>
    <P>I will remind Members of the views expressed in Opposition by some of the leading figures in Government.  In the dark days &mdash; for this party at least &mdash; surrounding 16 November 1994, the then Opposition made great play of the discomfiture of the Fianna Fáil Party for political gain.  Deputy Bruton, now Taoiseach, stated:</P>
    <P>We need a new Government that will reform the institutions of this State to make every Member of this House who holds office truly accountable. We need reform to ensure that when the answers to questions asked in the House are not adequate the Ceann Comhairle can demand that a further answer be given.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State accept the amendment I tabled in the spirit of what was said by his leader on 16 November <Col N="1712" /> 1994?  He went on to state that we are all accountable for our actions and that he is willing to be accountable for his. Every day on the Order of Business he hides behind the procedures of the House and will not answer questions, but pretends to abide by all the rules and to be the great reformer of the House.  Unfortunately, when the shoe is on the other foot he does the opposite. On 16 November 1994 he also stated that &ldquo;one should not accept anything at face value from anyone in circumstances like this, it is one's job to look for the proof&rdquo;.  Not long ago we requested the abolition of the repeat rule, but the Government did everything to prevent that happening.  The Minister of State said he would review the matter and, if necessary, introduce amendments.  That rule relates to the last century.  This is a modern parliament, we must know the answers and Ministers must be accountable. We must be able to react quickly. It is unacceptable that matters can be discussed on radio and television programmes, but not in the House.  On 16 November 1994, the Tánaiste stated:</P>
    <P>This is the correct and appropriate place for those who hold public office and are responsible for the decisions of public concern to account for their actions and omissions.</P>
    <P>These are all honeyed words but when in Government those same people do everything possible to prevent us getting vital information.  In a Fine Gael policy document, carrying the Taoiseach's name, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that it is pointless and hollow if politicians exhort and encourage other groups in society to modernise ... while failing to do so in their own area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The document also stated:</P>
    <P>We believe very strongly that if this country is to meet the challenges of the 1990s our parliamentary procedures and practices must be efficient, responsive, reflective, and <Col N="1713" /> capable of allowing Parliament to lead rather than to react.</P>
    <P>In that document Fine Gael also make a number of proposals, many of which it is not prepared to put into practice when in Government.  It proposes that written questions should be taken during Dáil recess, that Members should be able to raise matters of topical concern. The Minister of State said that the parties opposite did not agree with his proposals in that regard.  During its first few days in office the Government issued, with great fanfare, its Dáil reform proposals, one of which was to allow matters of topical urgent concern to be raised here.  He subsequenty stated the Opposition parties were opposed to that procedure.  We are not opposed to it. We oppose the procedure proposed to put it in place.  The Minister of State proposed that if a Member raises an issue in the House he or she would be answered by way of letter.  That is not what we want.  Such matters should be raised and answered in the House at the relevant time.  That is why we objected to the proposed procedure.  The Minister of State renéged on his promise to allow the Members to raise matters of urgent concern.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a number of amendments which propose the deletion of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;.  Will the Minister accept those amendments so that matters raised under Standing Order 30 on the Order of Business and Private Notice Questions are not ruled out of order because of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;?  We must be able to raise topical issues at the relevant time and not when they have been discussed by everyone else.</P>

      <P>I have another document from Democratic Left entitled &ldquo;Order in the House&rdquo;.  The Minister, Deputy De Rossa's party document in a paragraph entitled &ldquo;The(Dis)Order of Business&rdquo; states:</P>
      <P>The matters which can be raised on the Order of Business have been so restricted during the past number of years as to render the process virtually meaningless.  The position with regard to promised legislation in particular is ludicrous.  You now have a scenario of which Myles na gCopaleen would have been proud with a Government Minister able to hold a press conference or make a public announcement (several times) of an intention to introduce a Bill [but does not have to come into the House in that regard].</P>
      <P>The document is full of such nuggets from Democratic Left who made great proposals when in Opposition.  However, now it is in Government it does all it can to avoid proper Oireachtas reform.  The document states: &ldquo;Vocal proponents of Dáil reform in opposition, too often become unquestioning defenders of precedent and tradition when elected to Government.&rdquo;  Perhaps Democratic Left will respond later in the debate.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was asked before the summer recess if written questions would be allowed to be taken on two days of the non-sitting weeks in July and September.  We indicate to the public that the Dáil meets 11 months of the year in plenary session or <Col N="1715" /> in committee meetings.  Opposition Members should, therefore, be able to ask questions when they are preparing for committee meetings.  The Government has rejected our proposal that written questions be taken in July and September on two different days.  In response to this proposal the Taoiseach suggested that Members might use the telephone to get answers to questions. This is the same Taoiseach who portrays himself as the great reformer of this institution.  I and most Members of the House do not accept that is the case and, perhaps, if the truth be known, the Taoiseach himself does not accept it. Why will he not put into practice what is perhaps in the back of his mind?</P>
      <P>I have tabled 11 amendments to this report.  None of them deals with the committee system but that does not mean the Opposition is satisfied with it. I will not take issue with what the Minister of State says in the document because most of it is agreed.  He referred to the committee system and indicated that if people wish to have a go at the committee system they can only do so if they are using the procedures to the full. If they fail to do so they cannot be taken seriously if they deride what is available to them.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is the largest party on this side of the House and we are put to the pin of our collar to have Members attending all the meetings of the 22 committees of the House, not to mention the subcommittees of our parliamentary party and the various meetings with deputations and pressure groups.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for parties such as Democratic Left and the Progessive Democrats to have members attend all the committees.  It brings into disrepute the committee system as it has been allowed to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government created four extra committees to keep another four Members, a few convenors and vicechairman happy.  That is wrong.  If it is a question of paying people a little extra then the salaries of all should be increased.  We find fault with the com <Col N="1716" /> mittee system and that is a view shared by sections of the media which find it impossible to cover all the committee meetings.</P>
    <P>However, there are many issues which could be addressed if the Government were more open.  Among them is the ability to raise urgent matters in the House at the time they are urgent and to get an immediate answer.  I accept that the Taoiseach and Ministers have to receive some notice but such matters must be dealt with on the day in question. The issue of written questions in the summer must also be addressed.  I implore the Minister of State to accede to our requests in that regard.  The repeat rule is another issue which must be properly examined.</P>
    <P>While some amendment has been made on the issue of ministerial responsibility for answering questions, I will be anxious to see how that works in practice.  I feel that in this and future Governments Ministers will still hide behind a couple of lines and will not go outside what their officials tell them. That matter should be examined by all parties.  It is not for us to hide behind a document.  If mistakes have been made somebody has to answer for them.</P>
    <P>I compliment my colleagues for their work in the Whips' meetings over the last couple of months.  I also compliment the staff involved.  This is a good report which is agreed, save for the issues on which I have tabled amendments and other issues which could not be raised today.</P>

      <P>I thank the staff who guided the Whips in this tedious and laborious job over the last few months.  This may not be the perfect document but it is a move in the right direction.  It is welcome that the sub-committee will continue to meet and <Col N="1717" /> that an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of Members will make suggestions.</P>
      <P>Since becoming a Member I have been embarrassed at times to sit here and look at the schoolchildren in the public gallery watching the business. The Order of Business is not as it should be.  At times we act in an unethical and unprofessional manner and have made the Chair's job impossible on most mornings.  The Chair must be protected and this document makes a genuine effort to afford the Chair the protection and authority it needs.  It is ridiculous that if the Chair rules a Member out of order, if the Member persists and the Chair wishes to have the Member leave the House, a proposal from the Taoiseach and a division are required.  In effect, this calls into question the authority of the Chair.</P>
      <P>The changes proposed under this motion provide that the proposal will be made by the Chair, not by the Taoiseach, and that should eliminate divisions. Irrespective of who was in Opposition, that procedure was used by an Opposition Member acting in a rude manner as a tactic to create embarrassment for the Government and it resulted in a call for his or her removal. A division would have been called and there may not have been sufficient Members in the House to ensure that Member was removed, which would have constituted a vote of no confidence in the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to allow interventions in debates should add to their flavour.  We know how boring some debates can be and some of them have been made twice as boring because of the restriction on intervention.  This motion provides that with the discretion of the Chair a Member can be interrupted for 30 seconds.  That will add some colour to the debates.  In line with this committee, the Broadcasting Committee is also considering ways and means by which we can make the debates more interesting for those who view them on television.  Hopefully, we will be able to put forward suggestions together with <Col N="1718" /> what has been proposed under the motion to make them more interesting for outside viewers.</P>
    <P>The committee system must be considered because it is becoming impossible to ensure that the maximum number of members attend.  The back-up service for the committees must also be examined as there is insufficient secretarial staff.  Only legislative committee reports have been printed.  That is not satisfactory.  There is sufficient staff to ensure committees are recorded but not enough to ensure they are printed.</P>
    <P>To a degree I sympathise with Deputy Ahern on the topical matter raised during the Order of Business.  The Taoiseach and the Government should consider this further in the coming months. It might make life a good deal easier for the Ceann Comhairle when a Member wishes to raise an issue on the Order of Business because it has become impossible to raise some matters.  We saw an example of that here this morning.  The Ceann Comhairle was put in a difficult position when a matter of grave importance was raised on this morning's Order of Business in that strictly speaking he should not have allowed it to be discussed. Perhaps we could reconsider that in the coming months.  We will continue to work on this and hopefully we will come up with a better system.  If Members are conscious of the need for improvement and focus on the areas where we can improve the system, perhaps they will advise the committee of their views and in that way we might be able to improve on this document in the coming months.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, I welcome the proposals. They are fine as far as they go and represent a welcome step forward. I pay tribute to members of all parties on the committee for the sometimes boring, tiresome and turgid hard work required to bring the proposals to the stage they are now at.  I wish to make some general comments on the need for further change in regard to how business is carried out in the Dáil.  I wish to <Col N="1719" /> point out some of the limitations that I consider relevant.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the nature and culture of Irish politics which is a major factor in laying limits to the extent to which reform can be carried out in this House or in any other aspect of politics. The tone of political debate is set by the anxiety which exists for confrontation, disagreement, constant harping criticism, be it valid or otherwise, and the difficulty which faces any Opposition party in agreeing with the Government. Deputy Dukes learnt that to his cost when he set out the Tallaght strategy which he considered was in the national interest.  Some Members may have disagreed with his concept and with what he was proposing, but the general idea was worth while.  As leader of the then main Opposition party he put forward a strategy for national development working in co-operation with the Government, but he got little thanks for it.  That is the reality of politics which we must all keep in mind and from which we must learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preoccupation with splits, factions, power struggles and people jockeying for position has replaced other ideas. These are the aspects the media tend to focus on.  They are not so interested in constructive ideas.  In terms of the order of priority, invariably they will go after a good split or a backbencher who might have an idea of substance.  If it is put forward and there is any hint of disagreement with the party line the discussion and the debate will certainly not focus on the merits or value of the idea. It will focus on the concept of a backbench revolt, party split or a party in chaos.  I can see from the way Deputy Ahern is smiling that he is only too familiar with those concepts.  That approach sets the tone of what will happen in here.  It sets the limits and restrictions to Dáil reform because for reform to become effective we need a far greater concentration on ideas.  We also need to be capable of tossing those ideas to and fro in this House without that process being interpreted as a power struggle, <Col N="1720" /> undermining somebody or destabilising the Government.</P>
    <P>That relates to the concept of the ideal Government backbencher.  The ideal one is a lady or a gentleman who has virtually no ideas or proposals and in the event of such backbenchers being contaminated by an idea, they will have the good sense to keep their mouths shut.  Instead of concerning themselves with proposals, in an ideal world they would sing as best they could the party song, whether it was good, bad or indifferent. That may be something of a dramatisation or an exaggeration of Irish politics, but there is a fair degree of truth in it.  Unless we are prepared to address some of these matters, we will continue to have Dáil reform for many years to come because the end product will remain unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Government backbenchers have considerable difficulty in asking oral questions. They must join the queue.  It is almost like the lottery in that their chance of being called is about one in 100.  It is possible to go through the figures and check the position.  Does that encourage Government backbenchers to ask questions?  The Opposition has five priority questions and those take up most of the time.  That is one example of the type of difficulty that I would like to see addressed although I am pragmatic enough to realise it will not happen.</P>
    <P>There are 22 committees.  There is an analogy between the committee system and the lady or gentleman who decides to go into a restaurant and eat everything on the menu.  There are far too many committees, they need to be reduced and focused.  We need an indepth analysis of the effectiveness of those committees, where much talk and paper is generated.  How has it taken the country forward?  It is almost impossible for a Government backbencher to do anything about a Private Members' Bill. If a Member who is not a lawyer has an idea or does not have access to a committee the position is hopeless.  I have never considered drafting a Bill. <Col N="1721" /> However, it is desirable that all backbenchers should contribute ideas on Bills and reform.</P>
    <P>There has been discussion about openness, transparency and accountability, much of which is exceptionally naive and almost pitiable.  Consideration has not been given to the limitations on openness, transparency and accountability. When does openness become simple and naive?  If we are to be more open, we have to understand the limits of openness and accountability.  When does openness become nitpicking and an opportunity for cranks to indulge themselves?</P>

      <P>Much of Irish politics seems to be dictated along the lines of advertising conditioned by our behaviour in the House and in politics generally.

      <P>I listened carefully to, and reread parts of the Minister of State's speech.  Unfortunately, it is disappointing as it does not deal with the real problems in terms of the status and significance of the House and accountability to it.  It deals with trivial detail on the basis that the present system and approach is acceptable and will be improved by minor amendments to Standing Orders.  That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 19th century, when political <Col N="1722" /> analysts devised the system of the separation of powers between the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive in a parliamentary democracy, they saw the parliamentary tier as the supreme one.  It has to be, as it is the only one directly elected by the people and accountable to them.  In parliamentary and political theory, the parliamentary institution has always been the superior one.  In this country, the parliamentary institution is by far the inferior one of the three.  It is becoming progressively more inferior as the power and strength of the executive dominates.</P>
    <P>At least the position of the judiciary is preserved by the Constitution and cannot be changed.  They can interpret their own position and therefore will not weaken it.  There seems to be nobody to protect the parliamentary institution.  It seems to be regarded as entirely under the heel of the Government.  Every single parliamentary office, except one, is in the gift of the Government.  The only one that is not is the Chairmanship of the Committee of Public Accounts. The reason for this is that there is a long-standing Act which says that office has to be held by a member of the Opposition.  If there were not such a statutory provision, one can be sure the office would be held by a supporter of the Government.</P>
    <P>Even the office of Ceann Comhairle is now seen as a pawn in the creation of a Government and is not reflective of the views of the House.  The filling of that office is seen as a step to the formation of a Government.  If anyone doubts this House is entirely dominated by the Government to the exclusion of the House in a parliamentary sense, some of what the Minister of State said today should be examined.</P>
    <P>He was pleased he was able, on behalf of the Government, to accept revised proposals.  In other words, the Government decides what will be accepted here in terms of Standing Orders and the procedures of this House.  He went on to mention the Government's willingness to accept revised proposals and said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> It may have been a much more expeditious procedure if the Government had pushed its proposals through the Houses of the Oireachtas without reference to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>That is accurate and reflects the reality we face today.  The Government makes up its mind and does whatever it likes. This House is here to simply accept and put up with whatever the Government decides.</P>

      <P>It is not now that I am realising it, but it has become more blatant now than it ever was.  If this continues and intensifies, as it seems to have done in recent years, the situation is very dangerous indeed.  We are told by the Minister of State that &ldquo;all Members are now eligible to attend committee meetings and to contribute to the proceedings.  If they fail to do so they cannot be taken seriously if they come in here to deride what is available to them by way of such facility.&rdquo;  I am a member of five committees and I attend them constantly.  However, when I left the Chamber for a few minutes I was met by a member of one of those committees who said that I missed a meeting last week and that all kinds of things happened in my absence.  Frequently, I am in the position where I have two committee meetings going on at the same time and I am supposed to be speaking in this House also; I have three things going on simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee system as we have adopted it has gone from almost nothing to a ridiculous plethora of committees. We have, according to Deputy O'Donnell, 22 main ones and a few subsidiary ones.  This party has eight Members. How can it service those?  We have tried to service them.  Deputy O'Donnell and I, perhaps more than any others, have taken on an enormous quantity of these committees and have tried to service <Col N="1724" /> them in the spirit in which they were introduced by this House.  We are being told by our members and by people on all sides of the House that, electorally at least, we are wasting our time because the public do not give a damn whether I go to my five meetings or whether Deputy O'Donnell goes to hers.  We are doing it because we are trying to make the system work in this House.  It is not working.  The sooner this nonsense we have of these committees as they are at present constituted is brought to an end the better.  They are there for the purpose, unfortunately, of the Government rewarding its otherwise potentially disaffected backbenchers with posts as chairmen and convenors.  Convenor is a new post.  I am on a number of these committees and I fail to see what the convenor does.  In fact the convenor for some of them never attends, but apparently they are paid as are the chairmen. They are paid, unlike a Deputy's ordinary salary etc., free of tax.  I pay tax at 51 per cent so those who get X amounts as chairmen are in practice getting 2X.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I withdraw that comment.  I was under that misapprehension, but I was so informed.  They are still worthwhile, even paying tax at 51 per cent.  Why, if they are reflective of this House as parliamentary committees, is every one of the 22 chairmen, bar one that is compelled by Statute to come from the Opposition, on the Government side of the House?  Is that reflective of this House as an institution? Is it reflective of his House as elected by the people?  It quite clearly is not and it is a further indication that all aspects of this House as an institution will be used by the Government of the day simply to further its own interests. That is not good enough and it is a very dangerous and serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little or no accountability to this House.  Fiddling around with the <Col N="1725" /> detail of Standing Orders will not create accountability.  Accountability to this House and to the public will only come if there is a change politically and within the Civil Service from the culture of secrecy which dominates it at present.  If there was any one episode in my long history in this House which goes back almost three decades &mdash; I was the Government Chief Whip three decades ago so I know something of what I am talking about &mdash; that sticks out in my mind as indicative of the attitude of the Executive and of the Civil Service to this House it is what I saw written on a file in the Department of Industry and Commerce after it was finally produced to the beef tribunal in the early 1990s where a senior official commended a junior official on &ldquo;successfully confusing the Deputy&rdquo; in an answer that was provided in this House.  That was regarded as worthy of commendation by a senior civil servant.  It probably went on his personnel file to make the junior civil servant more worthy of promotion for &ldquo;successfully confusing the Deputy&rdquo;.  It was about export credit to Iraq.  The only constraint is that when answering questions in this House or drafting replies to questions for use in this House, a direct, deliberate lie, cannot be told but one can mislead to any degree possible short of directly telling a deliberate lie.  That is the official culture and, frankly, it is not good enough.  Until that attitude changes, fiddling around with the detail of Standing Orders, which the Minister of State proposes, is of no use.</P>
    <P>Not a week passes that there is not evasion of accountability by Ministers. One only has to look back a day at any time for evidence of this.  Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Quill, asked a question of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht about Teilifís na Gaeilge which is about to be set up as a result of a Government decision.  It will cost an enormous amount of money. Many people have great reservations about it.  It is a political decision which is costly to the Exchequer and will be for as long as it exists.  She wanted to <Col N="1726" /> ask a question about it yesterday and was told responsibility for Teilifís na Gaeilge lies with the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The Minister has no responsibility to this House and the question is refused.</P>

      <P>It is simply ridiculous. Deputy O'Donnell has a sheaf of letters from the Ceann Comhairle disallowing many questions about hepatitis C.  We had lectures last night from the Minister for Health about his transparency and accountability, yet the Deputy has a sheaf of letters in front of her about which she will tell the House.  What is the point in fiddling around, as this motion and the report on which it is based does, with the detail of Standing Orders unless there is a fundamental change of attitude?  Different attitudes exist in parliaments in different countries. What we have here is not the norm and because it is not the norm, it is dangerous.  This is where the real change needs to be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney puts many questions to the Taoiseach, particularly about Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach transfers the bulk of them to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and they may come up for answer six to eight weeks later.  I am handed a list of questions at that time by the General Office and told that there are 19 questions in Deputy Harney's name and I am asked if I want to put other names to them.  Through no fault of Deputy Harney, the questions are out of date by that stage, even though they were pertinent at the time they were tabled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, this House is misled on a daily basis by the manner in which parliamentary questions are obstructed by the procedures of the House or transferred to other Ministers.  Alternatively replies are drafted in such a way as to fillet out <Col N="1727" /> information sought.  Where one overcomes the procedural obstructions questions are answered in a minimal way and in many cases in such a way as to confuse, thwart and indirectly mislead Deputies.  That has been the pattern of several administrations.  This administration, which owes its existence to the failure of the previous administration to deal with issues of accountability and reply properly to parliamentary questions, has been more attentive than its predecessor.</P>
      <P>Any procedure which subjugates the rights of the Dáil to information must be challenged.  In our contribution to Oireachtas reform we have proposed a complete review and radical reform of procedures, not just a tinkering around with Standing Orders to tidy up procedures. I accept that is important, and we support all the proposals in the Dáil package of reform, but the real issues have not been addressed.  There is nothing radical about the proposal for Dáil reform.  If we are to enhance the role of this body as an inquiring body we must address the real issue of accountability.  The legislative function of Dáil Éireann is well known, but the inquiring function, an equally important function in a parliamentary democracy, is hardly developed and is being thwarted by the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the current controversy surrounding hepatitis C, a judicial inquiry is to be set up.  At last the Government has come round and what was out of the question several days ago is now Government policy.  Last night the Minister for Health said that all issues relating to his handling of the matter in terms of parliamentary accountability will be dealt with by this House.  Eleven questions which I tabled for written reply today have been ruled out because they anticipate debate on this evening's Private Members' motion. Those questions were not answered by the Minister last night and they will not be answered tonight.  Those 11 technical questions relate to matters over which this Administration has responsibility, its handling of the hepatitis C issue. <Col N="1728" /> instructions given by the Government, how much it knew about the handling of the court case, why liability was accepted at the last moment and the manner in which the severance packages were agreed with the two BTSB officials.  All those issues have been obstructed.</P>
    <P>The statement by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, last night is, to use his expression, a cod.  He accused us of codding women when we asked questions, but he is codding the Dáil when he says that there will be accountability to this Chamber in terms of his handling the crisis.  To establish the truth of these matters the tribunal of inquiry must look into what happened not only up to 1994 but since the Minister took over in the Department of Health.  The House is being misled in this matter.  There is a chronic inability to change our procedures and to review and reform the culture of secrecy, retaining information and holding on to knowledge.  The actions of the Government, which has a stated commitment to openness, are directly contradictory to that aspiration. Without radical reform of the way this House deals with parliamentary questions we are only skirting around housekeeping matters which are of interest only to us.  In terms of the public interest we must ensure that parliamentary questions are no longer obstructed or answered in a misleading way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I missed most of the debate because of a party meeting, but I heard some of the contributions of my Progressive Democrats colleagues.  Democratic Left and the Progressive Democratic have at least one thing in common, the small size of our parties.  I understand the difficulties of small parties in making a contribution in Parliament and trying to perform on behalf of their constituents.  The Progressive Demorcrats has an advantage over Democratic Left in that all its members are backbenchers whereas Democratic Left, with generous ministerial representation, has a deficit on the back benches.  The two backbench <Col N="1729" /> Deputies must carry a great workload, including weekly contributions to Private Members' Bills, raising questions with Ministers each day and attending in excess of 22 committees, which is crucifying.</P>
      <P>I am not, however, complaining in that when I was last elected to this Parliament most if not all of the work was conducted in this Chamber &mdash; there were a few committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts and one or two smaller committees.  This Parliament inherited the Westminster model. On the foundation of the State there were six or seven Departments whereas today that number has been increased to 15 or 16.</P>

      <P>There is an additional obligation on Members to partake in the proceedings of the House.  Small political parties will never be able to play the role they wish to play.  I have not heard Fianna Fáil's contribution to this debate, but that party has a sufficient number of backbenchers to cover all committees and it should have no cause for complaint.  I may have to attend, for example, a Committee of Public Accounts and at the same time watch the monitor to see if a vote is called at another committee. I may then have to go to the House to raise a question with the Minister.  I literally have to run from one room to the next to deal with business. If we are serious about introducing Dáil reform in a way that will benefit not only small political parties but also Fianna Fáil and other parties, we must recognise the need for back-up resources by way of personnel for every TD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently spoke to a Deputy who has decided not to contest the next general election &mdash; it is interesting to note the number of TDs who will not seek reelection. If asked they will say the Dáil has been transformed completely since they were first elected.  By anyone's <Col N="1730" /> standards the amount of work expected from a TD is disproportionate to that expected in the past.  We will see fewer and fewer part-time Members of this House.  We know the legal profession tends to treat this House as a part-time job but it is becoming increasingly impossible to treat Parliament as a part-time experience.</P>
    <P>If Deputies are to play a role to the maximum of their ability they will need back-up research workers.  I am an extremely busy politician and my secretary has been out sick for the last week.  As a result, my office has come to a standstill.  When a Deputy's secretary is sick he or she should automatically be entitled to a replacement.  It is impossible for me, or any Member, to prepare a few words for delivery in the Dáil, at the Committee of Public Accounts or at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges while two phones are ringing constantly in my office.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government and to the Minister of State.  If backbenchers are to play the role expected of them as legislators they will need substantially more resources by way of substitute secretarial staff and researchers.  Every TD should have a personal aide capable of doing research work outside the secretarial arena.  Without that we literally run from one committee to another not making much of a contribution to the debates.</P>
    <P>There is currently one journalist in the Press Gallery.  It saddens and disturbs me to see the image of a TD's role as projected by the media.  It was more hurtful last week when we read of the imminent opening of two bars in this House and the suggestion by a Member of the Oireachtas that most of us spend our time in the bar and are divorced from the real world.  That is a slur on every hard-working TD.  Some TDs work harder than others.  Some do their work in Parliament, see their primary role as legislators and do not maintain any direct or meaningful contact with their constituents.  There are others, like <Col N="1731" /> me, who have to work difficult constituencies like the south inner city of Dublin. There, for example, Deputies Gay Mitchell, Pat Upton, Ben Briscoe and I have been at more meetings about the drugs crisis than one could imagine.  We are obliged to be there.  I appeal to the media to be less flippant in their response to the workload of TDs.  They should recognise that a TD in this House works for a minimum of 12 hours a day and that does not include evening meetings so prevalent in certain constituencies.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke of the culture of the Civil Service in responding to questions, but we could also query the cultural approach to politics.  Should we attempt to break the incredible link that exists for many TDs with their constituents? Some British Labour Party MPs do not communicate with their constituents to the extent we do.  American students and others who come to Dáil offices and hear TDs contacting their constituents are amazed and flabbergasted by the extent of it.  Maybe it is a criticism of those who are in such daily contact with constituents, but we feel obliged to deal personally with them.  If the culture is to be changed I would strongly argue that Parliament can only assist in changing it by providing us with the necessary back-up resources including researchers and other personnel to allow us to devote more time to dealing with legislative matters.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the document produced. It will not necessarily resolve all the problems, and some of the issues I raised have not even been addressed in it.  I wish to impress upon all our parliamentary colleagues across the political divide that backbenchers need additional staff resources in order to make a more coherent, intelligent, articulate and researched contribution to the Parliament to which they were elected.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the proposals before the House today in the name of the Government Chief Whip.  I join in complimenting all those who <Col N="1732" /> have worked so assiduously in putting those proposals together.  I particularly compliment our Chief Whip, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has devoted a great deal of time, effort, thought and work to this document.  I regret that all our proposals have not been taken on board.  I heard the Minister say he would listen carefully to the case being made in favour of Deputy Ahern's amendments and I hope we can persuade him to accept some of those.  It would be a better document if the totality of our input could be included.</P>
      <P>I cannot seriously oppose any of the proposals before the House because they are fairly unexceptional.  I particularly welcome the proposal to finance Private Members' Bills, although it is regrettable that it is confined to only five in view of the fact that we see a much greater initiative on the part of Opposition Members in putting forward Private Members' Bills.  The Minister of State should examine that proposal which appears small and carping.</P>
      <P>There is a change in relation to allowing questions and answers during debates but, as I understand it, there is already provision for that.  We have already had a number of examples when it has been allowed during debates by agreement with the Whips.  I am not sure what the extent of the change will be; will it be the norm and will it be automatically agreed by the Government? What exactly will change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the recommendations for streamlined voting procedures for the suspension of a Member but I wonder why this proposal is being confined to that specific matter.  Why can we not have a generally streamlined voting system given the amount of time we waste trooping through the lobbies in this antiquated voting system we inherited from the English Parliament, which is more relevant to Victorian times?  The time spent coming down from our offices to vote in the division lobbies, having a chat and waiting for the results to be announced before returning to our offices, could be used more fruitfully in <Col N="1733" /> proceeding with the Business of this House.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the proposal for a revised format for the Order of Business and the introduction of an interruptions rule but I will reserve judgment on those until I see how they operate in practice.</P>
    <P>The proposals before the House leave one with the impression that what is being proposed are marginal procedural changes which will have no effect on the matters so eloquently adverted to by a number of Members during this debate. Even if some of the amendments we are proposing are accepted, these proposals will only have a marginal effect, if any, on accountability.</P>
    <P>On coming to office the Government promised openness, transparency and accountability.  Despite this we have been treated to a constant diet of secrecy, obfuscation and cover-up in the Lowry affair, in the defective warrant extradition case and most recently in the blood debacle where the story has been dragged out of the Government by instalments.  We are still miles away from the true story.  If the judicial tribunal being established by the Government does get at the truth I will welcome it but this House will not get at it or make the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, accountable for his stewardship of the Department of Health since December 1994.  The procedures which will be left largely intact will prevent it from doing so, as the Minister of State knows.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendments in the name of Deputy Dermot Ahern.  Nobody could argue logically that the repeat rule as it stands should remain in place.  It should be abolished as it has been used successfully as a device behind which the Government can hide when it wants to avoid accountability.  In practice we cannot bring up a matter on the day after it is first raised, even though it may still be topical, but the media can do so.  Every political journalist and current affairs broadcaster can ask the question on the <Col N="1734" /> day after and the day after that if it is still topical.  What does that say about this House?  Is it any wonder that the public's perception is that this House is less important than the political journalists and the broadcast media, that it is of little relevance and rubber stamps decisions taken by the Executive? The repeat rule allows the Government to avoid accountability in this House even though it cannot do so in the public media.  The net effect is to make this House less relevant and infinitely less important than the media.  That is regrettable in a democracy.</P>
    <P>We have proposed an amendment to Standing Order 30.  I have been a Member of the House for almost 15 years and have yet to see a matter raised being allowed, although I am sure it has happened on a few occasions.  It seems it is little more than a parliamentary ornament shown to visitors to the House.  It has little or no effect in practice. Because the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; is rigidly and narrowly interpreted Standing Order 30 is used consistently to avoid discussing matters of topical importance which are being discussed in the media. It seems they can be discussed everywhere but in this House.  We are told they cannot be raised because they are not sufficiently urgent.  Even where a factory closure is imminent and hundreds of people are about to lose their jobs any attempt to raise the matter will be ruled out of order because the Ceann Comhairle will adjudge it is not sufficiently urgent even though the factory is about to go into receivership or liquidation. Because the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; has been interpreted so narrowly Standing Order 30 is useless and has no effect in practice except to allow the Government to refuse to answer questions about matters which are of vital importance and urgent in the ordinary sense of the word.</P>
    <P>The Government is refusing to allow written questions to be tabled in the months of July and September.  This makes no sense.  As the Minister of State knows, committees of the House sit during those months.  The Members <Col N="1735" /> who attend those meetings need information urgently.  To get that information they have to use the tactic of the written question.  The Taoiseach has given us the ridiculous excuse that Members can get the information they need by using the telephone.  If we take this argument to its logical conclusion, we should abolish written questions altogether.  If the Minister of State is serious about introducing parliamentary reforms and making even a minimal difference during his term of office he should accept our proposal to allow written questions to be tabled during the months of July and September.</P>
    <P>Although it promised us openness, transparency and accountability, this is without doubt the most secretive Government in the history of the State. Even if one wants to ignore what has happened in the past two years, this can be seen in every line and section of the proposed freedom of information Bill to amend the official secrets legislation. Even from a cursory reading it is evident that the Government has no interest in getting rid of the culture of secrecy which has infected this State since its foundation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Lord Protector of Great Britain and Ireland, Oliver Cromwell, had at least one thing in common; both came to power on the basis that Parliament was allegedly being ignored and treated with contempt, that the Sovereign or the Executive was too strong and nobody was being held accountable.  In fairness to the Lord Protector, it took him about five or six years to decide that Parliament was irksome and it would be better to ignore it. Apparently, the Taoiseach decided to do this immediately on assuming office. We can be thankful that he does not have Oliver Cromwell's power to prorogue Parliament.  On occasion I have felt on the Order of Business or in various set piece debates that he would have preferred to take that option if it had been available to him.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Eric Byrne and others.  I, too, wonder why we have so many committees.  We have gone from <Col N="1736" /> the point where we had few committees, including the pilot scheme committee in which I participated which debated the Companies Act, to the point where we have 22 committees.  I sympathise with Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats because we have been put to the pin of our collar to service these committees.  This is ludicrous.  With the greatest of respect to the Members who serve on them and try to make them relevant it seems that many of these committees have been created simply to provide jobs, whether as chairman or convenor, for those who would have expected ministerial preferment and were disillusioned and disgruntled when that did not happen.  This is a device to keep them quiet.</P>
    <P>By using this device to buy off potentially disaffected backbenchers the Government has brought the entire committee system into disrepute.  I ask the Minister of State to look seriously at the difficulties being encountered by Members who are genuinely interested in having a proper committee system in place and making it work.  What is in place is a farce, a stunt and a device.  It is not working and has undermined confidence, not only in the House but among the media, in the entire committee system.  It is little better than a joke.</P>
    <P>We were told that the committee system would make backbenchers more relevant and give them more power but that has not been my experience.  I have debated legislation in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and if the Minister does not want to accept an amendment put forward by the Opposition, he or she can use the Government majority on the committee to reject it.  I have not found any evidence to suggest that because the amendment is being proposed in the cosy context of a committee, rather than in a full session of the House, it will make any difference to the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>I agree a proper committee system would make the House more efficient. The current system has made it more efficient in that it has enabled more <Col N="1737" /> legislation to be processed because the time of the House has been freed up while Committee Stage debates on legislation take place in committee. Apart from that, my reservations remain.</P>
    <P>There is a perception outside this House, reinforced consistently by the media, that Deputies are more interested in holding on to their own seats than coming in here to do the business for which they are paid.  The media, particularly those people in the media who focus on that issue, are somewhat disingenuous in this regard.  We have a multiparty system which puts enormous electoral pressure on Members.  As Deputy Eric Byrne rightly said, we have now reached the stage where, with the exception of a few, being a Member of this House is a full-time job for more and more Deputies.  It is their livelihood, although I pity anybody who depends on it for their livelihood.  If it is their sole means of income and that of their families, the pressure on them to hold on to that job is even greater.</P>
    <P>We have an electoral system whereby the people who elect us, our constituents, demand a minimum amount of attention.  They demand that we attend clinics, address their personal problems and are seen occasionally in whatever town or village in which they live.  Those demands should be taken into account. Without reform of the electoral system, which we have carefully avoided discussing and continue to put at the bottom of the agenda &mdash; the Government put it down the agenda in the run-up to the establishment of the committee on the Constitution, despite what the Minister of State said in his opening remarks &mdash; those of us in this House who want to survive will have to give a minimum of time to their constituencies, with the remaining time being devoted to their parliamentary duties.  That is the reality and it is time that we, as a Parliament, as well as those in the media, faced up to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion before the House.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Members opposite on the various procedures and <i>modus operandi</i> which currently exist.  In the brief time available to me I propose to deal with a number of topics which I believe are particularly relevant to the efficient operation of the House.</P>
      <P>The most popular interpretation of the dual mandate is that of Members of the Oireachtas being also members of the European Parliament, but I want to extend consideration of that subject to Members of the Oireachtas also being members of local authorities.  It is clear from the contributions of Members to this debate that to carry out one's duties in this House efficiently and effectively on behalf of our constituents is practically a full-time job.  It is almost impossible to exercise a dual mandate at European Parliament level in addition to being an effective Member of the Oireachtas.  It is time that situation was regulated.  I favour greater liaison between Irish members of the European Parliament and this House but if Deputies are members of both institutions they cannot execute either responsibility efficiently.  That aspect must be examined.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult for Members of this House, particularly those who represent rural constituencies, to execute a dual mandate in so far as it applies to being members of local authorities or health boards.  The House is normally in session from Tuesday to Friday, with various committee meetings taking place, but local authority meetings are frequently held on a Monday or Friday and it is becoming increasingly difficult to execute both functions effectively. The whole question of dual mandate must be examined in the context of reform of this House and efficiency in its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant point which has militated against the efficiency and effectiveness of the House is the introduction of the multiplicity of committees. As many Members stated, there <Col N="1739" /> are now 22 committees and it has become an all too familiar phenomenon to meet Deputies wandering the corridors of Leinster House, with a glazed look in their eyes and folders under their arms, searching frantically for the committee room they are required to be in by 2.30 p.m., with perhaps their attendance being required at another meeting at 3 p.m.  Enormous powers of bilocation or even trilocation are required by Deputies in respect of the committee system as it currently operates.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the smaller parties but the members of the larger parties are put to the pin of their collar to service the 22 committees of the House.  It has become almost a full-time job for convenors and party Whips to search for bodies to attend committees and make up a quorum.  It is not unknown for committees to be unable to initiate their business due to their failure to muster a quorum.  I omitted to say at the outset that I wish to share my time with Deputy Deasy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The time restriction does not permit me to make an effective contribution in this regard but a radical overhaul of the committee system is long overdue.  Yesterday the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which is dealing with prebudget submissions, received submissions from various organisations including the IFA, the IAVI, the drinks industry council and the Irish Hotels Federation.  It is difficult for Members to do justice to such an important committee meeting, notwithstanding that they are required to attend a number of other committees and parliamentary party meetings.  The whole question should be examined with a view to establishing ten or 12 effective committees of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of voting in the House is archaic.  Time is our most scarce <Col N="1740" /> resource and an electronic system of voting needs to be introduced immediately. Another point in regard to the waste of time concerns the Order of Business.  Every morning the Taoiseach comes into this House and reads out the Order of Business.  Under existing Standing Orders, the Ceann Comhairle is obliged to repeat, word for word, what has been said by the Taoiseach. The Order of Business should be circulated to Members who could then make observations on it.  That would be better than wasting ten or 15 minutes every morning reading out the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of resources for Members.  I am fortunate to have the assistance of an American intern who is amazed at the extent of the hands-on contact between public representatives and their constituents.  That contact demands a great deal of time and, if one is a public representative, it leaves little time to do the work for which we have been elected to this House.  Much of that work could be delegated if sufficient resources were available. Research facilities are lacking and that is an area which should also be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the proposals before us.  I hope they will lead to an improvement in the manner in which this House operates.</P>
      <P>We all thought, some years ago when the committees were set up, that we would have a far better system of debating and legislating in the House.  That has not happened.  A number of Bills are dealt with in committees but there has been no overall improvement in the workings of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised method of dealing with questions has been the cause of much frustration among Deputies in the House.  There are Deputies, including Government backbenchers, who ask awkward questions, and the manner in which priority questions are dealt with, <Col N="1741" /> taken in conjunction with the Taoiseach's questions, can mean that the ordinary Members, more than 100 out of 166 Deputies, never get a chance to pursue a question they have on the Order Paper.  That is not good for democracy.  That procedure has been a retrograde step and something will have to be done about it.  At least an hour should be reserved three days a week to allow backbenchers to ask questions. The present system has led to the despicable practice of Ministers filibustering on the questions preceding a question they do not wish to answer to such a degree that the question will not be reached.  That is a negation of democracy and should not be tolerated. Until we have a system whereby all relevant questions are answered, we are defeating the purpose of democracy. Under the old system a Minister's questions were dealt with until such time as they were exhausted, even if it took a full week, so that a question was reached regardless of whether the Minister liked it.</P>
    <P>The mention of parliamentary questions also brings into focus the matter of disqualification of questions.  As time passes I get more and more letters from the Ceann Comhairle telling me my question has been disqualified on the most frivolous of grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>It happens to me more often than to any Opposition Deputy.  I had two questions yesterday for oral answer and both were disqualified.  The Deputy and his colleague are only in the ha'penny place, because I have a tendency to ask pertinent questions which some people might say are too close to the bone.  That is what politics is about. I do not know who is responsible.  The letter comes from the Ceann Comhairle but I suspect that questions are often disqualified because the Minister responsible has said he does not want to answer.  It is happening nowadays on an ever increasing scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> I deeply resent the fact we cannot ask parliamentary questions about the activities of State-sponsored bodies because, taking them in conjunction, they spend more money than the entire budget of this House, with the exception of major spending Departments such as the Departments of Social Welfare and Health.  There are 40 or 50 State-sponsored bodies that handle billions of pounds of public money and we cannot ask a question about them.  Where is the justice in that?  If one writes to the company in question one gets the brush-off. They are responsible to nobody.  They should be responsible to the relevant Minister, to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. People may contradict me and say I am wrong when I say they are not responsible, but I am not wrong.  They are not responsible, and their arrogance and their activities prove that time and again.  They have the best of trips, the best of accommodation in first class hotels, the best of wine.  We need only go back a few months to the Bord na Móna débâcle.  One could point the finger at dozens of State-sponsored bodies where the same practices are in operation. It is a disgrace that this House has given away so much of its power.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see additional State-sponsored bodies included in today's legislation.  I compliment the Minister of State on that.  However, they are only included for examination by the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  They should be for examination by this House, and every penny they spend should be open to the close scrutiny of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to bear in mind that we never have a <Col N="1743" /> debate in this House on the proceedings in the Council of Europe which is the humanitarian body looking after the human rights of people throughout Europe and of which 36 or 38 countries are members.  I happen to be leader of the Irish delegation at the moment and feel it is a great pity that we do not occasionally have a debate on the proceedings in the Council of Europe.  It has some very relevant debates, most recently in relation to Northern Ireland and the conditions of detention of republican prisoners in British jails which delegations from the three main parties in this House have found to be appalling and a contributory factor in the breakdown of the ceasefire in Northern Ireland.  Such issues should be debated in this House and I ask the Minister when replying to give consideration to that.  We discuss such matters in Strasbourg but not here, and we should do so.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the motion.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, on his presentation on the first report of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on reform of Dáil Éireann and amending orders of reference of committees.  I wish to congratulate also the members of the sub-committee who, I understand, are the party whips, especially my own party whip Deputy Dermot Ahern. I was also pleased to hear the Minister refer to the input of the staff of the House which was endorsed by Deputy Ahern.  This is welcome as the input and contribution of the staff of the House to the business of the House is not often publicly appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the report that although a number of proposals have been submitted and agreed, there is no mention of legal representation for the chairmen and members of the various committees who make a very valuable contribution. It is fundamental to the working of the many committees of this House that they should be fully covered by way of legal representation if they so require.  I <Col N="1744" /> appeal to the Minister and the sub-committee to give this matter serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised this is the first report of the subcommittee and that it is proposed to continue the comprehensive review of Standing Orders. In that regard we will be thinking in terms of producing an up-to-date version of Standing Orders.  I am of the view that the procedures as they relate to parliamentary questions need close examination.  On this point legal representation is most important and I ask him to take it into account.</P>
    <P>I support the point made by Deputy Eric Byrne who referred to the need for back-up for backbenchers in regard to research.  It is important that this matter be taken into consideration.  There is no doubt that the workload of backbench TDs is not appreciated by the public.  If a backbench TD slips up in any way in regard to communication he will pay for it at the next general election.</P>
    <P>In my brief contribution I will deal with matters relevant to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Following the press release in relation to Dáil reform, all committees were invited by the Government Chief Whip, on 23 February 1996, to make submissions to the subcommittee on Dáil reform, setting out their observations in relation to the proposed changes and any further proposals for reform.</P>
    <P>Prior to that request, on 14 February 1996, as chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle pointing out where there was a conflict between the orders of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts and the proposed amendment of the orders of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  This letter was passed by the Ceann Comhairle to the Government Chief Whip.  The Committee of Public Accounts is very disappointed with the response of the subcommittee to its representations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> Dáil Standing Order 131, which sets out the orders of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts states:</P>
    <P>(1) As soon as may be following the reassembly of the Dáil subsequent to a General Election there shall be appointed a Select Committee, to be known as the Committee of Public Accounts, to examine and report to the Dáil upon:</P>
    <P>(a) the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by the Dáil to meet the public expenditure and such other accounts as they see fit... which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and presented to the Dáil, together with any reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon:...</P>
    <P>These orders of reference were extended in 1994 following the adoption of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, which was enacted following extensive lobbying by the Committee of Public Accounts. Section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, states:</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, in relation to ... any other person or fund whose accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General... carry out such examinations as he considers appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)whether and to what extent the resources of the Department, person or fund&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  have been used, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  if acquired or disposed of by the Department, person or fund, have been so acquired or disposed of,</P>
    <P>economically or efficiently, and</P>
    <P>(b)  whether any such disposal has been effected upon the most <Col N="1746" /> favourable terms reasonably obtainable ...</P>
    <P>In this report, it has been proposed that the orders of reference of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies be amended to extend its remit to cover particular non-commercial bodies, namely, Bord Fáilte, FÁS, Forbairt, Forfás, IDA-Ireland, National Roads Authority, SFADCo, Teagasc and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  All these bodies already come within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, by virtue of the fact that they are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and a number of them have already been examined by the committee this year, in accordance with its orders of reference which, unlike those of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, are contained in Standing Orders of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As a result of the proposed amendments there will now be a significant overlap in relation to the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts and those of the Joint Committee.  In addition, as the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies looks at the economy and efficiency of bodies, and their effectiveness, its new terms of reference will not overlap the duties of the Committee of Public Accounts but those of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the inclusion of a phrase instructing the joint committee to &ldquo;have regard to the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993&rdquo;, but the proposed amendments to the orders of reference of the joint committee will be extremely wasteful on the already over-stretched resources of the committees of the Houses, particularly as a result of the overlap of functions of these two committees.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts urges that the provisions proposed by the sub-committee be amended to remove the sections which, in effect, dilute the already limited powers of the <Col N="1747" /> committee.  The committee fought for many years for the extension of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and that of the committee to its present level.  As a result it is reluctant to allow for a reduction of its recently extended remit.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not see fit to amend the proposal as suggested, it will be necessary that detailed guidelines be drafted to address the problem of the overlap of functions of these two committees, to clarify the position and to allow for a new system to operate.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the committee to fully utilise the provision of the report allowing for the co-ordination of the committees by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and it will be in contact with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as soon as possible in relation to the operation of the amendments.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the inclusion of a proposal to amend Standing Order 131 to allow for the printing and publishing of the Minutes of Evidence of meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts from time to time.  This technical amendment was requested by the committee some time ago and its inclusion is more welcome.</P>

      <P>The main changes for my committee, arising from the motion, are a change of name from Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies to Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and the addition of nine bodies to the committee's existing remit.  My committee deals with 24 bodies, <Col N="1748" /> some with subsidary bodies.  An examination of these bodies involves a minimum of ten meetings, even allowing for the committee meeting on an average of 30 times a year.  Because of the additional bodies being added to our remit I calculate it would take between nine and ten years to cover the investigation of all these bodies.  That is neither possible nor likely.  On the basis of our term of reference, it would require three Dáil terms to cover the whole of these bodies.  One of these bodies, Irish Steel, should be removed from our remit shortly.  I hope that those commercial bodies which form a strategic alliance, but still remain in public ownership to a minimum of 51 per cent, will remain within our remit and answerable to public representatives. That is an importance point because more alliances are being forged and I hope there will not be a requirement to remove them from surveillance under our committee.</P>
      <P>The addition of nine extra bodies means we will have to give serious consideration to how we do our work.  I will return to that later.  The nine additional bodies are already among the 100 plus non-commercial semi-State bodies under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Our proposed orders of reference state that the joint committee shall have regard to the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, in its examination of State Sponsored Bodies.  The orders of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts include provision that the committee will examine and report to this House upon (a) the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by the Dáil to meet public expenditure which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and presented to the Dáil, together with any reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon, and (b) the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the examination of the economy, efficiency, effectiveness of evaluation systems and procedures and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> Having regard to the preceding orders of reference I will endeavour to ensure that any committee does not duplicate work which can be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General due to the vastly superior resources at his disposal.  The appropriate legislative committee can invite these bodies to come before it to discuss the matters within its remit.  It is important that these bodies are not brought before more than one committee, thereby using up their valuable time and duplicating work.  My committee must consider ways in which it can play a useful and complementary role to that of the Committee of Public Accounts in dealing with these bodies.</P>
    <P>The main remit of my committee has been to examine the reports, accounts and overall operational results of various bodies.  Having examined the annual reports of these bodies over many years, I am convinced more than ever that the purpose of these reports is to accentuate the positive and ignore the negative.  Perhaps it is time we devised a new method for examining these bodies which is more relevant to the present era.  The emphasis on strategic management presents an ideal opportunity to reassess the remit of my committee so that we do not duplicate the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the nine new bodies.  Strategic management with its emphasis on agreeing policy objectives and necessary results, on the one hand, and providing the necessary results, on the other, appears to offer a more attractive, efficient and relevant method of assessing value for money and performance and to provide a basis for avoiding duplication of work by committees which have an interest in the same body. I propose to raise this matter with the members of my committee under Standing Order 76 (d) which enables committees to review their procedures and roles and to report to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at least every six months.</P>
    <P>Nine bodies are being brought within <Col N="1750" /> the remit of my committee but I am surprised An Bord Tráchtála and An Bord Bia are not included.  Given that up to 90 per cent of all Irish-owned manufacturing companies are small and medium sized enterprises and the vital role these bodies must play if enterprise is to flourish, it is difficult to see how my committee can get a complete picture without their inclusion.  The further success of Irish-owned enterprise would appear to depend to a great extent on the level of co-ordination and co-operation between these bodies, including some of those being brought under our remit.  There are also cross-departmental issues involved in the carrying out by these bodies of their functions.  This is an area where my committee can have a useful input and which it can raise under Standing Order 76 (d).</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the inability of Members to query certain areas within the semi-State sector.  I hope Members will use the substitution rule to attend committees where they can voice their concerns about such matters.  I have received letters which have raised queries about the semi-State sector and the committee pursues these on behalf of Members.  I congratulate the Minister on the proposals he has put forward today.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Broughan.  While I welcome the proposals brought before the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, I am surprised that there is not more in them for backbenchers.  Last year I referred to the way backbenchers have to operate in the Dáil.  As can be seen from the proposals before us today we do not really count.  It is time backbenchers set up their own unofficial committee to consider ways of improving their facilities.  I am sick and tired of the way we are treated by Ministers and Governments and it is time we got together and organised ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Byrne.  If my secretary is on sick leave for one, two, three or four weeks I have nobody to assist me and my office <Col N="1751" /> comes to a standstill.  When she goes on holidays there is nobody to replace her. This is not the way private industry works.  A person in private industry who goes on holidays is replaced by another person.  What is wrong with us that we do not get together and fight for what we need?</P>
    <P>During the summer recess I was visited by a member of another parliament. I was embarrassed to bring him into my office where the only equipment is a telephone.  I do not have a fax or photocopier and my secretary was working in my constituency office. When he asked me how many researchers I had I told him I was not a Minister and only had a secretary who has an enormous amount of work to do in my constituency office.  My secretary helps me in dealing with the political problems which arise on a daily basis and she also carries out research. Nobody helped me with my speech; I had to go to the Oireachtas Library and read the speeches made on this subject on the last occasion it was debated.</P>
    <P>Backbenchers from all political parties do not have anybody to represent them and it is time we got together and set up our own committee.  A person who wishes to fax a letter to me must send it to the Fine Gael Press Office where it can be seen by five or six people who then know my business.  The general public may not believe what I am saying because the press gives the impression that we have all these facilities at our disposal and that we have control of the Dáil.  I want to say to the press that we do not have control of the Dáil, which is controlled by the Civil Service.  It is time a Bill was introduced under which Ministers took back control of the Dáil and were answerable to it.  I am sick of receiving letters from the Ceann Comhairle's office telling me my questions are not in order or that a certain Minister has no responsibility for the matter.  The general public think that Deputies have responsibility for everything but we have responsibility <Col N="1752" /> for nothing because we are not told anything. If we do not organise ourselves we will never be told anything.</P>
    <P>I am also annoyed at the way in which officials answer questions.  Instead of giving a simple answer to a simple question they give a coded reply to try to confuse us.  I could give many examples of questions which I have had to table two or three times to get an answer.  The Minister and officials know the information I want but they give a coded reply.  This is not the way the Dáil should work.  Ministers should answer questions honestly and truthfully and should not try to protect anybody.  They are elected to represent the people and, as their representatives, we should be given the answers.</P>
    <P>I wish I had more time as there are many other points I would like to make. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, on these proposals, but I hope further proposals will be brought before the House which will upgrade the facilities for Deputies and ensure that we have researchers.  In spite of what the press and general public say, we do a difficult job and have a heavy workload.  It is a difficult job but it is good that public representatives are available because of the way people are treated by officials in certain offices.  We represent them and provide a barrier between them and the officials.  Without us it would be a poor system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second every remark made by the backbencher of the year, Deputy Ring.  During my first weeks here, I was amazed to discover that the Dáil is effectively a 19th century assembly operating with early 19th century practices.  Like Deputy Ring, I primarily blame the officials responsible for running the Oireachtas for permitting this situation to continue.</P>
      <P>On the question of resouces I must inform the House that I share an office with two other Deputies, our secretarial staff and, on occasion, visiting staff from the Labour Party.  Five people are trying to work and represent 250,000 people in a few square metres.  That is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> As Deputy Ring stated, the lack of support is equally disgraceful.  In England, each MP has access to a secretary and a researcher.  This is considered to be the very minimum in a country where Governments also have a long tradition of not supporting backbenchers.</P>
    <P>This report could be likened to a doctor giving two tablets to a patient in need of radical surgery.  The procedures of the Dáil require such surgery.  Why do we not have electronic voting?  This matter has been discussed for 20 years. All votes could be recorded electronically on Thursday evenings at one time, as is the case in the Belgian Parliament. Amendments have been proposed to Standing Orders relating to the Order of Business, but why is it not possible for the Taoiseach to deal with Deputies' immediate concerns?  I welcome the proposals to allow 30 second interventions.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Connolly, I enjoy the cut and thrust of debate which is not available in this House.  We do not have proper debates in the Dáil.  Complaints have been made about only three to four Members being present in the House.  However, more people cannot contribute because speeches are far too long.  In the European Parliament contributions are limited to three minutes.</P>
    <P>There should also be radical surgery of the committees.  Some of my colleagues are chairpersons of committees but the Dáil could best function with approximately seven committees.  There should be only the four standing committees, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The remainder should be consigned to the dustbin because they are not necessary.  I may be echoing comments made by a previous speaker but the select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy should deal with the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Byrne stated, the Committee of Public Accounts is in a disgraceful position.  Almost 75 years after the foundation of the State, this premier <Col N="1754" /> committee, with its constitutional role, is not allowed to go public or be televised and does not have the power to compel witness, nor is it protected by privilege.  The previous Government was also at fault in this regard. However, two years into the term of office of the new administration, the Dáil does not have the kind of procedures to permit the Committee of Public Accounts to operate in a way similar to its counterparts in Finland, Sweden, England, etc.  This key committee is responsible for examining officials and making stringent judgments but it cannot compel witnesses to attend. Gross inefficiencies have occurred because the committee does not have access to the requisite powers.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the ideas and amendments suggested in the report.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, for bringing it before the House.  However, it is a pathetic first step given the radical surgery required. Like other Members, I hope to be elected to the 28th Dáil.  I also hope the incoming Government will bring the Dáil into the 20th century and introduce new rules of procedure and alter the situation regarding resources available to Members.  Such action will make this assembly truly interesting and relevant to the needs of our constituents.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report and I note what it intends to achieve.  There has been criticism of the public service and statements that its members are at fault in the operation of the Houses.  I do not blame them; I never did.  Successive Governments &mdash; I served in many of them &mdash; shied away from the problem because they were afraid of the media.</P>

      <P>When I entered this House, there were ten Members to each typist.  The typist who worked for me used an Underwood typewriter and had <Col N="1755" /> to use a brush to clean the letter &ldquo;t&rdquo; which otherwise appeared on the page as &ldquo;i&rdquo;.  What did we do to rectify this? When he became Taoiseach in 1979, former Deputy Charles Haughey made the first radical changes to the Oireachtas.  He appointed secretary typists to each Member of the Dáil and ensured that new typewriters were installed.  This might have been a small development but it was a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I have served on many committees of the House and Members baulked when the issue of improvements arose because we were afraid of the public reaction.</P>

When the Ethics in Public Office Bill was debated in the House, I spoke freely and without hesitation on it.  When they completed forms regarding their assets as required by that legislation, it emerged that Members did not own as much as people supposed.  It became apparent that many Members left this House with nothing to face ordinary life again.  I warn any young people seeking election to this House that it is a new ball game.</P>
      <P>It is the fault of Members that the facilities of the House have not been improved.  I have worked with members of the Civil Service for almost nine years.  Those people accede to all requests made by Deputies and should not have to shoulder the blame. Members across the political divide did not bother their heads to improve the situation because they were afraid of the newspapers.</P>

      <P>on Tuesday, 8 October 1996, read the following reply:</P>
      <P>
        <i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, together.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>The Special Meeting of the European Council in Dublin on 5 October last was a success.  In relation to the Intergovernmental Conference the Special Council reaffirmed the time-table set by the Florence European Council thereby confirming that the conference should be completed by the middle of next year.  The special council also confirmed the need to maintain the level of ambition of the conference so as to ensure that its outcome is adequate to equip and strengthen the Union to meet the internal and external challenges facing it.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>The Irish Presidency will now proceed to discharge the mandate given to it at the Florence European Council and submit a revised draft Treaty to the Dublin European Council.  It is our objective that this draft will meet the required level of ambition and will provide a basis whereby the conference can be successfully concluded in mid 1997.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>I also briefed the special council on the progress on Ireland's other key Presidency priorities in the areas of economic and monetary union, drugs</i>
      <Col N="1758" />
      <i>and crime and employment.  I indicated that the Presidency was on course to submit substantive conclusions to the December European Council under these headings.  The special council saw a particularly strong consensus on the need for the Union to tackle the issues of crime and drug trafficking not just through Treaty changes at the Intergovernmental Conference but also on an ongoing basis.  There was acknowledgement of the progress already made on this matter during the Irish Presidency notably at the recent informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and a determination to see further progress recorded at the December European Council.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>In the areas of external relations the Special Council discussed the EU's relations with the US, Russia, Japan and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  We also discussed the Middle East Peace Process and agreed that the Tánaiste should visit the Middle East to meet with both the Israelis and the Palestinians to convey the strongly held view of the European Union of the need to accelerate the Middle East peace process.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>As the House is aware the Tánaiste has already carried out his mission during which he met the Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Netanyahu, President Arafat of the Palestinian Authority and President Mubarak of Egypt.  The Tánaiste also had discussions during his visit with the US Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher.  The prompt action of the European Union signifies that the EU will do all in its power to promote a rapid conclusion to the peace negotiations in the Middle East and that we will co-operate with both the Israelis and the Palestinians in a constructive way.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>The Special Meeting of the European Council also agreed in principle to the appointment of a special EU envoy to work on an ongoing basis</i>
      <Col N="1759" />
      <i>with all of the parties in the peace process in the Middle East.  The Special Council instructed the General Affairs Council to consider a mandate for such an envoy at its next meeting at the end of October.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Chancellor Kohl paid an official visit to Ireland on 2-3 October last.  I had discussions with the Chancellor on 2 October which covered European and international issues.  The Chancellor indicated full agreement with Ireland's Presidency priorities especially in regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and the fight against drug trafficking and international crime.  We also reaffirmed our commitment to economic and monetary union in accordance with the provisions set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  I also briefed the Chancellor on the situation in Northern Ireland and expressed my appreciation for his support for the Northern Ireland peace process.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>I had a meeting with Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark on 3 September last.  We had a discussion on a broad range of European issues with particular emphasis on the Intergovernmental Conference.  We also discussed EU-US relations and the situation in former Yugoslavia.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>On 18 September as President in Office of the European Council I made a State of the Union Address to the European Parliament.  I have arranged for copies of my address and my comments in reply to the debate to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>In the address I identified the five main tasks facing the European Union.  These are: to make the Union more relevant to its citizens, to successfully conclude the Intergovernmental Conference, to make the single currency a reality, to complete the next round of enlargement to the East and South and to secure Europe's place in the world.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" />
      <i>Finally, I visited Japan for an EU-Japan Summit on 30 September.  The joint statement issued at the conclusion of the summit, copies of which I have had placed in the Oireachtas Library, detail the shared commitment of both parties to key international and economic objectives, notably the promotion of human rights and democracy, the fight against international crime and the strengthening of the open multilateral trading system.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>While in Japan I had the honour of an audience with Emperor Akihito and I also had a bilateral meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Hashimoto.  At the latter meeting I indicated my strong wish for an intensification of trade between Ireland and Japan.  I stressed in particular that Ireland was an ideal entry point to the European Union's market for Japanese investors.  I delivered the same message at a meeting I had with key Japanese businessmen.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the arrangements that were made to take these questions today.</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Danish Prime Minister the sensitivities of their sovereignty and the possibility of the Danes opting out of Maastricht II because of proposals relating to sovereignty and other financial issues?  They already have opt out clauses, but I understand from articles in international magazines that the Danes are concerned about these issues.  What view did the Danish Prime Minister express in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was discussed in a general way.  As the House is aware, Denmark has opt out clauses in regard to economic and monetary union, defence, citizenship and third pillar issues.  A court case has been initiated on ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Prime Minister gave me a general indication of his view on the matter, but obviously it is a matter for the Danish courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1761" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>How serious are the Danes about opting out of Maastrict II.  Is it relevant to what Chancellor Kohl said last week about Maastricht III?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there is a problem in this regard.  The Danes are not going to rely on this matter when making a decision about a new treaty.  They got opt out clauses at Maastricht, but it has not been suggested that they would seek other opt outs.  Those opt out clauses also allow them to opt in.</P>
      <P>There is not any difficulty of a general kind in regard to Danish participation in European work.  There are however, some specific constitutional precedents and political practices in Denmark &mdash; of which Members who have served on the Council of Ministers will be aware &mdash; in terms of parliamentary scrutiny of day-to-day policy making by Ministers in Denmark which does not apply in other EU countries.  The Union has accepted this for some time.  Apart from that, I am not aware of any great difficulty in this regard.  The Danes are positive contributors to the work of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred yesterday to his aim during the Presidency to achieve safer streets and to deal with the issue of crime and drug trafficking.  Given that an Irish citizen has been charged in the United Kingdom, is the Taoiseach satisfied that there are appropriate extradition laws on drug trafficking between member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would generally require notice of a question regarding the specifics of extradition legislation. Extradition works well within the European Union.  We have narrowed the area in which political motivation can be used as a means of avoiding extradition. As far as non-political offences are concerned, I am not aware of any problem in regard to extradition.  The Deputy did not give me notice of her question, but <Col N="1762" /> if she has a particular case in mind I will be glad to examine it.</P>
      <P>There is a need for more Union legislation on a number of issues, but this will be bedevilled somewhat by the fact that most of this work is done in the third pillar where there has to be consensus. It is the member states, not the Commission, that make the proposals and that is a slow process in terms of decision making.  Notwithstanding those difficulties, we are taking action during the Presidency to protect the European Union's external borders from importation of illegal drugs, crime, money laundering and precursors &mdash; chemicals used in the manufacture of drugs.  We will also introduce measures to promote a reduction in the demand for drugs, extend the role of Europol, which was brought into operation during the Italian Presidency, to include offences concerning children and we will provide for greater harmonisation of our legislation. Further work is envisaged on those issues during our Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that I did not give notice of this question. While I accept there are workable extradition arrangements between Ireland and other member states in relation to terrorist or political offences, I have been advised that similar arrangements do not exist for drug trafficking and the general category of white collar crime. That is why Irish citizens and others travel to places in the EU where they can avoid being extradited to stand trial. Will the Taoiseach ensure that workable extradition laws exist in the EU to deal with drug trafficking, organised crime, money laundering and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision in certain countries under which one cannot be extradited from one country to another for an offence that is not an offence in the original country.  That applies generally in regard to all extradition legislation.  It is known as the speciality rule, although I am not sure of the detail.  It is possible that where there are differences in legislation <Col N="1763" /> between different countries that rule may have a complicating factor in regard to extradition.  That is one of the reasons we are looking for harmonisation of penalties and laws within the EU in regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>It is difficult because in the third pillar &mdash; justice and home affairs &mdash; unanimity is required and the Commission does not have the lead role, as it has in the first pillar.  We would like to see the Commission having the lead role.  That is one of the Treaty changes we would like to see.  We would also like to see specific Treaty provision in regard to drug abuse as a competence for the EU.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's specific point on difficulties with extradition, it is a matter I will investigate and I suggest she tables a question on that topic. It will probably be answered by the Minister for Justice.  It is worth investigating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 2, in view of the similarities between Ireland and Denmark and the extensive coastlines of our countries, did the Taoiseach raise the issue of our vulnerability to drugs and, if so, what proposals, if any, are being followed in the Presidency on this issue?  I remind the Taoiseach that some years ago the Finance Ministers were working on this issue and there were proposals at the Essen Summit, in which the Danish and the Belgians were actively involved, to assist the funding of the security of vulnerable coastlines, particularly our own. Did the Taoiseach raise the issue and have there been any developments?  Is it still the intention of other European countries to assist in the funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points I made at the European Summit was that not enough money is being spent on the problem of drug abuse in the EU. About 0.1 per cent of the total EU budget is spent on this problem.  I concede that is not enough.  The Danish Prime Minister indicated to me that he strongly supported the Irish Presidency's programme in regard to drugs <Col N="1764" /> and crime.  He told me that the Danish Government would do everything it could to support us in having decisions taken.  It subsequently did so at the Justice and Home Affairs informal meeting, at which the Minister for Justice was successful in getting agreement on a number of measures.</P>
      <P>The Danish Prime Minister also adverted to the problem Deputy Bertie Ahern mentioned of our long coastlines. The problem is not the same for the two countries.  Denmark is on the Baltic Sea and a number of the Baltic countries are not EU members.  The Prime Minister indicated that there was a successful meeting recently at Visby of all the Baltic states, EU members and others, at which they considered what they could do together to deal with drug trafficking in the Baltic.</P>
      <P>We need to deal with the interdiction of drug smuggling on our Atlantic shore.  This requires action with regard to Latin America which may include agreements on alternative crops and action in the Caribbean in particular, which is an entrepôt area for drugs.  It also requires action with regard to North Africa.  I have discussed these matters with the US President, particularly with regard to Latin America.  He has expressed an interest in having an EU agreement with the US on action that can be taken to deal with drugs emanating from the Caribbean area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the European Parliament, Europol and the level of funding.  He indicated that he believed Europol should assume functions in relation to the problem of child trafficking.  Whatever the merits of that idea, the budget is inadequate even for Europol's present role. It is a new and unproven agency.  The child abduction and paedophile networks are very sophisticated as has become evident during the summer. How could Europol deal with such a complex matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it is a priority of the Irish Presidency but I am intrigued that the Taoiseach links it to Europol.  Would it <Col N="1765" /> not be better to use and to expand the existing networks to counter child abduction rather than include it in the remit of an already underfunded organisation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the existing mechanisms are being used as fully as possible to deal with the abduction of children. Europol involves new powers being given to a European-wide service. There is not a budgetary problem with Europol because, although the Europol convention has been approved by the EU it has not been ratified by the individual member states.  It does not come into effect until it has been ratified and there is no money to be spent until then. It will be ratified as quickly as possible and, as a result of the efforts of the Irish Presidency, it will be ratified with specific powers in regard to child abduction added to those previously considered. Existing measures are being used as fully as possible and will continue to be used.  Europol will give an added strength to the work.</P>

      <P>In his address to the European Parliament did the Taoiseach refer to the peace and reconciliation funds and compliment our European partners for the way in which the fund has been put together?  Will the Taoiseach comment on today's vote at the budget committee of the European Parliament where the socialist group successfully passed a motion slashing the fund from £125 million to £47 million for this year.  This will mean a dramatic reduction in the money available to the six southern Border counties.  This was apparently done on the basis that the uptake of this fund was slow.</P>

      <P>He said that the Irish <Col N="1766" /> Presidency of the EU did not fight hardest on this issue.  If the Taoiseach raised the issue of the peace and reconciliation fund, was he aware that the European colleagues of his Government partners sponsored a proposal to reduce the money for peace and reconciliation? The budget is being slashed at a time when it is most needed given the peace process is so fragile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not an immediate problem arising from this matter.  I am not in possession of a detailed report of the proceedings of the committee and I cannot say which Irish members were or were not present.  It is not really appropriate for members of the European Parliament to attempt to refer to the responsibility of another organ of the EU, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, as being responsible for decisions taken in the European Parliament.  It jealously garners to itself the power of making these decisions.  If it makes decisions of this kind one must assume it does so on its own authority and on its own account.</P>
      <P>The appropriate course of action may be to investigate why this decision was taken by the committee from the members of the committee who took the decision or the members who were not present and whose presence might have led to a different decision.  It is not feasible for me to be accountable for individual decisions of committees of the European Parliament during Question Time.  I made a general address to the Parliament on the Presidency priorities, but unfortunately that does not allow me to direct what individual committees will do.  If the Deputy has any problems he wishes to pursue with the members of that committee, he should pursue it with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that if the decision was made on the basis that there was a slow take up of the money it is a criticism of the system set up in regard to the peace and reconciliation funding of which our Government was a party in regard to <Col N="1767" /> the setting up of ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency?  On this side of the House, we have said time and again during Taoiseach's Question Time that the way the money was disbursed did not give the maximum benefit to people in Border areas.  We asked the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, on more than one occasion if moneys from the peace and reconciliation fund could be allocated to infrastructural development along the Border.  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is criticism of the manner in which the money has been handled and the fact that the budget committee of the European Parliament has withdrawn a sizeable amount of it is an indication that someone on this side of Europe has not been doing his or her job in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The truth of the matter is that there is a serious budgetary constraint in the European Union at present.  There have been increased demands for BSE compensation under the Common Agricultural Policy vote, problems in finding money for trans-European networks and there are tight budgetary constraints. Those who have to make these difficult decisions about allocating money will seek to find some explanation external to themselves.  They will not say it was their decision because they had to make a decision.  They will say that somebody else did not do something they might have done that would have made it different, even though it might not have made it different.  That is a natural human tendency in these situations.</P>

      <Col N="1769" /> The main feature of the Presidency is its involvement in the important technical drafting work of the new Treaty on which Mr. Dorr is doing an excellent job.

      <P>Regarding the conference of the representatives of the governments of the member states, convergence on the inclusion of the Petersberg tasks in the Treaty is being considered. As the Taoiseach is no doubt aware, the principal questions relate to the definition of the tasks, their location, the decision making and other rights held by partners who are not a full member of the Western European Union.  This is very important to this State in regard to the question of neutrality. Our people's deep feeling about neutrality was reflected in a recent opinion poll.  On this side of the House we have made it clear that we see a defence and police role for our forces in supporting the EU Foreign Affairs Council in a manner similar to the UN Security Council on Petersberg-type tasks such as providing relief and humanitarian aid.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that in the technical drafting work that is taking place our position on neutrality will be defended at all times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of the Government has been one of seeking to <Col N="1770" /> contribute on a case by case basis to operations of this kind and we will continue to do that.  We will do everything necessary to reserve our ability to make individual decisions in regard to matters of this nature.  We will not be bound by any situation where there is automaticity involved.  We are also taking the necessary care in the definition of the tasks to ensure that they are appropriate, but we will reserve our position in regard to participation.  However, it is important that we should be willing to participate.  It was clear from recent opinion polls that people here see a need to participate in defending our common achievement in the European Union and they seem to see that as not being inconsistent with neutrality.  There is a very interesting definition of the question in terms of public opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil led the debate on this matter with the publication of its document last November in advance of the Government's paper on this issue of participation.  It is important that the tradition of service abroad should continue.  It has developed here since the early 1960s with our work on behalf of the UN Security Council and on behalf of the EU.  We should engage in the Petersberg tasks in the provision of humanitarian aid and disaster relief, but it is important that in doing so the important line between commitment to the EU and being involved in NATO or the Western European Union is not crossed.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that that line will not be crossed in the technical work that is being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we are an observer at the Western European Union.  That decision was taken when the Deputy's party had responsibility in Government and it was the right decision.  We are involved in the Western European Union and attend every meeting of it in that capacity.  We will work in a constructive way to develop our commitment here. Obviously the Irish public expect us to <Col N="1771" /> show commitment to the defence of the values which bind the EU together. Equally, they have concerns about matters over which they have no control or do not want to be involved with.  The Government will respect that concern in its approach to the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In his discussions and statement, the Taoiseach mentioned the important question of Third World aid. He will be aware of the budgetary cuts implemented in relation to sub-Saharan Africa and the targeting of EU Third World aid to what would seem to be areas and zones of economic interest to the Union, rather than to those that require an injection of EU aid.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House he will reconsider this matter?  I do not expect him to give a detailed answer now.  Will he use his role as President of the EU to ensure that this serious redirection of funds is stopped and that the areas in greatest need, in sub-Saharan Africa or elsewhere, will be considered for aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter I specifically addressed in my State of the Union address to the European Parliament. I said that the world's population is six billion, about two billion more than when the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1958.  There will be an extra billion and a half in the world 30 years from now.  Each one of those people will have to be fed and clothed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point that whereas there are 2,800 square metres of arable land in the world producing food for every person today, by the year 2025 there will be only 1,700 square metres of arable land available because of increased population and claiming of food producing land.  Grain yields are not increasing fast enough at the moment to keep pace with population. Europe is consuming a disproportionate amount of the world's energy.  We are consuming 18 per cent of the world's energy even though we have only 7 per cent of the world's population.  On the <Col N="1772" /> other hand we are producing far more CO² per head than many other countries in the Union or in the world, which is damaging the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>It is important we are aware of the global challenge which faces us.  One of the reasons I am a strong believer in the European Union is that I believe individual nation states are too small to cope with these global challenges.  This includes the biggest nation state in the European Union.</P>

      <P>It is not impossible for the Taoiseach to reconcile the differences between the three parties in Government on this issue.  I am quoting from what the Taoiseach, Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and the Tánaiste said on the issue.  It is not in line with the Democratic Left party's position as expressed by some of its backbenchers in particular. How is that circle squared?

      <P>There is a question tabled about the Council meeting last Saturday.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the question of the Single Currency was not on the agenda on Saturday and was not discussed by the Prime Ministers? Given the turmoil in the UK on the question of a Single Currency, was it a mistake not to discuss it on Saturday at the senior level of Prime Minister? <Col N="1774" /> There is a need to make some arrangements with the UK in the event of it staying out of the currency and us going into it.  Is this a sign that Ireland does not intend to take a part in shaping this currency and in making some special arrangements for the UK and Northern Ireland?  Is it a <i>fait accompli</i> which is not to be discussed any more in case we embarrass Mr. Major?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not seem to be keeping up to date.  These issues were all disposed of at the Finance Ministers' meeting which was also held in Dublin.  All those issues, including the question of the ins, the outs and the pre-ins, were dealt with and disposed of effectively and, therefore, it was not necessary for them to be discussed at heads of Government level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.  It was not entirely disposed of. A European Single Currency is not disposed of at a meeting of Ministers of Finance.  If the Taoiseach thinks that he is greatly mistaken.  The Prime Ministers of the EU should discuss this project. What arrangements are being made, given that the UK will probably stay out?  What arrangements are being made to ensure there is no competitive devaluation with the UK?  Has the Taoiseach sought any assurances from John Major that the sterling currency will not be used to affect Irish exports, or is it not important enough for him to discuss?</P>

A report is being prepared by ECOFIN, in accordance with the long agreed programme for the second Dublin summit, where it will be dealt with and disposed of.  I expect the main lines of the decision to be taken at our second summit in Dublin will already be agreed and laid out by the Ministers for Finance on the basis of work they have done.  That work deals with all the issues to which the Deputy referred.  I do not <Col N="1775" /> think it is a good idea to discuss the currency every time we have a meeting of Prime Ministers.  We have seen examples in the past where that sort of summit hearing in regard to currency matters is far from helpful.  I think the politicisation of these sorts of decisions only creates doubt where it does not and need not exist.</P>

      <P>If they did not know the implications, then there has to be a heavy responsibility on the Government of the day of which the Deputy's party was a member.  If they did not explain the implications of the Maastricht Treaty to the people, if there was no explanation, then it was the fault of Deputy Ahern's party.  The fact of the matter was that there was a very full debate on it and, furthermore, it is clearly indicated to be the case in recent opinion polls that the Irish people support the concept of a Single Currency.</P>

      <P>In reply to Question No. 7 regarding the Taoiseach's meeting with Chancellor Kohl, did he raise the matter of the Single Currency?  Following what Deputy Brennan stated, the Bundesbank, Chancellor Kohl and, particularly, Dr. Hans Tietmeyer have made strong statements in the last week about whether the opt-outs will be allowed in respect of the Euro currency targets systems in the future.  The Heads of State made it clear, at least according to the international press, that the &ldquo;outs&rdquo; will not have access to the target system.  In his discussions with Chancellor Kohl, did the Taoiseach agree with that?  Chancellor Kohl made the suggestion here and at subsequent meetings in Germany over the weekend that a Maastricht III may be necessary to achieve true reform of the decision making procedures of the EU?  What is the Taoiseach's view on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on a number of occasions, it is the Government's view that a new national programme is desirable in view of the significant benefits which have arisen from the process to date.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) presented its opinion on the issues which a new programme should address.  The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) finalised a strategy report which sets down a framework for a new programme.  The council's recommendations and conclusions were published yesterday, in advance of the full report.  I am arranging to circulate a copy to each Deputy and Senator.</P>
      <P>The council has recommended that participation in the partnership process should be enlarged for the discussion on a new programme.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the council recommends that at the outset, all relevant parties, including Government, make opening position statements at a formal meeting for that purpose and that discussions thereafter proceed bilaterally and multilaterally, as appropriate, depending on the issues being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has accepted the Council's recommendation.  I have therefore invited appropriate key national organisations, who have formally sought to be involved in the process, to discussions in Dublin Castle on 23 October, during which they will have an opportunity to present their views and priorities for a new programme in the light of the NESC analysis and the opinion of the NESF.  Details of these <Col N="1782" /> discussions were agreed yesterday by the Government.</P>
    <P>The role and composition of the central review committee and its relationship with other bodies under a new national programme will be settled in the course of discussion on a new programme. Negotiations on pay and related matters will be undertaken by those organisations which have an established role in pay and industrial relations matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What role will ISME and the other social partner groups play in the talks process?  I am talking about the INOU, ISME and any other bodies which have made representations to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>ISME and the other bodies referred to by the Deputy are invited to the committee meeting on 23 October.  Discussions thereafter on matters related to the programme will involve all the participants as appropriate depending on the subject matter under discussion.  Negotiations on pay and related matters will be undertaken by those organisations that have an established role in pay and industrial relations matters.  The Central Review Committee, will come into operation only after the programme has been agreed.  The question of who will be involved in the review is a matter for discussion in negotiation of the agreement. No pre-ordained position is taken on that matter.  Submissions may be made by all participants in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify what will happen on 23 October? Various bodies including ISME and INOU will be invited to set out their stalls, as it were.  Will ISME, for example, be involved in pay negotiations or negotiations relating to the tax regime that operates in this economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards pay negotiations, the bodies involved will be <Col N="1783" /> those normally involved in pay negotiations, and that does not include ISME.  It will, however, be enabled to make a submission on other matters at the meeting on 23 October and discussions thereafter on the basis of that submission, which may include its views on tax matters, will be the subject of bilateral and multilateral discussions as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that at a time when he is endeavouring to bring about a new national agreement it is most unfortunate that Bus Éireann is attempting to bring in changes in a unilateral way and, more importantly, that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications sanctions such change?  Will he accept that is a wrong signal at a time when he should deal with the trade union movement on a partnership basis?  The Taoiseach tried to deflect responsibility for this matter yesterday by giving a lecture on public administration.  I remind him that the Minister sanctions such changes, which is very dangerous.  Will the Taoiseach accept there is tremendous unrest, particularly in the transport area between Bus Éireann and CIE unions, and it is wrong of the Government to make these signals to that movement at a time when we are trying to bring in a new national agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept the arrangements in place for the <Col N="1784" /><i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discriminate in favour of public sector workers?  Will he accept that many of IBEC's employer organisations are semi-State companies and that the only organisation that represents the private sector, which is a key component in the economy, is not represented in the negotiations?  Does he accept that we need to adopt a more inclusive approach to pay and tax negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>IBEC represents the private sector and some public sector employers who behave in a commercial way.  It is a body that represents enterprise, largely private sector enterprise.  In addition, farming organisations represent the private rather than the public sector.  We debated this matter here before at great length and there are arguments for including additional bodies on the Central Review Committee. I have said, and I adhere to this, that I will not change the Central Review Committee arrangements for the existing programme, but if a new programme is agreed there will be a review of arrangements.  On 23 October all parties to the discussions will be free to make submissions on who they regard as the appropriate people to be involved in the Central Review Committee or in sectoral review committees as may be set up under any new programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of talks for a national wage agreement, what is the Government's policy on the inclusion of a local bargaining clause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that is best dealt with by negotiation.  In the existing agreement arrangements there is some margin for local bargaining.  As to the content of a future agreement, in <Col N="1785" /> the first instance in regard to the private sector, that is a matter for private sector employers and unions representing private sector workers to discuss and agree.  As far as the Government is concerned, it is a different question in that there is not the same local character in regard to public sector pay issues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate for the Government at this stage of negotiations when matters are being opened up for discussion to say in a prescriptive way what its policy is.  It is important that people address the issues rather than address themselves to whether they agree or disagree with the Government.  In these cases there is always a way of avoiding the issues by saying one does not agree with the Government.  It is better not to adopt that approach but to allow the parties to address the question of whether that should be provided for.  There will be ample opportunity for a full discussion on that matter in the negotiations that will be initiated after 23 October.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the outgoing agreement the Government agreed to arrangements that allowed for additional payments for restructuring. That is not local bargaining in the strict sense of the term, unless each category of employment is considered to be a locality.  It is not a geographically local bargaining provision and is not firm specific; it is specific to types of employment where there are particular forms of restructuring.  Generally speaking it is best to seek to encompass all these matters in a global provision because the global provision must be met by the Government within the criteria laid down for public spending, taxation and <Col N="1786" /> borrowing under the economic and monetary union criteria.  It is very important that we do not place ourselves in a position where anything we might agree to in the industrial relations sector would create difficulties for the obligations we have under the treaty on the question of adhering to the requirements of economic and monetary union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

That is a matter about which I feel very strongly and I have discussed it with IBEC.  Will the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> deal with labour costs and labour regulation in the Irish market?  Will the Taoiseach accept that we are losing out to places like Scotland and Wales because of our high labour costs?  Will he further accept that workers in those countries are better off, even though labour costs are lower? This week a Hyundai plant was lost to Scotland.  Scottish workers are better off, yet labour costs there are lower. Will the Taoiseach accept that if we are to maintain jobs in companies like Semperit and Packard Electric and get new labour intensive investments into this economy we must become more competitive?</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney should have a word with Deputy Michael McDowell because he was at a meeting of the Small Firms Association which I also attended but which seems to Deputy Harney not worth mentioning. It is an organisation which recently attracted a large attendance of small business people in the private sector. It is plainly not true to suggest, as Deputy Harney did, that the only representative of the small business sector is ISME.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the failure of the Government Committee on Sellafield to meet once in the past year in view of the fact that he is Chairman of this committee.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17856/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministerial Group on Sellafield and the Irish Sea met on three occasions in 1995 and established the parameters for a comprehensive strategy to deal with all potential sources of radioactivity which could affect the Irish public and environment.</P>
      <P>The functions and responsibilities of individual Ministers in relation to nuclear matters have not been altered in any way because of the existence of the committee.  Ministers and Departments concerned continue to advance the measures for which they are responsible within the parameters established by the group and in consultation, as necessary, with other Ministers and Departments.</P>
      <P>The ministerial group has played its part in bringing about the present situation whereby nuclear matters are receiving an unprecedented level of attention. To demonstrate this, I propose to mention a number of the specific measures and steps which have been taken.</P>
      <P>The safety of the British nuclear industry generally and of Sellafield, the THORP reprocessing plant and magnox reactors, in particular, and the continuing threat they pose to the health and safety of Irish people and our environment is still a cause for concern.  The Government is continuing to pursue its concerns in this regard with the UK authorities and has called for the early de-commissioning of magnox reactors which are now operating beyond their design life.  As Minister for the Environment, I have availed of all opportunities to raise these concerns at bilateral, EU and wider international level. For its part, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has requested the European Commission to carry out inspections and verification of the radioactive monitoring facilities at magnox reactors in the UK under Article 35 of the EURATOM Treaty so as to ensure that they are in compliance with EU standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> Ireland's concerns in relation to nuclear power and, in particular, the safety of the British nuclear industry and the reprocessing of, and transport and storage of nuclear materials was raised at the International Atomic Energy Agency's annual general conference held in Vienna last month. Ireland has urged that the entire question of reprocessing and management of surplus plutonium stocks should be examined urgently.</P>
    <P>Ireland has opposed the proposed development of a rock characterisation facility at Sellafield, preliminary to the construction by NIREX of an underground nuclear waste storage facility. Last January, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications made a submission on behalf of the Government to the public inquiry in the UK which is investigating the proposed facility.  The submission outlined the Government's concerns and called on the inquiry to recommend against the NIREX proposal.</P>
    <P>The possibilities for legal action against the Sellafield/THORP facilities are under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A judgement which may be significant in this regard is awaited from the Supreme Court.  Consideration is also being given to the scope for action under the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from land-based sources and the more recent OSPAR Convention which Ireland will ratify this year.  The Government remains committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sustainable case for it can be shown to exist based on sufficient evidence of environmental or public health impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of a review and update of the EURATOM Treaty so as to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects is also being pursued. To this end, the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications <Col N="1790" /> and Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the other Departments represented on the ministerial group, prepared a discussion document which has been submitted by the Irish delegation at the current Intergovernmental Conference for consideration in the context of the revised European Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>An initiative has been taken by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, within the International Maritime Organisation, seeking to strengthen the code of practice governing the carriage by sea of irradiated nuclear fuels.  An Irish resolution seeking to have matters covered by the present code extended so as to cater for route planning, advance notification of shipments to coastal states, contingency arrangements in the event of emergencies and other appropriate considerations was accepted by the IMO and is being addressed by that organisation's Marine Safety and Marine Environmental Protection Committee.</P>
    <P>Requests have been made to the Oslo-Paris Commissions and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD to undertake a thorough technical review and assessment of both the reprocessing of non-reprocessing options for spent nuclear fuel management, as well as their impact on radioactive discharges into the marine environment. Work is well under way on these matters.</P>
    <P>Ireland ratified the Nuclear Safety Convention in July 1996 and efforts have been made to have all members states of the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency do so as soon as possible.  In addition, Ireland has actively promoted a new global Convention on Nuclear Waste Management on which negotiations are proceeding in Vienna.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the account I have given that relevant Ministers and their Departments are continuing to make significant progress on the basis of a comprehensive strategy established with the assistance of the ministerial group. While there are no particular difficulties or considerations arising at this time <Col N="1791" /> which would warrant an early meeting of the group, I constantly keep that suggestion under consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Minister set up the committee if it does not bother to meet.  It seems to be against the whole trend of what we expected and of what the Government promised when it took office.  Under the Programme for Government the Minister said this would be given priority. The Minister said he would set up a committee which would work tirelessly but if the committee is not meeting I do not know why he set it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any further information concerning media reports that BNFL is looking for an increase of discharges from Sellafield?  In his reply the Minister said the scope for action under the Paris Convention would be looked at.  What scope for action?  What is happening there?</P>
      <P>Is it not time for the Government to back the four residents of Dundalk who are taking action?  The Government should at least indemnify them for costs in case they run into difficulty.  These are four private individuals and they should receive the Government's support to ensure they do not run into huge legal costs.</P>
      <P>We have been waiting two years for the Attorney General to tell us whether there is a case.  I know the Attorney General's office has received much bad publicity over the last few years but it seems extraordinary to have to wait two years for an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee was established by the Government on my <Col N="1792" /> initiative because much individual work needed to be co-ordinated so that everybody knew what was happening.  The object of setting up the committee was to establish a work programme for the Government as a whole, not for the committee to undertake the job that is proper to each individual Department but to co-ordinate.  We met primarily to draw up that action programme which is ready.</P>
      <P>I have answered parliamentary questions about its contents previously and I will happily do so again.  It is a matter for each individual Minister and agency to operate it.  This is happening with constant reference back to me as chairman of the committee.  I do not engage in meetings for the sake of it.  Even in a disparaging way and with the most jaundiced of views, the Deputy will have to accept that my comprehensive response indicates a busy action programme and shows that the Government is taking every possible initiative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not only to voice our total opposition to the entire nuclear industry in the United Kingdom but, much more important, to advance our case in every international forum available to us.</P>
      <P>Under the current Intergovernmental Conference process we are looking for a EURATOM Treaty amendment.  I have been directly involved in some of the negotiations, and widespread support is not forthcoming from many of our EU partners.  This cannot be done unilaterally but at every opportunity every member of the Government says the same thing: that we want much more stringent standards and monitoring and, in particular, the older and out-of-date magnox reactors in the United Kingdom closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked a number of specific questions.  We will oppose to the best of our ability any additional discharges from any nuclear facility in the <Col N="1793" /> United Kingdom.  Any legal avenue open to us to voice our opposition will be taken.</P>
    <P>On the Dundalk case, in January the Supreme Court reserved judgment.  We await its decision.  I have no control over its timing but, as the Deputy knows, there have been informal discussions between counsel for the State and counsel for the people directly involved.  We have put no impediment in their way in advancing their case.</P>
    <P>On the role of the Attorney General in crystallising a case for the State we need empirical data which stands up.</P>

      <P>When Minister for Health, I established for the first time a national cancer register with the result that there are now data available, for example, on the incidence of cancer and cancer clusters.  It takes time to compile convincing epidemiological evidence.  I have also had bilateral discussions with my colleague in Northern Ireland on conducting a study&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One needs to conduct an epidemiological survey of the entire country to make comparisons.  One cannot say that the incidence of cancer on the east coast or in Louth is high unless one can make comparisons.  One needs sufficient time to do this.</P>
      <P>I would welcome any suggestions the Deputy may have in relation to other action the Government could take.  This is a national endeavour on which all parties agree we must work.  I regard it as a priority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Bill announced by the Government on 9 July to address the problem of anit-social behavour in local authority housing areas is being drafted as a matter of urgency and will be presented to the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to extend the measures in the Bill to private housing, including housing which may have been sold under tenant purchase arrangements. It is envisaged, however, that the legislation will provide discretion, in certain circumstances, for health boards to refuse or withdraw assistance under the SWA scheme in respect of rent or mortgage costs of private housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's reply in relation to tenant purchasers.  If a local authority sells a house to a tenant it will retain an interest in it for ten to 15 years even if it changes hands four or five times in the intervening period.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the matter again before she brings forward the legislation, otherwise everybody will start pretending that they are living in a private house.  I can think of areas within my constituency where major problems are being encountered.  On barring orders, can one be barred from a particular house, road or entire suburb?  Some of the people concerned are very mobile.  If it is a question of barring a tenant from a <Col N="1795" /> particular house people will start pretending that they are living in the house next door.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider as such narrow legislation will not resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>These measures are part of an overall strategy to bring about better estate management.  They are the result of considerable consultation, particularly with Dublin Corporation which has problems in dealing with anti-social behaviour related to drug dealing.  The Deputy is <i>au fait</i> with this.  Drug dealing is largely concentrated in local authority estates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are seeking improved powers to deal with this issue.  In many cases it would be more appropriate to seek an excluding order than the eviction of an entire family.</P>
      <P>In relation to tenant purchasers, where somebody applies to buy a house under the tenant purchase scheme the local authority will have discretion to ensure that a drug dealer who simply wants to open up shop will not be able to do so.  The Deputy should be aware that there are certain rights attaching to private property and that a local authority will not own a property once it is sold off.  It is extremely important where an approach is made to acquire a house under the tenant purchase scheme that a local authority should have the power to refuse, if necessary.  They will be given this power.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 50, 60, 71 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative by the Irish Business Against Litter Group, IBAL, in commissioning a further attitude survey on litter.  This complements both an earlier IBAL attitude survey and a detailed assessment published by my Department on the composition and incidence of litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now possess detailed information on the nature and extent of litter pollution and of its negative effects on <Col N="1797" /> Ireland's outdoor environment.  This clearer evidence reinforces my determination to maintain and build on the Action Against Litter initiative which I launched earlier this year.</P>
    <P>A provision of £400,000 has been made in my Department's Vote for this initiative in 1996.  Of this, an estimated £325,000 is being expended to promote a multi-media campaign directed at increasing public awareness of the harmful and polluting effects of litter.  I <Col N="1798" /> am fully satisfied that the public awareness campaign is justified and well targeted and that it represents good value for money relative to the major costs being home borne by local authorities to remedy the effects of litter.</P>
    <P>Information on the numbers of on-the-spot fines issued by local authorities in the period from 1992 to 1995 is set out in a table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Information in respect of 1996 will be compiled early next year.</P>

      <P>The Minister embarked on an anti-litter TV campaign some months ago at a cost of approximately £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the amount expended on the campaign to date.  Will the Minister accept that the findings of the survey carried out by the group, Irish Business Against Litter, confirm that the campaign has been a total failure, that there has not been any <Col N="1801" /> improvement in the litter problem since it was embarked upon and that 77 per cent of the people surveyed stated that what was needed to address the problem was stronger legislation that would be fully enforced?  Will the Minister further accept, even at this late stage, that a carrot and stick approach is needed involving a publicity campaign running simultaneously with newly enacted and properly enforced legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is paraphrasing the replies I gave to questions on litter during my previous Question Time.  Deputy Quill knows I am fully committed to two approaches.  I would be here listening to the Deputy's criticism of being lax and not having an education campaign if I had not embarked on it.  We have adopted various approaches in relation to litter.  We launched the first major anti-litter campaign, mobilised business with the excellent co-operation of IBEC and the establishment of IBAL.  There has been direct contact with local authorities which are now drawing up their own local litter abatement strategy &mdash; 30 local authorities have already put that in place.  The promised Litter (Amendment) Bill will be introduced in this session and I have already listed its beneficial effects.  We have distributed to every primary and secondary school an anti-litter kit.  This amounts to a multifaceted campaign.  I do not expect that a few advertisements on television, posters or education initiatives will solve this problem in a month or a week.  When I launched the campaign I said we have to fundamentally change the attitude of a minority of people and that will require an ongoing, consistent and persistent campaign.  Ultimately, however, we need a carrot and stick approach, exhortation and education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said the campaign was well targeted but on two occasions in the past two weeks, following &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; at 11.30 p.m., the anti-litter advertisement was broadcast.  Is it the Minister's information that those of us who watch &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; are the citizens who throw litter on the streets, put refuse in unauthorised places and who generally despoil our country?  Is that what the Minister calls a well targeted campaign or is that his information?</P>

      <P>I have not expended money on individual research of the psychological profile of litterers but it is something I may consider.  I do not think there is such a thing as a &ldquo;character&rdquo;. Should the advertisement be broadcast following some other programme? The reality is that it is broadcast following a variety of programmes. People who watch &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; might drop litter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in reply to previous questions on this subject, waste incineration is used extensively within the OECD <Col N="1804" /> countries and is regulated by a number of EU directives.  Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the licensing of waste incineration activities on the basis of best practicable standards, including relevant EU requirements.  Licences for both industrial and hospital waste incineration have been granted by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency, are at present participating in an interdepartmental committee established by the Government to consider incineration as a possible option to deal with certain animal waste materials from the meat industry and agriculture.  The establishment of such a committee is not in conflict with policy decisions already announced and being implemented in relation to the separate streams of health care wastes.  The report of the committee will be presented to the Government in due course and a decision will then be made on the best disposal option for the animal wastes concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for facilitating me and I thank the Minister for his reply. With due respect to the Minister, he is speaking out of both sides of his mouth in relation to incineration.  Before the summer recess the Government set up a Cabinet sub-committee, consisting of the Ministers for Health, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Environment, to examine the feasibility of a national incinerator to destroy BSE infected offal.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has said incineration is the most viable option. Some weeks later on the &ldquo;Davis&rdquo; television programme, the Minister said his policy was against incineration.  There is total confusion on the whole question of incineration.  Will the Minister give the House a clear statement on whether the Government is for or against incineration or if it is an option being considered for future waste management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1805" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated previously on many occasions in this House that I do not have a closed mind to the option of incineration &mdash; the Official Report will show that.  I said previously, from my time in the Department of Health, that I wanted various options for the health stream waste which contains a degree of infectious materials that need to be treated in different ways.  Many industrial plans across the country have been licensed for incineration and that is carried on in a safe and acceptable way. The committee established by the Government to examine the disposal of possible infected meat may decide that incineration is the best environmental option, and I do not have a closed view on that either.  The long-term strategy in relation to waste disposal will have to be addressed with an open mind, and I do not have a closed mind on the various technologies now in place and available.  The best solution to waste management in the future may be a variety of different options.</P>

    <Title>Dail Reform: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion.</P>
    <P>(1)  That, in respect of the First Report of the sub-Committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Reform of Dáil Procedure (T. 291) dated 19th June, 1996, and with effect from Tuesday, 15th October, 1996&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was dealing with matters on which many Members have spoken freely.  I am delighted they have done so because Governments have not improved the facilities here.  I do not blame the Civil Service because Governments decide what they will do just as they decide other matters.  To set the record straight, it is 16 years since any refurbishment was carried out in the Dáil bars.  What room in any household would last 16 years without some kind of refurbishment?  Money is being well spent now.  When foreign members of Parliament visit here we will have a respectable place to bring them.</P>
      <P>No one would deny that the improvements in Government Buildings are a credit to the country.  It was the Government of the day who decided to carry out that work, and the work at Dublin Castle and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. We had to fight hard for improvements in this House and it is a pity we did not have the courage to do more.  I was part of the committee that had to do that and, with the Members of the committee and the party Whips, I did that fairly and honestly.  If we are to be a modern Oireachtas and move with the times, we must be prepared to provide proper facilities.  There seems to be no problem finding money to pay lawyers to work for the State &mdash; I do not know how it can be said that there are people in this country who are entitled to £2,000 a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspapers say that Deputies and Senators are not entitled to a penny <Col N="1895" /> extra a mile, but we never ask questions about their pay or subsistence rates.  I do not begrudge them, but I do not like backhanded remarks.  The Members I have known in this House for many years have all been honourable people doing the best they can.</P>
    <P>There are 22 committees operating here, and I cannot see why we should have so many; ten would be enough. Many committees have to adjourn because they do not have a quorum and Members must go from one committee to another to make up a quorum so that meetings can commence.  Of the 22 committees the Opposition have only three chairpersons.  Deputies can make what they like of that.  There are far too many committees and this is seen by many as a way of handing out jobs in an effort to please some people, but it does not please others.</P>
    <P>During the Bord na Móna saga the chairman of the committee read out a statement which, as far as I know, came from the Ceann Comhairle's office stating that we should be careful about what we said at the committee because there were doubts about privilege.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us if there is a doubt about privilege in speaking at committees.  That should be cleared up because there were many questions Members across the political divide wanted to ask but could not because they interpreted that four page statement as meaning that privilege did not apply at the committee in the same way as it does here.</P>
    <P>If that is the case it should be rectified. The semi-States live in a world of their own but when anything goes wrong and they are short of money, they come to the politicians and the Government of the day to bail them out.  Questions tabled about them are ruled out of order as not being the responsibility of the Minister but when anything goes wrong the Minister and the Oireachtas is responsible and must give subventions on behalf of the taxpayers.  I am pleased we are making progress but I would like to see more progress being made.  I hope the Government will have the courage <Col N="1896" /> to improve facilities for all Members to put us on a sound operating basis.  In the long run the public will appreciate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the package of proposals from the Government Chief Whip is intended to make the Dáil more effective and relevant. However, frequent Dáil reforms in the last number of years have made the Dáil less effective, less relevant, less reported and more boring than ever before.  All of the boredom and the irrelevancies cannot be attributed to Dáil reform. The all-party consensus on almost everything, although it has plus points, certainly contributes to the general torpor. However, the way the Dáil and its committees are organised has contributed to a diffusion of focus which has reduced the accountability of the Government, reduced the reporting of Dáil proceedings and at the same time is exhausting Dáil Deputies.</P>
      <P>Apart from the committee structures being half-hearted and ill-considered they are chronically under resourced. The worst feature of Dáil life today is the excessively tight whipping system through which all different or new ideas are siphoned.  This creates an atmosphere in which Deputies are discouraged from researching and expressing their own ideas.  The irony is that all tranches of Dáil reform have been instigated by the Government Chief Whip whose overriding concern is to protect the Government.  It is not surprising therefore that the sum total of Dáil reform has had a comatose effect on the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven Deputies in the Chamber now, not even a quorum. Scarcely, if ever, is there a quorum in the House.  The Taoiseach's Question Time today was a case in point.  There <Col N="1897" /> was not one single Government backbencher in the House and there was not a quorum.  There was a time when because of the incisiveness of the Opposition it was always necessary to have Government Deputies present in large numbers to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the Taoiseach or the Minister, who was answering questions. In turn, the number of Opposition Deputies present was always significantly higher than it is today.</P>
    <P>Overall changes in Question Time whereby a Minister responds only once a month for a fixed period has deadened Question Time.  Priority Questions, ruling out supplementaries from other Deputies has been a significant backward step when it was supposed to achieve the opposite result.  Every day the Dáil sits, it causes a scandal among voters who watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; as boring speech after boring speech is delivered to an arena of empty seats. Most voters think we are on holidays all the time.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention is that Estimates are being nodded through.  A cursory consideration of the Estimates in a few hours is the best we can expect and frequently the Minister responsible for a Department does not sit through the Estimates.  This was unheard of many years ago.  Worse still, many Estimates which involve spending hundreds of millions of pounds are nodded through here without debate.  Is it any wonder there are scandals such as the Blood Transfusion Service Board scandal and the beef scandal?  Wholesale reform is needed and it cannot commence until there is an all-party review of the whipping system.  Without it the balance of power between parliament and the Executive will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the Dáil is to hold the Government to account.  The English version of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  The word used in the Irish version of the Constitution is &ldquo;freagrach&rdquo;&mdash; answerable.  If the Dáil is so tightly controlled under <Col N="1898" /> the whipping system by the Government which is supposed to be answerable to it, it is easy to understand why dullness and mediocrity is the order of the day.</P>
    <P>In considering the terms of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witnesses) Bill senior counsel with raised eyebrows advised the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, of which I am the chairperson on the constitutional propriety of what is proposed and on existing mechanisms and procedures.</P>
    <P>On resources available to committees and the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas depends on the Government for resources.  Committees are frustrated in holding the Government to account because the Government will not approve the expenditure required by committees. Other parliaments have what is called an ear marked vote where a certain proportion of the total national budget is ear marked for parliament, under parliament's control alone and not subject to the sanction of the Executive and the Minister for Finance.  This is a fundamental requirement and it should be considered.</P>
    <P>The ultimate enactment of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witness) Bill, is urgent even though it is clear from the consideration given to it by my committee that many substantial amendments will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The committee system needs an urgent overhaul.  We have at least seven House committees: the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Broadcasting Committee, the Joint Services Committee, the Liaison Committee etc., all of which should be abolished and replaced by two committees: a committee on procedure and privileges and a Houses of the Oireachtas committee that would deal with services, broadcasting etc.  All other committees, with the exception of the Committee of Public Accounts, should be abolished and <Col N="1899" /> replaced by 14 portfolio committees each one of which would shadow a member of the Cabinet, other than the Taoiseach and each member of the Cabinet would report to the relevant committee in respect of all his obligations and answer questions other than Special Notice Questions.  Ministers would also be required to introduce the Estimates for their Departments in these portfolio committees so that they could be considered in detail in advance of the financial year to which they relate.</P>
    <P>No Deputy should be a member of more than one committee.  At present we have to endure the spectacle of Deputies running from one committee to another in an effort to contribute adequately to both but failing to do so. We also see them running across the road from a committee to the Dáil which meets at the same time.  This leads to a diffusion in focus.  The Dáil should not meet in plenary session as the same time as committees.  We should so organise our business that committees meet for a few hours in the morning and the Dáil meets in plenary session for no more than four hours in any one day, thereby allowing committees to resume after the plenary session is completed.  The long-winded Order of Business and Taoiseach's Question Time on Tuesday and Wednesday should be merged so that there is a half hour for questions to the Taoiseach at the commencement of the plenary session of the Dáil.  This streamlining of business would greatly increase the effectiveness of the Dáil and improve the use of time by Deputies.</P>
    <P>As I said, no Deputy should be a member of more than one portfolio committee.  If I have done my arithmetic correctly, each of the 14 committees would have nine members, excluding officeholders.  I do not have time to develop these points in detail but I hope to have an opportunity to do so in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>We can tinker around with Dáil reform, Standing Orders and <Col N="1900" /> various procedures but there will not be much improvement until such time as there is a fundamental change in the manner in which Deputies are elected. As long as we operate the single transferable vote system in multi-seat constituencies, our form of PR, then Deputies will be mainly constituency workers.  Unless Deputies devote 90-95 per cent of their long working week to constituency work they will not be re-elected. What is the point of being an excellent legislator and wonderful parliamentarian if one cannot attend Parliament? The public have been asked twice by way of referenda to change the system of voting but they have turned it down on both occasions.  They like the PR system.  As long as this is put to them as a single issue they will never agree to change it and perhaps it could be made part of a package.  I am very sorry it is not part of the brief of the constitutional review committee.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem with the Dáil in so far as the transaction of business and its perception are concerned is the lack of a clear-cut system for raising important developments as soon as they occur.  We had an example of this on the Order of Business this morning and nobody can be too happy with the way it was resolved.  Every morning we have a programmed farce whereby Deputies, responsible politicians, party leaders and party spokespersons seek to raise important matters under the guise or pretence of promised legislation.  This is demeaning to the Dáil, embarrassing for the politicians involved and unfair to the Opposition.  It should be possible to raise important matters on the floor of the House in the same way as they are raised in every other democracy.  There should be no great mystery about this. The existing system was devised as a defensive mechanism by past Governments and wholeheartedly embraced by successive Governments.  Something must be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant improvement in recent years was the setting up of the <Col N="1901" /> improved and enlarged committee system. However, the system is not working and is a failure.  I would even go so far as to say it is a disaster.  This goes back to the burden of constituency work.  No Deputy can devote two days each week to committee work at the expense of constituency work.  I am a member of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs which has carried out excellent work on prebudget submissions.  It should be possible for us to be present at the committee all the time so that we can distil the wisdom within it and present it to the Minister.  However, we cannot do this as we have to look after our constituencies in order to ensure we will be re-elected. The committee system will be doomed unless the number of members is reduced or more time is made available.</P>
    <P>The most necessary improvement is electoral reform, which we will not get, but there are other improvements which can be introduced immediately.  The first improvement I would recommend is that every Deputy should have a full-time researcher in addition to a secretary. This would make an enormous difference as far as the burden of work is concerned.  I have been a Deputy for 16 years and I can remember only one occasion when I was satisfied with the level of research I carried out on a speech &mdash; I visited the National Library and other libraries and carried out much work on it.  If Deputies had researchers available to them it would greatly improve the system.</P>
    <P>Another improvement would be to give Deputies adequate pay for the work they do.  As the larger parties have discovered in the past few weeks, it is difficult to find candidates of the necessary calibre to fight an election because of the costs involved.  If we do not deal with the issue of pay this will continue to be a problem.</P>
    <P>It is important that we also improve facilities.  If we continue to treat ourselves as second rate members of Parliament who can blame the public for treating us as such?  We are entitled to <Col N="1902" /> improved facilities and we should make no apologies to anyone for having all the necessary facilities.</P>

      <P>I welcome the report of the committee.  If its recommendations are adopted a small number of minor improvements will be effected.  I commend those who put a good deal of work into bringing the report before the House.  I am at one with other speakers on the need for real and fundamental root and branch reform of the House.  I only have time to deal with this reform under one heading, that is the way in which questions are dealt with in the House and taken or not taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>During my ten years as a Member of the House.  I have witnessed a steady erosion of my role and function as a backbencher.  The position is worse now than it has been at any time during the previous ten years.  One of my functions as a Deputy is make the Government accountable and answerable to the Dáil in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  However, if I ask a question about an element of the national roads programme it is disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle and I am told it is a matter for the National Roads Authority. If I ask a question about the Blackpool by-pass in my constituency I will not get an answer.  The National Roads Authority has an annual budget of approximately £200 million.  This is taxpayers' money, yet that body is not accountable or answerable to this House for the manner in which it spends its funding or orders its priorities.  Is that accountability?  Where does it leave people like me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation arose in my constituency regarding a new scheme initiated by the Minister for Education entitled <i>Breaking the Cycle.</i> When I attempted to ask the Minister the basis <Col N="1903" /> on which certain schools were chosen for inclusion on that scheme and others were excluded, I was informed that it is not the Minister's responsibility, she has no function in the matter and decisions of that nature are carried out by the education research group based in Drumcondra.  There is no accountability to me on that issue.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I tabled a priority question to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht regarding the withdrawal of UTV from the consortium that was to make up TV3.  The question was disallowed on the basis that it was a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  There was no accountability for that issue in this House.  I tabled another question to the same Minister yesterday regarding whether he would make a subvention to RTE to enable it to host the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest in Ireland.  The question was again disallowed because the Minister has no official responsibility in the Dáil in relation to the matter. The responsibility lies with RTE.  I tabled a third question about a proposal the Minister mooted in the context of his releasing the Green Paper on Broadcasting. Part of that proposal involved moving Network 2 out of Dublin and to establish it as a publisher-broadcaster similar to Channel 4 in Great Britain.  I inquired when, how or if that will be done but the question was again disallowed. The explanation given was that &ldquo;The Minister has no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to this matter which is one for the RTE Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This has happened in connection with every other Department.  It also occurred in relation to the responsibility of the Blood Transfusion Services Board and accountability for the actions of that board in this House.  The same answer is repeated time and again and we are informed that the Minister in question has no responsibility to the Dáil.  If the cumulative effect of this is not to erode the function, role and what ought to be the responsibility of the Dáil, I do not know what is.  Unless we <Col N="1904" /> can remedy and rectify these matters, put in place accountability and oblige Ministers to enter the House and provide answers to the Opposition or to backbenchers of any party regarding bodies which are spending vast sums of taxpayers' money, the Dáil will become a talking shop.</P>
    <P>One of the most demoralising things which has occurred since I became a Deputy is that I cannot obtain essential information regarding the way decisions are arrived at.  That has eroded the role and function of this House.  This Government stands condemned.  I had enormous expectation that there was a certain reforming zeal in the present Taoiseach when he was in Opposition.  I expected that we would bring about real Dáil reform and reclaim the respect of the electorate for this House and its Members as a result.  I also believed we could engage the enthusiasm of backbenchers and reassert the rightful position of the Dáil as a place which makes Government answerable.  To date, we have failed to do so.  I ask that my comments will be taken into account when further reforms are being contemplated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for affording me the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.  I propose to share time with Deputy Browne.  One requires at least 15 to 20 minutes to tease out and develop the different points which must be considered in relation to this important motion.  During the morning session I had the opportunity to listen to many of the contributions which were very worthy and touched upon relevant points. However, the most telling contribution was made by Deputy Nealon.  The competitive position that obtains within the multi-seat constituencies and the electoral system dictates and determines the role of Members of this House.  That is the reality.  As Deputy Nealon correctly stated, unless Members are prepared to devote the necessary time to constituency work on a daily basis of 12 to 14 hours they will not be returned at the subsequent election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> I do not make these observations by way of complaint but by way of analysis of the motion under discussion.  There is not enough time available for Members to spend on research, deliberation and checking every issue necessary to making a worthwhile contribution.  Consequently, the quality of contribution suffers.</P>
    <P>I wish to consider the issue of Question Time.  New arrangements have been put in place regarding priority questions.  Effectively, this minimises the time available to ordinary backbenchers on all sides of the House for tabling questions.  There is a need to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to the accountability of the semi-State sector and the fact that parliamentary questions have been ruled out of order because Ministers claim they have no responsibility.  That is not good enough. Billions of pounds are being spent yearly by the semi-State sector and there is a need to have a direct political responsibility at Question Time in the House.  That matter must be addressed. I am sorry that I do not have more time to develop these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputies Quill and Kirk for sharing time.  It is somewhat ridiculous that, in discussing Dáil reform, we are confined to three or four minutes per contribution. Approximately 4 hours 30 minutes have been spent on a debate to which perhaps 130 to 140 Deputies might wish to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a Member of this Houses for almost 14 years.  Despite the fact that there has been some Dáil reform in the past, the House has become more irrelevant than ever to the outside world. For example, Irish Ferries are threatening to pull out of Rosslare for the winter months with a consequent loss of between 200 to 400 jobs.  However, if I want to raise that issue on the Order of Business tomorrow, I will be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle and directed to find a more suitable time to <Col N="1906" /> raise it.  That is the most important issue to the people of County Wexford and the rest of the country at present but I cannot raise the issue and request that it be debated immediately.  I must raise the matter on the Adjournment of the House or at Question Time a week to ten days after it arose.</P>
    <P>Salaries, the committee structures, facilities, staffing levels and research are areas which affect Members.  We are to blame for the fact that adequate facilities are not in place.  We have run from the media and criticism.  We have been afraid to bite the bullet and provide proper and adequate facilities.  In the time available I wish to comment on the issue of facilities.  With other Deputies, I am based in the old engineering block which we also call &ldquo;the bunker&rdquo;.  This is a dark and dismal dungeon where Members are completely isolated from the daily operations of the House. Deputies and secretaries are cluttered up in a building which is an absolute disgrace. The rooms are far too small.  The sheepdog I keep at home has more space to run around than is available to Deputies and secretaries in the engineering block.  Entry to the building is through a long glass tunnel which is more suitable for growing tomatoes or flowers than access to Dáil facilities. There is no wheelchair access to the building.  It is amazing how it passes the fire officer's annual inspection.</P>
    <P>If there were a fire in my office, which is on the bottom floor, I do not know how staff would get out.  Members are there only two days a week, but our secretaries work there five days a week in deplorable conditions.  I invite the Minister of State to visit the building to see the disgraceful conditions in which Members have to work.  Something should be done quickly to provide more suitable offices for secretaries and Members.  Those working in the private sector or elsewhere in the public sector would not accept similar conditions.</P>
    <P>Members in three or four seat constituencies have a heavy workload, but I come from a five seat constituency and I have only one secretary and do not <Col N="1907" /> have a research officer.  If Members do not fulfil their constituency duties, they do not get re-elected.  We must provide more staff for Members so they can give the people they represent a proper service.</P>
    <P>We have failed to reform the Dáil. We set up committees to pretend to the public and the media that we are here on a more regular basis.  I am a member of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and I seldom, if ever, attend meetings of that committee other than when a vote is taking place.  There are three Ministers in my constituency with all the necessary backup facilities, but I find it almost impossible to attend committee meetings and carry out my constituency work.  I have no difficulty with large amounts of money being spent on improving the bar or restaurant facilities, if the offices in which Members operate are also upgraded.  It is deplorable that a section of our Houses of Parliament is not accessible to wheelchair users.  Will the Minister ensure that wheelchair access is provided to the engineering block?</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate.  The fact that 19 other Members contributed since 11 a.m. this morning shows that there is great interest in Dáil reform.  As some Members had to share time, more time should be allocated to future debates on Dáil reform.  We believed we had provided adequate time, but that does not appear to have been the case.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge Members' contributions on the work of the committee. The chief whips, Deputies Dermot Ahern, Brian Fitzgerald and Eric Byrne, played key roles on that committee and I will reserve my comments on the Progressive Democrats until later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put this matter in context. This is the first report on Dáil reform published by the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. This is only the beginning.  For the <Col N="1908" /> duration of our term in office we will apply ourselves assiduously to improving Dáil structures to make them more relevant and meaningful in the interests of democracy.  I also thank the officials who were involved in the tedious discussions and, finally, devised this constructive framework.  We owe them a sincere debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern kicked off the debate with a constructive contribution.  I am sure many of us share his views on the tyranny of the script.  One does not get publicity unless one produces a script.  A hallmark of parliaments in the past was the capacity of Members to speak off the cuff.  Members of the Seanad are not allowed to read from scripts, but if a member of this House wants to be reported in the media he or she must produce a script.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by Deputy Ahern's constructive comments about arriving at a consensus and adopting common denominator solutions to problems.  We are not discussing this matter merely from a Government perspective, it is in the long-term interests of all Members. Those who are in Government today may be in Opposition tomorrow and <i>vice versa.</i> In pooling our resources collectively, it is in everybody's interest that we adopt a common denominator approach for the betterment of all Members and the House collectively.</P>
    <P>It is at that juncture that Deputy Ahern and I depart in terms of agreement. I cannot accept his allegations about the secretiveness of this Government in lumping together questions.  I will outline examples of its openness in answering questions and confronting issues.  On 24 May, 1995 the Taoiseach made a statement on the Matt Russell affair, following which there was a rigorous question and answer session.  On 30 May 1995 we had a debate lasting two hours and 45 minutes on the Attorney General affair involving the Taoiseach, the main spokesperson for the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats Party, following which we had an extensive question and answer session.  On Tuesday, 30 April <Col N="1909" /> thisj year we had statements from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications about the second mobile telephone licence, following which we had a question and answer session.  We had statements on the Anthony Duncan case, followed by questions to the Minister for Justice which lasted one hour.  On 3 October a request was made on the Order of Business for a debate on the hepatitis C issue and on that evening after Question Time we had an open debate on the matter.  Far from hiding from the political reality, the Government has made itself answerable to the House on all aspects of its performance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern said the repeat rule relates to the last century.  While Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the other parties were conceived in this century, Fianna Fáil has been in power longer than any other party in this century or decade. From 1987 to November 1994 Fianna Fáil did not show any reforming zeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reform. Members of Fianna Fáil are the best reformers in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That party did nothing about the repeat rule, something which Deputy Ahern demanded today.</P>
      <P>Under Standing Order 30, or by way of a Private Notice Question, urgent matters can be raised each day in the House.  If a Private Notice Question is tabled on an urgent matter, the Ceann Comhairle will examine it and if it is worthy of an urgent debate under the standing order relating to such questions, a debate on the matter will proceed.</P>
      <P>In relation to Adjournment Debates, matters that took place yesterday can be raised this evening, for example, by way of four ten minute debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brian Fitzgerald made a valid point on the need to enliven debates. The Whips are trying to inject some spontaneity into the proceedings of the House, first, by allowing spontaneous <Col N="1910" /> interruption and, second, by an automatic procedure whereby ten minutes will be set aside after a debate to allow for questions on the subject discussed. This will make proceedings open to a greater degree of spontaneity and I hope will enliven them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the misinterpretation of people's intentions and he has freedom of expression.  The Freedom of Information Bill is promised for this session.  He also referred to the need for enhanced facilities and rights for Private Members' Business and talked about the frustration of Government backbenchers.  This programme of reform will introduce a new procedure, not solely for Opposition Members, whereby five Bills may be sponsored by individuals and the money and wherewithal will be provided to do the research and drafting work.  The Whips will develop procedures to set time aside for this.  It is a worthwhile innovation that has not received sufficient recognition.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley considered the contents to be unimportant and trivial details, issues and procedures on the margins.  The subcommittee spent many hours going into the detail of what should happen and trying to distill the collective view in the production of a document that would have unanimous support.  There were eight meetings and the Progressive Democrats were present for one meeting in February.</P>

      <P>I know the Progressive Democrats have to prioritise their time but if they are so upset about the procedures of the House this was a committee that should have been at the top of their list.  In terms of a submission we got a reactive rather than a proactive document.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley seems to want to completely alter our parliamentary system. If we were to believe him we would accept that the legislature was totally under the heel of the Executive.  That is not true.  There are elections every four or five years and the people decide who they choose as Deputies.  The Deputies elect a Government and it is answerable to the electorate after a set period. There are many procedures and devices for openness, transparency and accountability. The system works relatively well.  I am not against refinement or elaboration of some of the procedures. However, that is our system and that is how democracy works.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of work in the committee system, particularly for the smaller parties.  The committees afford the ultimate in accountability and participation. Many Members who cannot participate in the House due to time constraints and so on can debate the detail of legislation and reports in the committees.  I concede that we may have too many committees and there is a need to rationalise them.  That is a matter we will look at in our second report.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a point about questions not being answered.  I listened to Question Time today and the Taoiseach was pursued vigorously with supplementary questions.  That is the purpose of supplementary questions &mdash; to get further details from the Taoiseach or a Minister.  It is not simply a case of tinkering with the mechanism.  Rather it is a case of applying it and making it work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Eric Byrne spoke about the difficulties for small parties in attending committees.  The committee system is <Col N="1912" /> novel and it is not perfect.  It needs refining through examination and monitoring. We have to examine such matters objectively.  As part of the procedures being proposed, the committees will now be answerable to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There will be six-monthly reports from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and we will get many of the details about the reservations of the committees in the chairmen's reports.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea welcomed the initiation of Private Members' Bills for individual members.  Knowing his capacity for work, I am sure he will exploit that facility to the maximum.  He referred to streamlining voting procedures and the need for a more time efficient method of voting.  It is a matter we can examine.  At the subcommittee I proposed that there would be a reserved time for voting; the votes would be confined to a specific time so that people would know exactly when they would happen and the interval between votes would be shortened.  However, that proposal was not accepted.  We may return to the consideration of that matter.</P>
    <P>Referring to the Order of Business, Deputy Creed suggested that the Ceann Comhairle should not have to repeat the details read by the Taoiseach.  This is a proposal we are including in the report. Deputy Deasy referred to the need to examine the Question Time system.  I acknowledge that it is not perfect and needs examination.</P>
    <P>With regard to companies and agencies, the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies are being expanded to include Teagasc, the National Roads Authority and some of the other agencies like those Deputy Quill mentioned with regard to a lack of answerability.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea made the point that the Taoiseach, if he had his way, would like to prorogue Parliament.  One of the Taoiseach's attributes is his capacity to handle the Order of Business.  One of the Government's hallmarks has been the Taoiseach's performance on the Order of Business from the point of <Col N="1913" /> view of his competence in fielding questions thrown at him, his comprehensive grasp of detail and being on top of every aspect of legislation almost without reference to the notes in front of him.</P>

      <P>It is disingenuous of the Opposition to try to construe that there is a lack of openness from the Government when it has failed, particularly on the Order of Business, to make any impact on the Taoiseach.  Any allegations of secretiveness are unfounded and irrational.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foley referred to legal representation for committees and it is a matter I will examine.  Deputy Kavanagh welcomed the expansion of the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, of which he is Chairman.  From the point of view of the Strategic Management Initiative we should wait to see how this develops in terms of the concerns about an overlap between that committee and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to facilities and rights for Deputies.  There is a very effective all-party committee examining this issue. One should examine the record of improvements in facilities for Deputies over the years.  I concede that from the point of view of office accommodation much has to be done.  Within the next 18 months top-class facilities will come on stream and I only hope we are all here to enjoy them.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry staff will move from Agriculture House and it will be available to Deputies.  It will provide interview rooms and state of the art office facilities.  One of the best contributions was by Deputy Connolly who brought his insight and perspective to bear on this matter.  I am glad he defended officials in regard to answering questions.  It is not fair to point the finger at them.  At the end of the day the buck stops with us in the <Col N="1914" /> material we dispense in the House.  It is up to us to cross-check it in terms of its relevance &mdash; it is not fair to blame officials.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell made the point that Estimates are being nodded through.  He is chairman of the committee specifically set up to go through the detail of Estimates line by line, chapter by chapter and on that basis to be satisfied that what is being put through is adequate and in accordance with the intentions of Members.  One of the functions of the committee he chairs is to concentrate on the minute detail of Estimates. In the past this was not often possible on the floor of the House because of time restrictions.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Members, the officials and the members of the committee who helped us to produce the consensus report before us today.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 17, paragraph (3), before &ldquo;;about arrangements for sittings&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;;matters of public importance which may require legislation or a statement from the Taoiseach or a Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the Order of Business.  We had a sermon from the Minister of State on how well he considers the Taoiseach has done in that regard.  When our party leader raised an issue of supreme importance to this nation on this morning's Order of Business the Taoiseach of his own volition told the Ceann Comhairle that he did not object to that matter being taken. We were particularly annoyed because the Taoiseach had a printed script on the matter.  This business is supposed to be spontaneous and yet the Taoiseach had a written script and was well prepared to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> The amendment proposes to add to the matters that can be raised on the Order of Business.  I tabled this amendment because of the Government's refusal to allow what it originally proposed when in Opposition.  In the first youthful weeks of this Government it proposed that Deputies could raise matters of urgent concern and that they would not be ruled out of order, but it has reneged on that commitment.  The amendment proposes to widen the scope of the Order of Business.  At present on the Order of Business we can raise legislation promised either within or outside the House, the taking of business which has been promised, questions about business on the Order Paper, questions about when Bills and other documents on the Order Paper needed in the House may be circulated and questions about secondary legislation. I propose that matters of public importance, which may require legislation or a statement from the Taoiseach or a Minister, may be raised on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to Democratic Left's document &ldquo;Order in the House&rdquo;, which outlines its proposals for Dáil reform and was prepared when it was in Opposition. Under a heading &ldquo;Disorder of Business&rdquo; that document states that the matters which can be raised on the Order of Business have become so restricted during the past number of years as to now render the process virtually meaningless.  It further states that the position with regard to promised legislation is particularly ludicrous and that we now have a situation of which Myles na gCopaleen would have been proud whereby a Government Minister can hold a press conference or make several public announcements of an intention to introduce a Bill, but that does not count as promised legislation as the promise was not made in the House and Members are accordingly precluded from asking questions on it. We are changing that now.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, announced various tribunals outside the House, but did not <Col N="1916" /> come in here to do that.  Similarly, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in all her difficulties in recent months made announcements outside the House, but did not come in here to make them and because of the procedures of this House we were unable to raise them.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left's document goes on to state that to cure the problem of disorder on the Order of Business Deputies should be entitled to raise the following matters on the Order of Business, one of which is matters of public importance which require legislation or a statement from the Government, the exact terms of my amendment.  I call on Democratic Left to do what it called for when in Opposition and to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exempt other parties by quoting from this document.  Unfortunately I do not have The Labour Party's proposals on Dáil reform when it was in Opposition.  Labour was in hiding at that time and it may not have put forward any proposals for Dáil reform.  Its members were past masters at abusing Dáil procedures to raise issues and red herrings down through the years, which to a certain extent they succeeded in doing.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's document, &ldquo;Better Laws, Wiser Spending and Speedier Redress of Injustice&rdquo;, refers to raising urgent matters in the Dáil.  The document covers a point on which the Minister of State took me up earlier.  It states that current parliamentary procedures were designed for the needs of 19th century society, and slower communication meant that in the 19th century Ministers and parliamentarians had greater time to consider issues that arose and make decisions.  It further states that nowadays one only has an hour or two in which to react to events which have occurred on the other side of the world. Ministers must make decisions within a very short time and parliamentarians must have an opportunity to influence those decisions within an even shorter time.  The document also states that to that end Fine Gael believes we need to <Col N="1917" /> have radically improved procedures for raising urgent matters whether they be of international, national or local significance and that this must be done in such a way that it does not interfere with the normal parliamentary business or create a situation in which the Dáil spends its time reacting to outside events and, consequently, fails to set its own agenda for political life.</P>
    <P>The document contains a number of proposals to which I will refer later.  It stated in regard to urgent procedure that when Fine Gael returned to Government it would introduce a new procedure whereby Members may raise issues of urgency of one half hour each day.  My amendment does not go that far; it proposes a period of only 15 minutes.  The Fine Gael document states this would occur prior to the Order of Business and during this period Members would be allowed to make a speech not exceeding one minute on a subject of concern to them and the subject would have to be one which involves the responsibility of a Minister or a statutory authority established under law.  That goes a good deal further than the Minister of State is prepared to go in the document before us, as I and a number of other speakers have said.  The Fine Gael document also states that the Minister will not be obliged to reply to the point made by the Member but if the Minister wishes and is present he may reply immediately within the one minute time limit.  Alternatively, the Minister may have the option of replying on a later sitting day during this same half hour period.  The document further states that a similar system operates in the US House of Representatives, that it has been successful and that it provides the opportunity for Members to air certain matters while giving the Government some discretion in answering.  The proposal Fine Gael made on which it has now reneged was that the Minister would reply by letter.  That is nearly as ludicrous as the Taoiseach's suggestion <Col N="1918" /> about answering parliamentary questions by telephone.  The Fine Gael document also states that the Ceann Comhairle will have discretion in the Members chosen to raise each issue every day, a laudable suggestion.  I ask the Minister of State to follow his convictions, those he had when in Opposition, and agree with amendment No. 1 or amendment No. 2.  That is not too much to ask.</P>
    <P>I was sitting where the Minister of State is now sitting when my party was in Government and I am aware there were proposals about topical matters and reform in this area coming to fruition during the last Government.  I know that but for the fall of the last Government this proposal would have been implemented.  It had been discussed for a considerable time.  Those who called for Oireachtas reform when they were in Opposition have a different view now they are in Government.  It is a pity they are now reneging on promises made in Opposition.  The Government will be on this side of the House again.</P>
    <P>I do not see why Ministers should hide behind procedure.  We should not have anything to hide.  We should dictate our own rules and be more open in the House.  Every Member who has spoken today has castigated the rules. We now have an opportunity to do something about it.  I ask the Minister to accept one or other of these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Dermot Ahern's point in relation to developing the scope of what is discussed on the Order of Business and raising topical matters.  Deputy Ahern knows as well as Deputy Brian Fitzgerald and I that we have discussed these issues <i>ad nauseam.</i> We have had these proposals at sub-committee and brought them back to our respective parties.  They have been discussed in detail and it has been decided they will not be accepted.  This is only the first <Col N="1919" /> report.  We will progress to further deliberations.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposal for the Order of Business, the report states:</P>
      <P>Following the announcement by the Taoiseach and the disposal of any motion comprehended by paragraph (2), the Ceann Comhairle may permit, at his discretion, questions about business on the Order Paper; about the taking of business which has been promised, including legislation promised either within or outside the Dáil; about the making of secondary legislation; about arrangements for sittings; and as to when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper needed in the House will be circulated; Provided that, the Taoiseach may defer replying to a question relating to the making of secondary legislation to another day.</P>
      <P>We have gone further than anybody has ever gone.  Until recently, what was technically allowed on the Order of Business was legislation promised in the House.  I remember the Government parties when in Opposition asking if legislation promised on a mobile phone could be allowed.  Pleas were made in relation to the power to ask questions on legislation promised outside the House.  We are expanding what can be asked in terms of legitimate questions on the Order of Business.  We are discussing legislation promised inside or outside the Dáil, the making of secondary legislation, the arrangements for sittings and the circulation of Bills or other documents on the Order Paper.  In relation to secondary legislation, if may not be possible for the Taoiseach to have immediate information so it is provided that he can come back on another day.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 proposed by Deputy Dermot Ahern states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;: Provided further that the Taoiseach may intervene on matters of topical interest and questions thereon shall be confined to the Leader (or his or her nominee) of Parties or Groups <Col N="1920" /> within the meaning of Standing Order 90 and shall not exceed fifteen minutes in the aggregate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a procedure like this is accepted, it will invariably become automatic.  Matters will be raised on the Order of Business every day and it will be claimed they are of topical interest and immediate concern.  On the other hand, it may be possible to examine how we can frame something acceptable that would depend on the initiative of the Taoiseach. I will look at it favourably when the committee reassembles, but I cannot accept it in the short term.  We have discussed it already in committee.  Hopefully we will have a second report before the expiry of this Government's term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  I put these amendments down in an effort to prevent a situation which all Members of the House agree is not desirable &mdash; the disorder of business at every sitting.  I am bemused by the Minister's comment about how we can perhaps examine the Taoiseach bringing forward matters of topical interest on his own initiative.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand what the Minister says about this becoming the norm. Of course it will because Members always have issues of urgent topical interest to raise.  Because of the procedures of the House, we are unable to do so in an urgent and expeditious manner. I think it was Deputy Nealon who said he felt sorry for the Opposition and the way they have to bend the rules.  We will unfortunately have to bend all the rules in relation to Standing Order 25, as it is amended here, in order to allow us to raise topical matters in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach are being short-sighted.  If they agreed to amendment No. 2, the Ceann Comhairle would have complete jurisdiction to refuse going outside paragraph (3) which details the restrictions on what can be raised.  The Ceann Comhairle would have greater authority if amendment No. 2 were allowed.  He could say <Col N="1921" /> to Deputy Bertie Ahern, Deputy Harney or anyone else who raises an issue on this side of the House that it could be raised under this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are asking for a lot in relation to this.  It is not as radical as some of the proposals the Government made when they were in Opposition.  I could be as radical in the views I express in regard to Dáil reform as some Deputies.  While we are primarily a legislative body, it is necessary that, as practising politicians, we react to issues that crop up occasionally.  When I was in Government, I was against what I think was called the committee of urgent matters, which would deal with urgent issues.  I thought it was off the wall.  In effect we were going to be dictated to by the chat shows.  I do not think we are here to do that.</P>
    <P>However, there is definitely a need for us to be able to raise issues which are of national and local importance. The proposed reduction of the peace and reconciliation funds was raised today.  I had missed the Adjournment time limit, but luckily the Taoiseach was in the Chamber because of Taoiseach's Question Time.  Strictly speaking, the Ceann Comhairle should have ruled me out of order, but I was able to make a contribution.  This is why we need a system whereby we can raise issues of urgency.  I do not think we are asking a lot.</P>
    <P>I will press this amendment.  I ask the Minister to reconsider because Members and staff of the House also believe that the Order of Business is unseemly and should be changed for the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the facility to raise something as a matter of urgency requiring urgent consideration and comment thereon is legitimate in terms of being addressed through parliamentary procedure.  I make the point firmly again that there are facilities.  I wonder, for example, how many times the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1922" /> had recourse to a Private Notice Question to raise an issue of urgency for which they could not be accommodated on the Order of Business or one that had arisen since the Order of Business, but within the time constraints that would permit them to put such a question. Certain people think that the facility of Adjournment debates are slightly beneath them, that they are for what would be called the ordinary rank and file.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of answerability, if a Private Notice Question is put and allowed, the obligation is on the Taoiseach if it is directed to him, or the relevant Minister or Minister of State, to come into the Dáil and answer fully in an open, unrestricted committee style debate, all aspects of the issue which has been raised.  It is a successful device and we have seen at times that Private Notice Questions can run for up to half an hour.  In our quest for new procedures and facilities we should examine old procedures and existing facilities to see if they are being underutilised.  I recall from my days in Opposition that I used the Private Notice Question frequently. Invariably if the Ceann Comhairle allowed them &mdash; and generally he was judicious with regard to making a judgement on whether they qualified &mdash; a worthwhile debate was had on all aspects of the subject under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A procedure was introduced by my predecessor as Government Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady, called grievance time where spontaneous issues could be brought up.  Eventually, it self-destructed because people simply did not use it.  When we did a run-down, we discovered it was dominated by two or three Deputies.  Apart from that, most people did not bother to participate. However, in the spirit of openness and generosity, I will look at it again in the context of the reforms that we will be discussing forthwith, subsequent to this report, and perhaps we might be able to arrive at some agreement on what can be allowed. <Col N="1923" /> Question put.</P>

It was accepted by the then Government Chief Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady.  With regard to the Adjournment debate, Democratic Left made the point that it was buried at the end of other business, often at 10.30 p.m. or later, which meant that the issues raised received little or no media coverage. That is probably the main reason it died a death and why all parties have proposed that there be a facility to raise urgent matters of concern at an appropriate time; that is in and around the Order of Business every day.</P>
    <P>My amendments propose to take the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; out of Standing Orders Nos. 30 and 31.  It gives me great pleasure to refer to the Democratic Left argument.  It is hypocritical of people to say one thing in Opposition and do another in Government.  They should be more careful about what they say in Opposition.  Perhaps in the case of Democratic Left they thought they were never going to be in Government.  They castigated the situation with regard to Standing Order No. 30.  They said the very fact that it was being used and refused all the time was an indication of the frustration of Members.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;, I took some inspiration from the Fine Gael document of 1989 calling for Dáil reform.  It referred to Private Notice Questions.  The Minister of State said that he used it quite often, but he put his name to this document which contradicts what he said five minutes ago.</P>
    <P>The main problem in raising matters under the procedures outlined which was special notice question and motion under Standing Order No. 30 is that the Ceann Comhairle and his predecessors have tended to take a fairly narrow interpretation of what is urgent and of the matters for which a Minister is responsible.  The fact that Ministers do not account for the activities of semi-State bodies also is a particular restraint on the raising of <Col N="1925" /> relevant matters.  Pressure of time also means that backbenchers frequently are unable to get speedy answers on issues affecting their own constituency or on issues of special concern to them.  There is simply too much competition for the available time for questions on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Every day the Leas-Cheann Comhairle lists sometimes up to 40 notices on the Adjournment and only four are picked. Again, I am asking the Minister to take the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; out of Standing Orders Nos. 30 and 31 with regard to Private Notice Questions and I am surprised he says that Private Notice Questions could be used more often.  We have invariably used them.  Deputy Séamus Brennan tabled one yesterday in regard to Iarnród Éireann and the Minister said he did not have any responsibility.</P>
    <P>We remember the Lowry affair.  All Private Notice Questions were ruled out of order on the basis that they were not urgent or, alternatively, they were not the responsibility of the Minister concerned. A plethora of Deputies have come in and said this House is hamstrung in its ability to go after semi-State bodies.  We hear about all this expenditure, quite apart from when we hear about the excessive expenditure in terms of travel expenses and remuneration, it takes our breath away and yet we cannot raise it.  It can be raised on every chat show and in every pub in the country and we cannot raise it here. That is ludicrous.  The Government professed to work as a pane of glass.  I refer the Minister to the honeyed words of the Programme for Government which stated that the Government would reform the institutions of the State in order to make them more relevant to the people.  In the spirit of openness, transparency and accountability I ask the Minister to allow the representatives of the people greater access to information from State authorities.</P>

      <P>The section relating to the Standing Order in question reads:</P>
      <P>Where the Ceann Comhairle is satisfied that the notice complies with the requirements of the Standing Order the Member shall be called upon by the Ceann Comhairle at the commencement of public business whereupon the Member shall rise in his place and state that he requests leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration and shall state the notice given but may not elaborate thereon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern is seeking to remove the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;.  It is proposed that the Order of Business that is agreed among the Whips, read out by the Taoiseach and confirmed by the Ceann Comhairle, should be set aside.  That would be a very serious occurrence.  To set aside the proceedings of Parliament and insert another subject matter in its place would be a major step.  If ever there was a requirement for the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; it is in this instance.  The words &ldquo;important&rdquo; and &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; should remain.  I acknowledge that it is a considerable period since Standing Order 30 was invoked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Common sense, compromise and consensus have prevailed in setting aside business voluntarily. For example, when the hepatitis C issue was raised last week in the House the Tánaiste made a spontaneous gesture by making available time after Question Time on Thursday to debate that matter.  That has happened on other occasions also.  The Taoiseach today agreed to make time available tomorrow to debate the peace process, the bombs in Lisburn and the general position in Northern Ireland.  If there is general consensus on the need for debate, time is usually provided for such debates.  To spontaneously set aside the <Col N="1927" /> business that has been agreed and insert some other subject matter in its place, proceeding forthwith to a debate, would be of major significance.  I am absolutely opposed to any attempt to remove the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; in that regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to Private Notice Questions, the presence of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; does not seem to be a deterrent.  If the subject matter of the question relates to an event that has occurred the Ceann Comhairle frequently allows the matter to be raised if he regards it as sufficiently grave.  There is no need to delete the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; in that case because the Chair is liberal in deciding whether such matters should be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few of us can remember the last time a request under Standing Order 30 was granted.  It was when the Government was falling down around our ears and it had no alternative but to agree to the request.  It was decided that the best way to overcome the debacle was to use the Standing Order 30 procedure.  I agree it related to an important matter of public interest, but we propose that &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; be omitted. Every politician is aware that the use of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; is the problem. I refer again to the document which states that the Ceann Comhairle, as did his predecessors, tends to take a narrow interpretation of what is urgent.  Even if the system under which Private Notice Questions are allowed was opened up, perhaps we would not need to raise topical matters at the start of business and we would not witness a debacle every morning on the Order of Business, which is not fair to this side of the House, the Taoiseach and, particularly, the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should open up the procedures.  Perhaps an amendment to Standing Order 31 which deals with Private Notice Questions would allow for urgent matters to be raised even on a daily basis.  I am sure Government Deputies would agree to that.  It would be open to all Members to raise issues <Col N="1928" /> in that regard.  Even if the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; was dropped from the provision relating to Private Notice Questions, many such questions would still be rejected, as happened yesterday.  Those questions must relate to issues which are relevant to Government Ministers, public affairs connected with Departments or matters of administration for which Ministers are officially responsible.</P>
    <P>The most radical reform of procedures dealing with questions should relate to Standing Order 32, to which there is no amendment tabled.  That is the procedure that prevents Deputies from raising issues of urgent concern. The Minister should give some leeway on this issue, particularly in regard to amendment No. 4 which proposes the deletion of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; as it applies to Private Notice Questions, so as to free up the system whereby Deputies may raise urgent matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>I raised earlier the matter of the deterioration of proceedings at Question Time.  Is there any hope of improvement in that regard?  For instance, given the amount of time devoted to Taoiseach's questions and priority questions, quite often on Tuesday and Wednesday no ordinary question on the Order Paper is reached.  The same sometimes applies to priority questions on Thursday.  More than 100 of the 166 Deputies are backbenchers and their questions are virtually never answered.  That defeats the whole purpose of Question Time.  As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, in the case of priority questions only the Deputy who tables a question may ask supplementaries, and it may take up to half an hour to deal with some of them.  On Tuesday one hour and 50 minutes is allocated to Question Time while on other days one hour and 20 minutes is allocated to Question Time.  In days gone by only one hour was allocated for Question Time.  I remember when Charles Haughey was Minister for Social Welfare he answered 40 questions in one day because if he did not <Col N="1929" /> do so they would have to be answered on subsequent days.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when this House was not as hectic as it is now and when we did not have fax machines or the Internet?  In relation to Private Notice Questions, the Government proposed, as I did also on Committee, that each day at Question Time the Leader of the Opposition would have the right to raise one Private Notice Question without such a question necessarily meeting the narrow urgency definition which limits the present system.  Is there any give in <Col N="1930" /> the Minister or in this Government of openness, transparency and accountability?</P>

      <P>The bulk of the proposals we have here are also taken from that document.  As the Deputy said, over the years various Governments have by instalments imported various reforms into the procedures of the House.  The bulk of the issues the Deputy is talking about are actually contained here.</P>
      <P>There are some, however, which we simply cannot accept now.  For example, the Deputy makes the point that Deputy Séamus Brennan was in some way restricted by this Standing Order because he was not allowed to raise the proposed cutbacks in CIÉ.  That is not so.  Deputy Brennan simply could not do so under the existing procedures of the House.  He could do so within the competence of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, chaired by Deputy Kavanagh, but not here according to the procedures of the House.  Irrespective of the deletion of the words &ldquo;urgent or important&rdquo; under Standing Orders 30 or 31, there was no other way that Deputy Brennan could legitimately have managed to engineer a debate on this issue he sought to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Private Notice Question offers the ideal facility to raise matters of urgency. It is not something that has to be submitted at 10.30 in the morning; one <Col N="1931" /> can submit the subject matter for consideration up to 2.30 p.m.  That leaves a very limited time for the Minister and the Department in question to explore the information involved and to prepare the relevant replies.  Deputies are in possession of a facility that is effective but under-utilised.  It answers the need for a facility to raise something as a matter of urgency.  If the Deputy checks the record he will find that people who have sought to raise on the Order of Business something which was considered to be extremely urgent at 10.30 in the morning do not even bother to put the issue down at 2.30 p.m. for consideration as a Private Notice Question.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot accept the proposal but I am prepared to be openminded. I am prepared to return to the committee to re-examine it on its merits and I am sure I will be reminded time and time again about the commitments contained in that 1989 document.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy has made a valid point in relation to questions and I will deal with it shortly.</P>
    <P>Amendment put.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 19, paragraph (1), after &ldquo;compliance with Standing Orders&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;: Provided also that, in the event of any Department making representations regarding a Question put down by a member, that member may also be allowed to give his or her views&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, relate to questions.  Amendment No. 6 relates to a former proposal of mine regarding the repeat rule, but this was fairly well thrashed out in a previous debate when the Minister refused to allow a total relaxation of this rule.  In that proposal I said there should not be a repeat rule in relation to any questions, either written and oral, to Ministers. However, in the case of the Taoiseach there should be an in-built repeat rule covering the six previous weeks so that there is some protection of the Taoiseach regarding the continuous tabling of repeat questions as he is on his feet twice every week to answer questions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 relates to the way in which questions are ruled out of order.  In the event of any Department making representations regarding a question, the Member who tabled it must be allowed to give his or her views. I accept there is a huge difficulty for the staff of the House but a lot of the pressure put on them by Departments relates to the Departments' views as to whether a question is urgent or not or whether it is within the Minister's responsibility. That is why it should be formally put in our Standing Orders that the person tabling the Question should be given an opportunity to put his or her views as to whether the matter is urgent and what the Department says about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 relates to parliamentary questions during the Dáil <Col N="1933" /> recess.  I refer again to the Democratic Left document which states:</P>
    <P>Another useful reform would be to provide for replies to written questions when the Dáil is not in session.</P>
    <P>This would prevent the backlog of questions on the resumption which we experience at present.  A special Order Paper would be published once a week during the recess giving the written questions and the supplement to the Official Report provided with the replies.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael document states:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes that Members would have the right to put down parliamentary questions during the Dáil recess.  These questions would be answered in the form of written replies within four weeks of their being put down.  They would be published as soon as they are answered in <i>Iris Oiffigiúil</i> and they would appear in the next edition of the Dáil debates published on the resumption of the sittings.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Labour Party did not see fit to issue a document on Dáil reform during the years but I expect it would have been of the same view when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The matter is much more pertinent now.  We are saying to the general public through the media that we now sit 11 months of the year.  As we know, committees, sit during the months of July and September.  The break this summer was very short.  Despite the Minister of State's honeyed words about the Taoiseach's performance as a Dáil reformer, the Taoiseach was put under extreme pressure to allow written questions to be tabled during the recess.  The only date on which he allowed written questions to be tabled was 25 July, the date of the special sitting.  It is necessary when the House is not in plenary session for Members to be kept fully informed to allow them to make a contribution at committee meetings.  I therefore ask the <Col N="1934" /> Minister of State to accede to my request.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 reads:</P>
    <P>In the event of a proposal by the Taoiseach or a Minister to transfer a Question put down, the Member involved will be given an opportunity to put his case on the matter: Provided that, in the event of a dispute, the Ceann Comhairle shall have the final decision.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Hanlon wanted to find out if the Taoiseach intended travelling to attend the Washington Conference he put down a question which was transferred to the Tánaiste whom he knew was travelling.  We subsequently found out that he did not go.  This is the height of stupidity,</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael document states:</P>
    <P>It is important that the Taoiseach be seen to answer to the Dáil for issues of overall Government responsibility.  A practice has grown up whereby Taoisigh transfer questions put down for answer by the Taoiseach to other Ministers.  Fine Gael will introduce clear and transparent rules governing this practice so as to ensure that questions may not be arbitrarily transferred to other Ministers. The Minister of State should put his money where this mouth is and do what his party called for when in Opposition, no more, no less.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 reads: &ldquo;Replies by Ministers should only relate to the Question involved and shall not be overly long&rdquo;.  Recently the Taoiseach lumped 19 questions together and made a Second Stage speech on the North. That is not what Question Time is about.  It should be like Question Time in the House of Commons where there is toing and froing.  Whenever we ask questions we groan because of what has been referred to as the Taoiseach's drone.  Perhaps his handlers have told him to use the system which is falling apart to frustrate the Opposition which has a duty and an obligation to ask questions. <Col N="1935" /> Fianna Fáil Ministers also tended to do this but no Taoiseach has done it as much as the present one.  It is a surreptitious abuse of the system.  I exhort the Minister of State and the Taoiseach to ensure that it does not continue.</P>
    <P>The Democratic Left document states:</P>
    <P>At present Ministers regularly provide vague or partial or overlong answers in reply to oral questions. Similarly, the Ceann Comhairle regularly seeks to restrict the number of supplementary questions from individual Deputies.  There should be no restriction.  In the interests of ensuring a full response to an oral question the Ceann Comhairle should also have the power to request a Minister to respond to a question or state why he cannot.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, is probably the worst culprit.  He has been obstructive in the way in which he refuses to answer valid questions.  He hides behind the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who cannot intervene and ask him to respond.  The same is true of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication.  Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>I doubt if in years to come the Minister of State will be able to throw the contents of a document of mine at me because I firmly believe that this House is supreme, that we should not give in to the views of civil servants, that we should be able to dictate our own business and have the ability to question what is in effect the permanent Government. While Ministers have responsibilities, I do not see why they should be hung, drawn and quartered and made to hide mistakes, perhaps of others.  We should be far more open to protect ourselves, apart from anyone else.</P>
    <P>During the past few hours the Minister of State has had an opportunity to make a name for himself as a reforming Minister.  I agree with those who said that many of the proposals contained in this document are only tinkering at the edges.  While some of the amendments <Col N="1936" /> will help Members, by and large the Government will continue for political reasons to maintain a clamp on this House.  One Member eloquently referred to the separation of powers. Unfortunately, the Government has a stranglehold on this House.  That is not the way it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point about the chaos in regard to Question Time and I ask the Minister of State to address the matter in his reply.  Questions to the Taoiseach and priority questions are dealt with on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and the questions of backbenchers are frequently not reached. For instance, on today's Order Paper 88 questions have been tabled to the Minister for the Environment.  None of the ordinary questions to the Minister were dealt with and I understand one or two of the priority questions were not reached either.  I have no doubt that will be the position tomorrow when questions are put to the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Question time should not conclude until all questions are answered because the current system provides Ministers with the opportunity to filibuster and to encourage Members to ask supplementaries to avoid answering a particular question.  That is not good enough.  I ask the Minister of State to devise a system whereby every question on the Order Paper has to be answered.  In previous years only one hour was provided for Question Time but certain Ministers dealt with as many as 40 questions in one day because they knew if they did not answer them that day, the questions carried over to the next day.  They knew there was little point in being evasive because the questions would have to be answered some time.  I remember the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, answering 40 questions in one hour.  I should add he was facilitated in that regard because Ireland was playing an important soccer match that day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Chamber was not as full as it might be.  The Members who would normally ask supplementary questions were in Lansdowne Road. Answering so many questions in such a short time was not unusual.  The Ceann Comhairle at the time, the late Deputy Joe Brennan, did an excellent job.  If he saw a Minister or a Member trying to filibuster or ask frequent or irrelevant questions, he would tell them to shut up and sit down.  That is the reason so many questions were reached during Question Time, although we may not have appreciated it at the time.  A system should be devised whereby all questions are answered, even if it means having late sittings or carrying over questions to the next day.  Alternatively, if questions are not answered, Ministers should be required to answer them in committee on the day in question or the following day.  If questions are not answered immediately they lose their relevance. There must be a solution to this problem because over 100 Members of this House are backbenchers.  We are the majority of Members yet we do not have any input during Question Time as it currently obtains.</P>

      <P>In relation to the difficulties highlighted by Deputy Deasy, I am committed to examining the whole issue of questions to see what can be done to streamline the system and ensure questions are answered in a timely fashion.  I agree if questions are not answered immediately they can lose their urgency.  One solution lies in questions being more focused and Members asking more focused supplementaries in the House.  It is all very well to talk about the number of questions not reached but many questions on the Order Paper are replications of other questions, some more urgent than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal to be addressed in relation to Question Time and I will outline some of the changes we intend <Col N="1938" /> to introduce.  For example, questions to the Taoiseach, which ran for 30 minutes on Tuesdays and one hour on Wednesdays, will now last 45 minutes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Question Time concluded at different times on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and in that regard we are trying to introduce a more standardised approach.  Question Time will now conclude at 4.15 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays with an additional 20 minutes on Wednesdays to allow the questions of ordinary Members to be reached.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the frustration of Deputies whose ordinary questions are taken with priority questions.  That is a legitimate grievance because priority question time is the exclusive domain of the party spokespersons and Deputies do not get the credit for tabling these questions.  That system is being changed. If a Deputy's question is the same as a priority question but is No. 10 on the Order Paper, the Minister will be obliged to answer the question separately and take supplementary questions from that Deputy.  In that way Deputies get a second bite of the cherry.  I agree with the Deputy that the entire PQ system needs immediate and radical examination and we will treat that as a priority.  It remains to be seen whether we can return to the system whereby questions not answered on a particular day were carried forward to the next day.  The way the system currently operates leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>In regard to the points made on the amendments by Deputy Ahern, I am amazed at the enlightenment which has suddenly hit Fianna Fáil in respect of major changes in the functions of the House.  Two years ago the Deputy's party sat on this side of the House and we are told that if that Government had not self-destructed, a major Dáil reform package would have come before the House.  I cannot take that seriously.  I am not aware that such a major tome was in the process of being written but collapsed because the Government went out of office.</P>

      <P>The issues being pressed by Deputy Ahern was dealt with in committee, and I indicated I was not in a position to accept them.  I may look at them again because I am sure some of them are worthy of further examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to representations on questions, there are already consultations with Deputies.  Regarding the relaxation of the repeat rule for parliamentary questions, if it were done away with there would be constant recycling and regurgitation of the same issues week in week out.  The same questions would be asked of the same Minister by the same Deputies and the same replies would be given.  There would be gross abuse of the system.  Rather than doing what Deputy Deasy wants, it would further clog up the system.  We went along with a proposal to relax the repeat rule for written questions on a trial basis by reducing the time limit from four months to two weeks.  I cannot agree to the total abolition of the repeat rule &mdash; the proposal in regard to questions to the Taoiseach is that the time limit be six weeks &mdash; because it would result in gross abuse with constant repetition and debates on hepatitis C morning, noon and night even though we will already have debated it in the House on several occasions.  Such issues would tend to come up again and again.  They would <Col N="1940" /> have a monopoly and many other legitimate issues which Deputies would like to raise would never get a look in.</P>
    <P>We discussed in detail at the committee the question of having written parliamentary questions during the recess. Underpinning the objection to this is that a Minister may be away on holidays, and a question asked of him must be replied to within a specific period of time.  The answers to such questions carry the same weight and import as an answer given on the floor of the House.  It would be tantamount to misleading the House to give an inaccurate answer to a written question.  A parliamentary question, written or oral, is a serious instrument in its own right and all answers must be checked and factually correct.  Otherwise they cannot be given.  The blame would lie fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister if there were an inaccuracy.  Also, parliamentary questions relate to plenary parliament, the main forum in which parliament discharges its functions although it may be argued that parliamentary questions should be allowed while the committees of the House are in session.  Meritorious as the committees may be, they are not the House proper.  The fundamental argument in relation to not allowing written questions during the Dáil recess is that parliamentary questions, by their nature, are directly linked to parliament. This is the Parliament.  The committees are committees of parliament, but they are not the parliament.  That should be understood and the link between parliament and parliamentary questions should be protected and preserved rather than trying to introduce a new device which is untrue to the title &ldquo;parliamentary questions&rdquo;.  It is only in plenary session that a direct link can be made between the parliament and parliamentary questions, written or oral.  I do not see this being changed in the foreseeable future, although I take the Deputy's point regarding the document.</P>
    <P>One of the features of this Government is that we have had special sittings of the House in July and September on <Col N="1941" /> different occasions.  At times we were castigated for that because it was felt it was just a way of focusing attention on the fact that we were on holidays and were back for a day or two.  During those special sittings we discharged quite considerable and important business. I do not accept Deputy Ahern's assertion that the Taoiseach &ldquo;grudgingly&rdquo; allowed written questions.  The suggestion was put to him and he readily acceded to it.  It happened in 1995 and again in 1996.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 8, Deputies may feel aggrieved about transferring parliamentary questions. However, they must realise that an individual member of a Government cannot be held responsible for an area which is the funcational responsibility of another Minister.</P>

      <P>Each Department has its own term of reference, its own brief and to hold one Minister responsible for another Minister's Department would be an abuse.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In my capacity of Government Chief Whip I frequently have to adjudicate between Departments. For example, a Fianna Fáil Deputy tabled a question on the Adjournment to a particular Minister <Col N="1942" /> who was not responsible in relation to the subject matter of the question.  This happens frequently and, as the Deputy knows from his experience as Government Chief Whip, the Whip has to adjudicate and decide which Department should take the question.  I do not want to split hairs but there is often a minor distinction between one Government Department and another, often because there has been a change of ministry or because of the manner in which Ministers are appointed after an election or during a reshuffle.  There was an example of that in regard to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The result of such changes is often a misconception as to where responsibility for a particular area lies.  Ministers should answer questions relevant to their own Departments and Deputies should pose relevant questions to Ministers and know their area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 9, relating to long replies to questions, Deputy Ahern, in arguing for a restriction, made the point that the Taoiseach lumps questions together.  The bracketing together of questions has been the practice in this House certaintly for as long as I have been here, and I have been here since 1987.  Similar and related questions are taken together, a composite answer given and thereafter supplementary questions are taken in the order in which Deputies tabled questions on the Order Paper.  One can imagine what would ensue if, instead of bracketing the questions together, questions that were related to each other were taken individually. Every question would be a rehash if, for example, Questions Nos. 2 to 19 were similar but were taken individually. If questions are broadly similar it is appropriate to take them all together &mdash; otherwise Question No. 19 would not be reached &mdash; and try to dispense justice in terms of calling the Members fairly as the Ceann Comhairle does, in the order in which they appear in the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the answer given by the Taoiseach, I cannot subscribe to the <Col N="1943" /> view that there is a filibuster.  An analysis of the Taoiseach's replies will show very little repetition or ambiguity, and most of his replies have substance.  If the complaint is that he is giving too much information we can certainly deal with that.  However, if sufficient information is not given he is accused of evading the truth and not facing up to the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Today there were six or seven related questions and the Taoiseach agreed to go into the House and adopt a new procedure to roll over the supplementaries.  Far from any rigidity or lack of flexibility we have openness, transparency, accountability, availability, answerability etc.  There is no better exponent of that than the Taoiseach. Every week, since he became Taoiseach he has come in here and answered questions for half an hour on Tuesdays and an hour on Wednesdays. There is no evasion.  One of the enhancement factors with regard to the Taoiseach's political image is that he is up-front, and does not attempt to elude questions.  Long may it continue.  That is what parliamentary democracy is all about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied the Minister is making a serious and positive attempt to be helpful and taking on board the points made during the debate. However, I would like to make a further point.  Will the Minister enter into discussions with the Chair on the manner in which questions are answered so that Ministers are told that lengthy initial replies and lengthy supplementaries will not be tolerated?  Some days Ministers may have seven, eight or even ten pages of an initial reply to a straightforward question.  That is defeating the purpose of Question Time.  In addition, people are allowed ask lengthy supplementaries which become more like Second Stage debates than a supplementary question.  Brevity would solve many of the problems and would allow more <Col N="1944" /> questions to be answered.  If Ministers were instructed that their answers to questions could not exceed more than one page in length it would give the desired result.</P>
      <P>What about a one page limit and no more than five supplementary questions on any one question?  The person who put down the question should not ask more than two supplementaries.  This is a suggestion to speed up Question Time.</P>
      <P>I put down Question No. 40 on today's Order Paper.  I am a betting man &mdash; as Deputy McGahon might say &mdash; and I could have bet heavily today that Question No. 40 would not be answered because it would create problems.  It was a straight question about moneys for the Tramore sewerage scheme.  I put it down in the name of Deputy Godfrey Timmins because he went on holidays to Tramore as a child and loved the place.  I knew that question would not be answered.  We must stop that from happening.  No ordinary question was answered today and that is becoming more and more frequent.  That practice must be eliminated otherwise Question Time for the vast majority of people in the House has no relevance.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Deasy I will be extremely brief.  I am intrigued with this discussion.  The Minister of State seems reasonable and is willing to take on board many of the ideas put forward by Deputy Ahern and others, including me.  Would it have been better if this report had not been presented to the House at this time but when further progress was made instead of having the inevitable long delay before we make progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee had been meeting literally week in week out on all of these issues and we came to an agreement on a number of matters.  We had to come before the House with the matters on which we could not agree. The agreements on the issues to which the Minister referred &mdash; 45 minutes for Question Time for the Taoiseach on <Col N="1945" /> Tuesdays and Wednesdays &mdash; would take care, to a certain extent, of the issue raised by Deputy Deasy whereby ordinary questions tend not to be answered, on a day like today when the Taoiseach's Question Time continues for an hour and only one or two of the environment questions were taken subsequently. That is the reason we wanted to get it on the Order Paper immediately. The Minister of State complimented the Taoiseach on his openness in the House.  By contrast with the two previous Taoisigh, his answers are overly long.  They are designed to allow the least participation by the Opposition. That is not the way it was with his two predecessors who invariably answered promptly and gave short replies.  The Taoiseach is renowned for the way in which he answers questions. The Minister of State may say that is why he is doing so well on the Order of Business.  However, his answers are not being critically analysed by observers outside the House.</P>
      <P>An issue raised by Deputy Deasy and which had been a practice when we were on that side of the House, is that civil servants prepare answers so that the Minister can read them out.  They do not really answer the question tabled but go into a dissertation about how great is the Minister and his Department. That is wrong.  There should be specific answers to the specific questions tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only rationale for retaining the repeat rule &mdash; four months for oral questions &mdash; is to protect the Minister against supplementaries.  The system whereby we have done away with the repeat rule for written questions has worked reasonably well.  As I have stated at a number of Whip's meetings, due to the frequent repetition of questions under the two week rule, very often Departments reply to a question by stating it was already replied to on, say, 25 July.  If another Deputy put down the original question the Deputy must look up the reply in the Official <Col N="1946" /> Report for that day.  When a Department refers to a previous reply it should append it to the answer.  The Minister for Social Welfare comes in for most criticism in this regard.  On a number of occasions the Department of Social Welfare has stated that questions tabled by me were replied to on a previous date.  In one case it did not answer the question, it referred to an answer which was supposed to relate to the same topic but which did not.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister imply that committee meetings are not plenary sessions of the House and that there is a distinction.  There should not be a distinction, but perhaps the committee system is bringing the entire system into disrepute.  When I was in Government I was against the committee system &mdash; I made my views well known &mdash; because I felt it would let the Government off the hook by enabling it to park many issues on a satellite so that no one would pay much attention to them.  This is happening all the time and it is not in the interests of Parliament. This Chamber should have primacy, but whether or not we like it, we have a committee system which we must use. This is why it is important for Deputies to be able to raise issues by way of parliamentary question during the Dáil recess when committees are working. Based on what he said in Opposition, I exhort the Minister to accede to our request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nealon asked why we did not wait and produce a more comprehensive document.  I take his point but it has been well answered by Deputy Ahern.  The other reason is that much of the earlier part of the document contains technical amendments to Standing Orders which we wanted to implement.  These amendments were there for a considerable period and while they were working in practice they were never codified.  We wanted to get this part of the document and the initial work into the House and agreed so that the new procedures could be put in place as quickly as possible. <Col N="1947" /> We also managed to recify other anomalies in regard to the procedures of the House which have not been referred to.</P>
      <P>The repeat rule applies only when there has been no change in the circumstances, that is if the question and answer are the same.  However, if there has been a change in the circumstances since the original question was asked then there is no problem.  The problem arises when the same information is sought and the same information is given.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy on the need to keep answers as brief as possible. This matter has been raised at Government level and it has been agreed to keep answers as short and relevant as possible.  Hopefully, the benefits of this will be seen in due course. We must also seek to ensure that supplementary questions are as short and relevant as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the proposed question and answer session at the end of Second Stage debates.  This has already been the practice at the conclusion of some statements.  I am not suggesting that people should be <Col N="1949" /> muzzled but on occasion, for example, during the Lowry affair, this Government of openness, transparency and accountability allowed backbenchers to ask questions in a concerted way when it was patently obvious that the question and answer session should have been reserved for the Opposition spokesperson who demanded the debate in the first instance.  I regard this as a breach of faith.  This did not happen when we were on the other side of the House. The question and answer session was not orchestrated in such a way as to allow Deputies to filibuster.  If the Minister does not accept the amendment I ask him to ensure that future question and answer sessions are confined to the Opposition spokespersons and the people nominated by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Opposition might have a legitimate expectation that it should dominate the question and answer session, whether on Second Stage or at the conclusion of statements.  However, I am sure the Deputy appreciates that there is no way I could legitimately try to prevent a Government or Independent Deputy who has an interest in a matter from asking a question.  They already complain that they cannot contribute to certain debates because the allocation of time is set down rigidly in the Order of Business and is confined to the spokespersons of the parties which conform to Standing Orders and are recognised by the House.  It is often the case that the only opportunity available to Independent Members or individual Deputies is to become involved in the question and answer session.  I agree that, by and large, it should be reserved for Opposition Deputies and I believe that is the spirit behind it.  However, it cannot be nailed down.  There is nothing to stop a dissident, critical or constructive Deputy on this side of the House from asking a specific question of a Minister.  To set it down in hard terminology and confine this section to Opposition Members would fly in the face of the rights of <Col N="1950" /> ordinary Deputies.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  I believe Deputy Ahern accepts it cannot be enshrined in Standing Orders and I ask him to withdraw it.</P>

I made a serious complaint against the procedure adopted by a Minister about nine months ago which has not yet been attended to.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Hepatitis C Infection: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Donnell on 8 October 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Minister for Health for his failure to accept political responsibility for the mishandling of the hepatitis C affair by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, and for his failure to ensure the accountability of those whose <Col N="1955" /> individual actions gave rise to appalling human suffering and to massive liability on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>The following amendment No. 1 was moved by the Minister for Health:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Health for the comprehensive series of measures which he has taken in discharging his responsibilities in dealing with the consequences of the hepatitis C infection and in particular confirms its approval to:</P>
    <P>(i)  the Scheme of Compensation published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995 which will continue indefinitely as an alternative to court proceedings for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from human immunoglobulin anti-D, blood transfusion or other products;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the proposals set out in the health care document published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995 in relation to the long-term health care needs of persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C which provides statutory guarantees in respect of the future provision of health care services; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Health of the decisions of the Government to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as amended, into the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" />&ldquo;(1)  condemns the Minister for Health for his failure to accept political responsibility for the mishandling of the hepatitis C affair by the Blood Transfusion Services Board and for his failure to ensure the accountability of those whose individual actions gave rise to appalling human suffering;</P>
    <P>(2)  calls on the Government to immediately set up a judicial inquiry to investigate all the events surrounding the hepatitis C scandal so that the truth of this affair can be fully and finally established; and</P>
    <P>(3)  while the judicial inquiry is proceeding, the <i>ad hoc</i> hepatitis C compensation scheme be stood down and be re-established at the conclusion of the judicial inquiry as a statutery compensation tribunal.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak of hepatitis C is one of the recurring nightmares experienced from time to time by most people who have anything to do with the practice of medicine.  Medicine today is a high technology area but it is also a science which depends more than most on the application of human resources.  Therefore, it is also a science subject to human error which can start a chain reaction and result in a tragedy such as this involving hepatitis C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all forgive someone who makes a genuine error provided that upon realising the mistake he or she does everything possible to minimise the consequences.  I do not intend to be in any way political and I can fully understand the dilemma in which the Minister finds himself.  I have watched the Minister in the House on a number of occasions handle himself admirably in difficult circumstances.  However, I have never seen the Minister as angry as on the issue of hepatitis C.  The reason is that he realises there is something not right in this case.  As I have said before, none of us makes the Minister responsible for what happened in this matter <Col N="1957" /> so many years ago.  However, he has had his day in the sun in his portfolio and the manner in which he is handling this tragedy is not that of a compassionate Minister for Health, which is what this tragedy deserves.</P>
    <P>By his own admission he is at the mercy of the Department of Finance.  I have heard the Taoiseach, the Minister and some of their backbench colleagues say that we are making this into a political issue.  We were even asked to take the beef tribunal into account.  As it was eloquently put in the House last night, this is not about beef but about human beings, their suffering and tragedy.  This is not a case in which prudent management demands cost cutting, no more than a parent would take such an attitude when deciding whether a child could have an expensive operation.</P>
    <P>I received a letter in December 1995 from the Department of Health when I asked about the tribunal.  A line in the letter caught my attention.  It described the proposed tribunal as one which would assess compensation on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis for the victims of the BTSB's negligence.  This is to say, in effect, nobody is to blame but here is a few pounds out of the generosity of our hearts.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has now accepted responsibility and Mrs. Brigid McCole was forced, under threat, to accept its estimate of compensation.  The judicial tribunal should carefully comment on the letter sent on 20 September 1996 by the BTSB to Mrs. McCole's legal advisers.  It admitted liability and apologised but only in the context of a threat that if Mrs. McCole were to proceed with an action for aggravated or exemplary damages and not succeed, it would pursue her for costs.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the making of a lodgment put further pressure on Mrs. McCole?  Had her eventual award in court not exceeded the lodgment she would have been compelled by law to pay the legal costs of the BTSB and, as a result, could have ended up with nothing.  The purpose of the lodgment <Col N="1958" /> was to force a settlement upon her and not to negotiate, yet the Minister attempted to make capital out of having paid her expenses.  I put it to the Minister that had she gone to court she would have won her case for aggravated damages with costs.</P>
    <P>I will give three cases of women who have died and I will begin with that of Mrs. McCole.  I asked the Minister why her case was not heard in the early summer rather than being put back to 8 October.  He replied that it was because the BTSB was not ready and that the decision was also based on medical reports.  There were three medical reports.  One report was from a professor who dealt with Mrs. McCole's case up to a certain point in time and it was equivocal.  Mrs. McCole's case was then taken on by a second consultant who had attended Mrs. McCole over a period of years.  He had seen her condition deteriorate over the years, it was his opinion that her health had deteriorated seriously and that a liver transplant should have been contemplated.</P>
    <P>The third report was from a third consultant. Who commissioned this third report?  On what basis was the decision made on this report?  This consultant made his report on the basis of a onceoff visit to Mrs. McCole and reference to textbooks.  There are no experts in the field of hepatitis C.  However, the Minister indicates that the medical report was one of the reasons Mrs. McCole's case was put back.  The cases of those who are seeking compensation through the courts have not yet been heard.</P>
    <P>Why did the tribunal not ask for a report from Mrs. McCole's general practitioner?  It was her GP who asked Mrs. McCole's legal advisers to seek an early court case.  Had he been asked he would have told the court that she would not have been fit to stand up in July or August, let alone stand up in court in October.  It happens from time to time that the doctor who has been seeing a patient over a lengthy period of time is ignored and the case is dealt with <Col N="1959" /> by an expert brought in to do the job on behalf of an organisation.</P>
    <P>The second case I bring to the Minister's attention is that of a woman called Susan who has also died.  She falls into a category that has not yet been considered by the compensation tribunal. The patients in that category have an underlying pathological condition, require a blood transfusion and as a result developed hepatitis C.  Susan had hepatitis C but patients in the category into which she fell will not receive compensation and neither will her family who looked after her through the years.</P>

      <P>None of the cases of the families of patients in this category &mdash; who have all died and did not receive compensation &mdash; which are before the <Col N="1960" /> compensation tribunal has been heard. These are families of women who have died who have not yet been considered for compensation.</P>
      <P>Mrs. McCole is not the first patient to die of hepatitis C.  There is another category of patient.  Brigid McCole died and she knew she had hepatitis C.  Susan died and she also knew she had hepatitis C.  Marie falls into another category because she died in 1989 before this condition was recognised and her autopsy report cites that she died from liver failure due to hepatitis non-A, non-B and that she suffered from cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, non-A, non-B for ten years.  She was brought into hospital and asked all the relevant questions about her alcohol intake and drug abuse.  She answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all of them except to the one which asked if she had ever had blood transfusions. She had received blood transfusions and St. Vincent's Hospital only belatedly accepted that she had a weakly positive hepatitis C.  She constitutes another category of patients, those who contracted hepatitis C and died from it, but they are not yet known as a category.  There have been biopsies, autopsies have been carried out and it has been stated that patients were hepatitis non-A, non-B. Other women have died from hepatitis C but they did not know they had that condition.</P>
      <P>The BTSB admitted liability and apologised to one person who has now died from hepatitis C from infected anti-D. It must also admit liability in the case of other infected blood products.</P>

      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to formally express my condolences to the family of the late <Col N="1961" /> Bríd McCole.  Not alone was she a constituent of mine, she lived in the same parish and we often met in the same shops, churches, at functions and parish events.  I know her large family who attended primary and post-primary schools in my parish of Gweedore.  It could be said that we are very near neighbours in every sense of the word.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday it was my sad experience to attend the removal of her remains from St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin on their long and arduous journey to Donegal.  A number of features greatly impressed me at that removal.  I was impressed by the genuine love, sorrow, grief and composure shown by her large family.  They had obviously lost a loving mother who always placed them first up to the very end, but they knew and the country now realises that she was a woman and a mother in a million, a unique and brave person.</P>
      <P>Another striking feature that afternoon in St. Vincent's Hospital was the large number of hospital staff who turned up to show their respect before the sad cortège left for Donegal.</P>
      <P>I wonder how many times during the past number of years Bríd McCole travelled from her home in the remote mountain village of Loughaugher for the necessary treatment and consultations in Dublin.  On Monday last I had a long discussion with a good friend of Mrs. McCole in Donegal, another lady who most unfortunately and tragically is afflicted by the same disease.  She told me that Bríd often had to be up at 5.30 a.m. to avail of an ambulance in Letterkenny to get her to Dublin in time for her appointment.  Often when they arrived in Dublin they had to travel to ten or 12 hospitals before she reached her destination.  One can only imagine the intolerable burdens and stresses placed on her deteriorating physical condition by those uncomfortable and demanding trips.  During one of those trips my colleague, Deputy Ahearn, some other Members and I met Bríd in this House.  We had a meal with her and we realised how ill she was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> My late neighbour Bríd McCole was shabbily treated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  It maintained a hostile attitude and kept threatening her to the very end.  Only by her tragic and premature death did the board eventually accept responsibility and tender a belated apology.  That is what Bríd McCole fought for and while her death is a great tragedy for her ailing husband, her family and her aged mother she achieved her reasonable aim and objectives, even in death.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to establish the tribunal of inquiry.  It must have the powers to investigate every aspect of this terrible tragedy.  Responsibility for the suffering of many and the death of Bríd McCole must be placed on those responsible, nothing less will be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of this my first public opportunity to extend my deep sympathy to the husband and family of the late Brigid McCole.  I also want to extend my sympathy to the members of Positive Action, many of whom were very loyal, caring and dedicated friends of Brigid McCole during the last two years of her illness.  The loss to them is also an enormous tragedy.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it took the death of Brigid to put a human face on this tragedy.  As a result of her very sad death at least we have moved out of the realm of talking about statistics and we are now talking about mothers, children, husbands and families who are victims of this great tragedy.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about what the late Brigid McCole achieved on her death-bed but her real achievement was during her lifetime.  I applaud her for the enormous courage and bravery she showed during those years when she was seriously ill and decided to go to the High Court to discover the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having met Brigid McCole, I regret she never lived to hear the apology she longed for during her lifetime.  She always insisted that compensation was secondary to her.  I have always said that compensation was secondary to the <Col N="1963" /> members of Positive Action.  What they want to know most of all is what happened, why, and who is responsible. Sadly, even if the BTSB now shout their apology from the mountain tops, Brigid will never hear it.  Neither did she live to benefit from the compensation, irrelevant though it was to her.  These are sad facts we cannot change.</P>
    <P>I have always said there has been to much emphasis on compensation, important as it is.  The tragedy women have experienced can never be compensated for in monetary terms.  Their quality of life and health is affected and the possibility of their life span being shortened can never be compensated for.</P>
    <P>I despise the politicising of this issue. In February 1994 and during the following ten months, I am proud that my party in Opposition never once politicised the issue.  Our party spokesperson at the time was the current Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen.  Her priority was that a proper healthcare system for the victims would be implemented, that counselling and compensation would be available and that there should be an investigation.  We did not change tactics because we crossed the floor.  We dealt with the human tragedy that must be treated with sincerity and without any hope of political gain.</P>
    <P>I regret the issue has been politicised. We all tried to do what we thought was right at the time.  There is no point in being experts today because we have the benefit of hindsight.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is seeking admission of liability, a public apology and a tribunal of inquiry, which the Minister is offering. She was in Government for ten months when this tragedy was known, in the powerful position of Minister for Justice. Like all of us, she thought that the inquiry by the expert group was the correct step to take at that time.  We supported her.  It is unfair that our Minister is now criticised because he does not have all the answers she wants.  She made her decisions on the available knowledge.  If we turn the clock back, things would have been different.  It is <Col N="1964" /> important now that the correct steps are taken, the truth is discovered and all the relevant information is made available during the tribunal.  It is important that those responsible will have to answer.</P>
    <P>It is important that in drawing up the terms of reference for the tribunal, it carries out its function as quickly as possible.  There have been brave speeches in this House from those who are lawyers.  They should ask what is the biggest problem we have in setting up the tribunal?  It is attempting to protect the tribunal from being bled by lawyers and to ensure it does not drag on.  Whatever compensation there is should be paid to the victims and their families who continue to suffer.  I ask the Minister to include an agreement reached in this House that applicants should be entitled to delay their hearing until after the results of the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I am glad that I played my part in a small way.  I negotiated and kept in contact with Positive Action and achieved some flexibility in the tribunal for compensation. I always had tremendous respect and sympathy for all the members of Positive Action, who were sincere in their demand.  However, there has been too much emphasis in this debate on what was not provided rather than what was.  It is unfair of us not to acknowledge the provisions the Minister for Health did make, even if the Opposition is not satisfied that its provisions were not made.</P>
    <P>I conclude by reiterating my sympathy on this sad occasion.  I hope the tribunal of inquiry will get to the root of the matter and that the victims will be compensated in full for the suffering and pain they are enduring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by my colleagues.  I agree that this debate should not serve as a vehicle for what many people outside this House see as a futile and irrelevant party political point scoring.  I am weary of that approach to issues in this House. I have no wish to enter that arena and am happy to leave it to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> In dealing with the consequences of this scandalous tragedy, our central concern must be for the victims of the BTSB's negligence.  We must also ensure that no-one in this State is ever contaminated by blood products administered here again.  Those in the employment of the State must be accountable for their actions.  Real accountability in public administration means stepping outside the fiction that the political head of a Government Department is responsible for decisions made by others to whom responsibility is devolved and whose scientific and medical expertise is relied upon.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement was made by the BTSB in February 1994, successive Governments have made a variety of decisions, many of which have been the right ones.  Sadly, wrong decisions and mistaken judgments have been made. The present Minister, as previous speakers have mentioned, deserves praise for many of the initiatives taken.  He acted quickly to preserve the integrity of the blood supply and established a compensation tribunal that is working well.  It offers the possibility of financial compensation to the victims of the BTSB in a far speedier manner than the courts and also provides for the making of provisional awards that give extra protection. The Minister has also made amendments to the health legislation to guarantee the provision of healthcare on an ongoing basis for all the women affected by this appalling debacle.  He is also setting up a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>In the light of what we now know, it was a grave mistake to provide for an informal inquiry under Miriam Hederman-O'Brien in circumstances in which the powers which are now vested in a tribunal of inquiry were not vested in her.  If in 1994, such a tribunal of inquiry had been established, many questions that today still demand a response would have been answered.</P>
    <P>There are other questions we should raise.  When members of the public have been seriously wronged or damaged by a State body, who truly represents their <Col N="1966" /> interests?  When a State legal team oppose a court application for anonymity made by a woman whose life has been destroyed by the negligence of a State body, on the basis of what principle is opposition voiced?  What was the public interest in forcing the late Mrs. McCole to be publicly named and identified as having hepatitis C?  There cannot be any, other than a hope that forcing her to go public would put her under pressure to discontinue court proceedings or to prematurely settle and by so doing facilitate the BTSB in avoiding an admission of negligence.  For God's sake, if Fr. Brendan Smyth or Mr. Marc Dutroux in Belgium were being prosecuted in this State for paedophilia, under our current laws as administered, their names would not have appeared in the media and they would have been granted anonymity.  Why should the victims of contaminated blood products marketed by a State agency who have contracted hepatitis C be treated more harshly by our legal system than alleged rapists and child abusers?  The lawyers acting for the BTSB should have been instructed to consent to the court's granting anonymity to the victims of their negligence and the State lawyers acting in the proceedings should have co-operated in that.  If even with the agreement of the State, there was a difficulty in dealing with matters in that way, legislation should have been introduced to provide such anonymity.</P>
    <P>Other questions arise.  Where was the public interest in the threat being made by the BTSB to fight Mrs. McCole and others who litigated through the courts all the way to the Supreme Court? Surely, the public interest was in knowing the truth, in knowing whether the BTSB had been negligent and identifying those responsible for such negligence. What was the public interest in making a lodgment into court to wrongfoot her on issues of legal costs before negligence was admitted and in treating her case as some ordinary run-of-the mill legal action between unbending and unreasonably stubborn litigants?  Who makes these decisions?  Are they simply <Col N="1967" /> made by lawyers without instructions or are there some policy objectives behind them?</P>
    <P>Why was it that only upon the court making an order for discovery were records suddenly made available that were not originally furnished to Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien?  Why was the background investigation of records going back over 25 years not conducted in December 1991 or, alternatively, in February 1994?  There was only one of two reasons for that.  I believe that the main reason was that the BTSB did not do its homework properly.  The decision was made when the compensation tribunal was set up that negligence would not be admitted.  Again, there could only be one of two reasons for that.  One is that lawyers advised that if an admission of negligence was made those affected might receive a greater sum by way of compensation.  If that were the reason a failed attempt to protect public funds took priority over the entitlement of the victims to receive compensation. The alternative reason, which I believe is the correct one, is that the BTSB never told the full story to successive Governments.  This Minister and the previous Minister for Health were caught in that trap.  We are entitled to know whether information was withheld by the BTSB from successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The State the late Mrs. McCole and others are suing and are seeking compensation and help from their State.  We should always remember that.  It is not supposed to be their enemy.  The primary objective of the State is to offer those who live here a sense of community and protection to provide social solidarity.  It is the State which promises to cherish everyone equally, to protect the family and recognise each individual's worth and right to bodily integrity. Those whose lives have been threatened and blighted by the distribution by a State agency of contaminated blood products were entitled to be treated better by their State.  They are entitled to anonymity if they wish to pursue their claims through the courts.  They are <Col N="1968" /> entitled to know the truth about what occurred.  They are entitled to know who is responsible for this disaster and they were entitled to an earlier apology. They also deserved more from this House than some of the usual caricatured political slapstick in which some, and I emphasise some, Members engaged in this debate and which regularly masquerades as serious discussion. Their future physical and mental wellbeing should be central to all our considerations and they should not be used as political pawns for irrelevant and callous party political point scoring.  It is treated with contempt by most of those who are not Members of this House.  I hope the tribunal of inquiry announced will establish the truth and in doing so answer all the outstanding questions, including those posed by the bereaved family of the late Mrs. McCole whose death is the responsibility of the BTSB. She should not have had to carry the burden of litigating in our courts to establish the truth in the last months of her life.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. Like my other colleagues I offer my condolences to the family of Mrs. McCole.  I met her and some other members of Positive Action in the House a month ago and it was with great sadness that I learned of her death last week.  She was a woman suffering from a terrible illness which weakened her physically, but she was a strong woman determined to get at the truth. What has always been most important to her and Positive Action was getting at the truth of what happened.  Brigid and all the women in Positive Action have worked hard to ensure that those infected through anti-D with hepatitis C should receive the support which they and their families deserve from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The questions which Deputy Shatter asked about the legal system must be answered and it is interesting to hear a lawyer asking them.  It is appalling that <Col N="1969" /> for whatever reason within our legal system Mrs. McCole had to be named at the end of the day because she wanted to remain anonymous.  It raises serious questions about the legal system and I hope that they will be asked during the course of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, in setting up a tribunal of inquiry, has made the right decision.  I hope that the terms of reference will be such that we will have the answer to the question of how this contaminated blood was given to women long after hepatitis C was identified as an illness and a test became available. This is a critical question.  I hope that we will have a commitment when this inquiry is set up that it will not take an unduly long time and that it does not cost a fortune in fees, although what is really important is that we get the full story of who was responsible for the decisions taken and why no action was taken.  While we understand and support the need for the rigorous application of the legal process and rights of representation it is appalling that compensation to Mrs. McCole's family could possibly be eclipsed by the amount of legal fees and I share the public distaste and anger that this could be the case.</P>
    <P>I wish that in the current circumstances it would be possible to deal with the issue without recourse to adversarial proceedings, legal or political.  It is disingenuous of the Progressive Democrats to come into this House and quote, as they did last night, from an adversarial court system, to use words from the briefs of the legal teams and treat those words as if they were the Minister's. They, as the Progressive Democrats know, are not the words of the Minister. They are taking proceedings from an adversarial court system with which we have great difficulties and which was not suited to helping this woman or dealing with this sort of case.</P>
    <P>We also have to look at the situation internationally.  When the compensation tribunal was set up I worked with others to ensure that it was more flexible and <Col N="1970" /> met the needs that Positive Action identified. There were faults with it and many of them were corrected through discussion.  That tribunal is an important mechanism to help the infected women. It is flexible and offers certain advantages over a court system.  We should recognise that important steps were taken throughout, through legislation and, particularly, through medical care to meet the needs of the infected women.  It is salutary to note that the UK Government this week refused to give any help to people who had been infected with hepatitis C.  The 400,000 suffers of hepatitis C in France have not got help from the Government.  We must be fair in this debate and acknowledge the progress that has been made in dealing with the issue, but we must also acknowledge clearly that no inqury, tribunal, words or compensation can ever make up for the wrong which these women suffered.  It is critical that we have this inquiry and that we find the truth.  Women must be able to wait also. I echo what Deputy T. Ahearn said in that they must not have to go before the tribunal before the truth is out.  I admire the work of Positive Action.  Their journey has not been easy.  There are many lessons to be learned from their relationship with the Department of Health and there are lessons to be learned for all Departments as to how they respond when there is a major crisis like this.  A new system of response teams needs to be set up when victims are involved and when there is a medical crisis such as this one.  I sincerely hope, for the sake of the women involved and the families, that the truth is now within reach.  We must learn from what happened.</P>
    <P>We may be unable to promise that a similar scandal will not arise again, but we can commit ourselves to facing up to it and setting the highest possible standards in dealing with it.  This is a matter for all political parties and public servants, and we can expect the public, particularly women, to demand no less. It is not an issue for political point scoring. It must be treated with the greatest <Col N="1971" /> of care.  We must ensure the inquiry finds out what happened, why there were delays and why blood continued to be given when, by any standard, it should not have been given.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Government on what was obviously a very difficult decision.  The Minister for Health clearly has nothing to hide in the management of the blood transfusion system.  It is vital that he helps us get to the bottom of this mystery. There is aways a temptation in cases such as this to make as much political capital as possible, and it is a tragedy that some members of the Opposition have been unable to resist the temptation.</P>
      <P>The story of anti-D and hepatitis C is a human tragedy on a massive scale. The political point scoring that has gone on in this debate, aimed at people who were not even Members of this House when the women were infected, makes little or no contribution to a better understanding of what happened, why it happened and how it happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has ever been a patient in a hospital knows that the phrase &ldquo;protecting the integrity of the blood supply&rdquo; has real meaning.  Without an adequate supply of blood and the assurance that it is there, many operations would not even be scheduled.  Major surgery would not be possible without the willingness of thousands of people to donate blood and the ability of the blood bank to certify with confidence that the blood is safe to use.  The first imperative for the Minister has been to protect the integrity of the blood supply. The great danger of such an imperative is that it could ultimately be used to justify a cover-up.  That is why the Minister's decision to hold a judicial inquiry is welcome.  It proves there is no cover-up, and there will not be a cover-up.  As public representatives we are entitled to the truth, but much more so are the women who have been affected and placed at great risk, who cope every day with suffering and may even die.  The <Col N="1972" /> children and loved ones who have to cope with the illness and anxiety are entitled to the truth.</P>
    <P>There have been no heroes in this saga, with one exception, a woman who fought on her death bed to know the truth, whose interest in money was so minimal that she instructed her lawyers to fight for admission rather than for money, who left behind her a monument of personal integrity and courage. Every Member of this House and every member of the wider community owes Mrs. Brigid McCole a debt of gratitude. She fought in pain and weariness against the delaying tactics of the BTSB until it could no longer resist the truth.  The greatest monument we can build for Mrs. McCole and her family is the truth behind what happened to her.</P>
    <P>This is a human tragedy, but we do not know whether it resulted from wilful conspiracy, human error or criminal stupidity or negligence.  We do not know if all the factors involved have been identified with sufficient clarity to be certain it can never happen again.  Until we do, nobody &mdash; we may need blood at some time in the future &mdash; can rest easy. Nobody can say that justice has been done to innocent victims, people who only sought an injection to protect their unborn babies.  It is important that the Minister receives the fullest co-operation possible.  If he needs additional statutory powers to instruct bodies under his control he will get them from this House.  We are entitled to the whole truth.  Brigid McCole must not have died in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The front pages of today's newspapers display in clear terms the disgraceful and shabby manner in which the victims of the hepatitis C scandal have been treated by the Government.  Alongside headlines showing that £1 billion is available in the Exchequer kitty, there is a poignant photograph of the 12 children of the late Brigid McCole at the High Court.  There are no billions, millions or half millions in the headlines associated with her <Col N="1973" /> family's story.  Her husband and 12 children will receive just £175,000, even though a State agency has accepted that it killed a wife and mother.</P>
      <P>While the admission of liability has been made, it is a snide, limited liability. As the documents released by Mrs. McCole's family show, even at the very end the State and the Blood Transfusion Service Board engaged in scurrilous tactics and applied pressure to a woman who through her brave fight challenged their cover-up.  The settlement, the very limited liability which has been admitted by the BTSB, the very late apology and the State's detachment from the entire affair, including its refusal to offer condolences in the High Court, typify the way the victims of this State scandal have been treated in the past two years.</P>
      <P>The casual observer could have been fooled in recent days into believing that the Government has decided to handle this whole affair in a compassionate and responsible way.  Action is being taken only because the Minister has had to go on a damage limitation exercise, but the sad reality is that all that is happening is public relations, not a change of attitude to this matter.  The State is no more listening to the victims of this scandal now than it did before Brigid McCole died.  The State, the BTSB and the NDAB are still obstructing cases.  The Attorney General still fails to file defences to delay cases.  As is clear in an upcoming case, early trials are still opposed.  Liability is still not conceded without a fight and aggravated damages will not be awarded if the State and the BTSB have their way.</P>
      <P>Despite the announcement of a judicial inquiry the cover-up is ongoing. That is evidenced by the fact that 20 separate parliamentary questions in my name to the Minister for Health today have not been answered under a dubious pretext.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also clear by the limited terms that have been disclosed so far for the judicial inquiry.  The first question that must be asked is whether a judicial inquiry would be necessary had the Minister for Health referred all the files and information in his possession to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Minister's failure in this regard is considerable.</P>
      <P>An inquiry into just the medical aspects of the hepatitis C scandal will tell only half the story.  It will not tell us what the Minister knew when he accepted the resignations in 1995 of executives from the BTSB.  It will not tell us who saw the 1976 file showing the diagnosis of infective hepatitis, why that file could not be found and then mysteriously showed up among other papers when a court order was obtained.  It will not tell us of who received the duplicates which were made of the documents in the 1976 file &mdash; I understand the duplicates have now been found in other files at the BTSB.  A limited inquiry will not tell us why the BTSB has lost its insurance cover.  My understanding is that that happens only when there has been a fundamental breach of the policy.  The BTSB lost its insurance some time ago.  What was known by its insurers?  Was the Minister or the Department told about it and, if so, when?</P>
      <P>The family of the late Brigid McCole have posed questions to the Minister which deserve answers.  In particular the Minister must answer why the BTSB was permitted to manufacture anti-D unlawfully and without a licence under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, from 1970 to 1984.  That question raises fundamental issues that need to be addressed immediately.  Will the Minister explain why retrospective product authorisations were issued in 1994 by the Department of Health?  Did the then Minister for Health approve those authorisations and was that done in the knowledge that the product was contaminated over the period for which retrospective authorisations were issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> A limited inquiry will not tell us what was known in the Department of Health when the expert group report was first commissioned.  Who are the people who were not available to the group for interview?  What documents were not seen by them?  A limited inquiry may not tell us that.  It certainly will not tell us if the claim by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in the Dáil that the Department of Health acted properly is true.</P>
    <P>It will not tell us the information the Department's representative on the BTSB took back to his Minister in 1993-94. Neither will it tell us if the relatives of decesed victims who were identified as having got the infected product have been notified.  It will not tell us why the Minister told the Dáil on 1 May last that when the clinical diagnosis of hepatitis C was given to his Department and to the expert group, &ldquo;documentary evidence in this regard was not sought or required&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems a remarkable coincidence that routine research showed the anti-D problem at that time in 1993-94 and not earlier.  Was there a reason an informal inquiry was chosen by the then Minister for Health?  Why has the BTSB suddenly admitted liability now?  What was discovered in the BTSB review mentioned by the Minister last week?  Who authorised the intransigence which Deputy Shatter spoke of in Mrs. McCole's case?  Who else will get an admission of liability now?  Will it apply to those forgotten men, women and children who got hepatitis C from blood transfusions?  These questions should all be answered, whether by the Minister or by the judicial inquiry.  On the basis of his refusal to answer parliamentary questions fully, the Minister is certainly not going to answer these questions.</P>

      <P>Here is a Minister whose political skills are legendary.  &ldquo;Michael Noonan&rdquo;, the reports say, &ldquo;is politically skillful.&rdquo;  That means he gets things done, can handle <Col N="1976" /> the difficult tasks, and that he will fight you to a standstill for what he believes in.  If there ever was an issue that demanded political skills, it was the hepatitis C issue.</P>
      <P>Here was a situation where the State effectively poisoned its own citizens, where the State intervened at what is arguably the point of most vulnerability in the life of a woman, when she gives birth to her baby, and at that acutely vulnerable time, in the guise of therapy, delivered death by instalments.</P>
      <P>The State was the only source of therapy open to these women and others including haemophiliacs and kidney patients.  The State-sponsored, Stateregulated, State-promoted, State-owned Blood Transfusion Service Board was the sole supplier of the product.  The professionals taking care of these patients used the product without a moment's hesitation.  Generations of trustworthiness backed each container of blood, plasma or anti-D.</P>
      <P>This was not a private sector company which might skimp in order to make profits, not that I am suggesting the private sector is rife with companies skimping on detail for that purpose. There was no profit motive.  There was a national responsibility devolving upon a top manager and a top doctor within the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
      <P>The only supplier did not live up to that national responsibility.  The only supplier did not just make one mistake; it failed to meet standards implicit in the most basic housekeeping, over a long period.  The only supplier did not justify the trust placed in it by the nation.  The only supplier betrayed that trust.  The only supplier delivered a potent toxin to shorten and constrain the lives of victims who should have been in their prime.</P>
      <P>Many of my colleagues in the House will know the traditional Irish interpretation of the passages of human life: Fiche Bliain ag fas, Fiche Bliain faoi rath.  Twenty years a-growing, and Twenty years a-flourishing.  There can be no doubt that this Minister knows that simple saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> There can be no doubt that the Minister knows, too, that an arm of the State, a body under the aegis of his Department, stepped into that sequence and changed it utterly for victims.  Instead of 20 years a-flourishing, the State gave these victims an indeterminate sentence. Not even 20 years a-dreading, or 20 years a-withering because of the effects of hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Some of the victims would die in a very few years.  Some would survive much longer, but not one of those survivors will have one single day without its physical reminder of their condition, without its clenching cramp of fear.</P>
    <P>We know that the Minister learnt about this national disgrace, although precisely when he learned about it, we do not know.  This Government of openness, transparency and accountability has not been open on this issue.  We do not know when the Minister learnt about it.</P>

      <P>We do not know what the Minister before him knew about it or how much he knew. How much precisely did Deputy Howlin know when he was in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us give the current Minister his due.  This Minister of great political skill certainly did take action.  What action? Did this Minister go public and say that <Col N="1978" /> national standards had been broken? Did this Minister go public and admit that the pact between citizens and the health service had been broken by the health service?</P>
    <P>Did this Minister admit culpability and force the State agency involved to admit culpability?  Did this Minister take swift action against the officers of this agency to ensure that justice was not just done but was seen to be done? Did this Minister reach out to the women the State had poisoned and say &ldquo;I will not submit you to a process which will waste any of your remaining days or force you to justify what the State pays out to you&rdquo;?  Did this Minister promise the nation, whose trust had been so lethally betrayed, that he would uncover every last detail of the scandal and publish it without fear?</P>
    <P>What this Minister actually did was to execute a politically skilful coup.  He did a politically skilful deal, a payoff.  Individuals were persuaded to remove themselves from their positions of responsibility to retire, into the kindly shadows with a kindly lump sum.  It was very skilful and it was very wrong.</P>
    <P>It was a deal which prevented the truth from coming out, and which set the Minister and the Department of Health, vested with the healthcare of the nation, on a course of willful conflict with the interests of their citizens.  It started them on a course of further victimising the victims, of protecting the system at the expense of the human beings that system is supposed to serve. It was very skilful, and it was a tragedy. For a long time we have watched this Minister play hardball with the lives of women victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister has engaged in bare knuckle politics when his handling of this issue has been called into question. He has coined the expression &ldquo;the blame game&rdquo; in an attempt to excuse himself from any responsibility. However, the Minister fails to face up to the fact that he is the current Minister for Health.  He is the one charged with political responsibility and the one who must take the action.  He has to stop <Col N="1979" /> passing the buck and accept that he is the first Minister for Health who has all the facts about this affair, and he is the one who has to make a judgment on how the State should respond.</P>
    <P>This is where the Minister has fallen down most seriously.  He appears to have decided to stand back from the entire issue because he was a defendant in the action.  All his focus has been on a compensation tribunal rather than making sure the truth emerged.  The first thing the victims of this scandal asked for was the truth and that has been the commodity most denied to them by the Minister Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>Justice delayed means justice denied. As a consequence, the public interest has not been served in this instance.  If it had, the Minister would not have attacked those of us on this side of the House who highlighted that the expert group was not shown all the files relating to the infection of anti-D.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also stand accused of withholding information from this House and, with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, of having misled it on a number of occasions.  I will outline those.  It is scandalous that even though the hepatitis C affair has been raised on 20 separate occasions in the Dáil, the first time the Minister revealed new information and admitted the expert group report was incomplete was on RTE television last Monday night.  This reflects how the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, regard this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given some of the most extraordinary reasons as to why he did not come clean with the truth before now.  He said that he could not establish a judicial inquiry as he could not afford to risk public confidence in the blood supply.  Does this mean that he was willing to maintain confidence on a false basis?</P>

      <P>It reflects the level of Government panic on this hepatitis C issue.  Another dubious claim made in recent days by the Minister relates to why he did not set up a judicial inquiry before now despite demands from the victims and Opposition parties.  The Minister claimed he did not want to waste taxpayers' money on a court case and a judicial inquiry and that the court case could have served as the tribunal of inquiry.  This is contrary to what he told the Seanad on 20 June when he said there would not be some kind of judicial inquiry when the first case came before the High Court.  He stated in the Official Report, volume 148 at column 109: &ldquo;The purpose of that case is not to have some kind of judicial inquiry; it is to enable a particular person to pursue a claim for damages&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Another fallacy constructed by the Minister which has been the subject of much comment relates to his distancing of the Blood Transfusion Service Board from the State.  Why has this divide been created?  It did not exist until now. Every time the Minister met the victims of the hepatitis C scandal he indicated he was representing not just himself but also the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board was established in 1965 by an Order made under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  Under that legislation it is answerable to and regulated and funded by the Government.  There would be no such body if the Minister had not made an establishment order.  It is specified in section 7 (2) (c) of the Act <Col N="1981" /> that if the Blood Transfusion Service Board faces legal action the Minister can take over those proceedings.  If he is dissatisfied with the way the Blood Transfusion Service Board is being run he can revoke the establishment order.</P>
    <P>The State and the Blood Transfusion Service Board are therefore profoundly and legally linked.  It is a nonsense for the Minister to construct a Chinese wall between himself and the Blood Transfusion Service Board for the truth is that if he wanted to acknowledge that the Blood Transfusion Service Board had acted incorrectly he could have accepted the wrongdoing on its part.  It was wrong for him to claim in the Dáil last week that he could not direct the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  He can, but for political reasons, he wants to build a fictitious divide between himself and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>Another matter that needs to be addressed is why the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, misled the Dáil about the expert group report.  In March, after several court orders were obtained, the blood bank eventually found a file that showed that the Blood Transfusion Service Board knew in 1976 of the diagnosis of infective hepatitis.  It was clear from its report that the expert group had not seen this file and I raised the matter in the Dáil.  On 28 March the Minister of State said the expert group had the full information and denied that this was new information.  The Minister did the same in the Dáil on 1 May and 11 June. The Minister of State maintained this cover up in the Dáil on 12 June.</P>
    <P>The first time the Minister acknowledged that information and witnesses were withheld from the expert group was last week.  He said that &ldquo;perhaps the new documents did add&rdquo; to the information that was known about the hepatitis C scandal.  On Monday night on RTE television he confirmed for the first time that the expert group were not given all the information.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has decided to amend the <Col N="1982" /> Government's amendment because we find the wording reprehensible.  The Minister is looking for commendation for the way he has handled this fiasco. Any fair-minded person would have to say that commendation is not due to a person who presided over a campaign of intimidation against a sick, frail Donegal mother.  The Minister does not deserve commendation because he refused for two years to listen to the four simple demands of the victims &mdash; the demands for truth, an admission of liability, an apology and a statutory tribunal.</P>
    <P>Mrs. McCole was a woman of honest values.  She neither drank nor smoked. Yet, she died of a condition that normally affects alcoholics and drug addicts.  As her family's letter points out, all she ever wanted was the truth and an explanation of what happened.  She wanted those who had poisoned her life and who have wrecked the lives of her husband and 12 children to be made accountable in public.  For two years the Minister facilitated those who wanted to frustrate the truth.  He deserves no commendation from this House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has always sought the truth in this affair.  That is the reason we proposed a judicial inquiry some time ago.  While we have yet to see what the terms of reference of the tribunal will be, the Government's amendment indicates that its remit may be very narrow, limited only to medical matters.  A tribunal looking at the medical issues only will not serve the public interest.  It is important that the inquiry looks at how the State handled this issue.  This can be done quickly and cheaply as much of the groundwork has already been done for the court cases and by the expert group.  It would be a travesty if only part of the truth was to emerge.</P>
    <P>While inevitably there is concern about costs, I resent the constant throwaway remarks by the Minister and others on the Government side of the House about a &ldquo;beef tribunal mark two&rdquo;.  The victims are not cattle or sides of beef and the issue is not about export credit insurance.  It is about 1,600 lives and more which have been put at risk <Col N="1983" /> because of the negligence of a State agency.</P>
    <P>The final part of our amendment relates to the scheme of compensation. We have sought from the beginning a statutory compensation tribunal rather than the Minister's <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, in the light of recent revelations, is seriously flawed because under clause 8 no liability is acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Even last night the Minister was trumpeting about his compensation scheme.  At every opportunity he has pushed people to it rather than to the courts.  I have queried before why he is so intent on pushing people along this route and how he could spend millions of pounds advertising it but would not allow any money up to now for a judicial inquiry.  In time it may be shown that he has short changed hepatitis C victims.  This could happen in particular in cases where final awards have been accepted.  The Minister was almost urging people to take final awards when he spoke to the Dáil on 12 December 1995. I understand that 110 of the 140 or so awards are in full and final settlement. My legal advice is that, even with the new revelations, those with final awards may have difficulty if they want to make new claims.</P>
    <P>There are also questions to be answered about what the liability from outside the State could be.  It is interesting to note that an amendment has been made by the Minister to the scheme of compensation to add the words &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; to the section defining those entitled to claim.  What was his intention in making this addition?  Who is he excluding?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes it is imperative that the scheme of compensation is stood down while the judicial inquiry is proceeding.  It is wrong that the chairman of the compensation tribunal is being used by the Government.  The goalposts have been moved and there should be no further play until all the facts are established.  Further awards should not be made until there is an outcome on the liability issue.  While this <Col N="1984" /> will inconvenience some it will ensure a swift response and conclusion to the tribunal of inquiry.  Depending on what is discovered by the judicial inquiry, the victims should be granted the statutory compensation from the tribunal following the inquiry.</P>
    <P>In the programme for Government there was a promise of fair compensation and fair treatment for the hepatitis C victims.  It is impossible to reconcile that statement with what has happened in this affair.  A Herculean campaign was mounted to make sure Mrs. McCole would not get to the truth. The State co-operated vigorously in the cover up and the Minister will be remembered always as the man who presided over a set of legal teams that tried every trick in the book to frustrate Mrs. McCole's legal action.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left and the Labour Party also have questions to answer. One Democratic Left Deputy &mdash; I regret it was a female Deputy &mdash; accused the victims and their lawyers of manufacturing or, to use her own words, &ldquo;peddling&rdquo; fear in the last debate on this issue before the summer recess. That Deputy owes the victims and their lawyers an apology.  Labour and Democratic Left Deputies should reject the Government amendment and support the Fianna Fáil one.</P>
    <P>Some Members on the Government side of the House hope this is the last they will hear of hepatitis C.  Many on the Government side have expressed amazement that the issue has been raised so many times.  I am amazed that the issue had to be raised so many times and it should be a matter of shame for Deputies in the Government parties.</P>
    <P>I reject and resent the comments made tonight by a number of Deputies opposite that this issue has been used as a political football or has been politicised by Members on this side of the House.  The truth of this matter has been brought out and we eventually got what was required from the beginning, a proper tribunal of inquiry, only by constant harassment of the Minister in this House.  To give him credit, he <Col N="1985" /> admitted last night there was constant harassment from this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the 20th time the controversy has been debated in a major way in the Dáil but it will be debated on many more occasions before it ends.  There is a simple equation in this controversy to which I have referred many times.  This problem will not go away because hepatitis C will not go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five questions the Minister must refer to the tribunal of inquiry. Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board use plasma from a patient undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange when it was unsafe to do so? Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board ignore the ample warnings of jaundice, hepatitis and adverse reactions to anti-D in 1977 and again take no steps when it was informed of the infection of anti-D with hepatitis C on 16 December 1991?  Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board not inform the infected women in 1991, and why did it not report the infection to the Department of Health, as it was obliged by law to do?  Why was the Blood Transfusion Service Board permitted to manufacture anti-D unlawfully and without a licence under the Therapeutic <Col N="1986" /> Substances Act, 1932 from 1970 to 1984?</P>
    <P>In its letter of 20 September 1996 the Blood Transfusion Service Board admitted liability in the McCole case and apologised, but only in the context of a threat that were she to proceed with a case for aggravated exemplary damages and not succeed, it would pursue her for costs.  What was the justification for this threat?  These are the questions posed by the husband and the 12 children of the late Brigid McCole.  In her memory, and to ensure that nobody ever again has to go through what Mrs. McCole went through at the hands of the State &mdash; the State is indicted in relation to the McCole case &mdash; the Minister must answer these questions and refer them for further answer to the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the family of the late Brigid McCole.  It is a tragedy that this woman died trying to pursue the truth. I believe 1996 will be long remembered as the year in which two women lost their lives pursuing the truth.  In June of this year we mourned the loss of Veronica Guerin, a woman apart, whose efforts to find out what went on in the criminal underworld knew no bounds. Veronica Guerin stood up to appalling threats.  She would never have taken &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer.</P>
      <P>Eight days ago, another brave woman, Brigid McCole, a 54 year old mother of 12 from Donegal, died trying to find out the truth.  All she wanted to know, as her family said yesterday, was the reason she was infected with hepatitis C by this State.  In order for her to establish that fact, she had to fight a David and Goliath battle against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that neither the Minister nor his predecessor were responsible for contaminating women with blood products that resulted in hepatitis C.  This is not a personal issue.  This is about a medical scandal and it is also about a <Col N="1987" /> political scandal.  I want to deal with both aspects of the scandal tonight.</P>
    <P>How did the Minister conduct the case against Brigid McCole?  First, the woman sought anonymity.  I can think of no area of our lives about which we are more private than health matters.  The doctor-patient relationship is known to be a confidential one.  As Deputy Shatter said, rapists, sex abusers and others are entitled to anonymity.  Is it not tragic that the Attorney General took a case to ensure this woman revealed her name? Brigid McCole came from a small rural community in Donegal.  She was entitled to anonymity and to have her privacy protected.  Last night the Minister went to great pains to say that the reason he set up the compensation tribunal in the way he did was to protect the privacy of the people involved.  If the Minister was interested in privacy, the Attorney General, acting on behalf of the Government, would not have sought an application to have this woman's name disclosed.</P>

      <P>The Minister engaged a team of medical people who said Mrs. McCole would be able to stand trial on 8 October.  She is now dead.  Her lawyer's application to have an early trial was refused on the basis that the State was not ready.  The worst thing the Minister did was to try to use the Statute of Limitations, a trickster's plea when there is no moral defence, to have the case thrown out for technical reasons.  That was the most disgraceful <Col N="1988" /> aspect of all.  The State tried to say that because this woman did not take her action in time, it would have to be dismissed for technical reasons, even though she did not, and could not, have known the reason for her illness until 1994.  That brave woman's battle against the State is something for which we should all be grateful.  Like Veronica Guerin's death, the death of Brigid McCole has brought about a change in the Government's attitude to this matter.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister chastised my party, and again this evening Fine Gael Deputies said we should not make a political issue of this case.  If the infection of 1,600 women with hepatitis C by this State is not a political issue, I do not know what is.  This is a parliamentary democracy and my job as an Opposition leader is to ask hard questions and seek the truth.</P>
      <P>During November 1994, the Minister's predecessor on occasion accused us of playing politics with the victims of Father Brendan Smyth.  This Minister came to office because of a failure on the part of certain people to be accountable. All we seek to do in Opposition is to make the Minister accountable.  He is not responsible for the contamination of these women but he is politically responsible for the way in which he has handled matters for the past 22 months. He is responsible also for the way in which the State's case was conducted and he is responsible to this House to answer questions.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the Progressive Democrats did not raise this matter on many occasions.  Since he came to office, the Minister has answered parliamentary questions on 12 occasions.  My party tabled 12 priority questions.  One in every three of those priority questions related to this issue and the others related to other scandals like the failure to publish the Kelly Fitzgerald report, the Trudder House issue and many issues of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our party spokesperson in this area is Senator Cathy Honan, one of the <Col N="1989" /> people who received the anti-D product. Thankfully, she was not infected. She underwent surgery last week, but this morning she called me, furious at what the Minister had said here last night.  People in Positive Action know that Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, on behalf of her party, and Senator Cathy Honan on behalf of our party, have acted responsibly throughout on this issue.  Indeed, Jane O'Brien is on record as acknowledging that fact.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute too to Jane O'Brien, because without her and her organisation much of what is now unfolding would never have come out. This is about accountability.  That is why the motion is down this evening. Numerous efforts were made by my party and Fianna Fáil to get the Minister to answer questions.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to the fact, as mentioned in this House, on 20 occasions.  Although the Minister said on television on Monday night that he always believed the truth would come out through a judicial inquiry, the manner in which he and his Government behaved makes it clear he never wanted that case to go ahead.  In any event, as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said this evening, on 20 June he told the Seanad that that case was not a judicial inquiry and never could be.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, said in November 1994 that without the truth there is no foundation for good Government and Ministers must not conceal the truth from the Dáil.  He said that if questions are not answered the Ceann Comhairle should be given special power to require a Minister to give more answers.  That power was never brought into effect.  There were 35 questions down today and only three were answered.  That is appalling.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday when I asked him if the tribunal would deal with the political as well as the medical aspects that this Government had shown on every occasion where a question of political accountability arose it was willing to take its responsibilities seriously in this House and to answer questions fully and openly.  He said that political accountability was not a matter for a judge but for this House.  I would like to know why the questions were not answered today.  I would also like to know why the Minister dismissed it and said it was not new information when we became aware that in 1976-77 the Blood Transfusion Service Board knew that donor X, whose plasma was used to make the anti-D product, had infective hepatitis. When we raised that in the Dáil on 28 March the Minister said to stop codding the women and read the report.  Where in the report can we see that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to know why on several occasions in the Dáil the Minister tried to distance himself from the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Why did he take such credit for seeking and securing the resignations of two officers? Why did he do a deal with them?  A deal was done and the Minister should not claim he was not responsible.  Under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, it is a fully owned subsidiary of the Minister and his Department.  The Minister appointed all 12 members of the board. A deal was done with two officers and today is the first time we have seen the nature of that deal.  It was a very generous deal in relation to one of those officers, indeed in relation to both, because one had not been there very long.  We will now have an inquiry, even though a deal has been done with two persons.  They were not suspended on full pay pending an inquiry.  The deal is done, signed sealed and delivered.  We <Col N="1991" /> will now find out who was responsible, but will they be made accountable?</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not send all the files relating to this case to the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Last Friday morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; Deputy Shatter wondered why the Director of Public Prosecutions had not taken action in this case.  In a very unusual step the Director of Public Prosecutions issued a statement that afternoon.  He said he had complaints from two citizens but could not investigate the matter because all the relevant facts had not been placed before his office for consideration. Why were the facts not placed before the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration? Would this happen in any other country?  We know what happened in France and elsewhere.  Why is it that in Ireland nobody is ever held accountable whether they are politicians or officials? If accountability means anything and if an Opposition is doing its job it must ask hard and searching questions.  The day the Opposition stops asking questions is the day democracy is dead.</P>
    <P>Last night when the Minister was being asked questions across the floor he said he did not have time and wanted to stick to his script.  I will sit down after I pose four questions and give him time to answer them.  When did the Minister know that the Blood Transfusion Service Board had on its files the fact that donor X in 1976 had been diagnosed at the time as having infective hepatitis?  I want to know why the Minister told the Dáil that was not new information.  I want to know why the Minister insisted, even last night, that that is in the expert committee's report, and I want him to tell me on what page it is.  Finally I want to know why the Minister did not refer all the files in this case to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I will now give the Minister an opportunity to answer those four simple questions.</P>

An English poet whose name I do not remember referred to &ldquo;the measured truth that tells the blacker lies&rdquo;.  As far as I am concerned, we have had the measured truth.  We have not had the facts but a partial U-turn; we will have an inquiry into why the medical contamination took place.  Equally I want to know why there has been such political contamination and why the women, particularly that brave woman, were treated so disgracefully by this State and by the agents of this State.  The Minister is responsible.  He is the person who is charged on behalf of the public with administering our health services.  He is the person who should answer questions and this is the place where they should be answered in a parliamentary democracy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Oil Price Increase.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for coming in to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue attracted so little media attention that when it was brought to my notice by some oil distributors I wondered if it were true.  The office of the Director of Consumer Affairs received <Col N="2003" /> complaints about the matter and people telephoned an RTÉ radio programme this morning about it.  There has been a dramatic increase in the price of home heating oil and kerosene in the past eight weeks.  A reduction of 1 penny or 2 pence in the price of a gallon of petrol would make headlines and oil companies would boast about reducing the price of their product to the consumer, industry and so on, but nobody seems to care when the hard pressed consumer has to pay £40 or £50 more for 1,000 litres of home heating oil.</P>
    <P>The office of the Director of Consumer Affairs informed me that it does not have control over the matter, that oil companies can charge what they want for their product.  I was informed the price is dictated by market forces, but it appears oil companies are operating a cartel to keep prices high. All oil companies have increased their prices.</P>
    <P>Nobody seems able to tell me why these prices have suddenly risen.  There have been vague suggestions that it is because of the situation in Iraq.  There is also a suggestion that the costs are associated with the oil refinery at Whitegate where costs have risen resulting in dearer oil.  I have also been told there is a new EU Directive on low sulphur diesel which has led to the increase.  Does this mean another process has to be undertaken at Whitegate resulting in additional costs?  If that is the case, why is only home heating oil and kerosene affected?  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter for me.</P>
    <P>If what happened with home heating oil was repeated with petrol and diesel it would have a dramatic impact on the costs associated with industry.  I have been informed that the price of diesel has gone up recently by up to 25p per gallon and there was a smaller increase in the price of petrol of 1p per gallon this week.  However, these do not appear to have attracted any attention. If this continues it could lead to job losses and a rise in inflation which our economy does not need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> I am not aware of any price increases occurring in our neighbouring European countries.  If that is the case, we need to know why it is happening here in isolation.  The Minister must take effective action to stem these increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware from previous statements by me and my predecessors, in recent years the policy of successive Governments has been to promote the model of free and fair competition generally with the aim of creating greater price competition and wider consumer choice.  From this point of view, the price of petroleum products was decontrolled in September 1991, with the entry into force of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>Oil companies or petrol retailers are not obliged, therefore, to give me advance notice of their intention to increase prices or margins.  The rationale for this is that competition reigns.  I understand that at present there are in excess of 300 distributors engaged in selling home heating oil, while there are 12 companies which import this product in wholesale quantities.  Thus there is no shortage of wholesalers and retailers and, therefore, there ought not to be a shortage of competition.  Supplier competition need not however always be synonymous with low or falling prices. It all depends on market fundamentals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, information provided to me by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications indicates the underlying factors behind the increase in home heating oil prices over the past two months.  Oil companies vary their prices in line with the basic price of oil products on the international market and also reflect other factors such as excise duty and compulsory purchase of supplies from Whitegate. Crude oil prices have risen from $19 per barrel at the end of July to $23.50 today, having reached $24 per barrel during September.  Prices for gas oil, from which home heating oil is derived, rose from $177 per tonne at the end of July <Col N="2005" /> to $233 per tonne at the beginning of October.  The rise in crude oil prices was influenced by, among other things, concerns regarding stability in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Demand for home heating oil is also traditionally higher at this time of the year throughout northern Europe as winter approaches.  Increased demand tends to exert upward pressure on wholesale prices.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications collects statistics on consumer prices of oil products for the purposes of providing information on the operation of the oil market in Ireland to the EU Commission.  Based on these returns, average final domestic prices for home heating oil have been as follows in recent months: on 1 July 1996 &mdash; 25.2p per litre; on 5 August 1996 &mdash; 25.3p per litre; on 2 September 1996 &mdash; 25.7p per litre and on 7 October 1996 &mdash; 28.5p per litre.</P>
    <P>Essentially, therefore, the oil market &mdash; for a variety of reasons including seasonal factors and geopolitical developments &mdash; seems to be signalling higher prices on grounds of uncertainty and risk assessment.  That said, it is also the case that the State must be ever vigilant in the interest of the consumer and in favour of full-blown competition.  In this regard and on this issue I intend to keep in close contact with my colleagues, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has responsibility for competition policy, and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, whose Department monitors developments in the energy sector, with a view to ensuring that the consumer is not exploited, that competition policy prevails and that inflation is kept under control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He is standing in for the Minister, but on an important matter such as this I would have expected the Minister to make herself available to respond to it.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for accepting this item on the Adjournment. I want to bring to the attention of the House the fact that there is a severe problem in Clonakilty town concerning primary education for boys.  This problem has been ongoing for a number of years and last year the parents, teachers and the management got together and worked out a proposal with the Department of Education whereby the senior boys would move to the infant boys' school if the local urban district council made a site available.  The local UDC co-operated, the land was signed over and the provisions were made for this extension.  In May this year the plans and specifications were forwarded to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>It now transpires that the Department was less than serious about this matter and the local parents, teachers and management are taken aback and quite annoyed about the fact that the Department of Education did not reciprocate their very generous accommodation for this development.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State to give immediate sanction to this project.  It is not very expensive.  It is a commitment which the Department has given.  In the boys' primary school teachers and pupils are seeking to carry on an education system in primitive conditions.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me highlight this problem and I await, with some expectation, the Minister's response to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to <Col N="2007" /> outline to the House the Department of Education's intention in relation to the accommodation problems facing both the teachers and pupils of Clonakilty national school.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is aware that the school has a current staff of a principal, eight assistant teachers and a resource teacher.  The enrolment on 30 September 1995 was 230 pupils.</P>
      <P>The school is currently situated on two sites in Clonakilty.  This is following the amalgamation between the senior boys' national school and the junior boys' national school.  It is proposed to site the newly amalgamated school in the junior boys' building.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to provide additional classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation.  To facilitate this extension the school was requested to purchase approximately two acres of land adjoining the rear of the school.  The school management has confirmed that this has been finalised and the Department can now progress the project.</P>
      <P>The building project at the school was included in the 1995 primary school capital programme.  The decision to include the project must be viewed as the start of a process involving enrolment projections, confirmation of the brief, sketch scheme, detailed sketch, planning permission-fire certificate and tender.</P>
      <P>This project is at the early stages of architectural planning.  The architects nominated by the school to oversee the building project have liaised with the Department's technical advisers.  Their outline proposals are currently being examined within the Department and when the examination has been completed the Department will contact the school management.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the Department to overcome the present difficulties.  The Minister accepts the urgency of the case and fully appreciates the concerns of the school authorities, teachers, and parents of pupils at Clonakilty national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> The Deputy can be assured of the Minister's desire to see an immediate improvement in the accommodation available at the school.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Casualisation of Jobs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time when people were employed mainly on a casual basis.  Stories we heard in the past about Dublin docks aptly illustrate the position.  At that time people turned up for work at 7 a.m. and were told that a number of them would be employed and the rest of them could go home. That practice seems to be returning.</P>
      <P>Casual and part-time jobs are creeping in.  I am not talking about a firm that takes on a part-time employee because a full-time job might not be justified. The casualisation of work is reflected in many ways.  It is happening in the retail trade, with which the Minister has been dealing, in terms of extending opening hours, Sunday trading and zero hour contracts.  The casualisation of work has also crept into many multinationals which compete with labour practices abroad.  It was approved and allowed to a small extent as a special concession as part of the restructuring under the Cahill plan in Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>According to the plans that practice is now being adopted in a major way in CIE where permanent jobs are being replaced by temporary ones, all in the name of competition.  CIE is trying to compete with private firms whose workers may be on the dole, paid under the table or have ridiculously low salaries to justify entitlement to family income supplement.  There are all types of fiddles going on and the State organisation must compete and be seen to be doing so with these fiddles.  It is bad enough for private firms to do away with jobs, but the State and State agencies must not be allowed do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is allowing years of progress, fought for and won by the trade union movement, to unravel around us. The casualisation of work is bad and is contrary to trade union principles.  I do not understand how a Labour Party <Col N="2009" /> Minister can allow that happen.  That amazes and horrifies me.  It is bad for the Government to allow firms, be they private or State, to be subsidised by engaging in various fiddles with the Department of Social Welfare through paying low salaries to enable workers obtain family income supplement or allowing workers remain on the dole.  It is bad for society when we encourage breadwinners, certainly in the case of CIE, to take low grade jobs with a basic salary of about £200 per week.  We encourage these people to sell their jobs and take a redundancy package.  They are then replaced on a temporary basis for a couple of hours at peak times in the week.</P>
    <P>We all genuflect to disadvantaged suburbs in Dublin where there are many housing areas where few people have jobs.  This creates a division between the haves and the have-nots.  There will be many houses in one area with two jobs and another area with no jobs at all. Partners are encouraged to take a part-time job.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with this issue in relation to Sunday trading and retailing. I ask her for a statement on what progress she has made because I understood legislation was to be introduced on that matter.  When are we going to see it or can she make a commitment to it?  Private firms may be using casual labour and we may have to live with that, but it is a disgrace that we are encouraging the Government and semi-State bodies to do it.  They are acting like small private fly-by-night companies. When will the Minister introduce legislation to stop this practice?  In the meantime can she stop State agencies discrediting the system and turning back years of progress fought for by trade unions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not come to the House to deal with the specific issues of CIE, because they are obviously a matter for <Col N="2010" /> the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Noel Ahern's concern about increasing casualisation of our workforce where it is accompanied by disregard for workers' basic rights which have been hard fought for and won by the trade union movement and legislated for under the aegis of my Department. I recently met a delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions led by the General Secretary, Peter Cassells, to discuss their document on atypical work and new labour standards in relation to the different kinds of working arrangements which are becoming increasingly commonplace.</P>
      <P>In today's market the old ways of the 40 hour week and the steady job are changing.  Firms are hiring people to meet peaks and valleys in production. We cannot ignore these changes.  We need to ensure that workers providing the flexibility which is keeping our economy competitive are not undermined in terms of their basic employment rights. We must strengthen the employment rights of atypical workers.  This has been done by successive Governments.  It is continuing to be done and is something I am committed to, having been an atypical worker for most of my working life.</P>
      <P>In 1991 we introduced legislation which extended holiday and other rights on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to part-time workers working more than eight hours a week. Full social welfare rights also apply to part-time workers on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. Workers employed through employment agencies are now included in the mainstream of our employment rights legislation.  I have asked my Department to undertake a study on how we can extend the protection of employment rights to new forms of employment contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the zero hour contracts, I will be introducing legislation which is almost at its final stage with the parliamentary draftsman &mdash; the working time Bill will give effect to the EU Directive in relation to working hours.  I will also implement protections in relation to the <Col N="2011" /> areas of zero hour contracts and Sunday working.</P>
    <P>At European level, an EU Directive in relation to protecting part-time and atypical workers was prepared by the Commission.  The British vetoed it and it is now on the social Protocol route. The social partners are discussing it and I hope we can introduce new EU legislation to agree protection for part-time and atypical workers across the community. My Department is continuing to work on how we can strengthen protection for people who no longer have the contracts our fathers had in their employment.  We want to ensure that workers working in different ways enjoy full protection of their employment rights.  If workers are employed on a casual basis they will not have the same dedication, training, skill and input as when their rights are respected and they are given the full protection given to traditional full-time and typical workers.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dairy Hygiene Grant Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to deal briefly with this important issue.  On Friday evening last without any forewarning, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry terminated the dairy hygiene grant scheme.  This scheme was introduced in recent years to progress the implementation of EU regulations on dairy hygiene.  It was a valued scheme and many farmers I know have applied for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the structure within the dairy industry of large, medium and smaller producers, the capital cost involved in the necessary upgrading of facilities is expensive.  Expense will vary from farm to farm depending on the existing state of the premises.  The ministerial decision to terminate the scheme has come as a shock to the industry at a time when, according to Teagasc's <i>Today's Farm,</i> it is clear that production costs for milk have risen sharply in the past 12 months.  The suspension of this <Col N="2012" /> scheme is a further shock to an ill prepared sector.  It comes in the wake of a recent ministerial suggestion that the number of full-time farmers in the country by the year 2000 will drop to about 60,000 from a present level of probably double that figure.  There are clear implications in this and it borders on the abandonment of many of our small and medium sized farmers.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the immediate possibility of restoring the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.  I support all the points raised by Deputy Kirk.  This scheme was an important scheme, particularly for small farmers. Everyone accepts we have to continue improving the standard of our milk.  The EU wants us to do that and I have no doubt the dairies will continue wanting us to do so.</P>
      <P>These grants help small farmers to provide proper buildings and milking and cooling equipment.  It is serious to suspend the scheme without any prior notice, particularly before all the farmers who wanted to avail of the scheme had an opportunity to do so.  This is a fundamental issue in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan where there are many small farmers dependent on dairying to rear their families.  What does the Minister intend to do about applications not yet processed and work that is only partially completed?  What advice has he for farmers where the dairies will insist on a higher standard of milk on foot of EU recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kirk referred to the Minister's comment last week about the number of farmers being reduced to 60,000.  Deputy Ned O'Keeffe referred to the Minister as the Mansholt of Ireland.  That can rightly be applied to him and not alone with regard to this issue.  Last week in the Dáil he told us we are responsible for the surplus of beef in Europe.  It is not acceptable for the Minister who is President of the Council of Ministers in Europe to make a statement like that when small farmers <Col N="2013" /> are so dependent on beef and milk production for their livelihood.  The surplus comes from the big factory farms in Europe, not from this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has discontinued the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the farm improvement scheme since he came into office.  He has not dealt effectively with BSE.  Deputy O'Keeffe's remark was appropriate on this occasion.  I am particularly concerned about the abolition of the dairy hygiene scheme and I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who is a reasonable man, to use his weight and ask the Minister to ensure this scheme is restored until such time as the farmers who want to avail of it have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  Under the on-farm investment section of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, an allocation of £195 million in Structural Funds was provided for the period 1994-99. It had been anticipated in the national plan published by the previous Government that £245 million would be allocated.  There was, therefore, underfunding of at least £50 million for on-farm investment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of grant aid for investments in upgrading of on-farm dairying facilities had been introduced in September 1994 as part of the operational programme with the objective of assisting dairy farmers in meeting the costs of achieving structural standards required under EU Directive 92/96 EEC.  That underfunding is the main reason it was <Col N="2014" /> necessary to suspend the operation of the scheme last week.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the scheme until its suspension about 7,800 applications were received.  By 4 October about 5,300 of the applications received had been fully processed and some 4,800 have been approved to commence work. This represents a grant commitment of about £25 million.  To date £6 million has been paid to some 1,100 applicants who have completed works to the Department's specifications.  The remaining 2,500 applications will be processed and approvals issued as soon as possible.  Payment of grants in respect of other approvals will be made following completion of validation of the approved works.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the impact the suspension of the scheme will have on my efforts to improve the overall hygiene standards in the dairy sector. Should additional funds become available as a result of the mid term review of Structural Funds, consideration will be given to reintroduction of the scheme in a modified form.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputies that before we came into office in December 1994, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, had to suspend the farm improvement programme because it had run out of funds.  To suspend a scheme is nothing new. However, because of milk hygiene regulations this area needs this type of investment to keep as many dairy farmers as possible on the land and in production. I am sure that it will be one of the priorities when the review of funds comes up for consideration in 1997.  I will convey the Deputies' concern to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 October 1996.</P>

      <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development clearly identifies and addresses the long-term issues affecting the communities on our offshore islands.  As Chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee, my colleague, Deputy Donal Carey, is responsible for co-ordinating the Government's response to the recommendations of the report.  Minister Carey recently visited a number of offshore islands.  He held meetings with island communities and saw at first hand the priority access issues to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The development of access services to our offshore islands was identified in the report as the priority issue and the Government made available an additional £1 million in 1996 specifically for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prioritised programmes of work submitted by the relevant local authorities have been assessed by the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee and recommendations regarding funding were subsequently made.  Minister <Col N="1807" /> Carey recently advised Galway, Donegal and Mayo County Councils of funding for projects included in their programmes of work.  He expects to be in a position shortly to confirm funding to Cork County Council on receipt of details of its priority access projects. Details of all the projects which received funding will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, a total of <Col N="1808" /> £242,250 has been made available to the relevant local authorities to date for projects submitted to the co-ordinating committee.  Decisions regarding a number of other projects submitted in the programmes of work are still under consideration and Minister Carey hopes to be in a position shortly to announce further funding from the financial envelope.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Task Force on Funding Arrangements in the Border Region which is chaired by Minister Carey, reported to the Government in July and the report of the task force has been circulated widely.</P>
      <P>The task force made a number of recommendations to ensure that people are generally aware of the programmes available in the region and to make it as clear and simple as possible for people to apply for funding.</P>
      <P>A pre-application form is being prepared for use in local offices.  A guide to sources of funding and a newsletter will also be published.  The newsletter will include information on projects funded from all the programmes in the region.</P>
      <P>These recommendations which were agreed by Government, are now being put in place by the Department of Finance. A seminar on all funding programmes in the region is being organised so that people working on individual programmes are aware of, and will be able to advise on the programmes available.</P>
      <P>The task force will monitor the implementation of these measures and will make regular reports to the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to establish any other Border funding body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Roadworthiness testing of light goods vehicles was phased in during 1993-94 and is fully operational in line with EC Council Directive 88/449/EEC of 26 July 1988.</P>
      <P>EC Council Directive 91/328 of 21 June 1991 requires those member states, including Ireland, which do not already have a system of periodic roadworthiness testing of cars to have such a system in operation by 1998 in relation to cars over four years old.  The Government has approved arrangements to introduce such a scheme which will have positive impacts in the areas of road safety, the environment and job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal features of the scheme will be as follows: testing will apply to some 750,000 cars over four years old &mdash; including second-hand imports; cars <Col N="1811" /> over four years old will be tested every two years; testing will be phased in, with older cars being tested in 1998 and with all cars over four years old being tested by the end of 1999; testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres operated by a franchise to be appointed following an open competitive tendering process; the level of test fee will be one of the key criteria in the assessment of tender proposals; test centres will be strategically located to minimise the distance motorists will be required to travel for a test and consideration will be given to the use of mobile test centres in more remote areas.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the competition for the testing franchise will be made as soon as possible.  The Minister for Finance is considering the possible extension of the car scrappage scheme, under which up to 25,000 older cars will have been taken off the road by the end of 1996.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any case where mistakes were made in the marking of this year's tidy towns competition. However, in the case of Bruff, County Limerick, the tidy towns committee, while sent the correct marks for the year, was through an error, given an adjudicator's report for a different centre. On the day after the results issued, this error was brought to my Department's attention and rectified.  Apologies were extended to the Bruff committee and the correct adjudicator's report was sent to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware that a small number of the 729 towns and villages which <Col N="1812" /> entered this year's competition have raised concerns about their lower placing, or lower percentage marks, in comparison with their placing or marks in previous years.  This may have arisen, in some cases at least, because following a detailed review of the competition, carried out in close consultation with all relevant interests, the marking scheme and adjudication criteria were totally revamped this year to take account of a much wider spectrum of factors which impact on the built and natural environment in Irish towns and villages. Towns and villages were judged this year by the independent panel of outside adjudicators on the basis of the new criteria.  No direct comparisons can therefore be drawn between a previous year's percentage and those which a town or village achieved this year.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme included, at Annex 2A, an indicative overview of specific projects being considered for the period of the programme, using all available sources of funding &mdash; EU Regional Development and Cohesion Funds and national resources.  This overview is necessarily tentative given the complex statutory and other procedures which must be completed before particular projects can proceed to construction stage and the factors which can impact on progress once construction stage is reached.

The most recently published bulletin indicates that average new house prices increased by 10.5 per cent nationally between the June quarter 1995 and the June quarter 1996.  Factors underlying the increase in prices include strong growth in the economy, historically low interest rates and a ready availability of mortgage finance.</P>

      <P>It is the objective of the Irish Presidency actively and efficiently to promote both the internal agenda of the Environment Council and a leading EU role in wider international business affecting the environment and sustainable development.  Details of the Irish Presidency Programme were formally published in early July by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In the environment area, this programme includes the review of the Community's Fifth Environment Action Programme and draft directives in the areas of water quality, genetically modified micro-organisms and vehicle emissions. Waste management was the theme of the Informal Environment Council in Dublin in July, and is also the subject of a Commission communication to be addressed by Council.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency is also leading and co-ordinating a strong EU input to a number of important international activities concerned with global environmental issues.  In July, I participated in the Second Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change and assisted in the agreement of an important political declaration aimed at intensifying the Berlin Mandate process. With the Environment Commissioner, I have also held discussions with Ministers of the Associated Countries of Central and Eastern Europe regarding the approximation of their environmental laws and standards to EU norms.  Other international meetings to take place during the Irish Presidency include the Third Conference of Parties to the Biodiversity Convention and the Eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.  Overall, it is our intention to ensure that the role of the European Union is maintained as a leading force for progress at international level in dealing with global environmental problems and the promotion of sustainable development.</P>

      <P>The existing system of local authority funding is based on a range of Exchequer grants, combined with a variety of local income sources, including domestic service charges.  It is entirely a matter for local authorities to decide, at their discretion, whether to levy charges, the scale of such charges and arrangements for their collection.  The whole issue of local government funding, including service charges, was examined as part of the professional study of local government financing, published on 27 June 1996.  I intend to publish a strategy paper on local government reform before the end of the year, which will address all the issues involved.</P>
      <P>Where a person defaults on payment of a water charge, local authorities can either pursue the outstanding charge as a simple contract debt through the courts, or they can disconnect the supply. Where a local authority decides to disconnect, it must first, in accordance with the Local Government (Delimitation of Water Supply Disconnection Powers) Act, 1995, obtain an order of the District Court.  The court, which is required to take the personal and household circumstances of the person into account, will not grant an order where hardship is involved.  Before applying to the court, the local authority must issue a series of notifications to the person concerned, involving initial demand, two reminders, two warnings &mdash; which may issue in conjunction with reminders &mdash; and final notice.</P>

      <Col N="1833" /> My Department also organised transport for the Intergovernmental Conference Personal Representatives meeting in Cork on 5 to 7 July as well as for the visits by Coreper 1 Ambassadors to Cork, Waterford, Tipperary and Kilkenny on 12 to 15 September and Coreper 2 Ambassadors to Kerry on 19 to 22 September.</P>
    <P>Contracts for the provision of transport for all these meetings were awarded in accordance with Government tendering procedures.  The names of the companies concerned are listed at Annex 1.</P>

    <P>The level of interest charges on loans is determined in accordance with the rates prevailing in the market at the time of the borrowing.  In relation to the ACC and ICC Banks, the totals supplied above include interest paid on <Col N="1835" /> conventional term borrowings as well as interest payable on inter-bank transactions arising in the normal course of banking business.</P>
    <P>Both the rates and the terms and conditions applying to conventional term borrowings by the above semi-State bodies are reviewed by my Department in advance of the actual borrowings. The ongoing management of the debt, once drawn, is a commercial matter for decision by the boards of the relevant bodies.  I am satisfied that the arrangements which are in place for evaluating these matters are appropriate and satisfactory and that the bodies concerned are conducting their affairs in an efficient and businesslike manner.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes and especially those with families. Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant improvements made over the last two budgets have been achieved through measures aimed primarily towards reducing the average tax take rather than cutting tax rates.  These measures included increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, widening the standard band and introducing the £80 per week PRSI-free allowance. Clearly further progress is needed in reducing the tax and PRSI burden, thereby improving the competitiveness of the economy.  There are, of course, different views as to the form further <Col N="1836" /> reductions in taxation should take, and the groups towards whom relief should be targeted.  The Deputy can be assured that all relevant income tax reduction options will be examined in the run-up to next year's budget.</P>

      <P>My Department engaged the services of a firm providing a comprehensive transport management and hospitality service. The Noble Travel Experience Ltd., for the informal ECOFIN Council meeting in Dublin on 20 to 22 September. This company was awarded the contract on the basis of a single tender as a specialised service, which involved a management and hospitality service as well as supply of a range of vehicles.</P>
      <P>A competition had initially been held for the supply of limousine cars only, for the occasion.  This involved inviting four companies to submit tenders, two of which did so.  The companies invited to submit tenders for the supply of vehicles in the original competition were: Prestige Car and Van Rentals Ltd., Hertz, Murrays Chauffeur Drive Service and Argus Automobiles Ltd.  Following the decision that an integrated transport management and hospitality service was required for the occasion, this original competition was discontinued and those who had submitted tenders were accordingly advised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 115 and 117 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 April, 1995 following the publication of the report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board, I announced a package of measures aimed at ensuring restoration of public confidence in the board. Among the measures announced were changes in the organisation and management of the BTSB.  These included the assignment of Mr. Liam Dunbar, former chief executive officer of St. <Col N="1838" /> James's Hospital, and Professor Shaun McCann, Consultant Haematologist, St. James's Hospital, to work with the board of the BTSB in implementing the necessary improvements required in the workings of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>My announcement followed the retirement on 4 April 1995 of Dr. T. Walsh, former chief medical consultant with the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The terms of the early retirement package for Dr. Walsh were agreed between the board of the BTSB and Dr. Walsh.  Under the provisions of standard public service pension schemes, it is normal practice to add up to a maximum of ten years to actual service for superannuation purposes in the case of certain professional grades.  This provision combined with the terms for voluntary early retirement enabled the board to reach a settlement with Dr. Walsh involving a lump sum of £86,872 and a pension of £29,018 per annum.</P>
    <P>The urgent need to take steps such as management restructuring to restore public confidence in the BTSB as a means of ensuring continuity in blood supplies did not allow for any avoidable delay in vacating the post of chief medical consultant.  Given the terms of Dr. Walsh's contract of employment, any alternative to voluntary early retirement would not have produced an outcome for many months, if not years.</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Keyes, former chief executive officer of the BTSB was employed by the board in 1987 and was due to retire on 1 March 1994.  In February 1994 when it became apparent that there was a possible link between the product human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti D and heptatis C he was requested to continue in office in order to help the board and he agreed to do so until 1 June 1995.  As stated in the report of the expert group &mdash; paragraph 2.12 page 138 &mdash; he, as chief executive officer, was responsible for the group's management functions but not for its medical-scientific functions. Under the terms of his contract of employment and based on his years of service with the BTSB, Mr. Keyes was entitled to a lump sum of £28,000 and <Col N="1839" /> annual pension of £7,000, payable from the BTSB pension fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 October 1996 is in the range of £205.92 &mdash; £218.01 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services to group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.  With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular, in the Eastern Health Board area the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues and my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of this service.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system. Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help or the spouse of a part-time home help is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to previous questions in this House I stated that my Department in consultation with the chief executive <Col N="1840" /> officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.  A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers formed the basis for this examination. Following on from these discussions, I have decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help service carried out by an independent body which will advise on measures to ensure the equity and high quality of the service in respect of both providers and recipients.  I am pleased to say that my Department has invited tenders for this review.  It is expected that the review should be completed in three to four months.</P>

      <P>The amount paid in interest on such loans, in the years 1992 to 1995, comes to £7.4 million approximately over the four years.  These loans were approved by my Department on foot of approval from the Minister for Finance.  The individual loan agreements were entered into following a process of evaluation of competitive bids from the main banking companies. The loans are in respect of hospital equipping and improvement of facilities. in the main.  A number of loans were approved on the basis of a self-financing arrangement, where the benefits accruing through more efficient systems would, over time, produce savings of a long-term nature.</P>

      <P>For the EU ministerial meeting in Adare, County Limerick, three companies were asked to tender for transport.  The companies were Bus Éireann, Roxboro Road, Limerick, Conway Coaches, Raheen, Limerick and Mannings, Croom, County Limerick. Quotations were received from each company and as Conway Coaches submitted the lowest quotations, they were awarded the contract.  Coaches, midicoaches, minibuses and cars were used by Conways throughout the duration of the meeting.  The most cost efficient means of transporting the participants was used at all times.  Transport was also provided by the Mid-Western Health Board minibus fleet at times when these minibuses were not required for routine patient transport services.  Any taxies used were supplied by the company which currently holds the contract for the provision of general taxi services to the Mid-Western Health Board.  That company holds the contract as a result of a public tendering process for a period of 12 months.  In relation to limousine hire, the company that was utilised was Limerick Limousine Hire.  No other limousine company was asked to tender for this aspect of transport as the board was unaware, having consulted locally, of any other company in the area which provided such a service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 101-107, inclusive, and Nos. 109 and 110 together.  The question of funding for the North-West Hospice is a matter for the North-Western Health Board in the first instance.  The board has identified the provision of funding in this regard as a priority in terms of funding available for the provision and development of hospice services.  The board is fully committed to hospice care in the region and has committed funding on a yearly basis to the North-West Hospice group, in addition to the provision of hospice beds and support facilities at the board's community hospitals, as well as the provision of staff training.  It is essential that partnership and co-operation between statutory agencies and voluntary bodies working in this area should be encouraged so as to ensure that services for the terminally ill can be provided in a planned and structured fashion.  I have been advised by the board that its officials meet representatives of the North-West Hospice on a regular basis. A request from the hospice group for a meeting with the board's standing committees is on the agenda for the next meetings of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> The national cancer strategy has been in preparation in my Department for some time now and I intend to publish it in the near future.  The strategy will take account of the views of the cancer strategy group which I established in 1995.  The strategy will deal with the full range of cancer services, including health promotion, screening and early detection, treatment services, and on to rehabilitation and palliative care.  A draft of the strategy has been finalised and has been circulated to other Government Departments for observations. I intend to bring it to Government within the next few weeks and to publish it without delay.  I will then be in a position to examine any proposals in respect of the provision of funding for the further development of hospice care facilities in the North-Western Health Board area.  The question of funding for any development would need to have regard to the objectives of the strategy as well as the overall funding priorities of the North-Western Health Board.</P>

    <P>In the case of hip replacement procedures in Cork, I would like to reiterate that the agreed 1996 baseline at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital was 299 procedures.  The Deputy will wish to know that Cork University Hospital deals with trauma cases rather than elective hip procedures.  This level of <Col N="1847" /> activity reflects my Department's substantial investment in orthopaedic services in Cork in recent years.  I would also like to point out that, in addition to its baseline activity, the board has contracted to carry out a further 45 hip procedures under the 1996 waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>The board has advised that it is confident that the 1996 baseline and waiting list initiative targets will be achieved. Furthermore, I am assured by the board that there has been no cessation of hip procedures for public patients at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, Cork.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the school in question at its failure to secure disadvantaged status.  In 1995, I asked the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre to advise me on the criteria for identifying educational disadvantage. Among the key recommendations made to me were:</P>
      <P>that a more targeted approach be adopted in the selection and support of disadvantaged pupils;</P>
      <P>that dispersed pockets of disadvantage, particularly in rural areas, be targeted;</P>
      <P>that disadvantage supports be limited to 16 per cent of the school-going population.</P>
      <P>At present, it is estimated that 17 per cent of primary pupils are covered by the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>In response to these recommendations, I recently launched a new initiative, Breaking the Cycle, aimed at breaking the cycle of disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the initiative focused on schools in large urban areas which already have disadvantaged area status.  The second phase focused on small/rural schools with fewer than five teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the initiative, a new targeted programme of supports is being made available to 33 selected urban schools and 118 selected rural schools.  All the schools which fell within the scope of this initiative were recently invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the scheme.  The relative <Col N="1860" /> need of all applicants was assessed by the centre on the basis of data submitted by the schools under objective criteria which has been devised by the Education Research Centre.  Unfortunately, based on the information available to my Department, the school referred to by the Deputy was not eligible to apply for inclusion under this initiative.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of Scoil Mhichil Naofa on the 30 September 1995 was 544 pupils.  This enrolment warrants the staffing of a principal and 17 assistant teachers for the 1996-97 school year.  In the circumstances, the post of the 18th assistant has been suppressed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the staffing mentioned, the school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a shared remedial teacher, and two special additional assistant teachers.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, schools have been selected for support under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria which were agreed some years ago between my Department, schools management and the INTO.  The criteria in question took into account such factors as the incidence of unemployment, medical card holding, and localauthority housing occupancy, among the parents of children attending the school.</P>
      <P>Arising from studies carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of education disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary schools were selected for <Col N="1861" /> support under this new initiative by reference to new selection criteria.  The criteria in question have been developed by the Education Research Centre and take on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>The following criteria are involved in the identification of educational disadvangage in both urban and rural settings:</P>
    <P>long-term unemployment (one year or more) of the main breadwinner;</P>
    <P>the family having a medical card;</P>
    <P>living in a lone-parent household;</P>
    <P>the educational level attained by the mother and by the father.</P>
    <P>In the case of urban schools an additional criterion relating to the numbers of children who live in rented local authority accommodation has been used.  In the case of small rural schools, an additional criterion relating to the numbers of children from families in receipt of assistance because of limited incomes from farming was used.</P>

      <P>Special schools for children with disabilities are not covered by the general disadvantaged areas scheme and do not therefore attract disadvantaged status.

      <P>As part of this special arrangement, the school to which the Deputy refers enjoys a special pupil teacher ratio of 14:1.  It also receives a special rate of capitation funding of £229 per child per annum for children under 12 years of age and £372 for children of 12 years or over.</P>

      <P>As the legislation to which the Deputy refers comes within the remit of the Department of the Environment, any changes to these <Col N="1868" /> regulations would be a matter for consideration by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>However, I assure the Deputy that safety is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on its behalf.  All aspects of safety, including carrying capacity, are monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann's safety record since the inception of the scheme speaks for itself, and in that time, no accident has been attributed to the three for two seating arrangement.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for additional classroom accommodation at the school referred to by the Deputy.  In order to meet this need my Department approved grant-aid in June 1996 towards the cost of one additional pre-fabricated classroom at the school. The planning process for the provision of the additional classroom is now at an advanced stage.  However, this process cannot proceed for the moment as the school's management recently applied <Col N="1870" /> for grant-aid towards the cost of a second additional classroom.  The need for this second classroom is currently under consideration by my Department's planning section in the light of the future trend of enrolments at the school.  As soon as a decision is taken the school manager will be notified of the outcome without delay.  My Department's architectural staff will then continue with the planning process.  It is expected that the provision of additional classroom accommodation will address the problem currently being experienced with regard to the remedial and library rooms.</P>

    <P>*I should point out that prior to 1989 Garda recruits were included in the overall strength figures.  Since April 1989, with the introduction of the two year training programme for recruits, only those members who have been attested to the force: i.e. completed Phase 3 of training, are included in the overall strength of the force.  In addition to the current strength of 10,801, there are also 428 probationers in Phases 1, 2, and 3 giving an equivalent to the 1985 number of 11,250 approximately.</P>

      <P>Increases in respect of child dependants payable with most social welfare entitlements are awarded on the basis of either receipt of child benefit or the production of a birth certificate.

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of this allowance is that the applicant must reside alone or with certain excepted categories of people. Included within these excepted categories are persons who are so permanently <Col N="1878" /> incapacitated as to be unable to summon help in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>The person concerned lives with his wife.  The medical evidence submitted in respect of his wife was not such as would, in the opinion of the Department's medical adviser, place her in the permanently incapacitated category referred to above.  The medical adviser considered her able to summon help in an emergency.  Consequently, the application for free telephone rental allowance was rejected.</P>
      <P>However, if the spouse of the person concerned were to qualify for carer's allowance in respect of her husband, he would then qualify for free telephone rental allowance.  The carer's allowance is paid to carers on low income who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention.  This allowance would be payable in lieu of adult dependant's allowance which is already being paid to the spouse.</P>
      <P>Based on the information available it is not possible to say if the conditions for carer's allowance are satisfied in this case.  Detailed information on the scheme and an application form have been issued to the spouse.  Should she feel that she would qualify for this allowance, she should complete and return the form.  Her entitlement to carer's allowance would than be decided and, if she qualified, her husband would be entitled to free telephone rental allowance.</P>

      <P>In the absence of statutory regulation through a Joint <Col N="1881" /> Labour Committee (JLC), or otherwise, rates of pay are a matter for negotiation and agreement between employees and employers, and/or their representatives. I understand that the present dispute in the hotel in question relates to a 3 per cent pay increase under the local bargaining clause of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  Prior to the commencement of strike action this dispute was referred to the Labour Relations Commission for conciliation. Two conciliation conferences were held but the parties failed to reach agreement. The services of the Labour Relations Commission and/or the Labour Court are still available to the parties to help resolve the dispute.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed to his Department and the Irish National Food and Agricultural Organisation Committee regarding the detrimental effects on developing countries of the proposal by Codex Alimentarius to revise the definition of chocolate and chocolate products, thereby reducing the market for cocoa solids; the position which will be taken by the Irish delegation during the discussions on this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 187 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk chocolate is the main chocolate produce manufactured in Ireland.  At its recent meeting held from 30 September 1996 to 2 October 1996 the Codex Committee on Cocoa Products and Chocolate agreed to maintain the existing <Col N="1884" /> codex definitions for milk chocolate which are the same as those set out in Council Directive 73/241/EEC.  This decision, which Ireland supported, should not impact negatively on developing countries.  Also at that meeting a proposal to permit the use of vegetable fat other than cocoa butter, up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the finished weight of chocolate products was discussed but no final decision was made on it.  Council Directive 73/241/EEC provides for the use of a similar level of vegetable fat.  Since the adoption of the Directive this provision has been availed of by Ireland and a number of other member states.</P>

      <P>At an Agricultural Science Association conference some weeks ago, and more recently in the Dáil, I expressed my view that, by the year 2,006, even with EU prices moving closer to world prices, at least 60,000 Irish farmers will be as competitive as any other farmers in the world.  I went on to say that these farmers can produce milk or meat cheaper than anyone else and, with improved economies of scale and greater efficiency, those farmers will be in a position to make a viable income from agriculture by the year 2006.  I also went on to say that if &mdash; as is likely &mdash; EU policy changes go in the direction of lowering prices, there would, of course, need to be additional compensation to protect income generally in the farming sector.</P>

      <P>Under European Union single market rules in the air transport sector, all licensed EU air carriers are free to provide services on any international route within the Union without Government control. However, the question as to whether an airline wishes to inaugurate services or to withdraw services on a particular route is, of course, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgement.  I am not aware of any proposals at present to <Col N="1888" /> inaugurate a new service on the Derry-Dublin route.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal and Dublin &mdash; is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Deputy may be aware that on 5 July 1996 I approved the award of a contract to El Air Exports Limited for the operation of a scheduled Dublin-Donegal-Dublin passenger air service under the Essential Air Services Programme.  The service commenced on 16 August.</P>

      <P>One lease for the purpose mentioned was issued to the company concerned under the foreshore Acts.  This was issued on 28 June 1993 and runs for 99 years from 20 July 1992.</P>
      <P>Two licences under the Dumping at Sea Acts were issued to the same company on 21 December 1995.  One was operative from 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1996 and the other was operative from 1 January 1996 to 30 September 1996.  Both licences have expired and an application for extensions is being processed. I will let the Deputy know the outcome of the application.</P>
