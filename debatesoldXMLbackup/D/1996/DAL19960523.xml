      <P>It is proposed to take statements concerning the extradition warrant issue; No. 5, motion concerning the instrument for the establishment of the restructured Global Environment Facility; and No. 1, Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the statements on the extradition warrants: (i) statements shall be confined to the Minister for Justice and the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party and shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; and (ii) following the statements, the Minister shall take questions for a period not exceeding one hour.  The proceedings on No. 5 shall be brought to a conclusion within one hour and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of the Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of other Members called upon shall not exceed five minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of <Col N="2074" /> State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.</P>

      <P>Having fought all day yesterday to have a debate on this issue and to have the Minister for Justice answer questions on it we are ready for the debate when the House so decides. To run a Parliament there is a need to get the co-operation of Members.  The Taoiseach is beginning to think this is a game.  The Minister for Justice was paired today in order to go to Loughan House and the officials in the Department of Justice were working through the night to prepare a script for the Minister.  At 10 a.m. today the Government Whip rang the Fianna Fáil Whip to say the debate would commence at 10.30 a.m.  The Taoiseach knew that Deputy O'Donnell, who is central to this debate, was thrown out of the House last night, and that Deputy O'Donoghue is in hospital.  Those Deputies are central to the debate.  If the Taoiseach wants to run this House in an orderly manner and get the co-operation of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right in the light of events in the House yesterday that I should take the opportunity to make a further statement on this matter.  My intention in making <Col N="2080" /> this statement is to set the record straight, to set out the facts of this case and to address the specific matters raised in so far as they have relevance to me and my Department.  Deputies will have the opportunity to put questions to me when I finish my statement.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to bear in mind, however, that I am constrained in what I say as the person who was the subject of the request is now before the courts as a result of separate proceedings in this jurisdiction.  Equally, Members should be careful about saying anything which would prejudice either that prosecution or the entitlement to a fair trial. I emphasised this when I answered questions in the House on 15 May and the Taoiseach emphasised it again yesterday. It nevertheless bears repeating.</P>
      <P>I will set out in some detail the sequence of events in this case for the information of Deputies.  Before doing so, I want also to say something about the functions of the different State agencies involved in processing a request for the backing of a warrant submitted under Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, so that the sequence of events can be better understood.</P>
      <P>Warrants are transmitted directly from the requesting police force to the Garda authorities who are responsible for endorsing the warrants for execution in the State in accordance with the provisions of the 1965 Act.  Other agencies which have a role under that legislation are the Attorney General's office by virtue, in particular, of the powers conferred on the Attorney by sections 44A and 44B and the Minister for Justice by virtue of the powers conferred by section 44 of the 1965 Act.  The Chief State Solicitor's office also has a function by virtue of its role in representing the State in proceedings on foot of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Warrants and supporting documentation are examined by the Attorney General's office, first, for the purpose of the powers conferred on the Attorney General by sections 44A and 44B of the 1965 Act &mdash; as inserted by section 2 of the (Extradition <Col N="2081" /> Amendment) Act, 1987 &mdash; under which a warrant shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs and, second, to enable him to advise on any other matter of law arising.</P>
    <P>My functions in applications of this kind derive from the power vested in me, as Minister for Justice, under section 44 of the 1965 Act to direct that a warrant shall not be endorsed in certain circumstances as, for example, where I am of the opinion that the offence for which return is sought is a political offence, revenue offence or so on.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor also has a function in the matter since that office is responsible for representing the State in extradition proceedings. A similar number of agencies are involved on the British side.  Incidentally, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice get copies of the warrant only.  The original goes to and remains with the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The role of the different agencies involved, and their specific functions, are relevant to some of the questions raised yesterday, as is the fact, which I pointed out in my reply to parliamentary questions on 15 May, that the procedures which needed to be followed in this case were followed at short notice and within a tight timeframe.</P>
    <P>The warrant and supporting documents which formed the basis for the application in this case were issued on Friday, 12 April, the day before the application was brought in the District Court.  A copy of the warrant and supporting documents was faxed to the Attorney General's Office by the Crown Prosecution Service during the course of that evening as arrangements were being made for the original documents to be brought to Dublin.  The warrant and supporting documents in this case, other than the documents required by the Attorney General for the purpose of the functions he is required to exercise under sections 44A and 44B of the Extradition Act, 1965, were subsequently forwarded directly by the requesting police force to the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> The warrant was brought to Dublin by a British detective superintendent and handed over to the Garda at about 9.45 p.m. on Friday night.  It was then placed in the custody of a sergeant attached to the unit which processes applications under Part III in Garda headquarters.  Copies of the warrant and supporting documents, which would form the basis for the application in court, were made available to my Department by both the Attorney General's Office and, following their receipt, the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities also forwarded to my Department at that stage, which was at around 10 p.m., a copy of a minute from the Attorney General's Office to the Garda Commissioner indicating that the Attorney General had considered the request for extradition and decided not to give a direction under section 44A of the 1965 Act.  That advice also stated that the warrant and supporting documents were otherwise in order for endorsement in accordance with section 43 of the Act.  The documentation was accompanied by a covering letter from the Garda authorities which asked whether I intended to intervene under section 44.</P>
    <P>A submission was accordingly prepared by one of my officials for my consideration. The file in the matter was brought to me by officials from my Department after midnight.  I decided not to intervene in the case and my decision was conveyed to the Garda authorities shortly after midnight on the morning of 13 April.  The warrant could only then be endorsed by the Garda authorities.  The person concerned was arrested on foot of an endorsed warrant on the morning of 13 April and brought before Dublin District Court No. 4 where it became evident that the warrant before the court was not the original document.  The decision was subsequently taken not to proceed with the application and the person was accordingly discharged.  The Taoiseach has dealt with the conduct of those proceedings in the replies he gave yesterday <Col N="2083" /> to Private Notice Questions on the matter and I have nothing further to add to what he said.</P>
    <P>The first indication I received that a problem had arisen in regard to the proceedings before the District Court was when an official of my Department, who was being apprised of developments, telephoned me on the morning of 13 April.  At that point it was not clear exactly what had gone wrong.  The suggestion was that the warrant was incomplete, was not an original or both. It will be appreciated that there was an element of confusion surrounding the events that had transpired at that time. I asked the official who had telephoned me about these developments to convey to the Garda authorities, through the Secretary of my Department, that I wanted a full report on the matter as soon as possible.  This was done.</P>
    <P>As far as I can recall, my only public comment on the matter, before answering questions in the House, was in response to questions put to me in the course of the hand over of the Curragh military gaol to my Department on 15 April when I indicated I had sought a report on the matter and also stated that any procedures found not to have worked well would be reviewed.</P>
    <P>A parliamentary question subsequently tabled to the Taoiseach by Deputy Harney for answer on 24 April asked about the person or jurisdiction who had responsibility for the documentation in the extradition proceedings concerned.  That question was referred to my Department as was entirely proper given that the Garda authorities received the documentation in respect of the application.  I made that clear when I answered that question together with a subsequent priority question tabled by Deputy O'Donnell on 15 May.  There is nothing untoward, therefore, in the transfer of that question to me.</P>
    <P>Arising from those questions the Garda authorities were requested by my Department to submit material in connection with the preparation of the <Col N="2084" /> reply, including the report on the circumstances surrounding the difficulties which arose in the case.  A response was received in my Department on 9 May. A number of queries were subsequently raised by my Department on foot of that report, but the precise reasons for the difficulties which arose at the court hearing on 13 April still remained unclear.  I saw that report on the morning of 15 May while preparing my questions. I accordingly informed the House, in responding to those questions on 15 May that I had been informed by the Garda authorities, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</P>
    <P>the reason the extradition proceedings failed in this instance was because the warrant which was produced in court was not the original warrant...</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>... that a review of the steps taken in dealing with this matter has, to date, failed to establish the reason the original warrant was not available to the court.</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the full facts which resulted in the original warrant not being presented at the court hearing have not been established at this stage.  I am not satisfied with the delay in establishing the full facts and I have requested the Garda authorities to conclude their inquiries within a matter of days.  I will make the full facts available as soon as they have been determined subject to advice on any legal constraints that may exist.</P>
    <P>The matter was pursued by my Department and the final Garda report on the matter was received by my Department on 21 May when a follow up written parliamentary question from Deputy O'Donnell also fell for answer.  My response to that question was based on that report.  That reply was imparted in the following terms:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have now completed their inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the application referred to in the question.  It has been established that an original warrant was in fact received by the Garda Síochána on 12 April 1996 but that a copy of the warrant rather than an original was endorsed for execution by the gardaí and subsequently presented to the court.  An extensive search has failed to locate the original warrant. The Garda authorities have concluded that the original warrant was mislaid by the Garda and that the only explanation is that the original warrant was destroyed accidentally when copies of the warrant were being made.  Because the photocopies of the original documents were of such quality, it was not realised that the original warrant was missing until the court hearing on 13 April 1996.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for ensuring that the original documents transmitted by the requesting country seeking the extradition of a person are available to the court rests with the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>This is the first time an error of this sort has occurred.  In general, extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland work well.  This is evident from the most recent report on the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, which was laid before the House in December last.  The report, which is in respect of the year 1994, records that 15 persons were extradited in 1994, seven to England and eight to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also indicated that the House could be assured that the necessary lessons would be drawn from the difficulties experienced on this occasion and that the Garda authorities were reviewing the procedures involved in processing the documents required in extradition cases.  I also indicated that they would introduce any safeguards needed to ensure that the type of error they made <Col N="2086" /> on this occasion will not recur.  Deputies will, I hope, accept that this is an entirely proper and appropriate response to something which the Garda authorities, in a public statement issued yesterday, characterised as a mistake caused by human error.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also, I hope, accept that the record clearly shows I have acted scrupulously in seeking to present the Dáil with the facts in this case as and when they became available to me.  I accept there was a delay in establishing those facts, but there was not a delay in bringing them to the attention of the House, or a wider audience.  As I indicated in my reply on Tuesday, I am also satisfied the delay in establishing those facts reflected in part the necessity to liaise with all the agencies involved in the proceedings in both jurisdictions to establish the full facts.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies remarked that it must have been obvious long before now that it was premature to blame the British authorities for what happened.  I emphasise again that I did not at any stage attribute blame.  I decided &mdash; quite properly &mdash; to wait until I knew the conclusion drawn by the Garda from its investigation before I said anything.  I did not receive that information until 21 May and I made a public statement that day, based on that information.  It would have been wrong for me, as Minister for Justice, to proceed to make statements attributing responsibility to anybody without the facts.</P>
    <P>All the individuals concerned, including the sergeant who had custody of the warrant, have a right to fair procedures.  This, as Deputies know, applies to all employees.  It would have been wrong for the Minister or anybody else to proceed to attribute blame or cast doubt until all concerned had a full opportunity of explaining themselves. To ensure that the reply received the appropriate publicity, I also issued a statement containing the substance of the reply I gave to Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>There are three further issues which I wish to address.  The first of these <Col N="2087" /> relates to a reference by the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday to a casual conversation in which he recalls me as saying something to the effect that &ldquo;it may be that the problem is on our side&rdquo;.  I made that remark to the Taoiseach in the course of a conversation about other matters before a meeting of the Northern Ireland Cabinet sub-committee on Sunday night last.  The record speaks clearly.  It was not possible until Tuesday last, when I received the final report from the Garda authorities, to say where responsibility for the difficulties lay.  I made no attempt to attribute responsibility for those difficulties in any public comment I made.  Equally, I made clear in my reply to questions on 15 May that the Garda review had at that stage failed to establish the reason the original warrant was not available to the court.  That, obviously, did not exclude the possibility that responsibility could have &mdash; as has now been established &mdash; rested with the Garda themselves.</P>
    <P>It was not unreasonable, I submit, when some weeks had elapsed with no final outcome to the Garda investigation, that I should begin to wonder whether the fault perhaps lay with the Garda themselves.  The fact that I raised the possibility with the Taoiseach could, under no circumstances, justify any public statement by me mentioning such a possibility.  The only correct course &mdash; the one I followed &mdash; was to wait for the facts to be reported to me.</P>
    <P>What I did, when the facts of the matter were clarified by the Garda authorities, was to bring them to the attention of the House immediately.  That was done by way of my reply to Deputy O'Donnell's written question on the matter.  This, I believe, was the correct and reasoned course of action for me to follow.  Ministers cannot rely on the luxury of speculation, but need to deal with fact.  That is especially the case in circumstances where, as the Taoiseach pointed out yesterday, the Garda review was primarily concerned with procedures within the force and could <Col N="2088" /> reflect on the performance of individual members.</P>
    <P>The second issue of substance raised in yesterday's proceedings, and for which I have responsibility, is the question of when the British authorities were informed that responsibility for the error lay with the Irish authorities.  The answer to this is that they were informed, as was this House, as soon as possible after the Garda report in the matter was received in my Department. In addition, I understand the Garda authorities were in contact with their counterparts during that day, 21 May.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to mention is that yesterday evening I discussed this matter with the Garda Commissioner with whom I was attending a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in London. In the course of that conversation I learned that the sergeant who had custody of the warrant in this case had been transferred to other duties.  I sought precise details on this matter and learned &mdash; about an hour ago &mdash; that the transfer took place on the directions of the Commissioner on 18-19 April.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice of Ministers to ordinarily confirm or deny the existence of a warrant for the return of a person under Part III of the 1965 Act in the ordinary way and I would be reluctant to depart from that practice except for the fact that the existence of such a warrant has already been made public.  Therefore, in the exceptional circumstances which apply in this case, I am prepared to confirm that fact and also the fact that the warrant in question has been endorsed and available for execution since 14 April as and when the need arises.</P>
      <P>This is a case in which human error led to the collapse of proceedings.  The procedures will need to be reviewed and tightened to avoid a repetition.  The process is already well under way.</P>

When was it prepared? Was a decision taken yesterday to climb down and give in as a result of the dogged parliamentary persistence of the Opposition?

      <P>I wish to refer to a number of specific points made by the Minister. She said she did not at any time <Col N="2090" /> attribute blame.  On 15 April there were reports in the media of statements by the Government Press Office attributing blame and putting it squarely on the British authorities.  This was not denied or retracted in any subsequent statement by the Government.</P>
      <P>On 24 April the Taoiseach said in the House that there was no hint of suspicion and that he had no reason to believe the fault lay on the Irish side. The obvious conclusion was that it lay on the British side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15 May the Minister said in the House that at that stage she did not know.  On 24 April it was, definitively, the fault of the British authorities. On 15 May this became a &ldquo;don't know&rdquo; and, ultimately, on 21 May the blame was transferred to the other side, the full facts were in the public domain, that it was the fault of the Irish authorities.</P>
      <P>We deeply regret that this debate is taking place today only after the Government's agreement was wrung out of it by the parliamentary persistence of the Opposition.  This is the antithesis of openness, transparency and accountability, the basis on which the Government came to office; instead we have secrecy, obfuscation and cover-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of the case are clear.  An application to have Mr. Anthony Duncan extradited to the United Kingdom for offences allegedly committed there failed in the Dublin District Court on 13 April.  During the proceedings, as reported in the press, counsel for the State indicated that, after discussions with the Attorney General and-or his office at lunch time, she had been instructed not to proceed with the case because the warrant contained a serious defect.  All material parties, the Attorney General, his counsel, the Minister and the Garda Síochána, knew, therefore, that the warrant produced in court on 13 April was a photocopy.  The <Col N="2091" /> only net issue that remains is who was responsible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister expect us to believe that it took the Garda Síochána, at the highest level, almost six weeks to discover that the document went missing in their office and was mislaid by them.  The Minister further asks us to believe that during this six weeks period the Garda Síochána were able to construct a Chinese wall between them and failed to give her any hint of what was happening. This beggars belief.</P>
    <P>With that knowledge, the Taoiseach informed the House on 24 April that there was no hint of suspicion that the fault lay on this side of the Irish Sea. I am sure that in preparing to reply to parliamentary questions on that date his Department contacted the Garda Síochána, the Attorney General's office and the Department of Justice.  On 15 April the Government Press Secretary said that the fault definitely lay on the British side.  Yet, on 24 April the Taoiseach said that he had no clue that the fault lay where it was, ultimately, found to lie.</P>
    <P>On 15 May the Minister informed the House that it was uncertain where the fault lay.  What was certain, therefore, on 24 April became uncertain on 15 May and, ultimately, the story was reversed 360 degrees on 21 May.  I do not find this or the Minister's explanation for that progression of events acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated &mdash; this is the first time this information has been made available to us &mdash; that the Garda sergeant responsible was transferred to other duties in accordance with internal Garda disciplinary procedures on 18 April.  The Garda Síochána knew, therefore, on that date that the document went missing in Garda Headquarters and that they were responsible.  Otherwise, why take disciplinary action against the sergeant?  All the material facts of the case, therefore, were known on 18 April.  That is the reality.  Yet the Minister for Justice told us she did not know until 21 May what the Garda <Col N="2092" /> Síochána, her political subordinates, knew.  She told us she did not even have a hint of it until the final written report was presented to her with a flourish on 21 May and that she informed the House at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am willing to wager that without the persistence of Opposition Deputies and the way this matter was pursued in Parliament, the facts of this case would never have come into the public domain.  Dogged parliamentary persistence has got us a drip-feed of information and a litany of evasions, half truths, camouflage and cover ups.  If this matter had not been pursued in Parliament, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, the Minister and the Government would have found out but the public would never have been informed.  It was only under parliamentary pressure that the facts of this case came out.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister expect us to believe that although the Garda Síochána knew precisely what happened on 18 April, she did not know definitively &mdash; to use the Taoiseach's word &mdash; until 21 May?  The Minister should reconsider when replying because that beggars belief and stretches credulity.  That type of response will do the Minister and the Government no good with the public which is watching this debate with interest.</P>
    <P>We are on this side of the House because the Government, in which I was a Minister of State, fell when the Minister and members of her party demanded the Taoiseach's head and the Government's resignation because there was undue delay in processing an extradition warrant.  The then Taoiseach and members of Cabinet did not know about the delay.  That was the standard set by the Minister's party and the Labour Party when they demanded the Government's resignation and the Taoiseach's head because there had been a delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the document <Col N="2093" /> was mislaid or destroyed and the case collapsed.  Yet the Minister, who is politically responsible for the Garda Síochána, will not accept any political responsibility for that.  She was one of the most vociferous advocates of the doctrine that no matter who knew what, ultimately the political head of the Department must take the rap and that the Minister or Taoiseach of the day is responsible, even if they do not know somebody has made a human error in their Department.  Those are the standards the Minister expected of us and others, but obviously she does not accept that they apply equally to her.</P>
      <P>The facts of this case are far more serious than those of the case which brought down the previous Government. A commentator on radio this morning suggested to me that I was still smarting from the effects of that.  That is not so and I have fully recovered, but I am grateful to him for asking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more serious because the case collapsed.  In the Brendan Smyth case there was an unconscionable delay which should not have occurred.  We accepted that, walked the gangplank and paid the ultimate political price.  This case collapsed because of an error in the Garda Síochána, for which the Minister is politically responsible. However, I would not demand her resignation because of human error in the Garda head office &mdash; to err is human.  This party has no interest in seeking the head of the unfortunate Garda sergeant in question.  Fianna Fáil is not in the business of looking for heads.  That is the prerogative of others and anybody's head will do when some of those on the Government benches are in one of their periodic fits of moral outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the central point, the Minister told the House the Garda Síochána knew all the material facts of <Col N="2094" /> this case on 18 April.  The Garda sergeant was disciplined.</P>

The garda who had custody of the documents was disciplined on 18 April.

      <P>The Garda sergeant who had custody of this original warrant was transferred to other duties on 18 April. No possible conclusion can be drawn other than that the Garda Síochána concluded this individual had mislaid the original warrant which caused the collapse of the court case to extradite Mr. Duncan.  It knew that definitively on 18 April.  The Minister and the Taoiseach expect us to believe that they did not know that until 21 May, four to five weeks later.  That is a national scandal and has all the essential ingredients to a cover up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we can only come to one possible conclusion.  I read the speech, which was obviously prepared yesterday, in the short time available.</P>
      <P>We now know the Garda Síochána knew exactly what happened and where responsibility lay on 18 April, yet a public statement made by the Government press secretary on 15 April that the fault lay firmly with the British was not retracted, contradicted, apologised for or withdrawn.  On 24 April the Taoiseach told the House that he had no reason to believe the fault lay on the Irish side, despite the fact the Garda Síochána, which is responsible to the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach, knew at least a week before.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us this morning that she did not know definitively until 21 May, yet she had a casual conversation with the Taoiseach last Sunday night. Although this is an important and highly sensitive matter which brought down a previous Government, the Taoiseach told us yesterday that he could not remember when the conversation took place &mdash; he could not remember that it took place 48 hours earlier.  That beggars belief.</P>
      <P>The Government's performance on this matter has been shabby and shameful. It raises more questions than it answers.  A Government, which came into office on the promise of openness, transparency and accountability, has performed not only on this matter but on many others during its 16 month tenure in office in contradiction to that.  I read the Minister's speech carefully and unless she answers the glaring questions and fills in the omissions, the only conclusion can be that this is a cover up and that she will have to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined the procedure that applies when an extradition warrant comes from Britain.  It is particularly important to recognise that the arrangements between Britain and Ireland are simply backing of warrants <Col N="2096" /> arrangements.  That means we must be very careful about the extradition of citizens from Ireland to the UK.</P>
      <P>There were difficulties previously in the Office of the Attorney General.  As a result of those difficulties, which were related to human error, a major investigation was undertaken into that office, following which it was made clear that every extradition case must be seen by the Attorney General for two reasons: to make sure the documents are in order and that the offence is an extraditable offence.  We are now told the original document did not go to the Attorney General, but that it was seen by the lawyer who worked on behalf of the Attorney General.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that arose previously, the documentation was not in order.  That system needs to be tidied up for the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that these events occurred on 12-13 April.  She was informed of them immediately, the Attorney General was aware of them and, if the normal practice with extradition was followed, the Taoiseach would also have been aware of them &mdash; because of the importance of extradition the Taoiseach is always briefed on extradition orders.  Therefore, the Attorney General, the Minister and the Taoiseach knew at that time what was going on, and if they did not, they were at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told yesterday that the lawyer concerned said, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 15 April, that she had been instructed by the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, that there was a fundamental flaw in the case and not to proceed with it.  That proves that the Attorney General knew what was happening.  Nobody would believe that he considered it a routine matter and did not pay much attention to it. There was a clear dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister, the Attorney General and the Taoiseach, and that is confirmed by the fact that the sergeant in charge of the section involved was transferred under the direction of the Garda Commissioner on 18-19 April.  Is <Col N="2097" /> the Minister trying to tell us she was not aware that the sergeant was transferred and the reasons for the transfer?  A person cannot be transferred under natural justice unless the reasons are very clear.</P>
    <P>Surely in the meantime the Minister met the Garda Commissioner on innumerable occasions, but she is now trying to tell us she was not fully informed of events until very recently. Did the Minister inquire into the matter or seek the information?  The only conclusion any reasonable, logical person can come to is that a human error was made, as the Tánaiste said this morning on radio, but the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare knew what was going on while this cover-up was conducted by the Government.</P>

      <P>They strained in the House to avoid telling us the truth.  That is not accountability.  It is a scandal and untenable that the House should be treated in that way.  I regret it has been left to the Minister to answer for this. The Taoiseach obviously was informed of matters and he has now skipped out of the House to hide with the Attorney General, the two people in high office who should take responsibility for the conduct of their offices.</P>

      <P>This debate is not about human error or the fault of an individual garda &mdash; we all make mistakes &mdash; it is about accountability, openness and transparency.  It is ironic that the Deputy whose persistent questioning brought us to a stage where the truth could finally emerge is not even in the House for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago tomorrow, 24 May 1995, this House held a similar debate about the delay in bringing to the attention of the Attorney General correspondence from the Father Brendan Smyth victims. We had a long and acrimonious debate on that occasion, the second such debate in a year, and we are now debating a similar matter for the third time.  I <Col N="2098" /> have to ask, as I am sure the public would rightly ask, if things ever change. Do we ever learn lessons?</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Justice was proposing the Taoiseach in the House on 15 December 1994 she said:</P>
    <P>He has believed always in the direct accountability of the Dáil to the people.  He has held, as fundamental to the running of this country, that individual Ministers and the Government as a whole should be accountable to the Dáil and to the people.</P>
    <P>I agree with that statement.  The Taoiseach is responsible and accountable to this House for the Attorney General, the officer with direct responsibility for extradition.  Like the DPP in criminal prosecutions, he directs the proceedings and the proofs.  Yesterday, however, the Taoiseach told us that the subject of these questions is the function and responsibility of the Irish and British police forces and falls within the remit of the Minister for Justice.  On 15 November 1994 Deputy John Bruton, Leader of the largest party in Opposition, said:</P>
    <P>It is a matter for which the Attorney General has a clear personal responsibility.  However, in the case of extradition there is a specific responsibility on the Attorney General to see and examine all warrants...</P>
    <P>... The Taoiseach is responsible for the Attorney General in this House. When mistakes are made the Taoiseach must be held accountable.  This is another case of evasion of responsibility by shoving the matter into the hands of officials who will now probably be moved and it will be implied that they are truly responsible.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable to me either.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice told us this morning that on 18 April the garda who was apparently responsible in this case was not disciplined but transferred. That means that on 18 April the authorities in this State knew where the <Col N="2099" /> responsibility lay for the failure of the extradition case on 13 April.</P>

      <P>When the extradition case failed I tabled two parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach who has responsibility in this House for the Attorney General.  One was a specific question about the collapse of the case, asking where the blame lay, and the other related to procedures in the Attorney General's office.  The Taoiseach transferred my specific question and on the day we came to answer the general question, I asked him about this case.  He said he could not answer me because there was a question tabled to the Minister for Justice.  I looked at the Order Paper thinking it had been tabled that day but I did not see any question in relation to the matter.  I drew the attention of the Taoiseach to this fact and he told me the question was tabled for oral answer and, therefore, he could not answer it.</P>
      <P>The question tabled for oral answer was the question the Taoiseach transferred that I had tabled to him.  From that day the Taoiseach has been trying to evade responsibility and pass the buck.  One of the greatest lessons we can learn from the Taoiseach is how quickly he can pass the buck when it suits.  He tried to pass the buck on the occasion of the episode in May 1995 to which I referred.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was asked on 24 April whether the fault lay on the British or Irish side he said he had no reason to believe the fault was on the Irish side. In making that comment the Taoiseach was clearly implying the fault lay with the British, yet yesterday he said: &ldquo;Neither I nor anybody acting on my behalf ever blamed the British authorities or anybody else for the failure&rdquo;.  If the Taoiseach told us in the Dáil that he had no reason to believe the fault was on the Irish side, then presumably he knew the fault was on the British side.</P>

      <P>We were quite happy in this jurisdiction to fuel the view that the British authorities were responsible for this incident.  Extradition is an important matter; it is a sensitive and delicate issue and one that can damage Anglo-Irish relations.  It is important that we have workable extradition arrangements between Ireland and <Col N="2101" /> Britain and between Ireland and other countries so that people wanted in relation to serious crime are brought to justice.  It is not a casual matter.  I find it extraordinary that yesterday afternoon in this House, when the Taoiseach was asked when he first became aware the fault might lie with the Irish authorities, he said: &ldquo;The Minister for Justice, in the course of a casual conversation with me at some date that I cannot remember, may have said something to the effect that the problem may be on our side&rdquo;. He went on to say: &ldquo;I cannot remember exactly when that was said to me.  Certainly I cannot say whether it was before or after 15 May.&rdquo;  The Minister tells us it was last Sunday night.</P>

This case had received enormous publicity on both sides of the Irish Sea, yet we are to believe that the Taoiseach could not remember yesterday that the Minister for Justice told him last Sunday night that the fault may lie on the Irish side and that was the first he heard of it.  Are we also to believe that when the Taoiseach spoke to the Attorney General after the 13 April debacle, the Attorney General did not offer any view as to the reason the case had collapsed? I find that extraordinary.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to impugn anybody's integrity; that is not my job.  My job, as Leader of an Opposition party, is to ensure the Government is made accountable to this House. We have found it impossible to get the facts, establish the truth or even have a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday morning in this House the Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;I will agree to changing the procedures and taking questions next Tuesday&rdquo;.  This is the man who was <Col N="2102" /> the great champion of Oireachtas reform who, on the day he was elected Taoiseach, stated:</P>
    <P>We need reform to ensure that when the answers to questions asked in this House are not adequate, the Ceann Comhairle can demand a further answer be given.  Only by that change will it be possible to ensure that the Government of the day is truly accountable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach used every method yesterday to avoid answering questions and, contrary to media reports this morning, the only reason questions were asked yesterday was because the Ceann Comhairle insisted on having private notice questions.  It is important that is put on the record of the House. The Taoiseach did not voluntarily decide to answer questions.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that a Taoiseach who assumed office because his predecessor failed to be accountable to this House and the present Tánaiste believed the so-called definitive Duggan case had not been brought to the attention of this House, should now come before this House and tell us he had a casual conversation with the Minister for Justice and that he does not quite remember when that took place, despite the Minister for Justice having told us it was last Sunday night.  I do not believe the Taoiseach's memory is that short. His response is not good enough for this House or the people.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the only person who apparently will take the rap for this matter is the unfortunate garda who made a human error.  Our sympathy goes out to him.  This matter is not about human error; it is about accountability, responsibility, openness and transparency. After persistent questioning we are only now beginning to find out something of what happened.  It is wrong that for almost six weeks this State allowed a view to be fuelled that the fault lay on the British side when it knew, certainly from 18 April, that the fault lay with our authorities.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Attorney <Col N="2103" /> General who directs this case did not ask if there was an original warrant and that it was Mr. Duncan's lawyer who discovered the error, not the authorities here.  After all that has happened with regard to extradition, does the Minister for Justice expect us to believe that is acceptable given the promises made by the Government and the delicate nature of these matters?</P>

      <P>When this case collapsed on 13 April there must have been some confusion in the District Court as to precisely what had gone wrong but it is equally clear that by Tuesday at the very latest, allowing for an intervening weekend, it must have been manifestly clear that the document delivered by a senior police officer of the Metropolitan Police to the Irish Garda authorities had not been tendered in evidence in court and that a photocopy of that document made in Ireland had been tendered in court instead.  The reason that is so is because it was clear from the document, on close examination, that it could not have been the document tendered by the British police.  It lacked its obverse side and it did not have the certificates written on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The press statement issued by the Garda yesterday furnishes us with sufficient facts to conclude beyond any doubt that the Garda knew by Tuesday of the following week, at the very latest, that the document furnished by the Chief State Solicitor's office, acting on the directions of the Attorney General, as the official warrant in this case was not that warrant and that the document <Col N="2104" /> the Garda Commissioner or whoever engaged in the endorsement process impressed was not the original warrant either.</P>
    <P>That is a cornerstone of this whole issue and I say to the Minister that by Tuesday of that week an intelligent child could have deduced that a photocopy produced in Ireland had been tendered to the court and that the document handed over by the British police to the Irish police had not been tendered in court.  It is for that reason the Garda Commissioner suspended the sergeant in question in that office within a few days of coming to that conclusion. No other explanation stands up to any degree of inspection and no other explanation is credible.  By the Tuesday following that week it was abundantly clear that the mistake had been made on the Irish side and by Thursday of that week, in order to investigate that mistake, the sergeant involved was moved aside.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Attorney General, under whose direction the case was brought and who was responsible for directing the proofs and the way in which the case was conducted, simply made no further inquiries as to the reason he had been involved in an embarrassing débâcle on 13 April.  As any loyal and diligent officer of this State would have done, he must have pursued that matter to find out what went wrong.  I believe he would have telephoned the Garda Commissioner to know the reason the wrong document had been submitted and would have told him to keep him apprised of developments. The Minister for Justice had a duty to make inquiries of that kind and in her statement she said that she sought an immediate report on what had gone wrong.  I do not accept that the Department, in the intervening six weeks, did not receive a progress report or information on what happened.  The Minister's statement today is a careful piece of prevarication.  At no point does the Minister say she did not have an inkling of where the Garda investigation was <Col N="2105" /> going and, until the final dénouement, that her officials were saying it now appears it happened in Ireland.  If the Minister's officials did not know that, the only conclusion we are driven to &mdash; it is an unfortunate one &mdash; is that she is so out of touch with the Garda force for which she is responsible to this House that it can keep her in the dark on matters of huge public importance week after week and drip feed her information to suit its own ends.  I reject that suggestion.  The Minister and her Department knew well the drift of the Garda investigation and that it was known in her Department that this débâcle in the District Court was caused, in all probability, by an error on the Irish side.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Members who say that this was human error, but I do not agree with the proposition that everybody was on auto pilot, that the Attorney General was not asking what went wrong with this case, was not seeking a convincing explanation for what happened and that he, who is supposed to have a close relationship with the British Attorney General, was not trying to find out where the blame lay.  I also do not accept he did not discuss it with the Minister and the Taoiseach and that her Department was completely in the dark on this Garda investigation until it received a definitive account.  If that is the way the Minister conducts her Department, she should resign now but I do not believe this to be the case.</P>
    <P>Senior members of this Government and the Attorney General were very clear from before 18 April &mdash; maybe 16 April &mdash; as to what happened in this case in large measure, that the Irish Attorney General, instructing a solicitor from the Chief State Solicitor's Office, furnished to the court a document purporting to be the original warrant endorsed by the Commissioner which was, in fact, a defective photocopy made in Garda Headquarters.</P>
    <P>I ask all Deputies to look through the Minister's statement to see if there is one point where she says that she first <Col N="2106" /> began to understand what had happened in this case in April, May etc., when she got a preliminary indication of where the Garda investigation was going and that her departmental officials understood, by the beginning of May, for example, that an investigation was being carried out in the Garda; that some gardaí had been removed from duty and that it appeared the error had occurred in Ireland.  That material is not in the Minister's statement.  The reason is that the Minister's statement is designed to confuse rather than enlighten.</P>
    <P>All this was debated, not in the British House of Commons but in the House of Lords, on 2 May.  It is amazing it could have a debate on this subject but that we had to wait until recently to find out what happened.  It is strange and sad that the English peers of the realm turned on their Government and accused it of getting it wrong yet again. It is strange they were allowed to do that at a time when the Irish State, Attorney General, Minister for Justice and Taoiseach knew the error lay on this side of the Irish Sea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the account given by the Minister.  It is a carefully tailored effort to camouflage the fact that what happened on Tuesday, 16 April 1996 was known in substance and that action was taken on it by the Commissioner the following Thursday.  This House was deliberately kept in the dark by a drip feed diet of prevarication, camouflage and smokescreen to keep the Opposition from finding out the truth; that the Government press secretary had blamed the British in the wrong and <Col N="2107" /> that this Government was seeking to cover its embarrassment.</P>

What let the Minister on Sunday night to tell the Taoiseach that the problem may be on our side?  How did she come to that conclusion on Sunday night?</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy was in the House &mdash; Deputy McDowell certainly was &mdash; on Wednesday, 15 May.  Anybody who reads my statement and my responses to Deputy O'Donnell on that day will realise I was open and frank, despite huge pressure from Deputy O'Donnell and the hurler on the ditch who was sitting in his seat feeding Deputy O'Donnell comments, in expressing my frustration that the report had not been finalised.  I indicated to the Deputy that as soon as it was finalised I would let her have that information which is precisely what I did.  I did not equivocate, perhaps the Deputies wanted me to say something different.</P>

Following the Wednesday on which I answered questions, I began to wonder about the reason for the delay and in the course of a conversation about a number of other issues I said to the Taoiseach on Sunday evening that I was beginning to wonder if the problem was on the Irish side. That was all.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the debate yesterday, a video of which I watched, and the report of which I read, that an effort was being made to imply that the Taoiseach had information before 24 April about this case and who might be responsible.  I say categorically that the Taoiseach did not have that information. It was only last Sunday in a casual comment to him I said I was beginning to wonder where the fault lay.  I do not have the luxury, as the Opposition have, of making speculative statements to the public.  I would not be doing the job of Minister for Justice honour if I were to speculate publicly and attribute blame until I had the facts.  A reasonable reading of the facts will show that I came into the Dáil on 15 May and had to say openly I did not know the information and that I would make it available as soon as possible.  I did that and I also issued a public statement on the issue so nobody could accuse me of hoping that the question might get lost or anything else.  I issued a public statement to the media.</P>

      <P>If there was no inkling until 21 May of the Garda involvement and that the human error had taken place there why &mdash; this is Deputy Harney's question which the Minister did not respond to &mdash; on 19 May did the Minister make the comment to the Taoiseach in a casual conversation &mdash; he told us yesterday he could not remember the exact date of that conversation? Why, on 24 April, in response to questions from myself, Deputies Ahern and Harney did the Taoiseach say: &ldquo;I have no reason to believe there was any error or omission on the Irish side on this matter that contributed to any of the difficulties but the matter will be fully addressed&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the incidents in the court on the Saturday while the proceedings were taking place and the case was adjourned from 10.55 a.m. to lunchtime. When the court resumed at 1.45 p.m. the lawyer representing the State, Miss Claire Loftus, apologised for the delay and told Judge Crowley she now had new instructions from the Attorney General.  She said: &ldquo;I am instructed that it is now clear that there is a fundamental flaw in the proceedings before the court and in the documentation that has been produced.  In those circumstances I am not in a position to make any application and we cannot proceed further&rdquo;. Does the Minister accept that Ms Loftus made that statement in the court at that time and that it was the State's position?</P>

      <P>On 24 April the Taoiseach answered questions about the role of the Attorney General.  He said in those statements there was no fault on this side, meaning the Attorney General's side, and he went on to say &mdash; everybody is leaving this out &mdash; that a full investigation was going on.  He was answering questions about the role of the Attorney General, which is his responsibility.  It was absolutely proper and correct for the Taoiseach to put the responsibility for answering questions on the Garda's role in this on to the Minister for Justice.  I am taking that responsibility as I did when I answered a question on 15 May and 24 April.</P>

      <P>Following questioning in the Dáil on 15 May the Minister began to wonder if there was something wrong on the Irish side.  She stated that her Department received a response from the Garda on 9 May about which her Department raised queries with the Garda.  What information did the response of 9 May from the Garda Síochána contain?  Will she publish that document?  It is now obvious that the document was a photocopy of one side of a two-sided warrant.  The Attorney General would have received photocopies of the documents produced in court. As the highest legal person in the land, surely he would have noted that he had received only one side of a warrant, something with which he is very familiar. Why is he not in some way responsible? The Minister saw those documents later that night and she is also quite familiar with warrants.  Is she not in some way responsible?  Yet she said that the poor unfortunate garda, the paper shoveller in all of this, is answerable.</P>

My <Col N="2115" /> Department officials contacted the Garda to know when it would be able to give an answer.  I did not see that report until the day I was preparing replies to parliamentary questions. When preparing such replies the normal procedure is to examine all the necessary paperwork.  Even at that stage I, too, asked &mdash; as I told Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; the same questions.  When Deputy O'Donnell asked reasonable questions on 15 May to the effect that it was amazing I had not received a reply after such a long time and so on, I told her I did not have a reply and that I would not make up one.  I had asked the Garda to furnish me with a final report within a matter of days, which it did.  I sent a memo to that effect.</P>

She stated that she received a report on the circumstances of the case on 9 May.  She went on to state that she did not examine that report until 15 May when she was preparing to answer questions in the House.  On an issue as sensitive as extradition, is the Minister telling the House that she would not have sought a report if parliamentary questions on the failure of the extradition application had not been tabled?  Is she also telling the House that, on an issue as sensitive as this, a report which came to her Department on 9 May was not read by her until the morning of 15 May when she was going to answer questions in the House? The Minister sought further details on the interim report on 9 May.  What further questions did she ask the Garda at that stage?  She stated that a number of queries were raised by her Department.

I did not await the tabling of a parliamentary question to do that.  The parliamentary question transferred to me was due to be answered on 15 May, as a result of which a request for a report was made to the Garda.  As anybody who has served in the Department of Justice will know, whenever a question is submitted it is circulated to the relevant agencies which must supply answers.  Answers were sought and the relevant replies were received in my Department on 9 May.  My departmental officials decided to ask some further questions &mdash; the full nature of which I cannot give the House.  I confirm that they asked why the matter had not been finalised.  They were informed that those from whom they had made inquiries were not in a position to finalise their inquiries, as was made clear by the Garda statement, because they still awaited further information here and from across the water.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree, since the original warrant was received and stamped by the Garda Commissioner, that when the case collapsed <Col N="2125" /> it could easily have been confirmed within 24 hours that the original warrant had been received and stamped?  Why did the Government put out a line that the fault lay with the British authorities? Why did the Taoiseach come in here and say there was no fault on our side? Within 24 hours the Taoiseach should have been in a position at least to confirm that the original warrant had been received in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I want to put a second question to the Minister.  Is she seriously telling the House that on his original inquiries the Attorney General had no suspicions when it is clear to the House that he would also have been aware on confirmation from the Garda Commissioner that the original warrant had been received?  It would have been clear to him that there might have been an investigation as to what happened to it but it could have been established within 24 hours that the warrant had been received in this jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to establish that the document presented in court was not an original, that does not require any great knowledge or reports.  The fact is that the document presented in court was not an original.  I deny the suggestion that the Government put out any line.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, the only formal statement made was in answer to a question from the media.  He said that the Government's spokesperson on duty that weekend was contacted by members of the media and asked if the Government would comment on the outcome.  He advised them that, in accordance with the normal practice, the Government would not make any statement on the case.  Subsequently he was again contacted by media representatives who told him that British sources were suggesting that responsibility for the failure of the extradition application lay with the Attorney General's office in Dublin.  He contacted the Attorney General who briefed him on the role of the Attorney General's office in processing extradition warrants.  The press spokesperson <Col N="2126" /> then conveyed that information to the media strongly denying any suggestion of a failure on the part of the Attorney General's office in Dublin.</P>

He said as a result certain certificates were missing from it.  I asked the Minister a while ago whether those certificates were present in the documentation furnished to her and the Attorney General and, if they were, given that she replied a moment ago that they were, does that not show that the fault must have occurred in Ireland. If they were not does the fault not lie with the Minister's Department and the Attorney General's office for not spotting that the certificates omitted were missing?</P>

      <P>The Attorney General is informed at the outset, and the original warrant goes to the Commissioner. However, the State's counsel is instructed by the Attorney General and must confirm, under the procedures and rules, that the original stamped copy is there.  The responsibility to do that lies with the Attorney General in the first instance, and it is a legal responsibility. The Minister may say that the Taoiseach is one step removed in that he has to be briefed, but the Attorney General, as the chief law officer, is directly responsible.  Did the Attorney General know or inquire about the original document once the fundamental flaw was found on 12-13 April?  The Attorney General is legally responsible, so he must have known.  Did the Attorney General tell the Taoiseach or <Col N="2133" /> the Minister of the flaw and the nature of it?  He was legally responsible and, being the law officer for the Government working to the Taoiseach, would have to tell the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>We have heard less than half the story today.  We need to question the Taoiseach because that is where the other part of the story lies.  I want to put it to the Taoiseach that the Attorney General is responsible for proceeding with extradition cases in court. In this case it appears that the Attorney General allowed flawed documentation into court; the flaw was only discovered in court.  In those circumstances, why is the Attorney General not responsible?</P>

The original document comes to the Garda Síochána, is endorsed and brought to the courts by the gardaí, not by the Attorney General. The Attorney General gets a copy as Deputy O'Dea knows having served as a Minister of State in the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that a warrant is not endorsed when it comes from the UK but that it is endorsed in this country?  The Minister has told the House that she had a complete copy of the document.  Does that tell her the original was in Ireland at that stage?  How else could she have had a complete copy with the endorsement showing on it?  Second, it could not have been a copy that originated in England because the endorsement of the Garda Commissioner's signature would not be on it.  That is the simple point that is being put.  Based on everything that has happened does the Minister for Justice believe the length of time it has taken to get these reports is acceptable and that she has discharged her duty of care as a Minister on the basis of doing nothing further than seeking a report from the Garda and awaiting the outcome while making no interim inquiries to update herself on the situation given that it was a matter of importance in the public domain and a matter of political controversy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the instrument for the establishment of the restructured Global Environment Facility adopted at Geneva, Switzerland, between 14 and 16 March 1994.</P>
      <P>The Global Environment Facility was established in 1991 by the World Bank as a pilot programme to assist in the protection of the global environment and the promotion of environmentally sustainable economic development.  Following the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, and the designation of the GEF on an interim basis to operate the financial mechanisms provided for in the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions, the GEF was restructured in 1994 to broaden its membership and further facilitate participation by developing countries.  The World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Environment Programme are now the implementing agencies for the GEF.</P>
      <P>At the time of the GEF restructuring, Ireland gave formal notice that, subject to Dáil approval, it intended to become a member of the GEF.  The purpose of today's debate is to comply with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which requires Dáil approval to international agreements which involve a charge on public funds and to allow Ireland to take on full membership responsibilities of the GEF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The GEF was established in 1991 in response to the perceived need to provide financial assistance to developing countries, over and above traditional <Col N="2143" /> development aid, to assist them in combating global environmental problems. The GEF also reflects the now widespread awareness of the seriousness of global and regional environmental problems. Dangers that seemed exaggerated ten or 15 years ago, such as climate change, ozone layer depletion and biodiversity loss are now accepted to be real and urgent.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the developed world has to take the lead in responding to these problems.  Apart from the fact that developed countries have, historically, contributed most to the environmental problems now facing us, they have at their disposal to a greater extent the financial, human and technology resources necessary to deal with these problems.  It is also the case, however, that action by developed countries alone will not be sufficient. Measures at the widest possible level, including efforts by developing countries in accordance with their capabilities and stage of economic development, are needed if the environmental problems facing the world are to be dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>The major new international conventions on climate change, biodiversity and ozone depleting substances have all, therefore, acknowledged that (a) developed countries must take the lead in combating global environmental problems; (b) the responsibilities of developing countries must be differentiated according to their capabilities; and (c) developed countries should assist developing countries in responding to environmental problems through the provision of financial resources and access to environmentally sound technologies.  It is in this context that the GEF has emerged as a multilateral mechanism for the channelling of resources to developing countries.</P>
    <P>At present 155 countries participate in the GEF, of which 22, including Ireland, are non-recipients of GEF support. The GEF governing structure consists of an assembly representative of all members which meets every three years <Col N="2144" /> to review and evaluate general policies; an executive council which meets every six months, and a secretariat.</P>
    <P>The GEF has a fund of more than US$2 billion pledged by donor countries for the period 1994-97.  The funds will be allocated to projects over the period April 1996 to October 2005 and will be drawn down over this period.  Total payments are expected to reach some US$390 million by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>The Global Environment Facility provides grant and concessional funds to developing countries for activities aimed at protecting the global environment in four focal areas: biodiversity, climate change, international waters, and ozone layer depletion.  The issues of land degradation, primarily desertification and deforestation, as they relate to each focal area, are also addressed.</P>
    <P>In the areas of climate change and biodiversity the GEF operates on an interim basis the financial mechanisms for implementing the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.  In these cases the GEF must operate in conformity with the policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria decided by the conferences of the parties for each of these conventions.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to outline for the House some of the activities financed by the GEF in its main programme areas. In the area of biodiversity, nine projects with combined financing of US$65 million were approved for inclusion in the 1995 GEF work programme.  These projects include conservation, protection, management, development and restoration work in threatened priority sites in nine developing countries.  The activities outlined in the project descriptions are varied and include tropical forest protection, wildlife preservation, ecosystems conservation and habitat restoration. Considerable emphasis is placed on working directly with the indigenous peoples of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the House passed a motion on 6 March last approving the ratification by Ireland of <Col N="2145" /> the Convention on Biological Diversity. The aim of the convention is, <i>inter alia,</i> the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources.</P>
    <P>In the climate change area, the GEF 1995 work programme consisted of a series of enabling activities, with emphasis on demonstration projects.  A total of 19 projects in the climate change focal area were approved with combined financing of approximately US$31 million. A feature of the aid administered in this area is that many of the benefiting projects will be of a regional nature rather than being confined to a single country.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention, which Ireland ratified in 1994, is to achieve a stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous man-made interference with the climate system.  The convention requires developed countries to take the lead in responding to climate change and to adopt policies and measures to mitigate climate change by, <i>inter alia,</i> limiting emissions of greenhouse gases. The convention requires developing countries to develop national programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change.</P>
    <P>The GEF council has also approved a Preliminary Operational Strategy for International Waters.  Current programme priorities in this area are focused on management of freshwater basins, including lakes, reservoirs and transboundary groundwater systems, and pollution.  Two projects, at a cost of US$687,000 were approved during 1995 and related to activities in the Red Sea-Gulf of Aden and the Lake Chad basin.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The GEF council included in the work programme for 1995 five <Col N="2146" /> ozone depletion projects at a total cost of US$37 million.  The funding for these projects is concentrated on the newly independent states, NIS, of the former Soviet Union and the central and east European countries, CEECs, which are currently ineligible for aid under the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund.  They are intended to assist in the phase out of ozone depleting substances principally in the refrigeration, foams, aerosol and solvent sectors.</P>
      <P>In implementing its programme in the areas I described, the GEF operates by reference to a number of principles, including ensuring the cost effectiveness of its activities; the maintenance of sufficient flexibility in order to respond to changing circumstances, including evolving guidance of the conferences of the parties where appropriate; the full disclosure of information relating to GEF projects, and the participation of beneficiaries and affected groups of people in GEF projects.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting the importance the GEF attaches to working in partnership with national authorities and local communities in implementing projects.  This approach is essential to ensure that projects complement national activities and to improve the capacity of developing countries to identify and implement appropriate solutions.  GEF financed projects are particularly important in the context of developing countries' efforts to build up their capacity for developing and managing environmentally sound technologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International co-operation is essential if major environmental problems that threaten the ecological balance of the planet are to be dealt with effectively. It is right, therefore, that Ireland should play an active part in international efforts through membership of institutions, such as the Global Environment Facility, to strengthen environmental protection and promote sustainable development.  Ireland's contribution to the GEF will amount to £1.7 million over a four year period, a sum of £425,000 per annum.  If approved, payments are expected to commence this <Col N="2147" /> year and appropriate provision has been made in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Ireland's participation will meet our financial obligations under the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. It is consistent with our commitment to the promotion of international co-operation to address global environmental problems and is a significant practical contribution to the needs of developing countries for finance to meet the additional cost of environmental protection measures.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I support the motion allowing for the establishment of the restructured Global Environment Facility.  Ireland will contribute funds to the facility which is a practical first step towards a global plan for sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The tentative nature of the steps being taken may be ascertained from the modest amount of moneys made available to the projects in client countries. As the Minister indicated, projects under four different headings have been approved.  These include nine biodiversity projects, which received US$65.21 million last year.  A sum of US$31.3 million has been approved for 19 projects in the climate change area, while a total of US$687,000 has been approved for projects in the international waters area.  A total of US$37.1 million has been approved for five projects in eastern Europe in the ozone layer depletion area.</P>
      <P>Given the size of the problems which need to be solved, the amount of money provided is tiny.  However, it is important and significant that an international mechanism is now in place in the organisation which can practically assist the concept of sustainable development in developing countries. The establishment of the working Global Environment Facility is the first step in the transition from talk to positive action in relation to sustainable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /> The Irish share of the funding, which will be £1.7 million over a number of years, will be money well spent if it is expended on properly evaluated projects. It will be a valuable contribution from this country because there is a strong and direct link between a clean environment and strong trading economies. The benefit of investments in water quality in Lake Chad may not be apparent to people in my constituency or elsewhere in Ireland.  However, it is imperative for Ireland's long-term strength as a trading nation that places such as Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia are spared any further environmental degradation.  The GEF will provide the seed money to allow eligible countries develop sustainable economies.  The planet is becoming increasingly small and events in one area affect the climate and other environmental aspects in other areas. While the link may appear tenuous, it is important that Ireland plays a role in this matter.</P>
    <P>The strongest reason for an international fund to assist sustainable development is that perserving the environment is the right thing to do. The issue is being discussed in terms of improving trade and the capacity of economies to develop in a sustainable way, but it is right to spend money on preserving the environment for its own sake.  Large scale environmental degradation is almost exclusively a modern phenomenon.  It does not take much imagination on our part to realise that posterity will look back on our time and call us a locust generation.  There is increasing awareness in communities and countries of the dangers of persisting with the current patterns of development.  To date action has not kept pace with that awareness.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that some of the projects will be of immediate relevance to Ireland.  The US$37.1 million being spent on projects in eastern Europe designed to phase out ozone depleting substances is a case in point. This will be of benefit to Ireland's long-term environmental well-being.  This <Col N="2149" /> assistance to the economies of eastern Europe will help their future cohesion in the European Union.  Economic and environmental trends are inextricably linked.  It is similar to the proverbial apple a day; a healthy economy needs a healthy environment.  The process of cleaning up the nuclear industry in eastern Europe does not appear to come within the terms and scope of the facility, as the Minister outlined.  If that process is not covered, will Ireland use its position on the body to expand the role of the GEF in this area to ensure there is a safe clean up of the industry there?</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved is relatively small.  It is, nevertheless, public money.  It is vital, therefore, that projects are properly evaluated and monitored. The GEF is a World Bank programme which has been put on an international footing.  The World Bank has been joined as an implementing agency by the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development Programme.  I hope this mix of organisations will provide the right level of practical supervision and ideological guidance to allow the fund operate in a successful manner. I hope it will not take the other route and cause excessive bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that the World Bank was responsible for some of the most environmentally damaging projects ever undertaken on this planet.  As a donor nation, we have a duty to our own taxpayers and the global environment to ensure funding is allocated in keeping with principles we would be happy to have applied at home.  I hope the Minister of State will use the opportunity of this debate to outline how he proposes to monitor the fund on an ongoing basis to see that it meets those criteria.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of the restructured Global Environment Facility means a turning away from the flawed policies promoted heretofore by the World Bank and other international organisations which have a poor record. Motorways through the Amazon and <Col N="2150" /> huge dams which have wiped out entire communities and habitats are dotted around the Third World landscape as a monument to the failed policies of the past.  The World Bank must take its share of the responsibility for this.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the GEF will not be allowed to serve merely as window dressing for an otherwise flawed policy.</P>
    <P>At least as important as the work that will be done by the GEF in its first year is the full eco-auditing of all World Bank policies.  The Global Environment Facility must be more than a PR exercise. Irish policy at international level must reflect the standards and attitudes we expect at home.</P>
    <P>Any foreign policy which ignores the daily living conditions of most of the world's population is unworthy of serious consideration.  In 1990, when Ireland last held the Presidency of the European Union, Fianna Fáil in Government began to address global environment problems.  The Dublin Declaration on the Environment was negotiated and signed.  That historic agreement committed EU member states to the principle of shared responsibility for the world environment. It further committed the EU to solidarity with the developing world and stressed that for action to be meaningful it should take place immediately.  Progress in the interim has been disappointing.</P>
    <P>I hope that when it assumes the Presidency of the European Union the Government will put environmental policy to the fore once again and build on the progress made in 1990.  One of its aims &mdash; this has not been mentioned in the context of the Presidency &mdash; should be to &ldquo;green&rdquo; the Maastricht Treaty, which was drawn up largely without any emphasis being placed on environmental issues and eco-auditing policies.</P>
    <P>We live in a world where 1.7 billion people do not have access to proper sanitation and 170 million people in urban areas lack a clean source of drinking water close to home.  In rural areas the number is 855 million.  In Latin <Col N="2151" /> America less than 2 per cent of sewage is treated.  It pays $50 billion per annum in debt repayments, which hugely exceeds total aid given to it.  The reality of the modern world is that poverty and environmental degradation are inextricably linked.  Our membership of the EU and, in particular, the forthcoming Presidency of the Council of Ministers allow us an opportunity to contribute to the environment as a global issue.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of increasing concern that the Government is not pursuing with any vigour or enthusiasm the urgent agenda of sustainable development. This week the Department of the Environment published a press release which related, apparently with some pride, that in the past year there has been a 5 per cent increase in the number of cars on our roads.  The increase over the past five years has been 20 per cent. No effort has been made by the Department, the Environmental Protection Agency or any other agency to evaluate the real cost of this hugely increased pressure on our health and environment.</P>
    <P>In its recently published document, The State of the Environment in Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency cited road traffic as the most significant source of air pollution.  Our CO2 emissions are as dangerous to the ozone layer as those of other countries. It is ironic that we are patting ourselves on the back for making money available to eastern European and other countries for emission reduction projects while we are belching out poisonous gases as if there were no tomorrow.  If we continue at this rate, there may not be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Global Environment Facility and very much hope that, in hindsight, it will be seen as a turning point in the investment and development policies of the World Bank and other international agencies. There is a need to monitor the use of this fund closely on an ongoing basis.  It is imperative that the GEF is not used <Col N="2152" /> as a fig leaf by agencies and Governments, including our own, for continuing inactivity.  Sustainable development at home and globally cannot be reduced to a set of cosy conclusions with which we all feel comfortable.</P>
    <P>Starting at home, which is where we must start, there are hard decisions which need to be taken urgently.  CO2 and SO2 emissions, waste and litter, to name but a few, are not responding to the sticking plaster solutions being applied.  Internationally, the ideas set out in Dublin when Ireland last held the Presidency of the EU have not been followed through.  I ask the Government to do so at home and in Europe.  The Global Environment Facility is a timely reminder of how much there is to be done and achieved urgently.  We support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My party and I also support the motion which is both timely and good.  We acknowledge that environmental protection is a global challenge.  Simply put, pollution does not respect national or other boundaries. If we are to deal with the outfall of pollution and the degradation of our environment, we will have to do so at international level in a highly determined way.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the restructured GEF.  If it sets out to carry out its tasks properly, it can become a strong moral force in the world.  I am glad we are making our contribution.  At £1.7 million over a four-year period, it is not a major one, but nonetheless it is a significant acknowledgement that we also have a role to play and are at one with the objectives set out by the Global Environment Facility on day one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four specific areas of concern to the GEF are biodiversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion.  These issues must be of primary concern to all human beings as we face the end of the century.  Gandhi said once this world can sustain all man-kind's needs, but it cannot sustain all mankind's greeds.  We are living in an age where greed is very much in the <Col N="2153" /> ascendancy.  It will not be possible to curb that greed without having in place a very strong international body.  I hope the GEF will increase and grow in strength and moral authority.  The planet is not being destroyed by any lower being but by mankind, which is supposed to be the most intelligent of all creatures.  The destruction and degradation is as a result of actions by man who will have to undo the damage which has been done.</P>
    <P>Ireland has an historic opportunity to advance environmental issues during the six months of the EU Presidency.  I strongly argue that Ireland should use the EU Presidency to effect the greening of the Maastricht Treaty, which was called for by Deputy Dempsey.  We should use this historic opportunity wisely and well, but we cannot do so unless we advance a vision which must be kept on the agenda during the six months of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The single most pressing issue threatening our planet is the manner in which we deal with the ugly by-products of nuclear energy &mdash; the manner in which we deal with radioactive waste.  To date, this country has been particularly helpless in such matters, especially in relation to Sellafield and THORP.  We have called for the closure of Sellafield and THORP time and again.  It has become almost a political mantra.  How much heed is given to those political calls?  We should square up to the fact that there are 8,000 good jobs in Sellafield and that they are very important to the economy of that country &mdash; a fact we cannot ignore.  While I am not saying we should stop calling for the closure of Sellafield, we should be a bit more realistic in our approach.</P>
    <P>During the EU Presidency, Ireland should seek to put in place an independent Euro-based body which would monitor the activities at Sellafield; it would advance research into new and different ways of dealing with the disposal and movement of radioactive waste and put in place enforceable sanctions in the event of a breach by any <Col N="2154" /> member state of agreed safety regulations and precautions.  That is the key point which I want to make.</P>
    <P>The shipping of nuclear waste and radioactive materials will greatly increase in the Irish Sea in the years ahead.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has objected to THORP on the grounds of increased discharges, the increased risk of major nuclear activities and the risk of weapons proliferation from unwanted plutonium. This type of objection, while it has great moral force, does not have any legal standing.  That is why there is a grave need to put in place an independent Euro-based body like that which I described.</P>
    <P>The latest plans for disposing of nuclear waste are causing major debate not only along the Cumbrian coast but in the United States where, by 1998, 23 power plants will have run out of space for spent fuel.  In April 1986 international attention was focused on the poor safety record of many civil nuclear power plants in what was then the Soviet Union because of the horrific accident at Chernobyl when unit four of that plant suffered a massive explosion and a subsequent leak of radioactivity. The fall-out from that accident will live to haunt us and future generations. Those of us who live in Cork where the Chernobyl Children's Project is based have looked at the faces of many of the child victims of that accident.  The Minister knows what I am talking about.  I assure Members that it was not a good experience to look at those faces and to see the blighted hopes, minds and bodies of little children, the helpless victims of that accident.  We must never cease to ask ourselves whether there could be another Chernobyl.  If there is, are there now better procedures in place?</P>
    <P>All countries with nuclear installations face the question of how to dispose of their radioactive waste.  Russia has a particular problem.  There are, for example, 120 decommissioned nuclear submarines carrying used nuclear fuel lying in shallow harbours off the coast of north west Russia.  Large quantities <Col N="2155" /> of nuclear waste have also accumulated at civil nuclear installations throughout Russia, constituting a continuous and horrendous risk to the environment.  We can no longer turn away from that fact. After all, Russia is not that far away.</P>
    <P>More research must be done to find some type of scientific formula which could help to find new ways and means to neutralise that waste.  As I said, nuclear fall-out is a man made nightmare. The best brains must be harnessed to find acceptable and safe solutions for disposing of the ugly byproduct of nuclear energy.  We must spend our energies putting in place an international body to scrutinise and supervise the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear reactors and the movement of nuclear waste and allied matters.  That task should be initiated by this country during the next six months of the EU Presidency.</P>
    <P>If there was a serious accident at Sellafield, people living in the eastern counties would be almost &mdash; I do not want to scaremonger &mdash; as helpless as the poor children of Chernobyl.  We must put in place a procedure to deal with this.  We have been given an historic opportunity &mdash; whether we grasp it remains to be seen &mdash; to put in place an international body to monitor, supervise, police and punish if safety regulations are breached.</P>
    <P>In matters of degradation of the environment we must look to the standards we set for ourselves.  We are not in a great position to preach to other countries if we do not attend to environmental matters in our own.  I take the point made by Deputy Dempsey about the huge increase in the number of cars. That is a sign of a good economy, but it is also testimony of our failure to put in place a better system of public transport. Many people have no alternative but to resort to the car, which is a great cause of degradation of air quality.  I wonder how many new cars are fitted with proper catalytic convertors.  I have a question down to the Minister for the Environment on that matter.  How <Col N="2156" /> forceful are we in insisting that all new cars are fitted with proper convertors to reduce harmful emissions?</P>
    <P>It has always been stated that one of our greatest assets is our highly skilled and trained young people.  As well as voting this modest amount of money, we should encourage at least some of our young workforce to put their expertise, skills and education at the disposal of developing countries which face enormous problems which, without international assistance, are insurmountable. We should send trained environmental groups who are well versed in key technology as missionaries abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> It is unacceptable that people who wish to contribute on a subject such as this have little opportunity to do so and must share a very short time.  In order to facilitate the other Deputies, however, I will be very brief.  We are contributing £425,000 in this area this year and £1.7 million over four years.  That money forms part of Ireland's overseas development assistance.  As chairperson of the Sub-committee on Development Co-Operation I wish, on behalf of the members of that committee, to put a couple of issues on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome wholeheartedly the ratification by Ireland of this instrument and the fact that Ireland will contribute to the Global Environment Facility.  In many aspects of development we in the First World are very much like the Pharisees in the Gospel, we create burdens for people but do not lift a finger to help carry them.  The integration of environmental issues into the whole area of development is somewhat similar. We are saying to the developing world that we have made mistakes in the environmental area and we want those countries to follow our model of development but we will not allow them make the same mistakes.  In many respects we are hampering them on their development path because on the one hand we are forcing this model on <Col N="2157" /> them while on the other we are not providing the resources, encouragement and support to allow them avoid the environmental mistakes we made.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that this fund will be used for a purpose similar to that of a zoo &mdash; animals are being exterminated throughout the world but there is a small zone where some of them are on show.  Biodiversity, climate change, international waters and ozone depletion are important issues, but I wonder how projects will be assisted under this fund when, through international economic and trade policies, we continue to force models of development on third countries.  If they follow the path of development suggested, it will result in environmental degradation.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that some of the concerns expressed about programmes imposed on developing countries by international agencies have been met.  A majority of members of the council involved in administering this funding should be from recipient countries and the chairperson of the council should alternate between recipient and non-recipient countries.  An effort is being made to redress the balance of power globally between north and south and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Government will be well aware of the criticisms by members of the sub-committee of the way the IMF and the World Bank impose programmes on developing countries.  The Government must be vigilant in ensuring that programmes under the GEF are implemented in a spirit of partnership and consultation, with genuine co-operation between recipient and donor countries.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that at the earliest opportunity Ireland seeks representation on the council set up to oversee this matter. Much negotiation will take place in that council and it should be a clear objective of the Government that we be represented. In that way we could be an advocate of developing countries by ensuring that in the implementation of programmes by the UNDP, the UNEP <Col N="2158" /> and the World Bank there is proper consultation and a spirit of partnership so that programmes are not imposed on people in the developing world.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about biodiversity and sustainable development.  Yesterday a number of Members met representatives of the Guarani Indians in Brazil who are being streamrolled out of their territory by cattle ranchers.  I suspect that much of that development is funded by international agencies such as the IMF and the World Bank.  The Minister should ask the GEF to consider adopting a specific programme of support for the Guarani Indians in Brazil and Paraguay and for people generally in Latin America.</P>
    <P>I regret I do not have more time to speak on these issues but I will allow other Deputies to contribute.</P>

      <P>This issue is one of the most important with which we have to deal. It is an issue that is difficult to deal with because it is so vast.  The measures we implement and actions we take on a daily basis have far-reaching consequences for this area, although we may not realise it at times.  I support this motion, but I believe that in an attempt to offset bad PR an element of conscience money from the World Bank is involved.  I hope there is more to it than that because enormous problems have been created by the wasteful spending of large amounts of money in many poorer parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the goodwill and generosity of the Irish people and many others vastly greater amounts of money go from poorer countries to the banks of the western world than the other way round.  For every £1 donated to these countries, £4 comes back as a form of repayment for the so-called generosity of the major financial institutions.  That must be tackled and the question of <Col N="2159" /> debt cancellation has to be given serious consideration, as it was in biblical times.</P>
    <P>Our lifestyles are intricately linked to the system which oppresses the people of poorer countries.  Let us consider some of the products we use regularly such as tea, coffee, pineapples, cocoa and oil &mdash; a product over which countries have gone to war.  I was in contact with Shell yesterday in regard to the problems in Nigeria.  These products are part of a system which keeps poorer countries as primary producers unable to develop sustainable economies.  This must be changed.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Quill's remarks about the jobs at Sellafield and THORP as if the problem with THORP is something from which we should back off.  There are alternatives for those 8,000 jobs and it is in that direction we must look.  We must examine what is known widely as appropriate technology which not only gives employment and ensures people have a sustainable livelihood but that the people in developing countries can maintain that technology and are not dependent on people in white coats travelling out on expense accounts from First World countries.</P>
    <P>Appropriate technology which should be promoted here for use in developing countries includes organic growing, a culture in which the car is reluctantly not habitually used, respect for habitats, reed bed sewage treatment, energy audits and solar and wind power.  These are all areas of appropriate rather than oppressive technology which can be used in developing countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion.  It is time we recognised the damage done to the environment in Third World countries is enormous and continuing unabated.  I hope the moneys being allocated here will go some way towards highlighting that damage and addressing the problems experienced by many people in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developed world must take <Col N="2160" /> action in regard to this problem.  People living in developing countries believe that the First World countries should take action on the environment because it has done most damage while they are merely trying to improve their standards of living.  The World Bank financed and sponsored many projects which have resulted in enormous damage in Third World countries, including forestry projects in Brazil and the building of various dams.  The Ogoni people in Nigeria are a typical example of how the expanson of the oil industry in that country has resulted in enormous suffering.</P>
    <P>Many of us on what are often described as junkets have visited Third World countries for a great learning experience.  The NGOs operating in those countries told us that much of the money allocated to these areas is wasted.  Natural resources are being plundered, at enormous environmental cost, by companies from the developed world without any spin-off to local communities. When the moneys are allocated it is vital that projects are monitored. It must be remembered also that many people in the Third World can do a great deal with small amounts of money which are more difficult to obtain than large sums for larger projects. It is vitally important to consider funds for small projects which can protect the environment.</P>
    <P>The developed world has created our largest environmental threat in the form of nuclear waste in the former Eastern Bloc countries.  That problem must be tackled.  The Assembly representatives of all member countries will meet every three years to review and evaluate general policy and the Executive Council will meet every six months.  Would it be possible for a committee of the House to receive an updated report on that, perhaps every six months, rather than waiting to see what happens three years from now?  A regular report is essential to ensure that money is being spent properly and that it is working.</P>

      <P>I thank <Col N="2161" /> the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  That Ireland is joining the GEF as a contributing member is practical evidence of our commitment to assisting developing countries in responding to global environmental challenges. Developed countries must take the lead in responding to these challenges but these efforts alone will not be sufficient. Action at the widest possible level, including developing countries, is necessary. GEF support is important in assisting developing countries to get on a sustainable development path.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dempsey on the importance of increasing our efforts to get on a sustainable development path and I will take his views on board.  The Deputy referred also to the modesty of funds.  I must clarify that the figures quoted by me were examples from the 1995 programme and that the total fund is US$2 billion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the clean-up of nuclear facilities in eastern Europe, the position is that the GEF does not finance such work but the European Union PHARE and TACIS programmes provide funding for the clean-up of nuclear facilities in eastern Europe.  That addresses the concerns expressed by Deputy Quill.</P>
      <P>I do not defend the past activities of the World Bank but I understand it now has an active policy of integrating environmental considerations in all of its programmes and activities.  I assure Deputies that during our Presidency we will advance a substantial programme of work in the environmental area.  A major priority will be a review of the Union's fifth environmental action programme and we will also ensure that the European Union maintains its leading role internationally in the area of climate change and ozone depleting substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note Deputy Quill's comments about the greening of the Maastricht Treaty and I agree that the current Intergovernmental Conference provides an opportunity to strengthen the environmental provisions of the Treaty of the European Union.  Deputy Quill also highlighted the widespread public <Col N="2162" /> concern about the safety of nuclear installations.  We will continue to avail of all opportunities to make known our concern about these nuclear issues and to seek solutions to the problems identified by Deputy Quill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher raised the issue of the use of trade policies to assist developing countries; he is correct in explaining the injustice of trade issues. The trade and environmental committee of the World Trade Organisation has begun to address the issues involved and, while progress is admittedly slow, one can take comfort from the fact that the WTO is finally beginning to take on board environmental and sustainable developmental issues.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions in what has been a brief debate. I will take Deputy Ryan's question on board and I may be able to get a response on it later.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> The purpose of this Bill is to provide the necessary statutory powers to construct, maintain and operate a light rail system in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a single comprehensive statutory procedure authorising the provision of a light rail system, the main features of which are as follows: it proposes that CIÉ will be the statutory agency responsible for the development of the light rail system; CIÉ will procure the powers to develop the system through a light railway order made by the Minister; CIÉ will have to apply to the Minister for the necessary light railway order.  Its application will have to include a draft of the light railway order together with detailed plans and an environmental impact statement.  The statutory approval process will be a one-stop-shop dealing with all aspects of the project, including transportation and physical planning issues, environmental impact assessment and the compulsory acquisition of land; there will be a manadatory public inquiry into all aspects of the light rail proposal, including the planning and environmental issues.  Any person will be able to make a written submission to the Minister in relation to the proposal and to appear and make his or her case at the public inquiry and the light rail network can only be built when the Minister has made a light railway order, having fully considered any submissions made on the matter, the report of the public inquiry and the environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>Because of this single comprehensive procedure, the Bill proposes that the development of light rail will be treated as exempted development under the planning Acts and will not, therefore, require planning permission.  This avoids an unnecessary duplication of effort and treats light rail in a similar way to road projects, which are also exempt from planning permission.</P>
    <P>I would now like to briefly outline the wider context in which this Bill has been developed.  It has its origins in proposals to facilitate the development of a viable public transport system for Dublin. <Col N="2164" /> Transportation is one of the most important factors influencing the growth, shape, size and environment of our cities.  By contrast, traffic congestion is one of the most serious threats to the efficient running of our cities.  It imposes heavy social costs on the community through pollution, wasted time and energy, road accidents and so on.</P>
    <P>Clearly, measures to relieve urban traffic congestion must include provision for improved road access and better traffic management.  However, it is equally clear that good quality public transport services are a vital ingredient of the overall strategy to keep our cities alive and thriving.  Since the 1960s traffic and car ownership have grown relentlessly. We have a vicious circle which sees increased road traffic levels matched by a deterioration in public transport services which, in turn, has encouraged greater use of cars.  The seriousness of this situation for the future development of transport in the Dublin region is clearly brought home when one realises that, congested though the city is, we still have some way to go before we reach the levels of car ownership prevalent in other European Union countries.  Our rates are only about half those in Germany, for example.</P>
    <P>If we look back over the recent history of Dublin's traffic and transport problems, it is evident that too often they have been a source of discussion, debate and argument and too infrequently about productive results. As far back as 1971 the Dublin transportation study, carried out by An Foras Forbartha, recommended the implementation of an integrated transportation system to accommodate anticipated increases in travel in the period up to 1991.  However, most of its recommendations were either never implemented or long delayed due to lack of resources.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the Transport Consultative Commission was set up to address the transport problems of the Dublin area. The principal recommendation of the commission was the establishment on a <Col N="2165" /> statutory basis of a Dublin transportation authority with overall responsibility for ensuring the integrated planning and operation of transportation in the Dublin area.  The Authority was established in November 1986 but dissolved little more than 12 months later. Once again a major opportunity to do something about Dublin's transport and traffic problems had been missed. However, it must be acknowledged that most of the bus lanes around the city today, which are of great benefit in keeping buses on the move at peak traffic hours, were implemented on foot of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative is our last real opportunity to come to grips with the problem.  The transport system is often called the lifeblood of a city and the analogy is an accurate one. A city will decay if its traffic circulation system fails to operate effectively.  A primary aim of the Dublin Transportation Initiative is to maintain and reinforce the vitality of the city centre of Dublin and to promote a transfer of commuters from private cars to public transport.  The DTI also places a particular emphasis on improved traffic management and enforcement, arguing that we can only justify increased investment when we have made better use of our existing transport infrastructure and facilities.</P>
    <P>The DTI, however, differs from previous attempts at improving transport and traffic in the Dublin region in a number of important aspects.  The first of these is financial.  While previous studies and reports cannot be faulted for their thoroughness and the soundness of their recommendations, they have all too often been prepared in a financial vacuum.  The DTI, however, was carried out with the active encouragement and financial support of the European Commission. As a result, the major elements of the DTI transport strategy have been included in the Operational Programme for Transport up to 1999.  This includes the most comprehensive package of urban public transport improvements ever proposed in this country, costing <Col N="2166" /> almost £300 million over the period 1994-99.</P>
    <P>The second is that the DTI was designed as an ongoing planning process with permanent institutional structures rather than a once off <i>ad hoc</i> study.  This provides a momentum for real change. The Government has established the Dublin Transportation Office to oversee the implementation of the DTI transport strategy as a whole and ensure an ongoing transportation planning process in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Finally, and of key importance to the success of the initiative, the DTI has followed the wisdom of previous reports by highlighting the need for greater compliance with road traffic law. The 1980 report of the Transport Consultative Commission made the point in very stark terms.  It stated that &ldquo;it would be pointless to attempt to implement the measures recommended in that report without a parallel commitment to provide the resources necessary to ensure enforcement of road traffic regulations.&rdquo; That is as true today as it was 16 years ago and the DTI final report put it in equally stark terms when it said that a failure to address the traffic management and enforcement issue adequately could undermine its overall strategy and lead to a waste of scarce resources.  The Government has decided to address this issue head on through the appointment of a director of traffic for Dublin who will assume overall responsibility for traffic management and enforcement in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have just outlined, I am confident that the DTI will succeed where other efforts have fallen short of their objective.  The DTI represents both an opportunity and a challenge to agencies involved in land use and transportation in Dublin &mdash; perhaps the last real opportunity.  Everyone with responsibility in this area must work together to ensure that the DTI strategy is implemented.</P>
    <P>One of the basic tenets of the DTI is that there must be a transfer from private to public transport in order to <Col N="2167" /> improve transport accessibility throughout the greater Dublin area.  Catering for future demand by increased arterial road building alone is is no longer seen as a sustainable strategy, especially within the motorway C-Ring and the city centre.  To meet the growing demand for travel by ever increasing car use, especially for commuting purposes, would be simply too costly in financial and environmental terms.  A workable and sustainable solution must involve a better deal for public transport.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve that objective it is necessary to improve the attractiveness of public transport to a level at which it can compete with the private car.  This needs to be done in a variety of ways such as increasing the speed, frequency and reliability of services, enhancing the quality of vehicles and providing better quality of information for users.  The greatest obstacles to encouraging more people to use public transport in Dublin are the delays and unreliability caused by traffic congestion and illegal or inconsiderate parking.  There is surely no more persuasive argument in favour of a more equitable share-out of scarce road space in our city between private and public transport.  Traffic priority is only part, albeit a vital part, of the overall package which must be implemented. Quality of service also needs to be emphasised.  The only way for public transport to compete with the private car is to offer quality services that are geared precisely to what the public wants and to do so in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>A modern capital city of the size of Dublin requires a public transport system which is capable of transporting large numbers of people along main transport corridors in comfort, with the assurance of fast and reliable journey times.  The public transport aspects of the transport strategy recommended by the DTI comprise a number of complementary elements.  The most exciting and innovative of these is the proposed light rail system.  The light rail network <Col N="2168" /> recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative comprises a core network of lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun.  An expanded network of lines to Finglas and Dublin Airport via Swords has also been recommended for future implementation once the core network is complete.</P>
    <P>The DTI recommended an on-street light rail system as part of its overall transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  It recommended against an underground system on economic, financial and accessibility grounds.  The DTI report supported light rail because it represented a sound investment, because it would achieve a significant transfer of people from cars to public transport, because it had a proven capacity to support urban regeneration and because it was environmentally friendly and accessible to mobility impaired people.</P>
    <P>Light rail in no way represents a return to an old-fashioned outmoded transport system, as some critics have suggested.  Light rail has evolved considerably in the decades since trams disappeared from the streets of Dublin. The modern equivalent is a quiet, attractive, streamlined, single deck vehicle which fits well into a modern city centre environment.  Unlike conventional heavy rail systems, light rail is flexible.  It can run through most city streets sharing road space with general traffic and even pedestrians.  It combines the reliability speed and comfort of the traditional railway with the flexibility and efficiency of the bus.</P>
    <P>The evidence from around the world shows that light rail has many positive impacts on urban areas.  It is helping to reverse the decline in public transport in urban areas and this has been responsible for the rapid growth of light rail systems in the past ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>Light rail is now the most common way to upgrade public transport in cities around the world.  Throughout Europe there are many examples of light rail systems such as Amsterdam and Strasbourg. In many instances the LRT system has helped in the development of <Col N="2169" /> the urban fabric.  In the UK, light rail systems have been implemented in Manchester and Sheffield since 1992 and plans for further light rail lines in Birmingham-Wolverhampton and Croydon in London are at an advanced stage of development.  There is evidence to show that car drivers transfer to trams, considering them to be an attractive and practical alternative to the rigours of city centre traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>Government policy on light rail is clear and unambiguous.  It is in effect the centre piece of a public transport investment programme, recommended by the DTI, included in the National Development Plan and endorsed by the European Union by virtue of its inclusion in the Operational Programme for Transport.  It has the support of public institutions and the people of the region, coupled with favourable financial circumstances.  These carry with them a great onus of responsibility to follow through on the project and get things done on time and within budget. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that we achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>I now propose briefly to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill can be divided in two main parts.  Sections 2 to 14 provide for the statutory approval procedures for light rail.  Sections 15 to 26 deal with matters relating to the implementation and operation of a light railway.  The remaining sections contain standard provisions which are common to most Bills.</P>
    <P>Section 2 empowers persons authorised by the Minister or the CIÉ board to enter on any land and carry out inspections, examinations and tests for the purposes of the construction of a light rail system.  Given the tight time-scale for implementing the light rail project, it is essential that relevant staff be permitted access to land in connection with the proper planning of the project. In the event that entry is refused, the Minister or the CIÉ board may apply to the District Court for a warrant authorising entry.  Where any damage or loss is caused as a result of an authorised officer carrying out functions under this <Col N="2170" /> section, there is a proposed procedure whereby compensation can be claimed from the Minister or the board as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Statutory authority to construct, operate and maintain a light railway will be granted to CIÉ by the Minister by means of a light railway order.  CIÉ is the only organisation that may apply for a light railway order.  Section 3 sets out the documentation which must accompany an application.  These include a draft of the order, a plan of the proposed light railway works, a book of reference to the plan indicating the identity of owners and occupiers of the lands described in the plan, and a statement on the likely effects on the environment of the proposed light railway works.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes that light rail developments will be exempted development for the purposes of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  This avoids an unnecessary duplication of efforts and treats light rail in a similar way to road projects, which are also exempt from planning permission.  The interests of planning authorities and the public are protected by other provisions in the Bill which require statutory consultation with the planning authorities and any persons directly affected by the proposed light rail scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the most important documents which must accompany an application for a light railway order is the environmental impact statement. Section 5 sets out the information to be contained in an environmental impact statement based on the relevant EC Directive.  Among the items required in the statement are a description of the proposed works, the data required to assess the effects on the environment, a description of the likely effects, both direct and indirect, of the proposed works impacting on humans, flora and fauna, landscape, structures, culture and heritage, and a description of measures to remedy likely adverse environmental effects and an outline of any alternative <Col N="2171" /> courses of action assessed.  Most importantly, there is a requirement that a summary of the statement in non-technical language is included to ensure that it is clear and accessible to as wide a range of people as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 6 requires CIÉ to give public notice that an application has been made to the Minister for a light railway order.  It also allows interested persons the right to inspect copies of the documentation accompanying the application for a light railway order and to purchase copies or extracts.</P>
    <P>Section 6 further provides that copies of the documentation lodged with the application for a light railway order must be sent to every local planning authority affected by the proposed light railway system and to any other persons as the Minister may direct.  Relevant extracts of this documentation will be served on every owner or occupier of land referred to in the draft light railway order accompanying CIÉ's application.</P>
    <P>A minimum period of four weeks is specified for the inspection of the documentation and a further minimum two-week period is allowed for the making of submissions in writing to the Minister in relation to the proposed light railway order or the likely effects on the environment of the proposed light railway.</P>
    <P>Where the Minister considers that further information on the likely effects of light rail on the environment is necessary to ensure the adequacy of the consultation process, section 7 allows him to require CIÉ to furnish that additional information.  Where the information provided contains significant data in relation to the likely effects on the environment of the light railway, notice must be given that this further information is available for inspection by the public.  Supplementary written submissions may be made to the Minister in relation to this further information.  A minimum period of three weeks is set out for the making of these additional submissions.</P>
    <P>The key element of the statutory approval process is provided for in <Col N="2172" /> section 8 of the Bill.  This section stipulates that there must be a full public inquiry into the application for a light railway order at which all aspects of the application can be discussed.  It provides for the appointment of an inspector to hold the inquiry.  The inspector may be assisted by one or more assessors.  It will be the inspector's sole responsibility to prepare and submit to the Minister a written report of the inquiry findings and to make any recommendations he or she thinks appropriate.  Any person will be entitled to appear and be heard at the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>Before making a decision, section 9 obliges the Minister to consider the documentation submitted by CIÉ, the inspector's report on the public inquiry, the written submissions made by any person, and any additional environmental information provided under section 7.  Where the Minister is of the opinion that the application for an order should be granted, the Minister will make an order authorising the construction, maintenance and improvement of the light railway, attaching such conditions, restrictions and other terms as he or she thinks proper and specifies in the order. Notice of the making of an order must be published.</P>
    <P>Should a light railway order need to be amended, the Minister may by order amend it.  However, the statutory approval procedures provided for in sections 3 to 9 will have to be repeated where a significant amendment is involved.  The Minister may revoke a light railway order where CIÉ fails or refuses to comply with any condition, restriction or requirement specified in the order.  CIÉ may appeal this decision to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a light railway order will contain such provisions as the Minister considers necessary. That can include specifying land and rights on land to be acquired, the manner in which works are to be carried out, or a time limit within which they must be completed.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a technical provision <Col N="2173" /> requiring CIÉ to retain and make available for inspection or purchase by the public the light railway order and related documentation for a period of five years after the order comes into operation.  In the absence of such a provision, the documents would have to be retained by CIÉ in perpetuity.  Provision is also made for the service of relevant extracts from the order on every planning authority for the area to which the order relates and on every occupier and every owner of land referred to in that order.</P>
    <P>Section 12, which is based on provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, provides for judicial review by the High Court of a light railway order made by the Minister.  Application for leave for judicial review must be made within a period of two months from the date on which the order was made unless the court considers that there is sufficient reason for extending the period.  The section further provides that leave will not be granted for a judicial review unless the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for such a review.  The decision of the High Court will be final except where that court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that an appeal to the Supreme Court is desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 13 authorises the compulsory acquisition of land by CIÉ following the making of a light rail order by the Minister. In practice, this will have the same effect as if the light rail order were a compulsory purchase order and the board were a local authority exercising its compulsory purchase powers.  The board is also given the option, under subsection (2), to acquire additional land adjoining that to be compulsorily acquired under the order.  This requires the consent of the Minister and of the owner of that adjoining land and is allowed only where it would be efficient and economical to do so for the purpose of the light rail project.  This allows a sensible approach to land acquisition <Col N="2174" /> and provides a necessary degree of flexibility.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives CIÉ power to enter land to carry out works authorised by a light railway order.  Provision is made for the serving of a notice on the owner or occupier of the land, who may apply to the District Court for an order prohibiting entry.  A judge of the District Court may prohibit entry or impose conditions on CIÉ.  Where any loss or damage results from the exercise of CIÉ's powers to enter on land to carry out works, there is provision for the payment of compensation to the owner or occupier and for arbitration where agreement on the amount of compensation cannot be agreed.</P>
    <P>Where any tree, shrub, or hedge obstructs or interferes with the construction, maintenance, improvement, safety or operation of a light railway, section 15 provides that CIÉ may lop any such tree, shrub or hedge.  Notice of the proposed works must be served on the owner who may, if he or she wishes, carry out the necessary works and recover the cost from CIÉ.</P>
    <P>Section 16 proposes that CIÉ will be authorised to carry out works on any existing public road or to construct a new road provided this is specified in the light railway order.  The prior consent in writing of the road authority in whose area the road is situated will be required before work starts and the road authority may impose conditions, restrictions or requirements in its consent.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that no part of the light railway may be open for traffic until it has been inspected and certified by an inspector appointed by the Minister. This is a technical provision relating to safety certification and is similar to existing procedures applied to new sections of mainline railway.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the Act or for resolving any difficulty in bringing the Act into operation.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 22 create offences of <Col N="2175" /> trespass, unauthorised use of a light railway, obstruction or interference with the performance of functions under the Bill.  Section 24 gives CIÉ the power to make by-laws for the regulation of a light railway and specifies a number of particular matters in respect of which CIÉ may make by-laws.  A person who contravenes sections 19 to 22 or a by-law will be guilty of an offence and liable to a maximum fine of £1,500 or a prison term of up to six months or both.</P>
    <P>Standard provisions for the service of notice under the Act are made under section 23.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that CIÉ may, with the consent of the Minister and of the Minister for Finance, acquire or form and register one or more subsidiary companies pursuant to the Companies Act, 1963.  This gives the option of forming a subsidiary company to operate the light rail system.  While CIÉ will obtain the statutory powers to construct and operate light rail, no final decision has been taken on the precise arrangements which will be made within the CIE Group for the operation of light rail.</P>
    <P>Section 26 applies the Railways Acts, 1840 to 1889 and any other Act relating to railways, except where such Acts are inconsistent with the provisions of this Bill and a light railway will be deemed to be a railway within the meaning of those Acts.  These Acts cover matters such as construction, operation and maintenance of a railway system and associated infrastructural works.  The right to carry passengers, supervision and safety inspection arrangements, including the powers of the railway inspecting officer to hold inquiries and make recommendations, as provided for in the Railways Acts, would also have relevance for the light rail system.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 to 30 are standard provisions common to most Acts and cover procedures for the laying of orders and by-laws before the Oireachtas, administration expenses, fees and commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>On 12 December last I launched the <Col N="2176" /> comprehensive public consultation programme currently under way.  The programme involves an extensive series of public meetings, exhibitions, surveys and bilateral discussions with all interested parties.  Its purpose is to explain the concept of light rail, to outline specific light rail proposals and most importantly, to listen carefully to any concerns expressed in relation to those proposals.  The consultative process will continue until a statutory public inquiry into all aspects of the light rail project is held towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that since the public consultation process got under way, the public profile and popular awareness of the project has greatly increased.  I believe that people are finally beginning to realise and accept that this Government is serious about implementing the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and that we are not content to let the DTI report remain on a shelf.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising therefore that many are starting to sit up and take notice of this implementation process as it gathers momentum, evidenced on an almost daily basis by developments such as the quality bus corridors, the establishment of the Dublin Transportation Office and, of course, the progress on the planning of the light rail system itself.</P>
    <P>This increased public awareness raises many questions and concerns in relation to the project.  Not least of these is the question of disruption during construction. The construction of a light rail system in Dublin will inevitably mean a certain level of disruption due to the necessity to divert essential services away from the path of the vehicles and the laying of track along the routes.</P>
    <P>However, the light rail construction plans for Dublin have been formulated by a team of experts with wide international experience who are working in conjunction with the civic authorities and supported by conservation bodies. The planning team formed by CIÉ have <Col N="2177" /> drawn on the experience of several cities in Europe, the United States and Canada to develop a plan which will entail a minimum of disruption to trade and access to affected streets.  CIÉ has engaged French consultants, Semaly, who have proven and extensive international expertise on light rail systems and are involved in all aspects of the Dublin project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The French know all about traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  To ease the construction phase as much as possible, a comprehensive package of measures to keep the general public informed and to provide advance notification of roadworks with the appropriate signage and alternative routes is being planned and will be ready well in advance of the start of construction.  CIÉ is committed to full consultation with affected businesses and residents on these plans.  Past experiences have demonstrated that, with advance notice, effective consultation and good traffic management, the city can continue to function well during construction.</P>
      <P>A great deal of valuable time and effort and not inconsiderable expense has been invested in developing the DTI strategy over the past four years.  We are fortunate to have access to significant EU funding for public transport development in the greater Dublin area through the Operational Programme for Transport.  Our priority has to be to ensure that the present opportunity to make a substantial and lasting improvement to the capital's transport system is fully grasped.</P>
      <P>We have now reached the critical point at which we must support our words with decisive action.  Only by doing so can we improve our public transport services and create a lasting climate for increased public transport priority in keeping with the fundamental DTI principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will enable the development of light rail in Dublin and is the vital next step to take the project off the <Col N="2178" /> drawing board and keep it on course to implementation by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I would ask Members to facilitate its early passage into law, thereby allowing a public inquiry to take place in the autumn and construction to get under way as early as possible next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first occasion in recent times we have had reason to debate the light rail proposal. Members will recall that last month it transpired that the Government had been notified in December last that the European Union wanted to investigate the project further.  This information did not reach Members of the Dáil and Seanad until much later.</P>
      <P>Even though the European Union had ordered last year an investigation into the phasing of the light rail system being proposed, the Government proceeded to announce the project as planned and did not disclose the existence of that EU investigation until the Opposition parties prised that information from it in the course of unnecessarily acriminious debates.</P>
      <P>Speaking on a Private Members' motion on the subject recently, I said that the manner in which the Government handled this entire light rail issue, particularly its failure to inform Members of the Opposition of the European Union decision to investigate the entire process, has seriously jeopardised our relations with our European Union counterparts.</P>
      <P>On top of the Minister's unilateral announcement of its proposed routes, last month the Minister for Finance went to Brussels, indicating that, no matter what the EU decided, Dublin has decided those routes.  That approach was generally extremely unhelpful in conducting and building on our relationships with our EU counterparts, who must be bemused as to precisely what are our proposals for a light rail system, particularly given those recent comments of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Last October we were promised that the strategic plan would be published in a few months.  We were then promised it would be published after Christmas and then after Easter. At that time the newspapers had little else to report and they published a long statement by the Minister of State to the effect that the plan would be published within days, given the difficulties between the Minister and the Department of the Environment had been resolved.  Will the Minister indicate what quality structuring the strategic plan will recommend should be put in place to guarantee the production of superior forest products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the delay in publishing the strategic plan as much as anyone else.  The principal reason for it is that the consultants hired by the former Government were due to complete their work in December 1994, but they did not complete their report until July 1995 and an amount of supplementary work regarding saw log sales was required.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction about the sale system among Coillte's saw log buyers.  Planning controls on forestry had to be negotiated <Col N="2180" /> with the Department of the Environment and an economic analysis on the investment, from a Department of Finance and an EU perspective, had to be carried out.  I completed my Department's consideration of it some weeks ago and it has been sent for circulation to key Departments.  I hope to bring a memorandum to Government in the next week or two and it will take another two weeks before the plan will be printed, some of the arrangements in that regard have been made.  Anything that may cause delay is being dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's interventions only serve to elucidate on the quality of work we are doing in this area.  This strategic plan is crucial given that, unlike in the case of milk and meat, there is no production quota limits on forestry.  Given our favourable climate, tax and EU grant allocation, there are real opportunities to create an extra 11,000 jobs in this sector over the next 20 years and to build it into a multibillion pound industry, one for which there is significant export potential.  I hope this strategy will form a blueprint for that.</P>

      <P>I do not want to pre-empt the publication of the strategic plan and the Deputy's question raises a separate issue.  I am concerned about a number of aspects concerning the quality of forestry production.  A four year inspection procedure to collect premia applies to forests planted on foot of a forest grant. We are not satisfied with the uniform level of forestry management and various strictures, incentives and other inducements will be introduced to improve forestry management <i>vis-à-vis</i> training and specialist skills.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 32 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Strategic Management Initiative, a decision in principle was taken in mid-1995 to reorganise the Department.  The main focus of this reorganisation was to be the clearer separation of the policy and executive functions, while maintaining the necessary relationships between these two roles, with the aim of ensuring the efficient delivery of services and effective policy formation.  I took the decision on reorganisation on the basis of a proposal by the Secretary of the Department, following its approval by the Department's management committee.  In particular, the proposal involved the establishment of a number of operationally independent executive units within the Department.</P>
      <P>A reorganisation group was established in September 1995 to work out the specific options for reorganisation and the detailed implications, in terms of structures and resources, of such options.  The group consists of senior departmental officials, an official from the Department of Finance and is assisted by an external consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision of 12 March to establish an executive unit for CAP payments was one part of a package of measures which I proposed to Government designed to achieve improved accountability and the protection of the financial interests of the EU <Col N="2183" /> and national resources.  This package also took account of the work of the Recoveries Group established by Government to examine the recoverability of the EU beef disallowances, on which a decision was then in prospect.  The Government decided that, in line with the decisions in principle already taken in regard to the reorganisation of the Department, an executive unit for FEOGA payments, such as an intervention and export refund payments, would be established, with its own accounting officer who would be recruited by open competition.  The head of this and other units will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  As will be the case of the FEOGA unit, where the unit heads are to be accounting officers, they will be designated as such by the Minister for Finance.  This is the case in respect of all accounting officers, including Secretaries of Departments.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the executive unit or units to be established will be integral parts of my Department. The unit heads will not be responsible to the Minister for Finance, but, as appropriate, to me as Minister and to the Secretary of the Department.  The head of unit or units will form part of the Department's management committee which is chaired by the Secretary. The Secretary will, of course, remain accounting officer for the Department.</P>
    <P>Since the Government decision in March, further work has continued on the detailed organisational aspects of establishing an executive unit for FEOGA payments, as well as other executive units.  Based on that work, I expect that the management committee will make detailed proposals to me on departmental reorganisation within the next two months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that recent newspaper reports that a separate accounting officer will be appointed who will be answerable to the Department of Finance are incorrect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the newspaper reports suggested, but a separate executive unit will be set up, most likely in Johnstown Castle, as part of the reorganisation of the Department in Wexford.  It will cover the principal European payments, intervention payments, FEOGA payments, export refunds and the head of that unit will be an accounting officer who will report directly to the Committee of Public Accounts, as do other accounting officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it from the Minister's reply that such an accounting officer would be answerable to the main accounting officer, the Secretary of the Department.  Is it the case that the accounting officer is answerable to the Department of Finance?  It was reported that would be the arrangement.</P>
      <P>We understand the Strategic Management Initiative provides for the separation of policy and executive functions. Did the proposal the Minister brought to Government have the support of the total management team in his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, yes.  I do not attend management committee meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the proposal emanate from that source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give credit to the senior management unit of the Department. They have been the primary initiators of all the reorganisation of the Department.  As this is my first time to work with civil servants, I have been amazed that the impetus for reform has come from themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Deputy's first question, there will be two accounting officers.  In the management of the Department, however, the accounting officer will be like the other assistant secretaries and will attend the management committee of the Department under the chairmanship of the secretary of the Department. <Col N="2185" /> The second accounting officer will be akin to an assistant or deputy secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that, as recognised in the beef tribunal report by the chairman of the tribunal, one of the praiseworthy aspects of the Department was that the FEOGA grants section had worked well and that only about 0.3 per cent was sought to be recovered by the European Commission? The Department was operating under a huge workload imposed upon it as a result of increased intervention stocks etc.  Will he confirm that any changes in organisation do not reflect on the competence displayed by the Department heretofore in respect of the proper payment of grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to have the opportunity to confirm the satisfaction of the chairman of the beef tribunal but also my personal satisfaction as Minister with the accounting officer and with the FEOGA section.  This year between market-related supports and direct income aids about £1.6 billion of EU money is being administered.  It is very important that we are seen to be as vigilant in looking after European money as we are in looking after our own.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the precautions taken to prevent the use of illegal growth hormones.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10472/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 April, 1996, the Supreme Court <Col N="2186" /> gave judgment in a case brought by a County Meath farmer challenging the validity of aspects of the regulations prohibiting the use of hormonal and betagonist growth promoters, namely, the European Communities (Control of Veterinary Medicinal Products and their Residues) Regulations, 1988 and 1990.</P>
    <P>The implications of that judgment are:</P>
    <P>1.  The Regulations of 1988, which banned hormonal growth promoters, survive in their entirety.  Thus, prosecution of offences relating to alleged breaches of the law in respect of hormones may proceed.  The penalty on conviction is a fine not exceeding £1,000, a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.</P>
    <P>2.  There is now no penalty for offences created by the 1990 Regulations until 1 October 1993 when the penalties provided for by the Animal Remedies Act, 1993 became operative. The result of this is that cases against 12 persons may not proceed.</P>
    <P>3.  The only alleged offence which cannot be prosecuted is administration of clenbuterol to an animal prior to 1 October, 1993.</P>
    <P>4.  Other offences, such as possession of clenbuterol, may proceed as they attract the penalties outlined already for conviction under the Regulations of 1988.</P>
    <P>5.  Seventy-six cases preceding the Act and 44 cases under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, relating to illegal growth promoters, have been referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor; prosecutions should now proceed in all these cases.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, I am advised that the judgment of the Court does not require any amendment to legislation.</P>
    <P>The Animal Remedies Act, 1993 provides a comprehensive legal basis for enforcement of the law banning illegal growth promoters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2187" /> The penalties, on conviction, for offences relating to the illegal growth promoters are rightly very stringent. The Courts may impose the following penalties:</P>
    <P>&mdash; on summary conviction, a fine of up to £1,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both;</P>
    <P>&mdash; on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £100,000 (or, in the case of a second of subsequent conviction, £250,000) or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Court may order the forfeiture of an animal or animal remedy to which an offence relates.  The Courts may also ban a person who has been convicted on indictment from keeping animals, animal remedies or being engaged in the production of food for human or animal consumption.  The duration of such a ban is at the discretion of the Court and may be for life. While not necessitated by the judgment of the Supreme Court, I am considering an amendment to the Act whereby a farmer would, as a statutory consequence of conviction for a serious offence, be banned from farming.  Such a disqualification is being considered given the serious consequences for the national economy of this illegal activity.</P>
    <P>The legislation banning illegal growth promoters is vigorously enforced by my Department and the Garda Síochána and backed up by extensive testing of animals on farm and carcasses at abattoirs. Suspected users and distributors of illegal growth promoters are being pursued and prosecuted with the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>There have been 59 prosecutions in respect of offences relating to illegal growth promoters in the past ten years. Fifty three persons were convicted as a result of these prosecutions and fines in excess of £50,000 have been imposed; in addition four persons were given suspended jail sentences and one person was sentenced to a period of community service.  A further person was sentenced <Col N="2188" /> to two years imprisonment which is under appeal.  As I have stated earlier, a further 120 cases should now proceed.</P>
    <P>Another 14 cases involving illegal growth promoters are being investigated by my Department.  Should the evidence warrant, I am determined that criminal proceedings will be instituted in each case.</P>
    <P>I have consistently informed the House how seriously I view the activities of the small minority of farmers who use illegal growth promoters.  It is national sabotage.  I have this year introduced a confidential hotline, backed by a poster campaign, to facilitate receipt of information anonymously.  The legal issues surrounding the question of publishing test results on a factory by factory basis and tracing animals are being examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer was long and it was hard to take it all in.  I could only jot down some of the figures.  One figure I jotted down related to the fact that in ten years there have been 59 prosecutions for this offence, and the Minister would have the country believe that he and his Department are serious about the matter.  This is what he called national sabotage, and 59 prosecutions in ten years is just a joke. It shows the willingness of the agricultural authorities, to put it at its broadest, to turn a blind eye to anything and everything that goes on in this country if their pals might be affected by it.  It is appalling that there should have been so few prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears all the time that hundreds of these cases are allegedly discovered, that this stuff is being widely used throughout the country.  A practice seems to have arisen in recent months of meat plants saying animals were supplied by Elvis Presley or some other equally unlikely name when they are asked to give the origin of particular animals which have clearly had growth promoters administered to them.  Does the Minister propose to take any steps to ensure that meat plants will be responsible for identifying the suppliers <Col N="2189" /> of animals that have had growth promoters administered to them?  Will he now take serious steps to prosecute the people involved, given that 59 prosecutions in ten years could not possibly be described as serious?  There should be as many prosecutions in one month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly disagree with the Deputy's analysis regarding the Department.  There is no question of turning a blind eye to this in the Department. If the Deputy were to talk to anyone in the meat processing business he would hear stories of how our investigation unit has carried out unannounced raids with the Garda Síochána which have been very upsetting for the meat factories involved.  The problem here is that a number of cases, perhaps 140, were held up because a Mr. Mallon appealed the Supreme Court decision. The case was heard some 14 months ago but there was a big delay in giving a judgment which was delivered in recent weeks.  Effectively, the Chief State Solicitor's office and other elements of the prosecution procedure were in a state of paralysis because of that appeal.  There were fundamental issues involved, such as were they entitled to a duplicate of the sample so that they could split the analysis.  There were fundamental issues underpinning the 1988 and 1990 regulations and the 1993 Act.  Effectively, apart from one technicality in relation to serious offences requiring the case to be heard by a judge and jury at least at Circuit Court level, all bar 12 of the cases will now proceed.  I hope the 120 cases that have been held up will come to the prosecution stage as soon as possible. Whatever the delay, it was not at the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special investigation unit has been absolutely rigorous in its activities. We revoked the licences of two meat plants owned by two different operators, a rare occurrence.  We suspended their operations because we were not satisfied with the traceability of animals in the Border region.  A new system of traceability is in place whereby we are insisting on being able to trace back to <Col N="2190" /> the farmer in question.  I am advised that this is working well.  If the Deputy has any information on this illegal and reprehensible activity, I would welcome hearing about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in believing that in at least one of these two recent revocations, the licence of a Border plant was revoked in the morning and was given back in the afternoon?  Of what value is that?  If the 120 cases which were held up due to the Mallon appeal can now go ahead that gives us a total of 179 cases in ten years and for a practice that appears to have been widespread for many years, does the Minister consider that the 179 prosecutions in ten years or 17.9 per annum is an adequate level of enforcement of this very necessary law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that the incidence of illegal substance abuse is as widespread as he suggests.  To back up my point, we have two systems for finding out the level in meat factories, first the Enfer screen testing whereby Department personnel go in unannounced, in conjunction with Enfer, and take 200 random bio samples which are sent off for analysis.  The incidence on a random basis is a low single digit figure and we will publish information on those factories in case there is a suspicion of a residual criminal element involvement in this area.  It is not widespread.</P>
      <P>The second element will be where every AO and veterinary inspector in a plant can send suspected carcasses off for full analysis.  There is a surveillance and a testing system in place and with the Q mark system under An Bord Bia we are able to give an assurance in respect of the meat plants that operate that scheme that premium Irish quality beef is residue free.</P>

      <Quest>the number of farmers in receipt of slaughter, suckler cow and special beef premia.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10707/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To date some 16,434 farmers have been paid grants under the 1995 slaughter premium scheme.  With regard to the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme, more than 75,900 herdowners have received grants so far.  Under the 1995 special beef premium scheme, payments have been made in respect of 180,254 applications representing in the order of 94,000 farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the statistics show that the EU compensation package which relates to an increase in the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium is not going to those farmers who have been in receipt of slaughter premium and have clearly been the hardest hit by the deteriorating beef prices?  What will the Minister do about this?  What is the point in having a compensation scheme which does not have as its basic criterion the idea that you compensate those who are hardest hit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No decisions have been made on the detail of the compensation scheme.  In Brussels this week there was a great deal of discussion on the margins with the Commission, with the French and Germans, as to what would be the most appropriate way to proceed.  I am very sympathetic to the position of the winter fatteners and targeting money there.  If we depart from operating the existing premium structure for ten month and 22 month special beef and suckler cow, and have a national envelope of money for which there would be national flexibility to administer to those the Deputy or others might consider the most deserving there is a serious risk that at the <i>tour d'table</i> the Dutch will say that as they have 7 per cent of the animals of Europe they are entitled to 7 per cent of the compensation fund but they only receive 1 per cent of the premium payments, the same with Italy.  The premium system <Col N="2192" /> greatly favours Ireland, Britain and France in the extensive forms of production and, therefore, I would be very reluctant to agree to any national envelope that would be a departure from the premia structure because Ireland would get far less money.</P>
      <P>Once we have it established that there is not a national envelope I will be looking for additional moneys through the DSP.  We must bear in mind that that is not paid Community wide and would represent a significant special element for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the discussion about what affects Irish agriculture seems to be taking place on the margins of meetings and is not getting the sort of attention one would expect in the <i>tour d'table,</i> to use the jargon. I have not asked the Minister to dismantle the premium system nor have I asked him not to ensure payments under the premium system.  I have asked the Minister why those in receipt of a slaughter premium have been totally ignored and neglected in the compensation package.  Why does the Commission when drawing up its proposal not regard the compensation as applying to the people hardest hit, as everybody in Irish agriculture knows?  What influence has the Minister either at administrative or political level in the decisions that are being taken at Commission level to compensate farmers? The evidence thus far is none.  If it is a case that the Minister is saying he will see what he can do for those in receipt of slaughter premium, I suggest that that should have been a precondition of any compensation package.  Why can Irish farmers not expect a special compensation package?  The idea that the deseasonalisation premium is particular to us is of no relevance to the argument. We, as the biggest exporters of beef in the northern hemisphere, have been denied the markets.</P>

I expect that the Commissioner will state his proposals on how to spend this money at the special Council meeting on 3-4 June and that the Council will try to agree this proposal at the 24 June meeting.  Failing that, I hope a special meeting will be held during the first week of July under the Irish Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The deseasonalisation premium is under threat because we no longer qualify as the number of cattle slaughtered on 1 September for the subsequent three month period has been reduced to 35 per cent &mdash; the qualifying level was 40 per cent.  We are seeking to have the threshold lowered and to include Northern Ireland.  This is an ongoing issue in terms of the price package. We must be realistic about the slaughter premium.  Earlier this week we <Col N="2195" /> saw how Britain tried to stop a blocking minority.  We have three votes &mdash; we require 58 &mdash; and are, therefore, not in a position to insist on an Irish compensation solution to the BSE problem. Rather we must favour grass-based systems and extensification and see how we can get a little extra through a doubling of the DSP.  That is our negotiating stance and at all times I will try to get the maximum amount and build a coalition of support with the other countries in northern Europe which do not have an intensive bull beef system and those countries which are net contributors to the Union.  I am pleased with the progress made with Commission officials this week but much more work needs to be done.</P>

      <P>The Minister has enunciated his negotiating policy at meetings with the European Commission and Council of Ministers on the biggest crisis facing farmers for many years, that is he will agree a Union-wide package and get a little extra for Ireland.  Does the Minister know any other member state which has to export 85 per cent of its product in order to stay in business?  Is the beef sector as important to gross national product and employment in manufacturing and service industries in any other member state as it is in Ireland?  Why has the Minister consistently said that he finds it impossible to get it across to our Union colleagues that our problem is much greater in net value and employment terms than theirs?  Is he seriously suggesting that he has thrown in the towel in terms of convincing the other 14 Agriculture Ministers of the inescapable fact that our beef industry will not be able to survive without a change in the present Commission response?  Will the Minister agree that the intervention system for 90,000 tonnes, of which we got 10,000 tonnes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a common agricultural policy is to ensure that there is no national variation in aid.  One of my principled positions will be to oppose member states which wish to deviate from a common European solution to this issue.  No one is in any doubt that we are 16 times more dependent on the beef industry than the UK or that beef is synonymous with the Irish economy.  Contrary to what the Deputy may be suggesting, our relations with Commissioner Fischler and all member states are excellent and we are in a pivotal position.  As is customary, I will visit all member states before 1 July or have a bilateral meeting with them in Brussels at a suitable venue or they will visit Ireland.  The Dutch, German and French Ministers will also visit Ireland. <Col N="2197" /> I, my senior officials and all our diplomats in Europe are engaged in trying to secure a favourable outcome for Ireland.  Good progress has been made and the detail is up for grabs, so to speak.  I have indicated to the House how Ireland can maximise its claim.  In all the circumstances, I will ensure that we not only draw down the maximum amount of money but also get extra additional measures.  I must point out that this will not be the way of the future in relation to the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that we are in an extraordinary position and that the usual responses in the past to changes in the market will not adequately deal with this impending crisis?  Does the Minister accept that is the case?  It is clear to everybody in the industry.  Will he agree that the case for a special intervention package for Ireland is unanswerable?  There is no market for cattle, particularly as autumn is approaching.  Will the Minister accept we do not have the ability to dispose of these matters by way of normal market mechanisms or the type of increase in premia payments he mentioned?</P>
      <P>I am delighted relations are excellent, but unfortunately the benefits of that position are not obvious in terms of dealing with the magnitude of the problem which presents itself to the Minister and the industry.  Will the Minister accept that, given the extraordinary circumstances we face, an extraordinary response is required?  The current type of Community-wide ideas which are circulating will fall far short of what is required to meet the magnitude of the problems facing the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On a constructive note I agree that the Deputy's prognosis regarding the enormous difficulties regarding the marketability of Irish beef is correct.  Given that Ireland exports 85 per cent of its beef, we are severely caught.  The Deputy also mentioned intervention as being the most likely market outlet and this is a correct analysis of the situation.  More cattle have <Col N="2198" /> been slaughtered in the past six weeks than at any time in the past ten years. Nearly 200,000 animals have been slaughtered during the past seven weeks.</P>
      <P>I spoke to meat factories representatives and others this morning and the real problem is the lack of markets. Demand is weak even in markets which have reopened, such as Egypt.  Consumption dropped rapidly, recovered slowly and is now plateauing at an unacceptable level.  The European promotion fund is due to come into play and hopefully normality will return.  For every 1 per cent drop in consumption, a home must be found for 75,000 tonnes of beef which was previously consumed in Europe.  GATT states that only one million tonnes may be exported and this quota had almost been reached anyway.</P>
      <P>This presents the biggest challenge ever to the management of the European beef regime.  If the level drops by up to 17 per cent, even allowing for the fact that 300,000 tonnes of British beef is removed from the food chain as a result of the 13 months of age policy and burned, there is still a surplus of one million tonnes of beef which cannot be exported to third countries under GATT rules.  However, even there, consumption is weak.  A new policy to curb production must be found or a dramatic increase in consumption is required and this may mean a radical approach to price.</P>
      <P>I am to visit Russia next week because it is the only country where there is a real possibility, if prices come down &mdash; they have dropped from $2,400 a tonne to $1,700 &mdash; that they will buy the beef.  They could take 100,000 tonnes, but if the price must drop it has serious long-term implications in terms of the appropriate level of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short-term, intervention will take up the slack.  I will vigorously push for an appropriate type of intervention which will provide a market.  However, if one million tonnes of European beef are in intervention by Easter, this stock will overhang the market.  This will <Col N="2199" /> make a market oriented solution more difficult because Russia will say it wants to buy from intervention rather than directly from meat factories.  Prior to this crisis, we had succeeded in moving away from that.  I am more than willing to listen to suggestions from the Deputy in relation to intervention, specifications, etc.  He is right that the key problem is the marketability of beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not worthwhile progress at Question Time. A final supplementary question from Deputy Ellis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the suggestion of a £20 per unit premium payment when the actual loss per unit is £125?  This is the market situation. What does the Minister propose to do to ensure the gap is bridged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The compensation package should be seen in the context that the financial year for Brussels ends in October.  There is an immediate need to have moneys paid, and a budgetary provision next year is also required.  The sum of 650 million ECUs is a good start, but it will not fully compensate people for their losses.  The figure the Deputy mentioned is not adequate compensation and more is being sought.  The breakdown of that in terms of how much for a suckler cow, how much for ten or 22 months old animals, what could be secured for a slaughter premium or what new schemes might be put in place is a matter for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to getting the Commission to propose it, one really needs France, Germany and Spain on one's side in that regard.  This is where matters stand at present.  Before 20 March, Europe was 104 per cent self-sufficient in beef, <Col N="2200" /> but the scenario now suggests a level of 125 per cent if consumption does not increase.  This is reflected in the current price.  For example, the price of cow beef in Italy has dropped by 40 per cent since this time last year.  As matters stand there will be no intervention in areas where there is no premium support, such as heavy heifers and cull cows.  Mince has taken a large cut in consumption and I am most concerned for those producers.  However, nothing is coming forward from the Commission because it has never supported female meat.</P>
    <P>I am happy to receive suggestions and consider how matters can be tailored to deal with the fundamental nature of the income crisis in this area.  However, this package, which I hope will be wrapped up at the end of June or early July, is a good start.  It is an initial package and it must, as the Deputy said, be followed up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the CPSU industrial action which prevented the processing of area aid applications, I do not have full details of the number of applications received in my Department.  However, based on account of the special area aid application envelopes received in the area aid unit of my Department, it seems that the total number of 1996 applications received to date is in excess <Col N="2201" /> of 135,500.  All but about 450 applications were received before the closing date of 15 May.</P>
    <P>With the termination of the CPSU industrial action, the processing of the area aid applications has commenced.  A processing work plan has been drawn up with the aim of ensuring that all 1996 livestock and arable aid payments will be made in accordance with the deadlines set out in the charter of rights for farmers which I put in place last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister knows how many applications are in his Department, not from looking at the application forms but from counting the envelopes.  As a result of the strike he has nothing but closed envelopes in his Department.  Will the Minister indicate if the havoc he said had descended on his Department has lessened to any degree?  When can we expect a fully functioning Department back on stream?</P>
      <P>The important element of the question is the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme and how that might affect headage payments.  Some farmers may be affected by the number of animals for which they can apply, based on the forthcoming changes.  Is an extension on 31 May envisaged?  How will it be administered properly to ensure people are not penalised for submitting notionally incorrect applications based on existing areas?  These would be correct if they were able to take into account the increased areas which were announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the CPSU dispute, I am relieved and pleased that we will be able to get back to normal. If the dispute had continued beyond 24 May, an unacceptable situation would have emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By closing date, 30 April, there were about 90,000 applicants.  With the Commission's permission, we extended the date to 15 May because of the dispute and there were a further 45,000 applicants. This is more than last year.  That <Col N="2202" /> is a big step forward and I am not as concerned as I was.</P>
    <P>Staff are now working normally.  We offered the CPSU a special deal on the issue of regrading in the Department. This was accepted by the union executive on Friday night and the general pay and restructuring package was agreed on Monday night.  The industrial action has been suspended pending the outcome of the ballot which will take a couple of weeks to complete.  The union has recommended acceptance.  My worse fears, therefore, will not be realised.  I hope with goodwill on all sides, we will get back to business.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised some important points on headage payments.  I announced the extension of the disadvantaged areas in Westmeath this morning. Some 3,000 farmers will be advised by the Department in writing that they are now entitled to receive payments.  A total of 325,000 acres have been reclassified. For example, £75 is payable on a beef cow for up to 30 animals and £10 on a ewe for up to 200 animals.</P>
    <P>December-January sheep applications will be accepted and processed on the basis that payments will be made. The closing date for the receipt of beef cow applications is extended to 7 June. The Deputy will be pleased to learn that his constituency accounts for the largest increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it intended to extend the closing date for the receipt of suckler cow and headage grant applications because of the failure to issue promised brass tags to farmers?  This is a major problem in that applicants are required to seek the assistance of a vet.  In poorer parts of the west, including offshore islands, where a farmer may have only two or three calves the cost involved is astronomical and may account for the full value of the grant.  Will the Minister clarify whether it is intended to extend <Col N="2204" /> the closing date because of the failure of the Department to deliver on its promise until all the boxes of tags have been issued?</P>

      <P>The CPSU industrial action made this impossible.  Now that it has been terminated I am arranging for the issue of receipts by the end of June to all farmers who submitted 1996 area aid applications to reassure them that their livestock and arable aid payments will be made later this year.  Any applicant who does not receive a receipt by the end of June should submit any proof of postage he or she may have to the area aid unit of the Department.  Heretofore, there were no receipts and farmers may have been told in October when they rang to inquire about their cheques that their area aid application forms had not been received.  They should have them by the end of June.  Those who are <Col N="2205" /> not happy or have any doubts should contact Hume House about the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulties experienced during the CPSU dispute which continued for far too long.  We all suffered as a result. He indicated that staff spent their time doing crosswords instead of their work. Does he intend to apologise for this to members of the CPSU?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the late receipt of area aid application forms.  As he well knows, in recent years errors were made and farmers lost substantial sums of money as a consequence.  When he took office I understood him to say that this would be taken into account.  I have brought a number of applications to his attention.  I am sure others have done likewise.  Where does he now stand on this matter?</P>
      <P>When he mentioned with some excitement the extension of disadvantaged areas the Minister took us into another field.  He told me that Wexford did not fare well.  Is it his intention to allow farmers who believe their lands meet the criteria to lodge an appeal with a new appeals board on the basis that the buck stops with him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand over my remarks about crosswords.  I have no difficulty with staff working to rule and operating an overtime ban, but, because of the way &ldquo;new work&rdquo; was interpreted in district veterinary offices, in relation to TB and brucellosis, no work was done.  No permits were issued, no envelopes were opened, no reactor cattle were destroyed and no samples were posted. This was not new work.  As a consequence, hundreds of people in district veterinary offices, not the entire Department, literally had nothing to do.</P>
      <P>Management in my Department visited those offices and found that people clearly had nothing to do.  This was going on for some weeks.</P>

      <P>It was a source of major frustration to me that this was the case. I appealed to them to lift their ban in relation to the disease eradication schemes.  Management of the Department and myself showed great patience and perseverance on this issue.  I am pleased the Department of Finance was able to accede to a special arrangement for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which facilitated a new approach.  I hope all the issues concerning the CPSU, including the charter and the general restructuring issue, have been settled once and for all and that we will provide the type of service we would like.</P>

      <P>Members will be aware that I negotiated a special concession last year in the case of 5,000 farmers who did not send in area aid forms.  They had been denied their benefits, but I secured them.  As regards errors by farmers, EU auditors come here to assess our premium payment structure.  If they find we have paid people who should not have been paid, we will face a 2, 5 or 10 per cent disallowance, as we did in the beef storage and beef intervention sector in 1991-92.  As the EU agent, we must administer this properly.  I would rather a one than two year penalty in relation to hardship cases.  I will put a case to Brussels about that in the simplification of CAP reform.  At present the penalties are uniform and apply across the Community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about disadvantaged areas.  For the first time dissatisfied people &mdash; there will be many thousands making submissions to the appeals panel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not administer this; the file was processed before I came to the Department.  I pay tribute to Professor Sheehy and the appeals panel who did this independently and impartially.  It will now be done transparently and it is not open to me to have a further review. Appeals were submitted in respect of some 3 million acres and one tenth, 225,000 acres, got in.  Those which were unsuccessful were properly processed. Up to 75 per cent of the country is in. Europe made it clear at the commencement, when Senator O'Kennedy was Minister, that the fourth review was the final one.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister will give the Department time to get maps right.  People sent in Land Registry maps, but wrong ones were sent back by the Department.  The Minister should not say he is making a concession to farmers; it is a concession to the Department.  Will a farmer who submitted an area aid form but did not get a receipt of postage before 30 April lose his headage payments, suckler cow over 12 units and extensification premia because the Department failed to issue a receipt as promised?  Will the Minister confirm that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a hypothetical case for people who have not sent in area aid forms.  Irrespective of criticisms he may have of the new mapping procedure, whether it is a satellite imagery, a manual map or any dispute, the area aid form always had to be in by 30 April.  Farmers who did not send in an area aid form got a once off concession last year.  In excess of 135,000 have been received, so it seems people have learned that they must send in the area aid form.  We should not confuse the issue because of problems with maps.  There should be no problem with forms.  I already answered the question about receipts.  People will receive receipts within one month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 27, 39, 43 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These questions deal with the BSE crisis.  I have made a number of personal interventions in respect of rendering, intervention, compensation and so on.  I would like to focus on the market aspects of this in terms of third countries. While I am pleased that a number of third countries, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon and South Africa, have lifted the restrictions on Irish beef, it is a matter <Col N="2211" /> of concern that some important markets, in particular Iran and Libya, continue to restrict to our product.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the recent developments on BSE are primarily technical, which are not amenable to instant political solutions.  My Department, the diplomatic service and An Bord Bia is continuing to address the issues and concerns as they have arisen and has gone to considerable lengths to reassure the relevant authorities of the safety of Irish beef and beef products.  Strong emphasis is also being placed on the image of Ireland as a source of clean, green and superior quality food and there is extensive contact and co-ordination between the different Departments and agencies involved.</P>
    <P>However, BSE is a very complex issue and it will take time before the problem is resolved in some cases.  The task has been made more difficult by sensational media reports which are very difficult to counter.</P>
    <P>Political interventions have and will continue to be made where required.  As the House is aware, the personal intervention of the Taoiseach was a critical factor in the re-opening of the Egyptian market while political initiatives were also important in lifting the Lebanese restrictions.</P>
    <P>I will visit Russia, a very important outlet for Irish beef next week.  I propose to visit Libya as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.  While I am disappointed that such a visit has not taken place before now, it is important to ensure that the timing and the circumstances are right so that the optimum outcome will be obtained from the visit.</P>
    <P>The Iranian authorities have agreed to send a veterinary delegation to Ireland to discuss technical issues and arrangements are being made to agree an early date for the visit.  I have had contacts with Mr. Foorozesh, the Minister of the Construction Crusade and I am in regular contact with the Iranian Ambassador.  The need for further <Col N="2212" /> action, including political initiatives, will be reviewed following this visit.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I am fully aware of the importance of ensuring access of Irish cattle and beef to all third country markets.  The situation is under constant review and all appropriate action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the various interventions other than on the question of marketing in third countries, will the Minister outline the position with regard to rendering?  We were told four or five weeks ago that rendering was absolutely essential and the slaughtering and processing industry would have to close down if renderers could not stay open.  A Supplementary Estimate was passed here for £2.5 million to keep renderers open until 21 May.  The Minister said after that time they would get no money and would have to stay open under their own steam.  The deadline of 21 May, the day many things happened, has passed and the money has been spent.  What is the present position?  If the subsidy is not required after 21 May, why was it required before then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the up-to-date position as I understand it.  Discussions are ongoing between processors and renderers.  In many cases a substantial volume of the rendering capacity is owned by meat processors, subsidiaries or sister companies of processors, and it is in their hands to find a solution.  It was necessary to have a breathing space of State support for the ongoing rendering of offal to meat, bonemeal and tallow.  That window of opportunity has resulted in a reduction in stocks from 10,000 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes during that timeframe, with one individual operator taking 2,200 tonnes. Not all renderers claimed aid, but the claims on hand indicate that slightly less than the £2.5 million will be paid in storage and production subsidies.  I understand renderers have agreed to operate for two weeks without subsidy to allow the negotiations to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the order of 200,000 animals have <Col N="2213" /> been processed since Easter in meat factories and the subsidy is, therefore, justified. I made it absolutely clear publicily on Friday, and I take this opportunity to do so again, that there will not be an ongoing State subsidy for this purpose. Other countries in similar circumstances do not provide ongoing subsidies.  While I could make a case to the Cabinet for an emergency subvention for a short period to allow the meat and bonemeal trade to restore order, export contracts are moving again and I do not believe a subsidy would be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister correctly to say that Iran and Libya are the only third country markets still closed to us because of the BSE problem and, if so, does that suggest the problem is a minor one since there are 100 or more third countries, a large number of which are potential customers for beef?  Apart from the two markets still closed, is it the case that the others are buying much smaller quantities of beef because of a general lack of confidence in European beef?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Many markets other than the two mentioned are closed to Irish beef, but in terms of third country markets, for the live trade the three potentially significant markets for Europe, including Ireland, are Egypt, Libya and Turkey.  The Turkish market was reopened, but since there was a problem with tariffs and so on we did not make a commercial breakthrough there.  In terms of beef, the key markets are Russia, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  The reason I focused on the two markets still closed is that they are volume markets. Countries such as South America are closed to us, but even if they were reopened they are not of significance. Consumption is down everywhere.  Even though the Libyan market is not open to us, the number of animals processed there is greatly diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that consumption is down 30 per cent in the UK, 40 per cent in France and 50 <Col N="2214" /> per cent in Germany; that Libya remains closed to us even though they had ordered 140,000 cattle; that 50,000 cattle and 500,000 sheep were recently exported to Australia; that the Gulf states are closed to us and that even though the Egyptian market is open &mdash; we heard much about the phone call on the open market in Egypt &mdash; there are no buyers in Egypt?  Will he confirm that the position is drastic at present?</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that when a Fianna Fáil delegation visited Iran a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that there were only minor, technical problems, that the market would be reopened in a couple of days or a week at most and that the Fianna Fáil trip was unnecessary.  In view of that statement will he explain what sudden difficulties have arisen in reopening that market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumption pattern in Europe is more or less as the Deputy indicated &mdash; perhaps his figures are slightly on the large side but I would not quibble with them.  The figure he gave for Libya is incorrect, it should be 160,000 animals.  The majority of markets in the Gulf states are open.  I do not know what the Deputy's experience of the Iranians has been, but my experience has not been good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had personal conversations with Minister Foorozesh who gave me assurances that if certain action was taken, commitments would be honoured. None of those commitments have been honoured.  I am very anxious to resolve the Iranian problem.  There is a problem in that Ireland, as well as France and other member states, was in the process of servicing a contract for an excess of 16,000 tonnes of Irish beef which has been supplied in good faith and for which an arbitary date, 5 March, has been fixed.  The product is not in free circulation, in many cases payment has not been made and the companies involved are experiencing severe cash flow difficulties.  There are also stocks here that never departed for Iran which have not been honoured in terms of contracts, there is an unfulfilled element of the contract and the overall ban remains in place.</P>
      <P>I have offered to go to Teheran to negotiate on these issues and I was assured this was not a political issue but a technical one.  Letters have been exchanged in recent weeks and a meeting is due to take place this week between my senior veterinary officer at the OIE meeting in Paris and Dr. Montulabi, the head of the Iranian veterinary delegation.  For three weeks I have been trying to agree a date for a visit by the Iranian technical delegation, notwithstanding the fact that Iranian veterinarians have already visited the Border. I will do anything the Iranian authorities want to provide them with the necessary knowledge to lift the four aspects of the ban to which I have referred.  This is a serious problem and I am determined to do whatever is necessary to resolve it.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made the point about the information in regard to the EU investigation I was extremely angry at what I perceived as the nondisclosure of crucial information to the House.  I question to the Minister's competence and political judgment in this regard and his ability to be in charge of this large Department.  Time <Col N="2298" /> and time again, he has shown himself not to be on top of his brief.  I do not question his integrity, which is what he referred to in his reply to me.  I would not question the integrity of any Member of this House and if that is the way the Minister interpreted my comments, then I regret it.</P>
      <P>The Government has seriously jeopardised our relationship with the EU through his handling of this entire light rail issue.  Added to the unilateral announcement of the routes by the Minister last month, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, went to Brussels and indicated that no matter what the EU decided, Dublin had made up its mind on the light rail question.  This was unhelpful in building relations between Dublin and Brussels.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil expressed serious concern about the confusion the Government has created at EU level on this issue. We were disappointed that Sandyford and Ballymun-Dublin Airport were not part of the first phase of the plan.  The airport route should be a central part of the plan and the Dundrum link should be extended to Sandyford.</P>
      <P>These concerns have been echoed at EU level, but I am convinced the Government's handling of the matter has seriously damaged our relations with the EU Commission in the transport area.  These relations will not be advanced either with this Bill.  One of the founding principles of the EU is that communities should be involved in decision making and proper consultation should take place.  None of this is evident in this Bill.  The provisions for public consultation are rigid and only pay lip service to the principle of local community consultation.</P>
      <P>The Bill has many other obvious flaws.  It is badly drafted and will not facilitate the speedy and proper construction of the much needed Dublin light rail system, which I and my party proposed and fully supported.  Even amendment may not rescue it and it needs to be sent back to the parliamentary drawing board for fundamental recasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> The Bill is in sharp contrast to the straightforward Gas (Amendment) Act, 1993, arising from the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987.  That Act made provision for laying a gas pipeline throughout the country and it was done quickly and simply.  Why was that model not adopted, rather than this cumbersome Bill?</P>
    <P>The measures proposed will create more problems than they will solve.  The manner in which difficulties are to be ironed out with local communities is heavy handed, bureacratic and extremely legalistic.  The Bill as it stands amounts to a recipe for enormous delay. The Fianna Fáil view is that it will be unworkable as currently drafted and should be withdrawn.  A new Bill to give proper and speedy effect to the light rail system should be presented along the lines of the Gas (Amendment) Act which proved efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not, for example, even specify which of the three CIE companies will operate the light rail system. Will one of the existing companies or one of its subsidiaries run the system or will a new subsidiary be established.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's hands are substantially tied in Cabinet, particularly by Democratic Left.  It is an open secret that the Minister for Social Welfare has a second look at most legislation.  If the Minister has a free hand he would not allow only CIE to apply for a licence to run the light rail system.  If the Minister's party was in a majority Government, he may have inserted another section saying not only CIE could apply to run the system.</P>
    <P>Governments and Ministers change and there might be a Minister some day who might not want to let CIE have a monopoly in extending the system but the Bill does not allow for this.  It specifically says only CIE may apply to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for permission to run a light rail system.  Given that legislation is for the long-term and not for the period of one Government, it is short sighted to tie the Minister's hands in <Col N="2300" /> that way.  There may be other light rail extensions.  Brussels may intervene at some stage to break up the monopoly and then amending legislation will be required.  The Minister had to do this because there are people sitting on his shoulder who, at any hint of private sector involvement in State companies, would make life miserable for him at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides sweeping entry powers to land, property and homes to persons authorised by the Minister.  It empowers CIE officials and others to carry out &ldquo;any investigation or examination&rdquo; on property or premises. Is that the intention?  If the Garda had these powers, there would be an outcry from civil libertarians.  Some of the language in the Bill is draconian.  It is not necessary and may lead to constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also makes provision for compensation for damage done to property. However, the compensation provisions are unnecessarily convoluted and may lead to endless litigation.  The lip service paid to consultation is evident in section 5.  That section outlines in detail all the matters to be included in environmental impact settlements. Subsection (3) points out that neither European nor local government environmental guidelines will apply.  It appears the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has become the judge and jury in that he has now invented his own guidelines and local communities will have to grin and bear it.  It is no wonder communities such as Kilmainham are up in arms. They rightly maintain that irrespective of what they say or do, what meetings they attend and what suggestions they offer, the Minister will do what he wishes because the legislation gives him the power to enter onto land and carry out any investigations or examination and do what is necessary.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil does not believe the Bill can speedily achieve the construction of the light rail.  This is apparent in section 6.  Provision has been made for a time-span of nine weeks for the publication of <Col N="2301" /> notices for application of light rail orders. At the end of the nine weeks there is a provision for a notice of such orders to be served on every occupier and every owner of land referred to in the order.  The section uses the word &ldquo;every&rdquo;.  What is meant by &ldquo;served&rdquo; in this context?  Does it mean the individual has to be found and personally served as in many judicial areas?  How long does the Minister estimate that will take?  While section 23 sheds some light on the definition of service of notices, it appears to make provision for notices to be served on, among other things, a field.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (d) provides that where the owner or occupier of any land or premises cannot be ascertained it may be addressed to the owner or occupier and left at the place.  Is it lawful to leave the notice at the place?  Does that constitute it being served and is it constitutional? Has the Attorney Generally made any observation on this and other matters in the Bill?  If so, will the Minister give the House the benefit of the Attorney General's comments on this point and also on the right of entry by CIE officials, particularly in the context of the phrasing of the Bill?  I would be interested to hear what the Attorney General has to say about this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 allows members of the public to buy copies of the documents in relation to the order &mdash; this is where the Bill is badly drafted&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;...on payment of a fee to the Board not exceeding the reasonable cost of making such copies or extracts as may be fixed by the Board&rdquo;.  Does this mean the cost of photocopying the document or the cost of drawing it up with lawyers and surveyors?  Is the public expected to fund the cost of drawing up the plans? This is typical of the poor phrasing and confusion throughout the Bill and the reason I have come to the conclusion that it would make more sense if it was redrafted.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with further information on the environmental impact statement and builds in a further time frame of three weeks in which to provide it to those occupiers or landlords <Col N="2302" /> involved.  The time-scale is open-ended and enormous delay could result here also.  The Minister would be better served by having a real consultation process rather than the phoney process which is now taking place.  There is no confidence in local communities about the public inquiry which has been planned for later.  It will be extremely bureaucratic and legalistic and people will have to make their case under oath. The vast majority of people in local communities will find it bewildering and totally unresponsive.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes the Minister should have adopted the model taken on board by many multinational companies setting up in Ireland, for example, Tulip Packard which is building a large plant near Leixlip.  It is a good example of this type of consultation not the austere remote type in the public inquiry where a verdict is handed down.  That company has appointed a consultative council to deal with concerns from local residents, businesses and schools in the construction phase. The council is made up of people from Tulip Packard, the local community, the schools and businesses.  Those with problems are dealing with people with whom they are familiar who can empathise with the problem in the construction phase.  This is in stark contrast to that proposed in the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill.</P>
    <P>Local communities are dealing with people they have not met before, many of whom are technical engineers rather than communications experts.  Local people meet these experts once and hear nothing further.  There are reports that engineers have pointed out and measured the route and that if people wish they should attend the public inquiry and make their case on oath.  A railway line cannot be built in that way. It can only be built following full consultation and by working out the problems. Do local people consult CIE, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the local light rail office or the engineering consultants?</P>
    <P>It would have been better to establish <Col N="2303" /> a light rail consultative council in each of the sensitive areas the system will visit.  These councils could be made up of experts, local community activists and business interests.  The councils could remain in place for a year or two even after the system is up and running. Local people dealing with them would know those involved.  They would know they were not going through bureaucratic steps but were dealing with people who knew the areas concerned and would assist in the construction of the light rail programme.  If there were a problem the public would know where to go and the people involved would be clearly identifiable.  The communities would also know that some of their people would be involved in the decision-making process and that it was not all done behind closed doors and was not merely a judicial process.</P>
    <P>One of our main concerns about this Bill is that the entire process is of a judicial type where people give their evidence under oath, a decision is handed down and that is the end of it. That system will take years.  A quicker way would be to have a proper consultative process with people who have good recommendations to make on the routes and who would work out the problems with those people.</P>
    <P>Given that the success of the light rail will depend on its acceptance by local communities, some type of local consultative councils rather than the hands-off type should have been provided for in the legislation.  It would have been better than the formal and impersonal public inquiry and inspector system provided for in section 8.  It is ironic at a time when we are trying to make the courts less intimidating that the public inquiry system proposed is as rigid as any court.  All representations made to the inspector have to be given under oath.  Those who give incorrect information, whether accidentially or otherwise, will, according to section 8, be guilty of perjury and punishable accordingly. That is no way to consult local communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2304" /> Section 9 provides for whatever the Minister wants irrespective of what local areas may have demanded.  The Minister will railroad ahead irrespective of what local communities want.  It is also one of those sections which, because of the way it is drafted, will give rise to enormous difficulties.  Part of the section appears to signal that once an order is made by the Minister the entire process can start again and there will be more inquiries.  In this legislation the Minister should be trying to achieve agreement without the obvious litigation.  It appears that in every section of the Bill there are opportunities for a legalistic maize to be followed.  That legalistic route of public inquiries and High Court proceedings will hold up this process interminably.  That should be headed off early on through proper consultation with local communities.  If agreement is sought from local communities in a proper manner, the light rail system can be built according to the timetable set. That will not be the case if we give CIE officials the right of entry and provide for the right to hold public inquiries, judicial reviews and to go to the High Court &mdash; a handed down mechanism of building the route.  The only way to successfully build the route is to convince local communities that their concerns are being taken into account and discuss alternative routes, engineering problems and compensation with them.  It is clear from the Bill that only lip service has been paid to such a process.  While a form of public consultation is proposed, it is only a junior system and does not measure up to a real consultation process.</P>
    <P>I dwell on this point because that is the stage we are at in the process.  If we continue to go down purely the legal road by encouraging everybody to take oaths and to go to the courts, they will have no other option.  If the building of our roads is used as an example, the light rail system will not get off the ground for many years.  That is why I encourage the Minister, even at this late stage, to provide for a strong statutory consultation process as the system <Col N="2305" /> develops.  If that happens there will be very few litigation cases and the system will be constructed speedily.</P>
    <P>Section 14 contains more of the heavy handed tactics that are spread throughout the Bill.  It would allow CIE officials and others to enter any lands and attach to any wall, house or other building a bracket, cable, wire or other fixture required for the construction, operation or maintenance of the light rail system. There is nothing about consulting the people to whose wall the brackets, wire or cable would be attached.  We are talking here about private property and constitutional rights.  The Bill gives CIE the right to write the necessary by-laws. I presume the Minister will lay them before the House and they can be objected to, but they will not be discussed here.  In effect, therefore, CIE officials will dictate the private houses that will be dealt with in this way.  I accept that the work must be done but it must be done properly.  The Bill is insensitive and will hold up the entire process rather than deal with it speedily.</P>
    <P>Another example of the delays that could take place is given in section 14. Under section 14 (1) (c) the District Court can make an order prohibiting entry onto lands.  What will happen to the light rail system in such circumstances? As provided for under section 14 (2), will CIE or others proceed in any case?  That matter must be clarified.</P>
    <P>The compensation provisions are extremely cumbersome and are likely to prove unsatisfactory.  I will expand on this matter on Committee Stage.  If ever evidence were required of the approach taken by the Department in building the light rail system, one need only examine section 15.  While this may appear a minor issue, I have never seen a State agency being given power in legislation to chop down trees and shrubs that get in its way.  The Bill contains a &ldquo;cut and burn&rdquo; section that gives CIE the power to lop trees, shrubs and hedges and that is indicative of the thinking behind the <Col N="2306" /> legislation.  If anything gets in the way the Minister is given the power to sign the necessary papers and down come the trees, or the houses for that matter. Were the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Heritage Council or other interested bodies consulted?  Will preserved trees be taken into account? Will Dublin's habitats be considered in the environmental impact statements? The Minister made no reference to that in his speech.</P>
    <P>Householders who decide to cut their own hedges, rather than let the Minister and his officials loose, will find it difficult to get paid for their work because the relevant section refers to the possibility of court proceedings.  People who cut down their own trees may have to go to court to get their money back. This makes the Bill extremely sloppy and, while it may appear an angular point, it displays the attitude that prevails throughout the legislation.  Emphasis is placed on the necessary law to railroad through the building of the light rail system, none is placed on a consultation process.  I accept that a public relations type consultation process is taking place, but there is no reference to that in the Bill.  It does not state how problems with the public will be resolved.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is on taking oaths, making decisions and lopping trees, shrubs and even houses and if people do not like what is happening they can go to the courts.  That is not the way to build a rail system in a small country such as this.  The Minister and his officials will have years of trouble if he does not amend the legislation and the matter will be before the courts long after he leaves office.  However, if he takes the proper route and provides for a strong statutory consultation process, the problems will be unravelled long before the lawyers get a slice.  By the time the legal people are finished with this matter, the money spent on the beef tribunal could seem very small.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about disruption caused by roadworks.  Section 16 provides wide-ranging powers for the <Col N="2307" /> breaking up of roads and new roads can even be built.  While there is provision for notifying local authorities about roadworks, there is none for notifying local communities about the disruption involved.  Once again, the public is being ignored.  Perhaps the Minister will introduce an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to section 23 which deals with serving notices.  Will the Minister explain section 23 (3) which refers to what constitutes the serving of a notice.  If a notice has to be seved on every individual, the line will never be built.  Section 24 provides for another layer of bureaucracy in terms of by-laws. Anybody affected by the light rail plan would need to study law and give up their other work and interests to study all the documents associated with the project.  It is difficult to imagine the type of by-laws CIE will draw up for this project.  A by-law is a law, but it does not come before this House for debate. The Minister is giving CIE <i>carte blanche</i> to write by-laws.  In a few years' time, long after he has left office, he will be horrified by the powers CIE gave itself when drawing up by-laws for this project.</P>
    <P>Section 25 states that CIE may set up subsidiaries.  However, we still do not know whether the light rail will be run by an existing company or by a subsidiary. Also, the legislation does not provide for employees.  Will the light rail staff be employed by CIE or by a subsidiary? Will they comprise existing CIE staff or will they be employed on contract? What terms and conditions will apply to such staff?  The cost set for 1996 and anticipated for 1997 and 1998 are inadequate.  Will the Minister outline the costs for the following years and how he proposes money will be spent, particularly in 1997 and 1998?  I and my party believe the Bill as drafted is heavy-handed and will create a legal nightmare and total chaos.  We cannot understand why the simpler model of the gas pipeline was not chosen.  We would also be interested to know why an amendment to the railways Acts was <Col N="2308" /> not considered and, if so, whether that would have obviated the need for this complext Bill.</P>
    <P>I and Fianna Fáil fully support the light rail system structure but this Bill is bureaucratic, possibly unconstitutional and provides for no real consultation with local communities.  A new streamlined Bill is urgently required to allow the project proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my party's support for Luas.  We recognise the need for a modern, efficient and reliable public transport system for Dublin where traffic congestion is choking the city.  Our poor standard of public transport means that, outside of the DART corridor, the vast majority of motorists use their cars in preference to what they perceive as a slow, unreliable bus service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my party favours the development of a rapid rail service as a major initiative in solving Dublin's transport problems.  Having said that, we want the best possible system for the available funds.  It is here I take issue with the Minister and Government.</P>
      <P>There are major deficiencies in the proposals outlined by the Minister.  I will point out just a few.  Assuming that we proceed with the Minister's plan, Dublin will be one of the few cities with two rapid rail systems.  There will be no interchange between the two; apparently the two will be run by two different companies, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann, without any connection to the airport, neither would there be any connection between the city's two mainline train stations.  The Dundrum terminus is to be located at a major traffic bottleneck and will cause major congestion there, and there will be no service at all to most of the north side of the city.</P>
      <P>I understand the decision to exclude the north side was based on the spurious logic that, as the people of Ballymun had fewer cars than everybody else, they had less entitlement to a rapid transit system: the mind boggles at such thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal presented will be a <Col N="2309" /> recipe for chaos in the central city area. International experience shows that the key to the success of a rapid transit system is segregation.  Full segregation would be achieved by a system such as the London underground or even Dublin's DART, which run on their own dedicated track and do not come into conflict with other forms of traffic.  The principle of segregation underlies the light rail transit systems recently completed in other countries, the new LRT systems installed recently in Manchester and Sheffield being good examples. Both systems run on segregated track for almost all of their length.  In the case of Manchester this means three kilometres only of its total route length of 31 kilometres runs on the street, less than half of which is in conflict with other traffic.  In Sheffield virtually all of the system runs on segregated tracks and, out of a total route length of 33 kilometres, 600 metres only is in conflict with other traffic.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with what is planned for Dublin.  Under the Luas proposal more than half the total 40 kilometres track length would run along suburban roads and busy city streets in direct conflict with motorised traffic.  Every major junction between the canals would be a battleground for trains, buses, trucks and cars, the travelling public being the ultimate losers.  One can imagine the traffic chaos that will result from building twin train tracks along the central reservation of the Naas road, one of the busiest arterial routes in the country and a vital commercial link between Dublin and the remainder of the country.  For example, will intending passengers be expected to walk across three lanes of heavy traffic to clamber abroad the tram in the middle of the road?  The Minister should explain how this will work.</P>
    <P>The proposed system will also have serious problems in terms of safety. Research shows that the accident rate on non-segregated systems is five times higher than that on segregated systems. In other words, are we about to instal a system in Dublin that may not merely <Col N="2310" /> be unsatisfactory but potentially unsafe?</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine an alternative approach which would eliminate the problems I have mentioned.  A unified proposal for an integrated rapid transit system for Dublin has been put forward by an informal group of engineers led by Mr. Cormac Rabbitte.  This proposal is the result of considerable effort on the part of public-spirited individuals who undertook this work without any prospect of personal gain.  As such, it deserves better than the cavalier, dismissive treatment it received from the powers-that-be in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>This unified proposal &mdash; which I support &mdash; argues in favour of a system that would be almost totally segregated.  For the benefit of those inside and outside the House who are unfamiliar with the details of this proposal, I will describe very briefly what it envisages for each of the planned lines.</P>
    <P>I shall begin with the Dundrum line. The unified proposal recognises the essential need to base the southern terminus at Sandyford Industrial Estate, with which I wholeheartedly agree. Thereafter the line would use the abandoned Harcourt Street track until it reached the canal, from which point it would proceed underground to a city centre station at Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght line would take a completely different route to that envisaged in the current Luas proposal; instead of following roads, it would follow people &mdash; and travel from Tallaght along the unused bus reservation as far as Sundrive Road, from where it would proceed underground to the station at Temple Bar.  By using the busway instead of the Naas Road, this line would serve some of the most densely populated areas of Dublin, such as Crumlin and Kimmage and greatly increase the population catchment of the whole system.</P>
    <P>On the Tallaght route, I fail to see how a tram trundling along suburban roads can offer any time saving over an <Col N="2311" /> express bus service which would cost only a fraction of the Luas budget.</P>
    <P>The unified proposal would represent a significant modification of the existing Luas plan, effectively converting it into a totally segregated system and making it available to a much greater percentage of the city's population.  The underground option would obviate the need for wholesale destruction of inner city communities and the disruption of commercial life along the proposed street level routes.  For instance, construction of the Tallaght route, as planned, will result in huge traffic disruption along the Naas Road, significant job losses in the Mount Brown area and demolition of whole streets in the inner city area.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the unified proposal would allow Dubliners enjoy the benefits of a segregated system.  Journey times would be shorter, requiring less rolling stock, fewer staff and reduced need for operating subsidy.</P>
    <P>However, the unified proposal goes father than the Dundrum and Tallaght lines.  Unlike the Government plans, it recognises the need for a fully integrated rapid transit system for Dublin and, to that end, envisages a continuation of the Dundrum line to the airport and a continuation of the Tallaght line to Connolly Station.  Segregation would remain the key objective.  The Temple Bar-Connolly Station section would be underground.  The airport line would proceed underground as far as Broad-stone before going overground to serve Phibsborough, Glasnevin and Ballymun; a small section only would need to run on public roadway.</P>
    <P>Implementation of this plan would provide Dublin, for the first time, with a fully, integrated rapid transit network comparable with that in any other European continental city.  DART and Luas would be fused together to create a single, coherent, interconnected system for the whole city.  The range of journey options would be dramatically increased, rendering it possible to make a whole range of trips speedily and easily, trips which are prohibitively difficult <Col N="2312" /> at present, and which would continue to be so under the Government's Luas plans.  For instance, it would be possible &mdash; using city centre interchanges &mdash; to travel from Dún Laoghaire to the airport, from Sandyford to Connolly Station and from Tallaght to Howth.  In addition, for the first time, it would offer a public transport link between Ballymun and Dublin Airport.  The airport, one of our biggest centres of employment and Ballymun one of our biggest centres of unemployment are less than three miles apart; yet, amazingly, there is no transport link between them.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe we are serious about tackling the problem of long-term unemployment if we cannot provide even a basic transport service to enable people to travel to and from work.  The existing Luas proposal offers none of these trip options.</P>
    <P>The alternative system would also provide interchanges with Arrow-type diesel commuter services at Connolly, for Malahide, Drogheda and Dundalk and, at Liffey junction, for Maynooth and Mullingar.  The unified proposal is clearly far superior to the system the Government put forward.  If we had a plebiscite in the city offering a choice between the existing Luas plan and a three line underground system in the city I have little doubt which would win public support.</P>
    <P>The basic issue is money.  Can we afford to run an underground system in the city centre?  Can we afford to develop a fully integrated system with links to the airport and Connolly Station?  The subject of construction costs is complex.  The Government has at its disposal all the necessary resources and expertise to compare and evaluate different systems and methods of construction. I urge the Minister to ensure there is a full evaluation of all the possibilities before construction begins.</P>
    <P>A crucial question relates to tunnelling costs.  Proponents of Luas have been quick to dismiss the city centre underground option as being so expensive as to be impractical.  I am not an <Col N="2313" /> expert in this area, but I beg to differ with that argument.  There is reason to believe the underground option may not be any more expensive than the proposal for an on-street system and that it might even work out cheaper.</P>
    <P>I understand the cost of constructing a rail tunnel in Dublin is in the order of £11 million per kilometre.  That compares with an estimated cost of £12.5 million per kilometre for the on-street system.  One reason the on-street system is so expensive is the horrendous cost involved in relocating services.  Construction of the Luas system, as proposed, will require water, electricity, gas and telephone services to be dug up and put down again elsewhere on the same street.  The estimated cost of that process is £2 million per kilometre, a figure which takes no account of the cost of the disruption to business life caused by necessary excavation and construction activity.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister and his Department to assess the comparative costs of the overground and underground options for the city centre sections of the system.  I stress that it is only for the central section, between the canals, that the underground option should be contemplated.</P>
    <P>On the issue of comparative costs I will address a number of questions directly to the Minister.  Did the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications or CIE carry out a study of the costs of going underground in the city centre?  What firm or consulting engineers was used to do such a study?  What conclusions did that study arrive at?  Will the Minister publish the results of it?</P>
    <P>This Administration has made great play of its commitments to openness, transparency and accountability, but it is time there was some openness about Luas.  It may be that the city centre sections of the system could be put underground without it needing any increase in the present project budget. If so, the Minister should explain why he is proceeding with an on-street system in the city centre that will cause <Col N="2314" /> enormous disruption during construction and will not deliver any real increase in journey times that could not be achieved by running a faster bus service.</P>
    <P>What about the third line which must form an essential part of any rapid transit system in Dublin?  How can it be funded?  The Ballymun-Dublin Airport line must be built.  We cannot construct a system at major public expense that ignores the needs of the people of the north side of the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  There is major concern among my constituents and much further afield about this issue which has gone unreported and about which there is a lack of clarity.</P>
      <P>In September 1995 the Government set up a subcommittee to study casino gaming activity and the relevant legislation which may require amendment. A good deal of time has elapsed since that subcommittee was established and we have not heard of any comprehensive report.</P>
      <P>My constituents are concerned about An Bord Pleanála's recent approval of a large-scale project.  It appears the Government has decided that its first preference, the national conference centre, long talked about by successive Governments, should be given priority location in the RDS grounds in Ballsbridge.  That recent decision was made in the light of consideration of schemes, programmes and submissions requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Andrews, in response to questions to the Minister responsible for this area on Tuesday, was told it is hoped that work on the proposed conference centre will commence by the end of the year.  Given that we have been struggling for a long <Col N="2315" /> time to have a conference centre established, it is doubtful there will be room for a conference centre in the former Phoenix Park racecourse as well as one in Ballsbridge.  The Government should clarify the position and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental objection to the proposed project at the Phoenix Park.  It lies in the commitment given by the applicants at the An Bord Pleanála hearing that not more than 500 gaming machines will be included in the complex. It was originally intended that the number would be closer to 800.  The scale of the physical dimensions of the project could accommodate up to 1,000 slot machines.</P>
    <P>Having heard submissions from concerned people including members of the clergy, community workers and others who were dealing with a problem that has reached crisis level, I and a number of cross-party colleagues on Dublin County Council voted to ban the use of gaming machines in Dublin.  That was a considered and reasoned council decision.  Such gaming machines are outlawed and I hope they will remain so.  I hope the Minister will clarify the direction the Government intends to take on this issue and whether it proposes to introduce legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>The size of the stadium, the houses it will overlook and the traffic chaos that will be caused by the project are matters of concern to my constituents.  We were taken aback by An Bord Pleanála's decision, particularly given that an objection was made by the Fingal planning team at executive level.  Local councils and officialdom opposed the project and made a comprehensive case at the hearing with An Bord Pleanála.  I question the recent decision of An Bord Pleanála.  While everybody else could be criticised for making planning decisions that faceless bureaucracy has not been questioned.  Its decision is not in the interests of the proper planning and development of the proposed location chosen for the project.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify this <Col N="2316" /> matter.  Under no circumstances should legislation be introduced to permit the use of gaming machines, particularly on the scale proposed for the Phoenix Park complex.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising this matter. Casino gaming is legal in Ireland.  The Government asked the Minister for Finance to investigate the pros and cons of a casino licence initially in the context of financing the expected deficits of a national convention centre.  Later the Government uncoupled the issue of the casino licence from the conference centre and decided that the Minister for Finance should report on the merits of licensing a casino as a separate policy issue.  The Department of Finance invited representatives of the Departments and agencies likely to be affected by a decision to licence casinos to participate in a task force to advise on the issue.</P>
      <P>The task force is chaired by the Department of Finance and comprises representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Finance, Justice, Social Welfare, and Tourism and Trade, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, Bord Fáilte and the National Lottery Company.</P>
      <P>The remit of the task force is to identify the major considerations which would arise for the Government in deciding whether to licence casinos.  It has been engaged essentially in a factfinding task assembling information relevant to both sides of the argument drawing both on material already in the public domain and on information sources accessible to the various agencies represented on the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the areas being considered by the task force are the social implications of casino gaming, the revenue implications and the legislative and regulatory implications.  The task force is aware of the fact that several proposals for setting up casinos have been tabled by a broad range of business interests.  They <Col N="2317" /> have not, however, discussed the specifics of any of these proposals with the promoters.  All persons seeking to discuss their proposals were advised that the role of the group was to facilitate a decision by the Government as to whether it wished to amend gaming and lotteries legislation to remove the existing legal prohibition on casinos.  Only in the event of a Government decision in principle to relax this prohibition would it be possible for Ministers to entertain proposals to set up casinos and even then it would be necessary for the Government to define specific parameters within which it was proposed to contemplate the licensing of casinos.</P>
    <P>There the matter rests.  Until the Government has had an opportunity to give consideration to the matter generally the question of examination of individual casino proposals does not arise. The Deputy, and the House, can be assured that before any decision in principle is taken by the Government to permit casino gaming, full account will be taken of all views expressed on the matter, including concerns expressed about the possible adverse social implications of casinos.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Leitrim Sewerage Schemes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the question of sewerage schemes in Leitrim on the adjournment.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will be able to give an adequate answer on behalf of her ministerial colleague from the same constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three villages concerned, Dromod, Drumsna and Jamestown are known as Shannonside villages.  All three are on the Shannon and have been in need of sewerage schemes for some time.  Some years ago Leitrim County Council submitted proposals to the Department with regard to funding.  To date no funding has been provided.  I understand the schemes have been included for Cohesion funding from the <Col N="2318" /> EU and that this is the method of funding that is being followed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Despite continual representations to the Department and to the EU, no final decision has been reached with regard to the provision of funding for the three villages concerned.  It is important that this matter should receive urgent treatment in view of the fact that these villages have a major contribution to make to tourism.  They already have facilities for dealing with cruiser traffic.  Recently the Department of the Environment announced funding for the provision of a pumpout station at Dromod.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, who is here on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, will be in a position to tell the people in those communities when they can hope to have schemes under way.  The village of Dromod is awaiting decision on 18 planning applications for private houses to be built by individuals on their own sites which are delayed because of the absence of sewerage schemes.  This is alarming in view of the population decline suffered by County Leitrim through the years.  The three villages are also in the catchment area of the new Masonite project which means they will be major growth centres in the context of employment and the construction of new residences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this matter.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has asked me to express his regret at being unable to be present to reply to the Deputy due to other business.  I am glad to reply on his behalf and to put before the House the present position in relation to the provision of sewerage schemes for the villages of Dromod, Drumsna and Jamestown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a modern environmental infrastructure in support of the whole economy is a high priority of this Government.  This is a commitment which has been, and continues to be, well demonstrated by the huge investment in the water services programmes throughout the country.  I am sure that <Col N="2319" /> the Deputy will agree that County Leitrim has benefited substantially from this investment.</P>
    <P>Of particular note, in this regard, is the South Leitrim Regional Water Supply, a major infrastructural project costing approximately £6 million, which is funded entirely by the Exchequer and which will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Leitrim is also set to benefit from EU funding under the INTERREG 2 Programme. This programme will provide funding for a number of schemes, including the Newtowngore and Keshcarrigan sewerage schemes' along the Border.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the benefits which has accrued to Leitrim under the small schemes programme for water and sewerage schemes.  Furthermore, as Dromod is an important stopping off point for the hire cruiser fleet using the River Shannon, the Minister recently approved a grant of £137,000 for the development of a sewage pumpout facility to be located there.  This facility will also provide public toilets and showers for both cruiser and caravan visitors to this attractive riverside village.  The Dromod facility is just one of 17 such projects which are being provided to service the expanding private and hire cuisers fleet using our inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is aware of the apparent deterioration in lakewater quality in Lough Ree and is actively pursuing a strategy aimed at reversing this situation.  Monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency has shown that there has been a substantial increase in the level of bio-available phosphorous in the lake and the principal inflows to it.  Nutrient input can be attributed to many sources but point sources such as effluent discharges from towns and villages together with diffuse agricultural sources are an area of particular concern.</P>
    <P>With the objective of securing an overall improvement in the quality of surface and groundwater within the Lough Ree catchment, the Department, <Col N="2320" /> together with the four relevant local authorities, have formulated an integrated catchment protection scheme for Louth Ree involving all aspects of the control of nutrient input to the lake in order to prevent eutrophication.  This catchment scheme is the subject of an application for assistance under the Cohesion Fund.  Dromod and Drumsna are included in Stage 1 of the application. Drumsna is estimated to cost £625,000 and Dromod £800,000, out of a total projected investment for the catchment of more than £14 million. Further schemes, including Jamestown, may be included at later stages.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion application relating to Stage 1 of the Lough Ree scheme was submitted to the Commission in December 1994.  To date, there has been no decision by the Commission on the application.  However, the Department of the Environment has been actively pursuing the application with the Commission with a view to securing its approval this year.  I can assure the Deputy that the Minister will continue his best endeavours to ensure that these sewerage schemes can proceed at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my utter dissatisfaction and frustration at trying to raise this important matter of law enforcement measures to combat the drugs problem.  I have had this request for the Adjournment debate before the Ceann Comhairle for eight weeks which must be an all time record. It is ironic I have had to wait eight weeks to raise the matter and get a response from a Minister as it seems the Ministers responsible for this area do not deem it important enough to come into the Chamber.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is coming here to deal with a matter that is primarily of concern to the constituents in Dublin working class <Col N="2321" /> areas.  It is a disgrace that the Government is paying so little attention to this issue.</P>
      <P>I had expected either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance to be present to deal with the drugs problem.  Without doubt the drugs problem is the biggest issue facing us in the Dublin area.  It is devastating thousands of lives and destroying entire communities and needs to be given priority by Government. I regret to say there is little evidence &mdash; today there is more proof of the point &mdash; of the political will to deal with this emergency with the resources and urgency it demands.</P>
      <P>While the middle class debate supply reduction versus demand reduction the wave of drug related crime continues to engulf the city destroying the lives of many of my constituents.  Our first priority must be to stem the supply of drugs and we do this by tackling the operations of the main drug barons.  It is an affront to most ordinary people to read the minute details of the extravagant lifestyles of these gangsters in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>On a regular basis we read about the expensive properties they own, their big cars, their movements and their associates yet they appear to be untouchable. These people are quite openly making huge profits from drug dealing yet the State seems powerless to deal with them.  Some are in receipt of social welfare payments and live in Dublin Corporation houses.  Apart from the appalling damage that drug dealing is causing to my constituents and others across the city, the drug barons are providing the most dreadful example to the smaller dealers down the line and to the many young people living on the fringes of society and considering a life of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We either tackle this problem or give up and let the criminals run the country. The Garda Síochána complain about an inadequate exchange of information between themselves, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  The Revenue Commissioners understandably fear for their <Col N="2322" /> own safety and that of their families. What should be done?  The Government must establish a special unit comprising hand picked personnel from the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Social Welfare to target the drug barons.  The existing wide-ranging powers of the Revenue Commissioners should be extended to this unit and the personal protection of its members must be guaranteed.  The unit must be fully resourced as is necessary, regardless of cost.</P>
    <P>The options are to do this, or give up because it is not until these godfathers of crime are put behind bars and their assets confiscated that we can start to seriously tackle the drugs emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express the regret of the Minister for Justice who cannot be here as she has an unavoidable commitment.  I assure Deputy Shortall, however, that I will convey the strength of her concerns personally to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance, whom I am meeting shortly.  I regret that it has taken so long for this matter to be debated.</P>
      <P>The Government shares Deputy Shortall's deep concern about the drugs crisis particularly in the part of Dublin she represents and is determined to tackle this issue.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, on 19 July 1995, the Government approved a series of measures to improve law enforcement on the drugs problem and related matters.  One of the measures required that a joint review be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda authorities of certain recommendations of the Law Reform Commission as regards co-operation between the two bodies.  The terms of reference given to the Revenue Commissioner and the gardaí based on the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report on the Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime (1991) &mdash; were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2323" /> (i)  That the existing tax laws should be enforced with vigour against drug dealers, handlers of stolen goods, or others obtaining a living from crime.  The powers given in various Finance Acts particularly in Sections 18 and 19 of the Finance Act, 1983 (which extends Revenue powers to the chargeability of profits or gains arising from unlawful sources or activities) should be employed as extensively as possible, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  There should be greater mutual transfer of information between Revenue and the Gardaí to assist the Gardaí in confiscating the proceeds of crime, and to assist Revenue in recovering arrears of tax from the criminals concerned or to penalise them for non compliance with the Revenue's lawful requirements.</P>
    <P>The review has now been concluded and a report will be submitted to Government shortly.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Minister can make no further comment pending the Government's consideration of the report.</P>
    <P>As regards the role of the Department of Social Welfare in this area, I know the Department is concerned about the illegal drugs problem and the effect it is having on communities.  That Department is exploring, in consultation with other State agencies and community interests, what role that Department might play in a co-ordinated approach to tackling the problem.  They are already participating in the national committee concerned with the reduction of the supply of drugs.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the Customs and Excise service &mdash; a part of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; the Deputy will be aware that a memorandum of understanding was recently signed by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioner.  The memorandum was also endorsed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.  This memorandum, among other things, will help to resolve any difficulties that may <Col N="2324" /> have arisen in the past and provides for the establishment &mdash; for specific operations &mdash; of a joint task force comprising representatives of the Garda, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service as required.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Alleged Irregularities in Milk Quota System.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the ongoing investigation by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry into alleged irregularities in the operation of the EU milk quota system.</P>
      <P>Disturbing reports of significant irregularities in the operation of the EU milk quota system are now in public circulation. These allegations, which potentially involve millions of gallons of milk, could undermine the integrity of the quota regime.  It was reported in one newspaper this morning that a departmental investigation has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.  It is already known that an investigation is being carried out by the Revenue Commissioners as a result of payments by co-ops to farmers out of accounts other than milk accounts.  It is further reported that the gardaí are about to be called in to assist in the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister set out unambiguously what exactly is going on?  Is it the case that there has been fraud in the operation of the EU milk quota system and, if so, who have been the beneficiaries? I want him to come clean on the existence of a mysterious substance called &ldquo;quiet milk&rdquo; for which payment was kept very quiet.  When questioned on RTE's farm news programme the Minister stated that an investigation was not needed.  Why did he change his mind and why did he not tell the Dáil that an investigation was ongoing?  Will he confirm that two farmers are in the process of taking legal action against co-ops and are threatening to join the Department in the proceedings on foot of the widespread practices which are alleged to have been going on?  The <Col N="2325" /> effect of the unravelling of this débâcle on the emerging PLC status of co-ops must be of concern.</P>
    <P>The main concerns are whether this practice will bring a retrospective milk super levy on Ireland, going back to 1989.  On six million gallons, this could amount to approximately £8 million. The amount of &ldquo;quite milk&rdquo; alleged to have been sloshing around in the system is six million gallons.  Has the European Court of Auditors asked for the report now being complied and, if so, when did it ask for it?  In regard to any punative irregularity, I can say with some certainty that few, if any, small producers were let in on any special arrangements. The producers who would benefit from a legitimate change in the existing arrangements were not at the table when these alleged special arrangements were made.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister set out the scope of all ongoing investigations by his Department or other State agency into allegations of irregularities in the quota regime?  How many co-ops are under scrutiny and how many farmers are under investigation?  I voice my considerable scepticism about how complex arrangements involving large numbers of people, and which are now contended to be illegal, could have escaped notice for so long.  The sense of discretion of what might broadly be considered as the agricultural establishment, should not be underestimated.  It is imperative that this matter is rigorously investigated and the full facts disclosed.  Sharp practice and fraud have no part to play in the agri-business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify media reports on possible irregularities in the operation of the milk quota system.  There are a number of points I will make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is responsible for the implementation and control of the EU milk quota system in Ireland.  There are more than 60 registered milk purchasers. Each purchaser has a quota, which totals more than one billion gallons altogether.  Approximately 40,000 <Col N="2326" /> active milk quota holders supply these purchasers.</P>
    <P>The quota system is not a simple one. It is set out in a series of complex EU and national regulations which contain the detailed rules for the operation of the system at producer, purchaser and national level.  The national regulations were updated in October 1995.</P>
    <P>Within the framework there are national regulations and schemes governing the reallocation of unused quota known as &ldquo;flexi milk&rdquo;, temporary leasing of quotas, restructuring of quotas as well as the range of provisions governing the links between land and quotas, including those relating to transfer of land.  It is an extremely wide ranging and complex system.  Its complexity is necessary to take account as far as possible of the range of different circumstances which apply not only throughout the EU but within individual member states.</P>
    <P>At the kernel of any supply management regime such as the milk quota system lie the controls implemented by the relevant authorities.  My Department is acutely aware of this and rigourously applies such controls.  The controls are kept under constant review and are updated and reviewed to reflect experience gained both here and with other member states.  The system of controls in place has been scrutinised by the EU Commission on numerous occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>As part of the control system, my Department conducts detailed audits on an ongoing basis at selected milk purchasers. These are selected according to a risk analysis, underpinned, by the detailed and ongoing monitoring of the system at ground level.  It is my Department's policy to deal fully with any abuse or irregularity in the operation of the system in accordance with the legislation governing the system.</P>
    <P>We are in the process of carrying out such an audit of the industry as a whole. This has uncovered, in the case of one purchaser, that some national rules in regard to the adminstration of the quota had not been correctly applied.  The <Col N="2327" /> super levy had, however, been correctly calculated and fully paid to the Department and the EU in the normal way. Therefore, the audit outcome had no financial impact.  In a second case, the audit found that the levy had not been correctly calculated and was, therefore, underpaid in two years.  This shortfall has, however, since been fully paid with interest.</P>
    <P>I will clarify a matter referred to in press reports.  The impression is given that the EU may impose fines for breach of super levy rules.  This is not correct.  My Department, exercising its legal authority as competent authority, will impose a super levy where it finds it has been evaded and pass it on to the EU Commission.  Other action over and above this is also open to it and will be considered when appropriate.  The EU is fully aware of these developments and is satisfied with the approach being adopted.  Only this week, officials of the EU Commission met officials of my Department and have been fully briefed on the details of the findings to date.</P>
    <P>I have taken a keen interest in ensuring that the milk quota system is applied in a way that meets the objectives set for it both in terms of dairy policy and financial accountability.  I have kept myself fully informed of the progress of these investigations.  I have no hesitation, therefore, in pursuing any attempt to undermine the system to the full extent of the legal provisions available. That matters of the type under discussion here to-day have been uncovered by my Department is testament to the efficacy of its controls and its willingness to implement the quota system totally and comprehensively.  I assure the House that whatever action is necessary in this or any other case to <Col N="2328" /> maintain the credibility of the quota system will be taken.</P>
    <P>Any information which it is legally permissible to communicate will not be concealed in the investigation.  It will be clear from what I have said that only two of the 60 registered milk producers are under investigation.  The well known co-op in farming circles to which the Deputy referred has not been found to be in breach of any super levy rules.  The other producer, who features prominently in one of today's newspapers, has been found to have had a problem. There has been an underpayment of levy but it will be fully repaid &mdash; the final aspect was repaid this morning.  As I do not know if there will be a legal prosecution in this case I am circumscribed in terms of what I can say.  The milk purchasers have a total quota of one billion gallons a year and we are talking of fraud involving four million gallons at most over two years.  There should not be widespread concern about this issue and there is no prospect of taxpayers having to pay a fine.  The EU is satisfied with the measures we have taken and we have kept it informed every step of the way.  I have not been explicit in terms of naming certain purchasers and I hope this will not be misrepresented as an industry problem.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the officials in the dairy division of my Department for their detailed approach to this issue and for unearthing the information, whether in regard to a breach of national fleximilk rules or a more serious breach of rules.  We received the utmost co-operation from the two producers involved. If the Deputy has any further questions I will communicate directly with him or answer parliamentary questions on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 May 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the losses suffered by sheep farmers in the Nire Valley, County Waterford, during March 1996. Once the extent of the problem became apparent, I had measures set in motion to ensure that the full ewe premium and sheep headage payments be paid in 1996 for the sheep lost in the disaster.  In addition, I have instructed that the producers affected would be exempted from the requirement to fill 70 per cent of their quotas in 1996 and 1997.</P>
      <P>EU Regulations do not permit my Department to pay the full ewe premium to these farmers on their 1996 ewe numbers, while they rebuild their flocks.  The EU disaster fund is specifically for humanitarian aid and does not cover situations of this nature.</P>

      <P>I am committed to developing urban forestry, wherever possible, for the benefits of those living in cities, towns and villages throughout the country.  This is consistent with my intention of ensuring that we generate as wide a range of social and economic benefits as possible from our national forestry programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 March 1996, I launched a new <Col N="2221" /> scheme called the urban woodland scheme.  The aim of this scheme is to support the establishment or development by local authorities of woodlands in or near centres of population for the purpose of public enjoyment and recreation.  The scheme covers woodland improvement and/or the establishment of new woodlands on land owned or managed by local authorities and also the provision within such woodlands of a variety of public recreational and amenity facilities such as seats, signs, litter bins, picnic tables, playground equipment, etc.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in touch with local authorities throughout the country to promote this scheme and I am looking forward to receiving many applications over the coming months. My emphasis in both the urban woodland scheme and its sister-scheme, the amenity woodland scheme, is on supporting quality projects which will clearly have positive local impact.  My Department will provide up to £4.5 million in support of projects aided under both schemes up to and including 1999.</P>

      <P>When I came into office I was seriously concerned to discover that the funds available for the operation of this scheme were inadequate. Following negotiations with the Minister for Finance and the European Commission, revised funding arrangements were put in place to meet potential demand from applications on hand at 27 April 1995, the date the scheme was suspended.  These involved the transfer of additional resources from <Col N="2222" /> elsewhere in the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry as well as the bringing forward of substantial funds, already available in the operational programme, into 1996 and 1997 from later years.</P>
      <P>My Department was thereby able to expedite payments in 1995 and 1996 to existing approved applicants as investment works were carried out, and also to issue approvals to outstanding applicants on hands, on the understanding that the grants in such cases would be paid in 1997 when further funds became available.  This represented a substantial improvement on the position which such applicants would otherwise have had to face.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of April 1996, some 9,800 farmers had been approved to carry out investment works under the scheme, with a grant commitment of some £87 million.  Of these some 4,720 have been paid a total of some £39 million. As indicated above payments in respect of works approved prior to April 1995 are being made according as investment works are carried out to specification, and subsequent approvals have issued on the basis that grants will be paid in 1997.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is I am sure aware the matter of research in farming, including organic farming, is a matter for Teagasc.  However, I should point out that since 1990 Teagasc has been engaged in research at the organic unit in Johnstown Castle and furthermore considerable research has been carried out at the Teagasc centre in Kildalton and at Mountbellew agricultural college.  Indeed, the organic unit at <Col N="2223" /> Johnstown Castle continues to be operated to organic standards and important scientific information will continue to be assimilated there.</P>
      <P>My Department has additionally provided for the development of the organic farming sector for the past number of years through a series of initiatives in promotion, research, training and education.  At the present time the sector is being developed through a special supplementary measure under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS).  This special measure provides attractive financial farming in accordance with a five year agri-environmental plan.  Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development Forestry 1994-99 an allocation of £1 million has been provided for the development of the organic sector in the areas of marketing and promotions and distribution of organic produce.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a reasonable level of research and development has been carried out in the organic sector.  While Teagasc has provided a worthwhile service in the areas of organic research and advice in recent years my Department will be appraising the role which Teagasc can play in these areas to meet the future needs of this expanding sector.</P>

      <P>While the conservation of endangered wildlife species, including their habitats, is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the <Col N="2224" /> Gaeltacht, the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, administered by my Department contains a measure which requires participant farmers to retain any wildlife habitats on their farms.  The habitats which must be retained under REPS are listed in the scheme's documentation and are as follows; callows, turloughs and other seasonally flooded areas; marshes and swamps; peatlands, including raised bog, cut-over bog, blanket bog or moors and fens, sand dunes; foreshore and sea shore; machairs, eskers, natural or semi natural vegetation; woodlands, scrubland, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams; field boundaries-margins; hedgerows and stone walls; old buildings inhabited by protected species such as barn owls and bats, and discused quarries and such workings which have become habitats.</P>
      <P>Farmers under REPS are prohibited from carrying our certain activities such as afforestation and drainage works which could have an adverse effect on a habitat area.  In the light of the foregoing the Deputy will recognise that habitat areas are indeed catered for under REPS.

      <P>I have delegated responsibility to the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, for a number of work areas.  Details of the main ongoing activities and programme of work may be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Legislation</P>
      <P>The text of the Control of Horses Bill, 1996 was circulated on 20 May 1996 and the Second Stage is scheduled for Wednesday, 29 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" /> 2.  Leader II and Rural Development</P>
    <P>The Minister of State successfully negotiated with the EU Commission approval of a National Leader II programme, replacing the pilot and selective Leader I Programme in Ireland. The programme sets out the general terms on which Leader II operates and the basis on which the approved groups were selected.  Following an additional allocation of funds by the EU Commission, total funding for the Leader II Programme, 1995-1999, is IR£95 million.</P>
    <P>Priorities of the Minister of State are:</P>
    <P>(a)  To formulate a strategy for rural development to be devised by the Department arising from recommendations of the Rural Policy Advisory Committee by 31 May 1997.</P>
    <P>(b)  To have all Leader II contracts signed by 30 June 1996 &mdash; currently two of the 36 contracts remain to be signed. Close liaison to be maintained with the Leader groups to monitor performance and effectiveness.  A mid-term review to be carried out by 30 April 1997 and additional funds of IR£18 million to be allocated on a merit basis.  (c)  To have a curriculum for national certificate and national diploma in rural development and enterprise, arising from discussions at the Rural Policy Advisory Committee, in operation by Teagasc and the universities by September 1996.</P>
    <P>3.  Greyhound Breeding and Greyhound Racing Industry</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is actively involved in promoting a number of positive initiatives in relation to the greyhound industry which have contributed to the process of reversal of the downward cycle of the last ten to 15 years experienced by the industry.  These initiatives span the fields of taxation, capital investment, marketing and legislative infrastructure and represent the most significant and co-ordinated approach to the development of the industry since the establishment of Bord na gCon in 1958.  The Minister of State <Col N="2226" /> will continue to progress these matters over the period of his administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, has overseen the preparation of heads of a Bill which will provide for the updating of the 1958 Greyhound Act and it is expected that a Bill will be circulated by 31 October 1996.  Bord na gCon reports directly to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>4.  Cattle Breeding</P>
    <P>A feasibility study on the future organisation and financing of cattle breeding activities was completed in October 1995 and published by the Minister of State in November 1995.</P>
    <P>Negotiations at industry level on how the consultant's report should be implemented have so far failed to achieve substantive agreement among the industry organisations.  The Minister of State is currently engaged in an initiative to facilitate progress to the next phase of the process by which the restructuring of the organisation and financing of cattle breeding can be undertaken to protect the long-term best interests of the Irish dairy and beef industries.  His aim is to achieve agreement on the future funding and organisation of cattle breeding by September 1996.</P>
    <P>5.  Horticulture Industry</P>
    <P>The Minister of State oversees the horticulture industry.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grant aid for investment in commercial horticulture under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99, was announced in January 1995.  In the first round of applications, which closed on 31 January 1995, 440 applications were received, of which 135 were approved, representing grant aid of IR£900,000 with a total investment of over IR£2 million.  The second round of applications closed on 30 April 1996 and is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>A new farm improvement programme for horticulture has been introduced with some IR£12 million in grant <Col N="2227" /> aid being made available.  This will result in a total investment of in excess of IR£50 million in the horticulture industry over the next four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State established the Horticulture Industry Forum which meets periodically in order to attempt to create greater co-ordination, co-operation and communication within the horticulture industry, placing particular emphasis on establishing closer linkages between market intermediaries comprising the &ldquo;supply chain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A priority of the Minister of State is to ensure that the Horticulture Industry Forum, established November 1995, takes an active role in indentifying problems in the industry and realises creative solutions to those problems which are identified.  He will participate actively in the business of the forum.  An Bord Glas reports directly to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>6.  Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS)</P>
    <P>Under REPS, the Minister of State has presided over the expansion of the scheme from a stage where, when this Government took office, there were under 500 farmers in REPS, to the current stage where over 13,000 farmers have been approved for payments under the scheme.  The amount paid to farmers in that time has increased from approximately IR£3 million to almost IR£47 million at present.</P>
    <P>In February 1995 the Minister of State established the REPS Consultative Committee which draws representation from State, agricultural and environmental interests, and was established to give feeback on the operation and effectiveness of the scheme.  The REPS Committee has to-date been responsible for putting forward a number of proposals which have been incorporated into the scheme towards its overall improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will keep REPS under review to ensure that (a) the scheme is best suited to Irish farming conditions and (b) the original target of 40,000 participants will be met.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2228" /> 7.  Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has been successful in promoting greater interest in the scheme of early retirement from farming.  Since December 1994 the number of farmers approved for pension entitlement under the scheme has trebled from 1,400 to over 4,300, with the average annual pension amounting to IR£9,126 per annum.  As a result, over 132,000 hectares of land have been released to young trained farmers for structural improvement.  This is well ahead of the programme estimates and the Minister of State will continue to ensure that the original target of 7,000 participants in the scheme will be met by 1998.</P>
    <P>8.  Plant Health</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has operational responsibility for plant health, which covers: (i) phytosanitary measures, the prevention and-or control of plant diseases and pests, and (ii) the approval, marketing and usage of agricultural pesticides such as herbicides, fungicides, insecticides etc.</P>
    <P>In the general plan health areas, 12 new national regulations have been introduced and implemented under the responsibility of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has taken an active role in measures to improve the Department's pesticide control service. He has held a number of meetings with the agri-chemical industry and has successfully negotiated a substantial financial contribution from the industry towards the cost of employing additional staff and facilities in the Department's pesticide control service. These arrangements are at an advanced stage and it is envisaged that they will be in place by year-end.</P>
    <P>9.  Land Policy</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has undertaken to ensure that farming interests are fully represented in the compilation of the proposed national land use policy plan, to be devised by the Minister for the <Col N="2229" /> Environment.  He has sought and has obtained the views of the various interested parties in this context and is currently engaged in the preparation of a review of current departmental policy, including the impact of various schemes operated and administered by the Department on land policy.  It is the Minister of State's aim to finalise the land use policy document in course of preparation by 31 October 1996 and to conclude active discussion of its contents by 31 December 1996.</P>
    <P>10.  Premium and Headage Payments</P>
    <P>A major priority of this Government was to ensure that farmers are paid their entitlements under the headage and premia schemes in a timely and efficient manner.  The Charter of Rights for farmers, published in April 1995, provides for a programme for substantially improved services to farmers to be implemented over a two year period.</P>
    <P>The charter is our commitment to a quality user friendly service.  It is the farmer's assurance of full information, privacy and confidentiality, prompt response to queries and a definite payments schedule.  It also provided for an independent appeals procedure, which ensures that all appeals are handled in a way which is seen to be completely fair and impartial.  The new headage and premia appeals unit was set up in the autumn of 1995 and is now fully operational. Significant progress was made on improving accommodation facilities in local offices during 1995 and this will continue during 1996.</P>
    <P>The payment targets set out in respect of 1995 schemes were largely met or indeed exceeded.  During 1995 a record £664.2 million was paid out to farmers under the various headage and premia schemes.  Some £415 million of this related to payments under the 1995 schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is committed to maintaining this progress.</P>
    <P>11.  Food Sub-Programme</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Food Sub-Programme 1994-99, which was approved in late 1994, is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2230" /> Up to the end of 1995, a total of 463 grants involving grant aid of £152 million has been approved.  Implementation has been integrated with the development plans drawn up by the implementing agencies &mdash; Forbairt, An Bord Bia, Teagasc and FÁS.</P>
    <P>The sub-programme, in addition to providing financial assistance for investment in fixed assets, will continue to make available considerable support to companies to develop new products, seek out new markets, improve their operational efficiencies and upgrade their skill levels and management capabilities. This contrasts with earlier approaches where public funding was largely applied in support of fixed assets investments.</P>
    <P>The sub-programme and its individual measures will continue to be monitored to ensure compliance with the overall objective to build a competitive food industry which will generate national wealth and employment while helping to sustain rural economies.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is responsible for monitoring the food sub-programme.</P>
    <P>12.  Disease Eradication (other than TB)</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will formulate and establish by September 1996 a sheep scab control and eradication plan.</P>

      <P>The operating rules which govern the implementation <Col N="2231" /> of the business plans by approved Leader groups are designed to ensure accountability and transparency in the administration of public funds.  The rules were drawn up on the basis of the requirements of the programme as set down by the European Commission, the findings of the independent evaluation report on Leader I, the report on the value for money examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General and my Departments's experience of the first programme.  In finalising the rules, account was taken of the views of the successful groups.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a reasonable balance has been struck between the administrative procedures which are necessary to safeguard public funds and the bottom-up flexible nature of the programme.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the recent modifications to REPS are designed to enhance the environmental impact of the scheme on the participant farms and, by extension, on the countryside as a whole.  All of the changes introduced take account of the experience gained from the operation of the scheme to date and further changes give practical effect to modifications to the scheme which were approved by the European Commission.  The monitoring procedures my Department has put in place are essentially to ensure that participant farmers are complying with the scheme's requirements and to further ensure that payment will only issue to participant farmers who have established an entitlement to payment.</P>
      <P>A significant feature of the revision is the introduction of a penalty system under which fines vary from 5 per cent to 100 per cent of payments.  Where serious breaches of the rules occur a participant will be excluded from the scheme, will have to refund payments made and will not be allowed to reapply for up to two years.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the current BSE crisis may create difficulties for the European Union in complying with its obligations relating to the GATT ceiling on subsidised exports. However, the extent of any such difficulties will be largely determined by, on the one hand, the rate of recovery of beef consumption in the Union and, on the other hand, the quantity of beef removed from the market by the various measures taken by the United Kingdom in the context of their programme to tackle the BSE disease.  In the latter regard, it should be noted that the destruction of meat from cattle over 30 months, combined with the selective cull of 80,000 cattle, should reduce beef production in the United Kingdom by up to 300,000 tonnes.  In addition, the United Kingdom has decided to implement the calf slaughtering premium and this could remove substantial numbers of calves from the production chain. However, it will be some time before the overall impact on the market balance in the EU of these measures can be assessed and in view of this, it is too early to assess what are the most appropriate adjustments to beef policy to meet the new situation.</P>

      <P>The EU directive governing movement of animals between EU member states is implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Trade in Animals and Animal Products) Regulations, 1994.  In addition, the EU decision to ban the exportation of cattle and bovine products from the UK was implemented by regulations adopted by me on 28 March 1996.  These regulations contain a wide range of powers, including penalties of up to 12 months imprisonment and fines of up to £1,000 and, in certain cases, the destruction and disposal of the animals concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 33 seizures of animals have been made since the entry into force of the EU prohibition on the export from the United Kingdom of, <i>inter alia,</i> bovine animals.  In 19 of these cases, the animals have either been destroyed or a <Col N="2236" /> notice of destruction served.  Prosecutions in relation to such illegal trade are hampered by the difficulty in determining in many cases the actual importer of the animals or by the fact that the importer resides outside the jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure by my Department in 1995 on the agriculture, food and forestry sectors, including both Vote and non Vote expenditure, was £1,650 million, excluding the Department's administrative budget.  The main elements of expenditure were as follows: direct income payments to farmers of £747 million; market support measures of £715 million; and measures, other than direct income payments, co-financed by EU Structural Funds of £91 million.  An amount of £68.681 million was paid as grant-in-aid to semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department.  These bodies also received £10.648 million in EU funding.  Grants amounting to £7.838 million were paid to assist a number of other bodies performing work of relevance to the agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct income payments in 1995 accounted for 35.5 per cent of income from farming.  Although total farm income increased by 7.7 per cent in <Col N="2237" /> 1995, many farm families continue to have lower than average incomes. Direct income payments, therefore, constitute an important source of support for farm income.</P>
    <P>Market support measures, such as export refunds, benefit the beef and dairy sectors in particular.  They are also an essential part of the market mechanisms which support prices in the EU. Without this support, prices for beef and dairy products would be approximately half the current level.</P>
    <P>EU financed or co-financed schemes are vital to Irish farmers and the food industry.  A major review of the CAP was undertaken in 1992, under which the current structures were put in place. Further adjustment of the CAP is likely in the context of the WTO round, European Monetary Union and enlargement. The Irish focus in any future negotiations will be to ensure common financing of measures and full compensation for farmers for any reduction in market supports.</P>

      <P>Approximately 3,000 townlands in 305 district electoral divisions in 18 counties were reclassified from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped in October 1995. Farmers with land in 1996 in the townlands in question and who did not heretofore have land in more severely handicapped areas are therefore eligible to participate in the 1996 cattle headage scheme as distinct from the 1996 beef cow scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department identified all farmers who had land in 1995 in the townlands reclassified and made arrangements to issue the appropriate 1996 cattle headage application form to those farmers. Some of those farmers already had some land in more severely handicapped areas and the effect of the reclassification in their cases would have been an increase in the amount of their land which is more severely handicapped. Since they already had some land in more severely handicapped areas they would always have been issued with the cattle headage application form as distinct from the beef cow headage application form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort was made to ensure that the appropriate 1996 application form issued to farmers with land in the reclassified areas, there may well have been instances where an incorrect form issued.  My Department has no evidence, however, to suggest that a large number of incorrect application forms issued.  The press advertisement which appeared during the last week of April 1996 advised all intending applicants, particularly those whose land was reclassified to ensure that they received <Col N="2239" /> and completed the appropriate application form.  Any farmer who inadvertently received an incorrect application form may obtain the correct form from his-her local office.</P>

      <P>Supplementary measure 1 under REPS deals with the conservation of proposed natural heritage areas, NHAs. This is a mandatory measure for REPS participants who have some or all of their lands in a proposed NHA.  A top up payment of £30 per hectare, subject to a maximum of 40 hectares, is available to such farmers who follow guidelines for the conservation of the proposed NHA as prescribed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The areas in which the corncrake grant scheme operates are proposed NHA sites and, accordingly, the top up payment is available to farmers in these areas who comply with the NPWS requirements for the conservation of these sites.</P>
      <P>REPS is, as I indicated, a wide ranging scheme and not a scheme designed to cater for individual wildlife species, such as the corncrake.  The conservation of such species is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who has provided an allocation of £64,000 for this purpose in 1996.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 45, 48 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the collection, treatment and disposal of livestock offal are a commercial matter to be determined between the parties directly involved, processors and the rendering industry which produces meat and bonemeal.</P>
      <P>As part of the memorandum of understanding concluded with the Federation of Irish Renderers on 10 April, I agreed to provide a temporary subsidy on the production and storage of meat and bonemeal.  That subsidy expired on 21 May.</P>
      <P>I understand that, arising from discussions between meat processors and the Federation of Irish Renderers, agreement has been reached on a commercial solution which will enable offal to be collected and the meat industry to function normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> I do not see any necessity in the current circumstances for the non-commercial disposal of meat and bonemeal. However, technical discussions have been held with a number of Departments and agencies in regard to various possible non-commercial uses for meat and bonemeal.  These technical discussions are ongoing.</P>

      <P>A total of £50,216,000 has been paid to 14,238 farmers since the launch of the scheme in 1994.  The number of farmers awaiting second payments is 1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> First payments under the scheme are made on an ongoing basis.  The second instalment would normally be due for payment 12 months after the commencement date of the agri-environmental plan.  However, due to the high level of deficient plans submitted during the first year of the scheme more detailed checking of applications is being carried out.  As a result, no second year payments have yet been made. Checks on farmer compliance with their REPS plans commenced last week on those who joined the scheme in 1994 so that second year payments can be made at the earliest possible date.  It is expected that these payments will commence in the next week.</P>

      <P>There is a high level of co-operation between my Department and the Department of the Marine which is effected mainly through ongoing liaison between, and joint activities by, our respective State agencies. For example, in the area of product development, the National Food Centre, a division of Teagasc, and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are jointly involved in providing technical support services to the fish processing sector.  On the marketing side, I have agreed with my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, that the export market promotion functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are to be transferred to An Bord Bia.  The first step in implementing this agreement has been taken with the appointment of the nominee of the Minister for the Marine to the board of An Bord Bia in November 1995.  The other arrangements necessary to effect the transfer, including the establishment of appropriate structures and linkages between BIM and An Bord Bia, will be completed later in the year.  Meanwhile the two boards have a close working relationship. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is kept fully informed of, and participates as appropriate in, An Bord Bia's activities and programmes, including in particular its trade fairs and other overseas promotions.</P>

      <P>The deseasonalisation slaughter premium is payable in member states where the number of steers slaughtered in the period 1 September to 30 November of the second preceding year exceeds 40 per cent of annual steer slaughterings.  This scheme is designed to encourage a better seasonal spread of slaughterings in regions with traditional seasonal imbalances in production.  It has been very successful in Ireland in meeting this objective. Because of the success of the scheme steer slaughterings in the period September-November 1995 were just over 36 per cent of annual slaughterings and, therefore, below the 40 per cent limit necessary to trigger the scheme in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1996-97 price proposals the Commission has proposed a reduction in the trigger to 38 per cent, based on total steer slaughterings in the island of Ireland.  In addition, when the trigger is not reached member states would have the option of maintaining the premium at 60 per cent of its current rate, which would be financed by way of reduction in the second tranche of the special beef premium.  This proposal, as it stands, is unacceptable to me for a number of reasons, including the fact that it would mean that the existing premium would not apply in 1997.  I am pressing to have the trigger reduced to 35 per cent and based on steer slaughterings in individual member states, with a provision that, in the case of the island of Ireland where it is triggered in one jurisdiction, <Col N="2246" /> it automatically applies in the other. This would allow this very important premium continue uninterrupted in 1997 and prevent a return to the previous seasonality pattern.  I do not expect a final decision on this before the meeting of Agricultural Council on 24-25 June.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A major priority of the Irish Presidency will be to achieve a satisfactory resolution of the difficulties in the beef sector arising from BSE, including <Col N="2248" /> adequate compensation for beef farmers for the lower prices being experienced this year, a restoration of consumer confidence in beef and changes in the market organisation which will better suit the sector in the longer term, to the extent that these issues may not be concluded during the Italian Presidency.</P>
    <P>A further priority will be to secure a satisfactory outcome to the debate within the Council on the report which the Commission is required to carry out on the application of the quota system in the sheepmeat sector and to bring any resultant commission proposals to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>Other priorities of direct interest of Irish agriculture will be in the fixing of the set-aside rate for 1996-97 in the arable crops sector and the finalisation of a number of proposals in the veterinary area relating to food safety, animal welfare and trade and the siting of a new EU veterinary agency in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Since the outbreak of the BSE scare at the end of March effective market support measures have been put in place at EU level to overcome the serious crisis that has affected the beef industry.  These measures included an extension of the range of qualities which are eligible for intervention, the temporary lifting of the weight limit on carcases which may be sold into intervention, and an increase of over 12 per cent in export refunds for beef and live cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, even though 10,499 tonnes of beef has been taken from the market through intervention, I have always been conscious that market support measures on their own would not ensure adequate returns to producers.  From the early stages of this crisis I insisted <Col N="2251" /> on provision being made for compensation to producers through direct income payments.</P>
    <P>At this week's meeting of the Agriculture Council, Commissioner Fischler presented his suggestions for a compensation package amounting to 650m ECU based on topping up the suckler cow and special beef premium.  While the Commissioner's ideas are welcome and significant they do not take full account of current difficulties in the market.  The Commissioner will review his suggestions in light of the discussion in the Council and will submit his formal proposals at the next meeting of the Council which is scheduled for 3-4 June. I will be pressing for some improvements to take account of our position and would hope that this eventual proposal and Council decision will represent a fair and equitable response to present difficulties.</P>
    <P>In particular, I am aware that the main income losses incurred to date have been suffered by winter fatteners and my objective in the forthcoming negotiations on the compensation package will be to ensure that this category of producer receives an equitable share of the compensation provided by the European Union.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement under the 1994-99 Community Support Framework for Ireland to undertake a mid-term review of the Structural Funds.  In the case of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, I expect that an independent evaluation will get <Col N="2252" /> under way in June and be completed by December.

As regards the scheme for compensatory headage payments under the Structural Funds, the Deputy may be aware that we were obliged to carry out an independent evaluation of that scheme in 1995 as the Commission felt that the amount of funds going to this measure &mdash; 62 per cent &mdash; as against general investment for agriculture under the Operational Programme was too high.  Following consultations with the farming bodies my Department is now drawing up proposals to address the various broad recommendations contained in the report and these will be available during the course of the mid-term review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Communist takeover of Saigon in 1975, more than 800,000 Vietnamese have passed <Col N="2253" /> through the refugee camps in South-East Asia, most on their way to resettlement in the United States, Canada, France, Australia and other so-called third countries.  Ireland has also accepted a number of refugees and there are now more than 500 Vietnamese refugees settled in Ireland, including more than 100 children born here.</P>
      <P>In 1989 a UN-brokered Comprehensive Plan of Action &mdash; CPA &mdash; established a screening system under which third countries would accept only those they deemed true refugees.  Some 115,000 Vietnamese were deemed to be economic migrants in South-East Asia and thus ineligible to be considered for resettlement.  As of April 1996, about 77,000 of these had been sent home by air.</P>
      <P>Some 18,000 people remain in camps in Hong Kong, and officials there are seeking to repatriate them before 1 July 1997, when the British colony will revert to China.  The Chinese Government has demanded that those people currently occupying the camps be returned to Vietnam before this date.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recent forcible repatriation of Vietnamese boat people and the reported disturbances in camps in Hong Kong, I understand the UN High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; UNHCR &mdash; regretted that Hong Kong's recent deportations of the boat people had been necessary.  The boat people were among thousands interviewed by the UNHCR over the years in Hong Kong and other Asian countries and were among those deemed to be economic migrants rather than refugees.  The UNHCR holds the view that it is Hong Kong's sovereign right to return the boat people to Vietnam.</P>
      <P>I understand that the British Prime Minister has raised the situation of the returning boat people with Vietnam's Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who has said that Vietnam wished to see the repatriation carried out in a way that respected the safety and dignity of the returnees, and with international assistance conforming to agreements already made between the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> It should be noted that officials in the UNHCR have detected no systematic harassment or political persecution of boat people who return to Vietnam. The UNHCR believes that those who go back will find their native country dramatically changed for the better.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR has recently announced its decision to end the Comprehensive Plan of Action on 30 June 1996.  According to the UNHCR, the goals of the CPA have been accomplished: asylum has been upheld, genuine refugees have been recognised and resettlement has been generously provided, and returnees have been fairly and humanely treated under the watchful eye of UNHCR.</P>
    <P>The decision to end the CPA means that the UNHCR will phase out its care and maintenance activities in South-East Asian camps.  In Hong Kong, however, which shelters a larger number of boat people, the UNHCR will maintain alternative arrangements.  Moreover, UNHCR's extensive programme to monitor people who have returned to Vietnam, and its financial assistance and micro-development projects to facilitate reintegration of returnees, will continue well beyond the ending of the CPA.</P>
    <P>According to the UNHCR, the Vietnamese Government has also stated that it would facilitate boat people who return to Vietnam to then depart the country, provided that they are eligible for exit permits from Vietnam.  The United States Government has indicated that it would offer expanded opportunities for the departure to the US of returnees, and the UNHCR hopes that this will encourage the remaining population in camps to return home voluntarily as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances I would not consider it appropriate to raise the question at present, but I will keep this matter under continuing review.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 57 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Electronic mail facilities are extensively used throughout the Civil Service providing communications within and between Government Departments and also with external agencies.  For internal communications, E-mail facilities are typically available to all civil servants within a Department.  The availability of external facilities to civil servants is a decision for individual Departments.</P>
      <P>My Department actively promotes the use of E-mail facilities between Departments, and the 1996 edition of the Government Telecommunications Network Directory lists the E-mail addresses of almost 4,000 civil servants for this purpose.  The use of E-mail continues to grow significantly within the Civil Service and, with the recent launch of the Government Pages on the Internet, those Departments connected to the Government Internet site now have the capability to generate Internet E-mail, in most cases from the desktop.</P>

Following correspondence between the respective solicitors, a draft <Col N="2256" /> contract and related documents were furnished by the Chief State Solicitor to the council's solicitor in February 1996. In reply, the council's solicitor requested that the commissioners should commence the procedure under Part XIII of the 1994 planning regulations in relation to the proposed new Garda station and that signing of contracts should be delayed until the commissioners had completed this procedure. This procedure was duly completed at the beginning of May 1996, and the Chief State Solicitor is at present preparing revised contract documents which will be issued to the council's solicitor this week.</P>

      <P>I have no direct responsibility for recruitment to the European Monetary Institute (EMI) which operates independently in this regard.  However, I understand that at present there are ten Irish nationals working for the EMI.</P>
      <P>The European Monetary Institute is the forerunner of the European Central Bank and its role is set out in the Treaty on European Union (Article 109f) and in Protocol No. 4 to the Treaty on the Statute of the European Monetary Institute.  This role includes strengthening co-operation between national central banks and strengthening the co-ordination of the monetary policies of the member states, with the aim of ensuring price stability.  As the Deputy will be aware, implementation of monetary policy in Ireland is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, which is an institution independent of the Government. The Governor of the Central Bank is a member of the Council of the European Monetary Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 23 of Protocol No. 4 of the <Col N="2257" /> Treaty prescribes that the European Monetary Institute will be replaced by the European Central Bank before the commencement date for economic and monetary union (EMU), which the Madrid European Council confirmed will begin on 1 January 1999.  The role of the European Central Bank and of the European System of Central Banks is set out in Articles 104-1091 of the Treaty and in Protocol No. 3 on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  This role includes the implementation of monetary policy in respect of the member states in European Monetary Union.  Governors of the member states participating in economic and monetary union will be members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.</P>

Revised syllabuses are being introduced on a phase basis thus ensuring that the need to change textbooks is kept to a minimum.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is also engaged in regular consultation with the educational publishers regarding the content of syllabuses and curricula for inclusion in textbooks.</P>

    <P>My Department's advisory committee for primary school textbooks which has representation from the educational partners is also examining the preparation of guidelines and specifications for textbooks for use in primary schools. This committee is also drawing up <Col N="2263" /> guidelines for the information of parents and schools on the selection and purchase of textbooks and other teaching materials.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cost to parents of textbooks, my Department makes provision for the payment of assistance towards the cost of textbooks in the case of necessitous pupils.  In addition school authorities are being encouraged and supported to introduce textbook loanrental schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of measures aimed at alleviating hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.  A provision of £500,000 has been made available to schools in order that entry fees for the 1996 exams may be waived or reduced in the case of those experiencing financial hardship.</P>
      <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of the scheme, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of: unemployment; prolonged illness of parent; large family with inadequate means; single parent; more than one child doing the certificate examinations or other circumstances which would denote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
      <P>An additional provision of £600,000 for reduced fees in the case of candidates who are repeating the leaving certificate has also been made available. These candidates would normally be required to pay a higher fee than first time candidates but where the candidate, parent or guardian holds a medical card, the maximum fee payable is the fee payable by first time candidates.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the concern of charitable societies regarding the possible impact of exam fees on low income families.  Indeed, taking account of these concerns, I decided to increase the fee alleviation available to schools by 25 per cent for the 1996 examinations. It is my intention to continue to improve provision in this area on an ongoing well targeted basis and as resources become available to me.</P>

      <P>In 1995, I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre to conduct a detailed study on current approaches to the identification and support of pupils in disadvantaged areas.  The criteria used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme and how to focus and target new measures to break the cycle of disadvantage were among the issues covered by the study. Following receipt of this study, I recently announced an important new initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage in targeted areas of particular need.</P>
      <P>For urban schools, a targeted programme of supports will be made available to twenty-five selected large schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.  For rural schools, a special initiative will focus on schools with fewer than five teachers, and particularly on schools in rural areas serving dispersed populations. Supports will be made available to 25 clusters of schools in this category, each cluster having a combined enrolment of some 300 to 350 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to approach schools in the target groups and areas and invite their participation in this new initiative. I would expect that the schools in question will be contacted in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the particular case referred to by the Deputy. In 1995 I allocated a sum of £150,000 for a pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  All applications for support under this scheme, including the application from the school referred to by the Deputy, were carefully considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>Funding under the pilot scheme was allocated as follows: to special schools for physically handicapped children in respect of their daily transport routes; and to provide assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for the hearing-impaired and visually-impaired who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be necessary to fully evaluate <Col N="2268" /> the operation of the pilot phase before considering any modification or expansion of the scheme.  The needs of the children attending the school in question will be given every consideration in the event of any further expansion of the scheme being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The school transport review committee, established earlier this year, has been asked to review the arrangements for pupils in special schools.  The provision of escorts services and journey times will form part of this review.</P>

      <P>In 1995 I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre to conduct a detailed study on current approaches to the identification of schools which are serving pupils from disadvantaged areas.  The report presented was one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It examined the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacted on pupils in the education system.  It reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage. The report also evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches, using a wide range of national and international research data.</P>
      <P>While the report recognised the very considerable advances which have been made in alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage, it also made a series of comments and recommendations aimed at improving on current arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to this report, I launched <Col N="2270" /> Breaking The Cycle, a new targeted initiative which aims to break the cycle of disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of urban areas, the report recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted whereby resources would be used to discriminate positively in favour of large schools in urban areas with high concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Since the report identified Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway as the urban areas with the highest concentration of disadvantaged pupils it was decided to concentrate the initial pilot phase of this initiative on schools in these urban areas.</P>
    <P>A further recommendation was for the targeting of a number of clusters of small schools i.e. schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those schools in rural areas with higher than average numbers of disadvantaged pupils.  In the case of this initiative, schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to contact the target schools and invite applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  It is expected that this exercise will commence in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Approximately, 500 offenders on renewable temporary release sign on in any one week throughout the prison service. It is not possible to give an exact weekly figure of offenders signing on in each prison as the number changes daily with some offenders being granted full <Col N="2271" /> temporary release, some having their temporary release revoked and others commencing periods of temporary release.</P>
      <P>The majority of those signing on do so on a weekly basis but some must do so on a three-day, fortnightly or monthly basis.  It is important to distinguish between renewable temporary release, under which the offender must report back regularly to the prison and full temporary release, under which there is no obligation to return.</P>
      <P>Overall, the prison service operates at or above capacity.  For example, on Tuesday, 21 May 1996 the occupancy rate was over 99 per cent of the maximum prison capacity.  Most prisons and places of detention operate from day to day without any vacancies.  The exceptions would be Portlaoise Prison, where it is necessary for operational reasons to leave some cells vacant and some open centres which from time to time, due to the lack of availability of suitable offenders, may have some vacancies.</P>

      <P>The granting of temporary or early release &mdash; called parole in other jurisdictions &mdash; is a feature of prison systems internationally. I have outlined the positive reasons for it in the past, as have my predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the case that some early releases arise in the context of accommodation problems, but it would be totally wrong to suggest that it was the sole reason for early releases generally.  It would certainly be wrong to imply that serious offenders are being released simply because of accommodation problems and without reference to other criteria which are normally taken into account in assessing offenders' cases generally. <Col N="2272" /> While a shortage of places could and does tip the balance in favour of early release in some cases, I am not in a position to put a figure on the number of cases involved.</P>
    <P>The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public.  In cases where pressure on prison accommodation may be a factor, any early releases which may be authorised are generally limited to offenders who are serving relatively short sentences or who are near the end of longer sentences.</P>

      <P>The total number of prison places currently available is 2,210.  The Five Year Plan for the Management of Offenders June 1994, estimated that in order to eliminate all <i>ad hoc</i> releases and overcrowding, an increase of 825 places would be necessary.  The cost of providing these places was estimated at about £90 million, with an annual operating cost of £30 million.  The report did not recommend the creation of that number of extra places, making the point that a certain level of early releases &mdash; or parole &mdash; would always be justified.  The report stated that a credible case for 500-600 extra places could be made to eliminate overcrowding and reduce the level of early releases somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the provision of additional prison places is as I announced at the end of January last.  I am proceeding with planning and construction works for the provision of the 278 additional places I promised earlier this year.  Already, 33 additional places were brought into use at St. Patrick's Institution in February and a further 38 places, which were out of use arising from extensive fire damage at the <Col N="2273" /> Health Care Unit, Mountjoy in December 1995, will be ready for reoccupation within the next week following major fire damage repair and fire safety upgrading works at the unit.</P>
    <P>Construction works for the conversion of the Military Detention Unit at the Curragh to a civil prison to accommodate 68 offenders, were commenced within the past two weeks, and are due for completion in autumn this year. Works for the construction of a special prison unit at Castlerea to accommodate 25 offenders have commenced and these places are expected to come on stream within four months.</P>
    <P>At Portlaoise Prison, a series of works necessary for the recovery of up to 80 cell spaces now vacant due to operational requirements or used to accommodate a range of necessary offender facilities, have been commenced and are due for completion within the current year.</P>
    <P>These measures will increase the available accommodation by over 14 per cent.  I am satisfied that these additional spaces, along with increased reliance on community sanctions and positive sentence management, in appropriate cases will have a significant impact on the overall pressure on accommodation in the prisons and help reduce the level of temporary releases due to the shortage of prison accommodation.</P>

      <Col N="2274" /> Terms of Reference of Advisory Group on Investment-Linked Naturalisation</P>
    <P>1.  To consider applications for naturalisation based on investment in the State received by the Minister for Justice and referred to the Group and to make recommendations to the Minister based on the Group's assessment of the job-maintenance capacity of the investment.</P>
    <P>2.  The Group will examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation/advice from relevant agencies where necessary and, in making their recommendations, will apply the following criteria:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Substantial residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least 5 years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the 2 years following naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(b)  The level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where the investment is in the form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least 7 years at an interest rate not greater than 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary market, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower. The loan shall be made by the applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.</P>
    <P>The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on. The loan shall not be secured by the assets of the company in which the investment is to be made.</P>
    <P>(d)  As ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period: at the very least 5 years.</P>
    <P>(e)  The number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only.</P>
    <P>(f)  Audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the Group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with the rules of the scheme for naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(g)  The investment will be monitored by Forfás to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the Group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2275" /> (h)  Police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in country of origin (and, if required, from the Police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments) together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to enquire behind it.</P>
    <P>(i)  Annual certification by the established auditing firm of accountants to Forfás that the investment is being maintained for the appropriate period.</P>

      <P>As a matter of policy and out of deference to the personal feelings of all concerned I prefer not to comment in detail on an individual case of this kind.  I want to assure the Deputy, however, that I am deeply conscious of the concerns of all persons bereaved by murder.  The vast majority of &ldquo;lifers&rdquo; do, however, eventually reach the stage in their sentence where the management of their sentence requires consideration of rehabilitative aspects including such steps as occasional temporary release to attend workshops or educational facilities outside the prison environment. Where this happens in the case of a person convicted of murder, special conditions are attached by me to the grant of temporary release which take into account the genuine concerns of victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very elaborate risk assessment process precedes approval by me of any programme involving periods of temporary release from custody of a person convicted of murder.  This includes consultation with the Garda, the trial Judge <Col N="2276" /> and the sentence review group, which is chaired by a former Judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that starting this year, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will be run on a <Col N="2280" /> different administrative basis compared to previous years in so far as the scheme is now paid on an age related basis rather than the level of education which the child has reached.  Under the 1996 scheme, an allowance of £43 will be payable in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and an allowance of £58 will be payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years of age.  If it is found that an 11 year old child is attending secondary school, the community welfare officer has discretionary powers under legislation to ensure the higher rate is paid in respect of that child.</P>
      <P>The objective of the changes in the administration of the scheme is not to achieve savings but rather to achieve consistency and equity across health boards.  The scheme is managed on an administrative basis and this change from school related to age-related criteria is an effort to ensure the delivery of a more efficient and equitable service to the claimant.</P>
      <P>This change in administration will also facilitate the introduction of computerisation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which will provide greater efficiency in administering the scheme giving community welfare officers access to the Department's database which will enable a speedier and more accurate response to claimant needs.</P>
      <P>There is no onus on the applicant to present a birth certificate for the purposes of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme, but once computerised, all SWA payments will be made on the basis of RSI numbers.  For control purposes, RSI numbers are only allocated on the presentation of a birth certificate which ensures that nobody can be allocated more than one RSI number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, delays experienced in the past in the EHB area in the delivery of the service were fully investigated by the health board and the problems were resolved.  The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from 1 June <Col N="2281" /> each year to allow adequate time to process the large number of applications and health boards will ensure that the majority of payments are made by 31 July 1996 to enable families to receive their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by a number of industries in the Dundalk area of County Louth, particularly in view of the Punt/Sterling differential.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by companies in the Dundalk area, including concerns regarding the impact of currency movements on their competitiveness. Sterling has fallen by about four per cent against the punt since the end of 1994.  The relative values of the currencies now means that there are benefits for some companies in terms of lower import costs, as well as competitive challenges for others.  Overall, however, the punt has maintained a stable position against a basket of currencies among our trading partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, in the first instance a matter for each individual firm to make the arrangements required to cope with the prevailing economic environment. The Government, however, does have a role in ensuring that the economic climate is as conducive as possible to economic activity, including exporting. In this regard, the current economic environment in Ireland is characterised by sound public finances, high growth, <Col N="2284" /> low inflation, interest rates at historically low levels, a high level of investment and moderate wage developments in line with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> All of these factors are beneficial to economic activity.</P>
    <P>In addition, in each of the last three budgets, considerable Exchequer resources were allocated to employers through reductions in their PRSI contributions. This was done to assist employers to maintain and create employment and was targeted at lower-paid, labour-intensive and mainly indigenous sectors of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The recent announcements of job losses and lay-offs in Dundalk-based firms were the result of competitive pressures in the electronics sector in the main coming from low cost countries.  In my reply to an Adjournment Debate on 14 May, I dealt with the question of job losses in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to reassure the Deputy that State agencies will continue to do their utmost to assist existing companies and to attract new investments to the Dundalk area.  In this regard, I am sure the Deputy will welcome the announcement during my visit to Dundalk last week of the decision by EPC to establish a project in Dundalk which will employ some three hundred people at full production.  In addition, I announced that IDA-Ireland, through private sector investment, is arranging for the construction of a new 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Dundalk as a new asset in the urgent promotion of the area for investment.  I am confident that these initiatives and the strong interest shown by potential investors will translate into strong jobs growth and economic development for the Dundalk area.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to statements made by multi-national companies who have made workers redundant in Ireland in 1996, that the reason for the redundancies was the high cost of production in Ireland in comparison to countries in the Far East; the studies, if any, that have been conducted by his Department to verify these statements; if so, the validity of these claims; whether the excess costs in Ireland are common to other EU countries; whether the costs are due to national or external factors; and if the excessive costs are due to national factors, the recommendations, if any, he will make to the Government to rectify this situation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a small number of the multinational companies which have made workers redundant in Ireland in 1996 have indicated low cost competition from the Far East as a factor in causing the redundancies.</P>
      <P>This redundancy problem relates to low labour costs in the Far East in producing certain lower value-added products which have a high labour content and are therefore sensitive to labour costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU as a whole has a higher overall cost base than Far-Eastern countries. Within the EU, however, Ireland is in a more favourable position than most other member states.  Having said that, my Department and the development agencies are acutely aware of the importance of building and sustaining a competitive cost base in Ireland.  In this regard, Forfás continually analyse and draw attention to the need to maintain downward pressure on the full range of production inputs that influence competitiveness. Specifically, the main conclusions of their 1995 report on <i>Ireland's Cost and Competitiveness Environment</i> include: cumulative wage inflation in Ireland at a little over 34 per cent over the period 1987-95 was substantially lower than the average of our main trading partners at almost 40 per cent; total labour costs in manufacturing in Ireland in 1994 were on average slightly below the UK level, about half the German average and almost three times the <Col N="2286" /> average for Portugal; at the average industrial wage the Irish tax wedge for single workers is higher than in the UK. The gap for single workers is 12 per cent for 1996-97, a significant improvement since 1994-95 when this gap was almost 19 per cent and the appreciation of the punt against sterling since 1991 and the falling gap in inflation between the two countries resulted in a loss of about 3.8 per cent in price competitiveness against the UK, over the 1991-94 period. However, both the punt's devaluation and higher average inflation in Germany have resulted in an increase of about 15.0 per cent in price competitiveness with Germany over the 1991-94 period.</P>
    <P>The Government and industrial development agencies are encouraging companies to move towards the production of higher value-added products which are not sensitive to low labour costs.  The change programme is there to help firms in low productivity sectors of business to address their competitiveness by repositioning into higher value added markets.</P>
    <P>Labour costs are one element only of competitiveness.  The overall competitiveness of Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries is a key national issue.  This relative competitiveness is monitored on a continuing basis and is a central theme of several policy/strategy papers which I am in the process of bringing to Government.</P>
    <P>The recently published strategy paper on the labour market <i>Growing and Sharing Employment</i> is the first of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>The total amount of EU subsidies and grants paid in 1995 was £1,401 million.</P>
      <P>EU financed or co-financed schemes are vital to Irish farmers and the food industry.  Direct income payments in 1995 accounted for 35.5 per cent of farm incomes.  Market support measures such as export refunds benefit the beef and dairy sectors in particular.  They are an essential part of the market mechanisms which support prices in the EU.  Without this price support, prices for beef and dairy products would fall by about half.  This would obviously have very serious implications for farm incomes and employment as well as for the food industry.</P>
      <P>The agriculture and food industries are of course a vital part of the Irish economy.  In 1995, the agri-food and forestry sector accounted for: 15 per cent of GDP; 15.3 per cent of employment; and 15 per cent of exports.</P>
      <P>A reduction in national and EU expenditure on these sectors would therefore have serious implications for the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that there is no proposal to abolish EU subsidies to agriculture.  Further reform of the CAP, building on the 1992 reform, is likely in the context of the WTO round, European Monetary Union and enlargement.  Such reforms may include reductions in market supports and prices but with compensation to farmers through direct income payments.  The Irish focus in any future negotiations will be to ensure common financing of measures, and full compensation for farmers for any reduction in markets supports.</P>

      <P>The question of proliferation of radio masts from a planning and amenity point of view is one for the relevant local planning authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to concerns about possible risks to health from non-ionising radiation produced by telecommunications masts, this is a health issue and is the responsibility of the relevant health authorities.  Therefore, I have nothing to add at this stage to my reply to Questions Nos. 14, 25 and 143 on 23 April 1996.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take, in view of full liberalisation of the airline market in 1997, to protect workers in economy airlines and to ensure the safety of Irish air travellers in view of recent air crashes involving budget or economy airlines (details supplied) and recent United States Government reports that budget airlines are between two and six times less safe than established and often state-owned carriers.</Quest>

      <P>The grant of operating licences to Irish air carriers is a function of my Department having regard to the requirements of EU Council Regulation No. 2407/92 on licensing of air carriers.  This regulation came into effect from 1 January 1993 on the establishment of the EU internal market in air transport.  One of the basic requirement for the grant and retention of an operating licence is that the air carrier or prospective air carrier must at all times be in possession of a valid Air Operators Certificate (AOC). This is a document which basically affirms that the carrier meets the technical, operational and safety requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority which are of the highest international standards. That authority is solely responsible for the granting of the AOC and I have no function in that matter.  The Irish Aviation Authority has assured me, as I would expect, that it applies the same safety standard to all Irish operators, regardless of their size or their commercial strategies.</P>
      <P>As regards airlines from other countries operating to and from Ireland, safety standards for the commercial operation of civil aircraft are set down in the various Annexes to the Chicago Convention of 1944, to which Ireland is a party.  Under the Convention each state is responsible for ensuring that airlines licensed by them comply with these standards.</P>
      <P>The EU Council of Ministers for Transport recently set up a High Level Group on Aviation Safety to examine the question of safety of air carriers from third countries.  This High Level Group is expected to present a report to the June Council of Ministers for Transport. On a broader level similar work is being undertaken by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2295" /> Also within Europe the Joint Aviation Authority (JAA), comprising 26 European Aviation Authorities including Ireland, work together to develop and implement common high aviation safety regulatory standards and procedures. This co-operation is intended to provide high and consistent standards of safety.  Ireland is fully participating in and supporting the work and objectives of the JAA.</P>
