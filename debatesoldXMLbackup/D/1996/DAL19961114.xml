      <P>I am sure Members wish very much to join me in extending a most warm welcome to Dr. Hassan Rowhani, the Deputy Speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Iran, and the other members of the Iranian delegation.  I express the ardent hope that their visit to Ireland will be happy and successful.  On behalf of the Members of the House, I extend to them the warmest of Irish greetings, céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing yesterday with the letters on file in regard to the current issue the Taoiseach inadvertently misled the House when he stated no former Taoiseach had ever cleared correspondence containing decisions or legal opinions from an Attorney General.  He stated there was no precedent for issuing such letters but there are a number of precedents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the opportunity to the Taoiseach to correct the official record.  I am sure he did it inadvertently.  I am not making an issue of that.  Does the Minister for Finance consider it a decidedly unhelpful breach of Government solidarity that 70 Labour lawyers have come out strongly against the Minister for Justice's bail referendum?  Does he consider this a breach of what the Labour Party, the Government and Fianna Fáil are trying to achieve in getting this referendum passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant to the Order of Business.  The matter can be raised in many other ways, it is not appropriate now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister wants it both ways.  He wants to pretend in here that he supports the referendum while outside he wants to tell the liberal agenda he is against it. That is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>Since the report of the inquiry into what happened in the Department of Justice is not scheduled for debate in the House next week, can the Minister for Finance give an undertaking that Questions to the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach will not be ruled out on the basis of the anticipation rule.  Can the Minister for Finance say when we will debate that report in the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We expect to have the report sometime on Monday but it is not yet clear precisely when.  As the Taoiseach said on a number of occasions both inside and outside the House, as soon as it is practical arrangements will be made to have a full debate on the report of the inquiry.  As the Taoiseach has also said, in the <Col N="1088" /> course of that debate provision will be made, as has been the practice of this Government, for questions to the relevant Minister or Ministers should that arise.  As to when precisely it will be ordered, that is a matter for the Whips.  I will ask the Government Whip to discuss the matter with the Opposition Whips as to what is practical in ordering business in advance of a report we hope to get on Monday.  However, at this stage although we have not yet received it, we cannot order Business should the report not be available. I have no reason to believe it will not be available but it is our clear intention to have a full debate as soon as it is.  I expect, as has been the practice in the past, that both Opposition parties would like to have some time to read the report before a debate takes place.  As soon as is practical, we will facilitate the House in having the fullest and most comprehensive debate with full questions and answer sessions as an integral part of it.  We will talk to both Whips about that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I note from this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> the Government has received a report on the pay and remuneration package of chief executives in the semi-State sector.  It seems some of them are in breach of Government guidelines.  Does the Minister intend to publish that report today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not yet finalised its consideration of the Estimates, which will come as no surprise to the Deputy opposite. It is my intention and that of the Government to have the Estimates published early in December to provide time for a debate before the House rises for the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Order of Business at the beginning of the week we were to deal with the situation in the Great Lakes area of Africa.  Is it still the intention that this will be part of this week's Business?  Given that the Dáil has to give approval for any involvement by the Army in UN action in Africa.  It is a matter of some urgency.  I am absolutely flabbergasted and ashamed that we seem to have put this on the back burner because of the domestic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Tánaiste and the Government Whip offered time <Col N="1089" /> to the Opposition parties for a debate during the course of this week.  For a variety of reasons, which we can understand, that was not availed of. The Government is quite prepared at any stage, subject to agreement with the House and the Whips, to have such a debate.  We share the Deputy's concern about the scale of the tragedy unfolding in the Great Lakes region of Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will be aware this issue was raised twice on Tuesday, and this morning was seen to be appropriate rather than last night after a no confidence debate.  I understand the Tánaiste was not available for it this morning and that is why it was left until next week.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the Opposition not availing of it, it was a question of suitability for both sides of the House.  In advance of the debate, will the Minister for Finance indicate to the House the willingness of the Government to make our forces available as part of a UN contribution to a military force to assist in feeding up to a million people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his clarification of why we are not having a debate this week.  I did not wish to mislead the House in any way.  With regard to the attitude of the Government, it has not yet had a chance to discuss this.  I understand there was a full debate at the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday on the same issue.  Two weeks ago the Government indicated it was making an extra £1 million available for humanitarian relief which is to be channelled through the ODA section of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We are fully aware of the widespread concern about the scale of the tragedy and of the desire of the people to respond as efficiently and effectively as possible. As soon as time is available and those with responsibility for this matter are in the House we will discuss the matter and take appropriate action.  The Government has not yet discussed the matter and, therefore, I am not in a position to give an indication, as the Deputy requested, of what its attitude will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter twice on Tuesday with the Taoiseach.  We had the visit of the Tánaiste to Ireland yesterday and the visit of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, to Zaire and Rwanda last week.  Will the Minister for Finance take this decision today with the group of Cabinet Ministers that are around, and announce it?  Even the British are contributing and the French have offered to.  As President of the EU, it is important that the Government should be seen to reflect the wish of the people <Col N="1090" /> to contribute in a meaningful way to the military force being assembled by the United Nations to be led by the Canadians.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste was prepared to make time available but the time was not availed of. We share the concern of all Deputies and Senators about this matter.  We will have a debate as soon as arrangements allow us to.  The Deputy knows I am not in a position to indicate what the Government will do.  It would be very unwise.</P>

      <P>In the context of the programme for Government, I tabled a Question on the Higher Education Authority which the Minister for Education appointed.  I accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling that the Question is out of order on the basis that the Minister apparently has no responsibility for the Higher Education Authority.  In a week when we have heard much about answerability, accountability and Ministers coming before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach a question about the commitment in A Government of Renewal to assist people with disabilities and he told me to table a question on the matter.  I did that, but the reply told me nothing.  I am sure the Minister for Finance is well aware of the position of people with disabilities, in particular those with a mental handicap. Thousands of them are without a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify that it is not a matter for the Government to decide to send UN troops to Africa?  That is a matter for the Dáil and we need time to discuss it, irrespective of who is available.  The people of Africa cannot wait.</P>
      <P>Is it true that the Credit Union Bill will be published before Christmas, as various dates have been given for its publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying &mdash; this has already been put on the record of the House &mdash; that any decision to send troops to Africa requires a decision of the House.  The time required to prepare for such a debate must be considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach stated repeatedly, it is the Government's intention to publish the Credit Union Bill before Christmas.  There are more than 200 sections in the legislation, which has been a long time in gestation.  If it proves impossible to publish it before Christmas, it will be published as soon as possible afterwards but it is our intention and desire to publish it before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant legislation is at a very advanced stage.  The legal remit for the existing Custom House Docks Development Company expires early in 1997.

I hope the legislation will be published before Christmas to enable Members to study it.</P>

      <P>a copy of which in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 4th November, 1996.</P>
      <P>These motions seek the approval of Dáil Éireann for draft regulations I propose to make under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment of Close Relatives) Regulations, 1996, which we passed before the summer recess.  As Deputies will recall, that Act requires affirmative resolutions of both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Act passed by both Houses and signed into law by the President last June revises and extends the legislation relating to the protection of children and young people in employment.  It repeals the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, and other employment protection legislation relating to young people dating back to the 1940s, consolidates them in the new Act and gives effect to the EU Council Directive on the Protection of Young People at Work.  It is proposed to bring this Act into operation by way of a commencement order as soon as these regulations, which are necessary to give the legislation full effect, are approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations being made under section 8 (1) of the Act modify the application of the Act to young people employed in the fishing or shipping sectors.  It is proposed that the provisions relating to working hours and night work will not apply to such young people.  These sectors were exempted from these provisions of the 1977 Act and Articles 8.5 and 9.2 of the EU Directive also allow a derogation for those sectors from those <Col N="1095" /> provisions where there are objective grounds for doing so.  We signalled that during the debate in the House earlier this year.  The employment of such workers is usually intermittent and seasonal and may entail long spells on and off duty.  For these reasons, compliance with these provisions would be impractical.</P>
    <P>It is noted that young workers in these sectors are covered by other provisions, including minimum age.  Furthermore, any young person assigned to night work must have equivalent compensatory rest time.  Under regulations I propose to make under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, a young person will be entitled to free assessment of his or her capabilities before assignment to night work and at regular intervals thereafter.</P>
    <P>The regulations proposed under section 9 of the Act exclude close relatives from certain provisions of the Act.  These provisions relate to the prohibition of employment of children, duties of employer, working hours and time spent in vocational training.  These regulations will replace similar regulations made under the 1977 legislation.  During the passage of this Act through the Dáil, Deputy Tom Kitt tabled an amendment to this effect.  I signalled at that stage that we would make this amendment by way of regulations.  These regulations replace similar provisions in the 1977 legislation.</P>
    <P>Close relatives are defined as family members &mdash; spouse, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, brother, sister, half brother or half sister &mdash; who are employed at a private dwelling house or on a farm where both employer and employee reside or in a family undertaking.  These regulations will facilitate young people who wish to work on a family farm or in a family business.  The point was made during the debate that it was important for young people to be able to help out in the family business.</P>
    <P>The regulations under section 28 of the Act prescribe the abstract of the Act, which is required to be displayed by every employer of young people at the premises where the young people work.  An employer who does not display the prescribed abstract of the Act should be guilty of an offence and may on summary conviction be fined up to £1,500 and a further £250 per day in the case of a continuing offence.  The abstract summarises in simple language the main rules in employing young people under 18 and will be available free of charge in both poster and leaflet form from the information unit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  We have designed an attractive and eye catching poster because I want this abstract to be seen and read by young people.  We have taken steps to ensure the information is made available in a user friendly way.  I also propose to make regulations under the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, whereby the employer will be required to give a copy of the abstract to every employee <Col N="1096" /> under 18 within one month of the employee starting work.  This point was made strongly during the debate in the Seanad and these regulations fulfil an undertaking I made there.  It is important that young people know their rights and entitlements under the legislation.  An information campaign about the Act will be launched as soon as the commencement order is made.</P>
    <P>We had a good debate on this legislation as it went through the House and I was pleased to take on board constructive suggestions by members of the Opposition parties after I took further legal advice.  We were able, for example, to relax conditions for young people working at weekends or at holiday time, when they did not have school the next morning, and to extend the maximum time from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m.  The Act was welcomed by Deputy Tom Kitt and Deputy Quill, both former teachers.  It places the employment of young people firmly in the context that education comes first because their long-term job security is tied in with their opportunity to get a good education.  There is a clear link between early school leaving and long-term unemployment and this was made clear during the debate.  We have tried to update our law to ensure there is adequate protection for young people and that the rules regarding work are placed in the context that education comes first for young people of school age.</P>
    <P>I commend the regulations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need to have a lengthy debate on this issue.  Are the Protection of Young Persons (Employment of Close Relatives) Regulations, 1996, specially designed for the Labour Party?</P>
      <P>We had a constructive debate in this House on the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act.  We had to strike a balance between the need to protect young people and ensure they got a proper education and the need to ensure employers did not exploit young workers.  We have seen from recent reports of the ILO what is happening world-wide as regards the exploitation of young people.  It would be wrong of us to put the health and safety of our young people at risk. I referred to the fact that many young people, especially 17 and 18 year olds, were in third level education.  Despite the fact they do not have to pay for third level education, the vast majority of young people have to find work.  Deputies from all sides of the House expressed concern about this during the debate.</P>
      <P>Although it is not the Minister's responsibility, perhaps she could tell the House when back-up legislation from the Department of Education will be introduced.  It is important to enact appropriate legislation when dealing with young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the need for information.  It is important that young people know their rights and that employers are aware of their position.  I urge the Minister to ensure <Col N="1097" /> that posters are displayed in prominent places. She should also ensure they are properly displayed in trucks or vans.  I look forward to seeing these posters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  Some glossy reports have been published by her Department which suggest it employs many marketing and design experts.  It is important to ensure the information is clear and straightforward so that everyone knows where they stand.  One problem is that legislation and regulations are too complicated.  I know it must be legally right, but employers and employees must know where they stand.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister has published the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996.  I had only a brief look at it but I have problems with some aspects.  I hope we will have a lengthy debate on it.  Many young workers who approached me are concerned about Europe becoming too intrusive.  We are here to try to assist employees.  I will not dwell on that Bill as it would not be in order, but I ask the Minister of State to listen carefully next week to the voices not only of employer organisations, whose views are well known and many of which I share, but also to the voices of employees.  I do not want any employee to have a lower wage as a result of that Bill.  We want to protect them on health and safety grounds.  We should not rush that Bill through the House but should have a detailed debate on it.</P>
      <P>My party supports this legislation on the basis that we need to protect the rights of young people in a world in which we are all striving to be competitive, which is laudable.  Regulations are required to protect the rights of young people.  As a result of a thorough debate on this legislation we have managed to get the balance right.  I await the response of the Minister of State to the questions I have put.</P>

      <P>Generally in this House and country we have been great Euro enthusiasts. That may be the case because each year we get about £2 billion net from the European Union, approximately £35 per week for each family.  It is no wonder we have been quite enthusiastic.  Each time we have been asked to endorse a new treaty by referendum, or legislation we have been delighted and enthusiastic to do so.  It is time we asked questions about the Union to which we belong.  I am not a Euro sceptic, but neither do I belong to the category of person that could be called a Euro enthusiast.  I like to think I belong somewhere in the middle and that I am a Euro realist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been very successful at getting derogations from Europe when a measure does not suit us.  Frequently when asked to upgrade our environmental infrastructure we have <Col N="1098" /> pleaded inability to pay and have got a derogation from the provisions of some of those directives for a number of years.  More recently in the case of Telecom we have a derogation until the year 2000 and beyond.  Telecom Éireann will not have competition in certain key areas.  We sought that because we considered our State company would not be able to compete in those areas at present.  We are very good at looking at ways out, but when it comes to Euro regulation we appear to embrace them with such enthusiasm that sometimes I wonder if we understand the implications.</P>
    <P>I view these regulations as restricting the pocket money young people can earn. Regulation, law and the Constitution define us as a people, what we believe in and what we want enforced.  We are good at passing laws, but we frequently fail to enforce them.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a number of key questions about the regulations we are about to put into effect.  At present a 16-year-old can hold down a general job, but under these regulations a 16-year-old who is at school cannot work between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. I get newspapers delivered early in the morning by a 14-year-old or a 15-year-old sometime between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.  Obviously that person will not be able to deliver my newspapers following the enactment of these regulations.  It is also ludicrous that under these provisions a 17 year old university student will not be able to work on a Friday or Saturday night as a lounge boy or lounge girl or to babysit up to midnight.  Who will police this legislation?  Will a Cinderella penalty apply in that if a young person is caught on the job beyond the hours in question an employer will be fined £1,500 and £250 per day for each continuing day?  Will we turn employers into pumpkins?</P>
    <P>While watching &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; last week I reflected on who were the patriots at the foundation of the State.  As we move into the 21st century we have a massive level of unemployment, which we will debate later.  A total of 70,000 people have been out of work for three or more years and 140,000 have been out of work for more than a year.  Do we really understand the obstacles facing employers in Ireland today, particularly small employers? Time and again through excessive taxation, more regulation and bureaucracy we put obstacles in their way.  We do not see them as the real patriots of the Ireland we live in now.  Through their effort, enterprise and risk-taking they provide opportunities for themselves and others.</P>
    <P>When debating legislation such as this, it is all very well to pretend we live in an ideal world and we all like to think we are idealists, but we do not live in an ideal world.  We live in an imperfect world in terms of employment and unemployment in Ireland.  We live in a world where perhaps 250,000 people here do not have a real or sustainable job, where more people are working on Government job schemes than in the <Col N="1099" /> food industry and where more people are employed in Government job creation agencies than in some of our traditional industries, such as brewing and distilling.  We belong to a European Union in which there are 20 million unemployed, equivalent to the population of three member states, or four if the population of Luxembourg is included.  Unemployment is Europe's single biggest failure.  Only the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have unemployment rates in single digit figures.  Europe is losing out.  It is an unemployment disaster area.  Some of the regulation, including the type that we will put in place this morning, is the reason Europe is losing out as against the United States and other trading blocs.  The United States has an unemployment rate of less than 6 per cent and New Zealand has a rate of 5 per cent.  We could go through the developed world and it would be hard to find a comparison in terms of the European Union's unemployment record.  For that and other reasons I question the practicality of these regulations.</P>
    <P>The law may be fine, but will it be enforced? Who will enforce it at night?  Will public officials from the Minister's Department go into supermarkets at 8.30 p.m. to check if a 16 year old who should have finished work at 8 p.m. is still on duty?  Will they go into pubs at 11.30 p.m. to check if a 17 year old university student working as a lounge boy or a lounge girl is still on duty?  Will they intrude into people's houses to check if a 17 year old is baby-sitting for somebody after 11 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday night because they do not have to go to school the next day?  I pose those questions because I do not believe this legislation will be enforced.  I believe that scrupulous employers will obey the regulations because they are the law and many young people will lose out as a result.  Because we are putting more obstacles in the way of employers, we will discriminate against young people getting work.</P>
    <P>In my experience young people who work while at school or university generally do not get into trouble with the law or take drugs.  They are generally enterprising and the type of young people we need to encourage if we are to foster an enterprise culture.  The reality is that our school system is so bookish and academic that fewer young people have an enterprise culture. Most of our problems will not be solved by Europe or anybody else, they will have to be solved by us, as they were in the past.  They will be solved by young people who are enterprising, hard-working and who understand what the world of work is all about.  These regulations put an obstacle in the way of achieving that type of society.  They are impractical and idealistic.  In an ideal world they might be perfect, but we live in a competitive world of globalised markets.  Our employers must be able to compete daily in terms of quality and price with employers in other countries to sell their products.  The more regulation, taxation, bureaucracy and obstacles <Col N="1100" /> we put in their way, the less opportunity they have to compete in that competitive world outside.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that as we put in place regulations that will act as an obstacle, particularly to young people getting work, that we will be going on to debate the problem of long-term unemployment, which affects young people in particular.  Under these regulations a 16 year old will be able to have a full time job but will not be allowed to work between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.  Is it the case that a 17 year old university student will not be able to work in a lounge bar or babysit until midnight on a Friday or Saturday night?  If so, who will enforce and police the regulations?  Will it be the officials of the Department or the regular police? Who will ensure the nonsense we are about to put into law is enforced?</P>

      <P>I will deal with a number of technical points before dealing with issues of broad principle and philosophy raised by Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of follow up legislation.  This is being worked on in the Department of Education and an announcement will be made in due course.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for its display in a prominent place.  I will make further provision in regulations to ensure an abstract is made available to employees in their pay packets within one month of starting regular work.</P>
      <P>I am at pains to ensure the abstract of the Act and the guide to it are user friendly.  When I worked in the information business, in Threshold, I was keen to ensure simple language was used and complex regulations were made as clear as possible.  Deputies will be pleased with the result. My constituency colleague, Deputy Kitt, is aware of my interest in good quality design of literature. This will be reflected in the poster.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney raised the question of babysitting which is not covered by the regulations which deal with people employed on contract.  Those delivering newspapers will only be covered where there is a contract of employment between them and the shopkeeper or distributor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney also raised the question of enforcement.  The regulations will be enforced by the labour inspectors of my Department.  There will be a new channel of appeal to the rights commissioner and the Employment Appeals Tribunal which will hear complaints.  If there is an accident involving a young person working outside the prescribed hours which results in a claim, the employer will find himself or herself in a difficult position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his or her insurance company.  That is an important self-policing mechanism.  Good employers will want to comply with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copies of the Act have been circulated.  The abstract will be circulated also to all major employers of young people.  I have met the <Col N="1101" /> vintners federation which is happy with and understands the new rules.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney took the opportunity to have a go at the principle of social legislation and our obligations under the social chapter.  She spoke as if the Act was new.  If she had followed the debate in the House closely, she would understand that in large part it consolidates existing law.  The new provisions, which we are required to introduce under the EU Directive, are minimal.  The 1977 Protection of Young Persons Act, enacted around the time Deputy Harney was first elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas, already provided good protection.  In all that time I have never heard her complain about that law.  Some of the provisions about which she complained have been part of the law since 1977.  For example, the 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. rule and the restriction on late working in respect of 16 and 17 year olds is in keeping with our obligations as a member of the International Labour Organisation and its policies on child labour.</P>

      <P>The new provisions involve raising the minimum age to 16 in respect of regular work.  This is in line with experience and research which shows that the longer someone stays at school the stronger the chance of getting a good job thus reducing their chance of becoming long-term unemployed.  Approximately 74 per cent of the long-term unemployed have minimum or no qualifications.  We do not do a service by encouraging them to leave school at 15 to take up a job.  They are more than likely to end up in a mickey mouse job and the chances of them becoming long-term unemployed are extremely high.</P>
      <P>There will be a new avenue of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the rights commissioners for young people and their parents.  The penalties will also be increased.</P>
      <P>I am proud Ireland has signed the social charter; that we believe in a Europe based on solidarity, where we are not just takers but givers; that workers have entitlements and that Europe's economic prosperity is based on the quality of our workforce who give of their commitment, talent and energies because they are not exploited and are treated well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney may wish to put herself in the same political category as John Major and the Euro-sceptics who deride basic minimum protection for workers but I remind her we are moving into the 21st century and that 19th century employment conditions are no longer acceptable.  Perhaps we are competing with people in Hong Kong and Singapore but their <Col N="1102" /> labour conditions, for young people in particular, are not acceptable in this economy and society.</P>
    <P>We hope to position ourselves on the basis of our skills base and quality education.  As the best performing economy in Europe which created a record number of new jobs in the past two years &mdash; 93,000 &mdash; we are proud to say this is based on a tradition of social solidarity and respect for the rights of workers, young workers in particular. When I speak in debates on child labour at the International Labour Organisation I can do so on the basis we have ratified its conventions dating back to the immediate post war period and we have good labour standards for our young workers.  I reject the notion we can only have an entrepreneurial culture in this society based on the exploitation of workers and lack of respect for their basic rights.</P>

    <Title>NESF Report on Long-Term Unemployment Initiatives: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Government's representative on the National Economic and Social Forum, I very much welcome its pioneering No. 4 report aimed at ending long-term unemployment.  It was unanimously agreed by the forum which comprises Members of this and the other House, the traditional social partners, unemployed people and others outside the traditional social consensus and under-represented in the paid labour force.  The forum, which is broadly representative and which has given a voice to the unemployed, the disadvantaged, women's groups and others, has come up with a good programme aimed at ending long-term unemployment which has shaped Government policy and thinking in this area.  As a result of that report a commitment was made to immediately set up a local employment service and a task force on long-term unemployment.  That task force submitted two reports to Government, the first of which deals with the setting up of the local employment service.  Work is proceeding on putting that service in place in 14 areas, the 12 original partnership areas as well as Kildare and Clare. Based on experience in those areas, the Government intends to set up the programme on a nationwide basis as soon as the local employment service is fully established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second report of the task force on long-term unemployment recommended changes to the community employment scheme to focus it better on the needs of the long-term unemployed. The task force analysed the differences on the live register between those considered to be reasonably likely to get a job with a small degree of help and those who need more intensive support to get work.  Changes were proposed in the community employment scheme such as the introduction of the integration option which <Col N="1103" /> would cater for those who have been unemployed for a year or more and who would be considered, with a year's work experience on community employment, to have a reasonable chance of getting work.</P>
    <P>The community employment scheme was revamped to put greater emphasis on training of participants and quality work experience.  The proposal that one quarter of the places on community employment be reserved for people who have been long-term unemployed, for three years or more, is being put into effect.  Under a new pilot scheme there are 1,000 places on offer to the very long-term unemployed, people aged over 35 years who have been unemployed for three years or more and whose possibilities of getting work are extremely limited, people at the end of the queue for employment.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum welcomes the initiative in setting up the local employment service, the revamping of community employment and the particular focus on the long-term unemployed.  I am glad that not only are we creating jobs at a record level &mdash; 93,000 new jobs were created in the past two years, the highest level in the history of the State &mdash; but the emphasis on tackling long-term unemployment is beginning to pay off.  In the year 1994-95, the latest year for which detailed figures are available, with an increase in total jobs of 53,000, there was a reduction of 34,000 in the number out of work.  Of those 34,000 jobs, 25,000 went to the long-term unemployed and 9,000 to the short-term unemployed, those unemployed for less than a year.  It is interesting to give a disaggregation of those figures.  In the year 1994-95 a greater number of jobs went to people who had been out of work for more than two years than to those who had been out of work for between one and two years.</P>
    <P>The forum indicated that to address the problem of long-term unemployment it is not sufficient to focus on the issues of economic growth, interest rates and so on.  While those factors help to create extra jobs in the economy, the jobs will not necessarily go to the long-term unemployed unless we address the specific problems, handicaps and obstacles facing those people.  For example, individuals who have been out of work for some time lose heart and hope. After a period of looking for jobs and finding themselves at the back of the queue, many people no longer believe in themselves and, therefore, it is very difficult for an employer to believe in them.  In some cases whole communities lose hope and young people in those communities whose parents do not have a job wonder whether it is worth while staying on at school.  Those issues need to be addressed in tackling long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>We must also address issues such as lack of education and training.  The long-term unemployed disproportionately include those who had an incomplete education or whose skills <Col N="1104" /> are obsolete.  Some 74 per cent of long-term unemployed people left school with no qualifications or with minimal qualifications.</P>
    <P>In order to address the handicaps facing the long-term unemployed the Government is engaged, through the local employment service, in a policy of turning the traditional pattern on its head of trying to fit the unemployed person into the service on offer.  The local employment service is a counselling, training, education and placement service, tailored to the needs of the unemployed person.  There is need to offer people an upgrading of skills by way of compensatory education.</P>
    <P>There is also need to ensure a job placement service modelled on successful initiatives such as the Job Centre in Ballymun and Contact Point in Coolock.  The adoption of a partnership approach at local level, involving employers, unemployment centres and the trade union movement, which concentrates on the skills and potential of the long-term unemployed, offers a bridge back into the world of work in that employers offer vacancies to people coming out of the local job centre or employment service. That model, which was pioneered in Ballymun and Coolock, is proposed by the local employment service in the 14 partnership areas throughout the country.  The service is working to put in place a tailored response to the problems faced by individuals.</P>
    <P>When I drew up the national plan I laid particular emphasis on rebuilding the economic potential of unemployment black spots.  The local development programme, which has been extended to 33 areas selected on the basis of criteria supplied by the Combat Poverty Agency as being the most disadvantaged communities in the country, places major emphasis on rebuilding the economic potential, tackling community problems and restoring hope in those communities.</P>
    <P>In the education area the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, has directed an unprecedented amount of resources to schools in disadvantaged areas and to remedial education.  She set up the Head Start Programme for pre-school education in disadvantaged areas.  This year the demographic dividend has been devoted almost exclusively to the Breaking the Cycle initiative to ensure that young people in disadvantaged communities can get help to overcome the education and other disadvantages which would otherwise make them more likely to become today's early school leavers and tomorrow's long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives are in place to address the problem of early school leaving and lessons being learned through the Youthstart, HORIZON and other programmes are being mainstreamed into the school system.  The retention rate for young people in second level education is increasing and we are all aware of the strong links between lack of education and long-term unemployment. Identifying people at an early age is an important <Col N="1105" /> part of the programme to address long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>We also have in place a series of programmes designed to deal with the disincentives which may face those moving out of unemployment into the world of work and to ensure that long-term unemployed people are financially in a position to take up job opportunities becoming available to them through various policies and in a rising economy.  In the past three years there has been a concentration on tax relief for low paid workers in marked contrast to the emphasis on tax relief for high earners during the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration.  It is by reducing the tax, PRSI and levy burdens on the low paid we will address the margin between being unemployed and moving into employment. That is particularly important and is paying off.</P>
    <P>The back to work allowance scheme is in operation and 17,000 places are now available. The scheme allows people to take three-quarters of their previous dole money in year one, half in year two and a quarter in year three tax free if they move either in an entrepreneurial capacity by creating a job, as Deputy Harney would like, or into the private sector.  That scheme is successful and there is a steady demand for it.  I am aware of its success in helping people who have been out of work for a long time get back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>Changes have been made in the health system so that a person who has been unemployed for three years can keep his medical card for three years after taking up a job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot get medical cards. It is in complete chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are ensuring also that people can retain child benefit payments for three months after taking up work before the family income supplement comes into place.  In successive budgets we have placed emphasis on improving family income supplement because it is by paying benefits to people in work, particularly those with limited earning capacity, that we ensure it pays to take up employment.  In all of these measures there is a concentration on the obstacles and difficulties facing the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>When I was first elected to this House and worked in the Department of Finance the official attitude, generally speaking, was that if the economy is going well it will benefit the long-term unemployed.  We all know from experience, research and from working with people who are long-term unemployed that economic policies alone will not solve the problem of long-term unemployment.  Something extra is required and those additional measures are being implemented.  The Government is guided in that regard by the opinions of the National Economic and Social Forum and that is recognised in the forum's opinion number three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> I would be the first to say we have not finished the job and much more needs to be done in this area.  We have been at pains to ensure the local employment service operates efficiently as it has been disappointingly slow as Deputy O'Rourke said, in getting off the ground.  I would prefer to have a local employment service that works effectively rather than one put in place in such haste it does not work.  As we learn the lessons from establishing the local employment service in the first 14 areas, it will become easier to ensure it is established effectively on a nationwide basis as recommended by the National Economic and Social Forum.  In its opinion number three the forum drew attention to the need for more quality work experience and training.  The Government accepts that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The forum raised the issue of the rate for the job.  Deputies will be aware that community employment is paid on a benefits plus basis.  The new pilot whole time jobs option, which is directed at people over 35 who have been unemployed for more than five years, the most disadvantaged in the labour market, will be paid on a rate for the job basis.  The CORI scheme which has operated since June 1994 is due for evaluation in June 1997.  That scheme has operated on a rate for the job basis within the same type of budget as that provided for community employment.  There are different views on which scheme is the more appropriate, a benefits plus based scheme or a scheme where people get their social welfare payments plus an additional amount which forms the community employment rate.</P>
    <P>If we were to move to &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo; on the basis of half time jobs, some people currently on community employment, including parents of families, could lose out financially; it would not be worth their while taking up a community employment place.  That is an issue of concern to the Government because the children of today's unemployed are more likely to be the unemployed of tomorrow.  We must ensure that parents are encouraged to take up job options which will help to build a bridge back to the world of work.  The basis on which we move forward, or whether we continue to move forward on a dual basis as is currently the case, will be examined in the evaluation of the CORI scheme.</P>
    <P>There is ongoing evaluation of the community employment scheme and this issue, on which the forum holds a particular view, will remain on the table for discussion in the light of the evidence of which is more successful in terms of both attracting long-term unemployed people, particularly those with families, on to community employment programmes, and the type of job experience.  In the CORI schemes, for example, some people earn their money by working ten hours per week while others may earn theirs by working 20 hours a week.  That can create internal tensions.  This issue will have to be examined so that we can determine which is the best method. The Government does not have any <i>a priori</i> views <Col N="1107" /> on this matter but there has not been a shortage of people presenting themselves for community employment places on the basis of the current rate for the job.</P>
    <P>The forum referred also to the potential of the social economy and work is under way in the Department of Enterprise and Employment on this.  The community employment scheme would be regarded as the biggest single intervention in the social economy but work is also under way through the county enterprise boards in relation to this.</P>
    <P>The forum drew attention to the need to co-ordinate the pilot whole time jobs option and that is being taken on board.  The division of the CE options, 25 per cent and 75 per cent between the short-term and long-term unemployed, is supported by the forum also.</P>
    <P>Regarding the status of working conditions for participants, the Government proceeded, on the recommendation of the forum, with the class A contribution for community employment workers.  Members of the forum had strong views on this issue.  I have mixed views on it and I am aware it is causing some difficulties on the ground.  The recruitment subsidy for employers has now been implemented through the new Jobstart scheme.  It has been slow to take off but a publicity campaign is under way.  Deputy O'Rourke will know I launched this scheme in Athlone recently and spoke to employers about it.  Employers also spoke to me about having recruited FÁS trainees under the Jobstart scheme and being pleased with the outcome.</P>
    <P>The forum's report also addresses the area of youth unemployment.  It is now working on a report on early school leavers and youth unemployment because there is a link between the two.  Better education funding is often the best policy for tackling unemployment.  That is being done through heavy investment in schools in disadvantaged areas, by targeting of resources at those children who may have little help or few books at home and who are least likely to benefit from their education unless they are given targeted and special help.  Emphasis will be placed by the home-school liaison scheme on involving the family because it is constitutionally the primary and natural educator of children. Involving the family in the education process is extremely important.  That service has been developed and expanded.  Using the demographic dividend arising from falling numbers in education to target resources at disadvantaged areas is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The forum makes a number of specific recommendations for the local employment service and these are being adopted by the policy unit in my Department.  For example, the recommendation on representation of the voluntary sector on the monitoring group has been adopted.</P>
    <P>On unemployment statistics, a subject the forum will return to when it holds a plenary <Col N="1108" /> session on the subject, we in this House know how unsatisfactory the live register has been. That has been shown in the survey carried out at the same time as the labour force survey which showed a discrepancy between the latter's figures and the live register's.  There is a concern that certain categories are not measured by the live register, for example, women who are actively seeking work and who may not qualify for credits or benefits.  They may be under-recorded.  We have a degree of over-recording and under-recording on the live register.  The labour force survey has much detailed information which allows useful figures on unemployment to be constructed.  This allows us to get a more accurate picture of who is actively seeking work and to form pools of workers for recruitment by employers.  We must do more on that and on regular tracking because the labour force survey, our most accurate measure, is only available on an annual basis.  However, the quarterly labour force surveys have now been implemented and we will begin to get that information on a more regular basis from the new year.  This will help to accurately track something extremely important.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is an Irish and European problem.  Some 18 million people are unemployed in Europe.  Earlier this week in County Clare.  I attended the Conference of the European Federation of Unemployed Organisations.  Half of Europe's unemployed are long-term unemployed.  This is a matter we are highlighting during our Presidency.  I held my informal Social Affairs Council in July on the theme of long-term unemployment.  I listened with great interest to what was said and the measures taken in different countries in moving towards a more active labour market policy.  For example, there are successful job sharing and job rotation schemes in Belgium and Denmark and they are also being implemented in Sweden and Finland.  I will have some proposals in this area in the future.  The other European countries were also interested in turn in what we are doing in our area partnerships, or &ldquo;territorial pacts&rdquo; in Euro jargon.  This is an area which will be discussed again at the Dublin summit.  We have put long-term unemployment at the forefront of the domestic agenda and European agendas.</P>
    <P>The rising tide does not lift all boats.  A range of additional policy measures is needed to address the specific problems and issues of long-term unemployment.  Those are being implemented but what is in place is not and cannot be the last word.  We must always be open to new ideas, to experiences elsewhere and to see what more we can do to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment and our unemployment blackspots.</P>
    <P>I have made this a personal priority in both my jobs in the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment and as the Government representative on the National Economic and Social Forum.  I welcome the fact that Government policies are being shaped by the <Col N="1109" /> input of the unemployed organisations, the Congress of Unemployed Centres and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  There is continuous feedback between the unemployed, Members of both Houses, who deal with the long-term unemployment problem in their clinics and communities, and the social partners, who can do much to remedy the problem.  That partnership, through the National Economic and Social Forum, is fruitful.  It has a voice to which the Government listens and on whose recommendations this and the previous Governments have been quick to act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to discuss the issue of long-term unemployment and I thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity.  When I was invited to the forum some months ago I said discussion of its reports should become a feature of Dáil debating and I am appreciative that this has been done.  What I say is not against the Minister or her Department but about the disgraceful neglect of the NESF.  The rosy picture the Minister has painted is not an accurate representation.  However, I know from my experience as a Minister that the best foot must be put forward, so I do not fault the Minister for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the figures too.  I did not interrupt the Minister once except on the issue of medical cards about which I have a tale to tell. The Minister must have never sat in a clinic with a long-term unemployed person who has returned to work and has failed to get a medical card.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are having the debate.  The latest live register figures show that the number of long-term unemployed is 3,500 higher.  It gives me no joy to say that Ireland continues to have the greatest number of long-term unemployed in the OECD. The Minister says the job is not yet finished.  I say the job has not yet been started.  I do not know how we can utter a paean of praise to a country with the highest rate of long-term unemployment in the OECD.  We may have the highest rate of economic growth but we have the highest rate of long-term unemployment.  That is a paradox which has not been explained in two years of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and other Ministers speak ecstatically about economic growth and say we are the envy of Europe but many people are in despair.  We have the largest number of long-term unemployed and the number has grown by 3,500 in the past year.  It is all very fine for the well-heeled, but for people who are part of the growing number of neglected people, it is sad that we are debating an issue when we have nothing concrete to show for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister for Finance said that Jobstart and Workplace would be <Col N="1110" /> central planks of the Government's commitment to reducing long-term unemployment.  We waited with bated breath.  It is now nearly the end of November and just 500 people are employed under the schemes, not the 5,000 projected.  I knew that projection was a scam because the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Mr. Richard Bruton, did not have the money to meet the target.  Nineteen ninety-six was to have been the year of initiatives by the Government but only 500 are employed under the project and £1 million has been spent on advertising it.  I am glad it is being advertised, but we are assailed on radio, television and in newspapers by massive advertisements, and there must be something wrong when the schemes are not being taken up. I was unable to go to Athlone but I sent my apologies.  I hope the fact that only 500 are employed under these schemes will prompt action.</P>
    <P>A year and a half ago, on 20 June 1995, during a Private Members' debate on long-term unemployment the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, said that the Government was determined &ldquo;to implement the local employment service as recommended by the NESF and as endorsed by the task force on long-term unemployment&rdquo;.  This has not yet been fully implemented, as is noted with serious concern by the NESF in its report of April, 1996 entitled &ldquo;Long-term Unemployment Initiatives&rdquo;.  I commend NESF and its very sturdy chairperson who has not allowed herself to become part of the system.  I thought NESF would be sucked into the system and to a certain extent it has; the marginalised are now muted because they feel they are part of making policy.  They are very far from making policy.  However, the chairperson pulls no punches.  She notes in the report that the NESF is seriously concerned about the delays in establishing the local employment services even in the initial 14 designated areas, apart altogether from the Government's stated commitment to extend it to all other areas throughout the country.  This body, set up by the Government to be the forum through which the views and policy making points of the long-term unemployed would emerge, has been ignored, and that fact cannot be obviated by the sweetness and light of the debate.</P>
    <P>The NESF also lambasted a £6 million allocation in 1996 for the local employment service, stating that it would not provide any additional moneys to extend the services to other areas in the immediate future.  They concluded that much more needs to be done at an accelerated pace to achieve practical and concrete results.  The Government says the job has not been finished, but I say it has not started.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, also said that the local employment service would be established throughout the country as soon as practicable, but it is a long time coming, I note the Minister of State told the INO in Ennis during the week that the numbers had come <Col N="1111" /> down but the number of long-term unemployed on the live register is 3,500 greater after two years under this Government.</P>
    <P>Although some long-term unemployed may have got jobs last year, they were replaced on the long-term register by others, witness the 3,500. We tried again this morning to get the live register figures for the end of October but our researcher was told by the Central Statistics Office that it would be many months before the figures were available by about the first week in December will not be available for many months, possibly after the next election.  I can only describe the manipulation of the figures as sinister.  A person who is long-term unemployed does not care what survey he turns up in; he knows he has not had a job for a long time and that there is not much hope of getting one.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party claims to be the guardian angel of the NESF, but Deputy Kemmy, in a debate on long-term unemployment in the Dáil, said reports were piling up on shelves and gathering dust.  Last night in the Dáil, we were treated to what I can only describe as sanctimonious humbug, but the Labour leadership, in which I do not include the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, have long forgotten Ireland's poor.  The Labour leadership may well see the poor in New York, Boston and elsewhere, but Ireland's poor are very far from their minds. Perhaps the Minister of State and the members of the Labour leadership would sign the European initiative on the long-term unemployed, the European Full Employment Appeal, which has been developed by a number of groups within the European Parliament.  I was informed this morning that not one member of the Labour leadership has signed it, even though some of the Labour backbenchers have brought it to their attention.  It is not good enough that it has not been signed by the leadership of the party to give expression to their supposed commitment.</P>
    <P>Some groups have been sucked into the system even though they are doing their best to keep their criticisms sharp and focused.  It would not surprise me if they felt like giving up when their points are ignored.  Deputy Lynch told the Dáil that we were precipitate in putting down the June 1995 debate and that the recommendations of the NESF would be implemented.  Her main job in life seems to be to cheer all the Ministers in the Dáil who are making mistakes, and when she has done that job she leaves it.</P>
    <P>I consider myself cheerful and optimistic but I am overawed by the cheerfulness of this cheerleader <i>extraordinaire</i> who seems to see it as her job.  I wonder if there is a perk with the job, although it does not fall into the same category as being chairman of a committee.  Nevertheless, Deputy Lynch has made it her mission.  She praised the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, as being wonderful for the women of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Col N="1112" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and she praised the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  Deputy Noonan attacked the women of Ireland during the hepatitis C debate. Deputy Lynch also praised the Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, and what he did for the Army widows.  It was the most extraordinary debate I ever heard.  I will be a long time in Government or in Opposition before I let myself down to that extent.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot stay until the Minister of State replies to the debate as I must attend a public function.  However, perhaps she will tell the House when it is planned to extend the local unemployment service.  The report recommends its extension countrywide.  The Minister of State said it is better to hasten slowly and do it in proper order, <i>festina lente,</i> but if a person is long-term unemployed, will he or she care for proper order?  They want a job and every help in getting a job.</P>
      <P>There is a poignant aspect to statements by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and other Minister about our massive growth and economic boom.  I hold my constituency clinics on Saturdays and over a period of about six hours I deal with about 80 people on the telephone and in person.  Many of them tell me they do not understand the economic boom and do not know what the Government means in its statements. The Government's message does not reach the homes in Battery Heights, Sarsfield Square, St. Mel's Terrace and similar places whose inhabitants cannot get jobs because of the tardy pace at which the Government is supposedly tackling long-term unemployment.  It is a disgrace, as is the distancing of the leadership of the Labour Party, Democratic Left and Fine Gael from the problem.  They wrap themselves in surreal phrases such as &ldquo;we trust one another&rdquo;. The electorate trusts none of them.  The electorate is waiting, not in the long grass but in the short grass, to give the proper verdict on what has not been done.</P>
      <P>Although the INOU is estimable, it does not have a countrywide structure so there is no direct representative of the long-term unemployed.  We hold debates such as this and everybody says their piece.  We keen and moan when the monthly figures are released but what can we do?  We can spend money on extending the local employment services immediately.  We can get the money in the budget and extend the scheme, and not just to six more areas, and bring proposals to the Cabinet.  Its members have read the NESF report &mdash; or perhaps not, it would appear &mdash; but they are not implementing its recommendations.  One in 16 new jobs goes to a long-term unemployed person.  This document was welcomed when it was produced last April.  After the welcome, however, there was a halt to any further work on it.  It has been ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> The retention of medical cards was put forward as the central plank of policy.  The long-term unemployed could return to work and keep their medical cards for some time.  That was the carrot, but it is a shrivelled carrot.  I have put down parliamentary questions on this matter to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment but he has denied responsibility.  I have put the same questions to the Minister for Health who replied that the health boards are meeting to work out a formula.  This is November and the scheme was announced in January.  The carrot for the long-term unemployed was that they could retain their medical cards for a certain period if they returned to work.  It is not working.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, does a great deal of constituency work so she must meet such people as regularly as I do and be aware of the problem. The people who come to my clinics say they are not getting their medical cards and I do not know why.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with a Government whose members pass the buck.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, passes it constantly and, as a result, some poor civil servant will be truncated when it is the Minister's fault.  We are waiting to hear the result of an inquiry which is due to report within the next two weeks but the Minister is culpable, not the head that will be chosen following the inquiry.  Or will we have an &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; situation in which it is nobody's fault but the &ldquo;system&rdquo;?  How interesting.  The system is inanimate but it appears it can be faulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment says medical cards are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health says the health boards are endeavouring to meet to work out a formula.  However, this is November and the scheme was a central feature of the strategy to help the long-term unemployed when it was introduced in January.  Do Ministers and Departments talk and communicate?  Do civil servants talk?  Why can it not be done?  The medical card provision is not being implemented. It is a classic example of what goes on in this Government with every Minister second guessing the other.</P>
    <P>I will recount the relevant points.  The NESF forum is excellent and is excellently led but the marginalised are being muted.  Perhaps that was the intention.  The reports are sturdy and vigorous but they have not been implemented.  I am glad the House is having this debate.  It might instigate some action, although I doubt it.  Since we have the largest number of long-term unemployed people in the OECD, any attempt on the part of the Government to be pleased with itself is faulty. The number of unemployed has increased by 3,500.  The Jobstart and Workplace programmes which were to have 5,000 participants in 1996 have only 500 participants despite massive advertising by FÁS.  The report recommended that local employment services be extended countrywide.  That has not happened.  The <Col N="1114" /> medical card &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; has not happened and I do not know why.  I also do not know why the anticipated numbers have not participated in the Jobstart and Workplace programmes.</P>
    <P>The net result is that Ireland is becoming an insider versus outsider society.  Insiders are buoyed up by the high economic growth and by the figures spewed out at posh conferences in Kenmare and other places.  I mean no disrespect to those who spoke at the conferences.  People who attend such conferences go home in posh cars, comforted by figures which claim Ireland is doing brilliantly.  Ireland is not doing brilliantly for the long-term unemployed.  We are a show. We allow the scandal of those numbers to grow while saying, with a brazen face, that the country is doing well in economic terms.  It is not doing well in economic terms if it ignores the growth of such social injustice.  That injustice is the number of long-term unemployed who have no hope or objective in life.  How can they have an aim?  They look to the Government and public representatives to help them and we, and particularly this Government which set out with such high sounding notions, have failed them miserably and utterly.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the House, I will give the remainder of my time to my colleague, Deputy Walsh, who has a real interest in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the authors of the NESF report.  They did a great service in outlining clearly the extent of the unemployment problem and the plight of the long-term unemployed.  What I find extremely difficult to understand is that the Government and Ministers directly responsible seek to ignore the problem rather than to acknowledge and address it.  On questions and during the debate on social welfare I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare on several occasions but, as in many other cases, he seeks to air brush it out of existence and say it does not really exist. The other survey is far more beneficial from the Government's point of view.  If we have a difficulty with the live register, we produce a survey carried out once a year or once every six months, such as the labour force survey, which shows the Government in a much better light. That is absolute nonsense and escapism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from questions answered here that more people are now being paid long-term unemployment benefit than a year ago or two years ago.  To cater for these people we must look at the whole economic model because obviously it has not worked.  The figure for people unemployed long-term is 136,500.  That is more than when the Minister came into Government and no amount of escapism will get away from that.  Some research should be done on those figures.  When I asked the Minister for Social Welfare the extent of research on those figures he said he had no idea, that it was not his job <Col N="1115" /> to know.  The Government should think about its constitutional responsibilities to the people.</P>
    <P>The Government got into office by chance in a situation engineered by the leader of the Labour Party.  There is more about being in Government than having the trappings of power.  The responsibilities of office mean one has to avail of the opportunities, the good economic growth performance, the remodelling of the national finances and the restructuring of the whole economy post 1987.  One cannot rely on press conferences and spin doctors who say we have the greatest growth rate in Europe, the lowest inflation and interest rates are at an all time low. That is no good to the greater number of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>If the Government could say it converted growth and good economic performance into real jobs and opportunities there would be a degree of hope for the long-term unemployed.  That is the responsibility of the Government.  Research on the long-term unemployed should be carried out to assess their level of education, backgrounds, skills and their ability to be in a position to avail of opportunities.  How can we superimpose an education model based on the academic model to a great extent on people in deprived and depressed areas?  Those people in deprived and depressed areas have tremendous skills, many of which are unknown in the rest of the country.  We are not allowing them to use skills by providing an education system which would allow them put those skills into operation. Instead of making facilities available through the education system we abandon and neglect them. Then we wonder why they end up crowding our prisons, why they are on drugs, why they end up in neglected and abandoned housing estates and in housing schemes which are no-go areas.</P>
    <P>On the Control of Horses Bill we debated wandering horses.  The unfortunate people who ride them were berated and insulted.  However, riding is a skill and we have some of the best jockeys in Europe.  We have a racing apprentice school in Kildare.  Why not provide more opportunities for those unfortunate people?  If there was a will to do it, it would be done; we have many FÁS schemes.  Some of these young people would be good at many other skills because they have good hands and could work with timber and so on.  There is not the will to look at alternative opportunities for those people but if we did so we would begin to seriously tackle the problem of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Apart from the niche opportunities, indigenous industry is sorely neglected.  We are fooling ourselves to a great extent if we think the growth levels are a reflection of how good the economy is doing.  Our growth level tells only half the story. Much of industry here is dependent on the economic model which is based to a great extent on attracting foreign industry.  We have been extremely good at doing that.  Much of our exports have only a minimal indigenous content. <Col N="1116" /> Many of the foreign companies here boost our exports because they avail of the 10 per cent tax rate.  The spin-off and the benefit to the economy and to jobs is minimal.</P>
    <P>We have the resources to build up a truly great indigenous industry in, for example, potatoes but it is totally neglected.  If anything is synonymous with Ireland it is the humble potato.  Ireland is 60 per cent self-sufficient in potatoes.  This means almost half of the potatoes consumed here are imported.  That is a shame.  There should be Government and Departmental encouragement, and resources should be put into that area.  We would have another famine in many parts of the country if people had to depend on what they produce in potatoes and other vegetables.  We have to depend on the economies of Cyprus and the Netherlands to feed the Irish people.  We do not do ourselves justice in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the food area, we have the BSE problem.  In 1987 when the restructuring of the economy began in earnest, an office of food was established and a Ministry of Food was put in place but it was abandoned by the Rainbow Coalition.  The policy is to depend on live exports, sent on the hoof to North Africa, Russia or to anyone who will take them from us.  When there is instability in any of those areas one is left high and dry.  The urgency of this problem has not dawned on the Government.  There is one area in which there has been a tremendous growth in jobs: that of special advisers, programme managers, spin doctors and so on.  These are all employed in the interests of ensuring Government decisions are implemented efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>What happened in the past two months and in the past two years when Ministers went to Government and to Cabinet with a proposal?  In the case of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, the proposal was put, decided on favourably, and went back to the Department where it was thrown somewhere.  Where are the programme managers, special advisers and spin doctors who are supposed to free up the wheels of Government and ensure that everything is done efficiently and effectively?  If the labour force survey and the live register do not suit, the rules are changed.  In the last few weeks, the Government decided that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, was not to be obeyed.  It says it is not effective and it does not have to abide by it.  I commend this report to the House and ask the Government to take its recommendations seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>These debates are useful but to a large extent statements and reports of this kind become legislative polyfillas.  We usually have a debate on some Government report or other on a Thursday afternoon where everyone makes meaningful and aspirational statements, after which nothing happens.  This will be the case with this issue, which has been debated before.  If debates, task forces, reports, committees, <Col N="1117" /> consultants, programme managers and advisers could solve our unemployment problem, we would have none.  The country is overwhelmed with advice, reports and recommendations in relation to job creation and unemployment.</P>
      <P>Before we debate unemployment and long-term unemployment in particular, which is the focus of this report, we need to make a few things clear.  No party has a monopoly on concern for the poor, unemployed or the marginalised.  Every political party worthy of the name is concerned about all these issues.  The difference is not in the extent of the concern but in how we believe the problems can be tackled.  We belong to different political parties because we have a different approach, outlook and philosophy on how this country and its economy should be ordered so that more people can have an opportunity to participate in society.  The reason the Minister of State and I are in two very different parties is precisely that we have a different approach. Politics is about ideas and options and general elections give the public an opportunity to choose between conflicting sets of ideas.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State believes in State intervention and regulation.  She believes in State control to a large extent and that it knows best how to spend people's money.  Ireland is one of the few countries which adopts this approach. Labour parties in New Zealand and Europe have adopted a different approach.  The State should have a minimalist role in our economic affairs and our life generally.  As regards private morality where individuals should be allowed to make choices about their lives, equally in relation to economic matters, workers should be allowed keep more of what they earn and choose how to spend it.  If others can perform a task or provide a utility, they should be allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>The primary duty of any State is to protect its citizens, to ensure it has a fair and even-handed system of justice and that the laws are enforced across the board, without fear or favour.  Our citizens, elderly and young, should not be vulnerable to criminals and in so far as any State can, it should protect them from crime and deal severely with those who commit crimes.</P>
      <P>The State has a duty to provide a comprehensive system of education, from preschool to third level, for all its citizens.  It must also provide a decent health and welfare system, to ensure money does not become the reason one gets particular medical procedures.  Every citizen in the State should have access to a decent, caring and compassionate health service.  Those citizens who cannot, for whatever reason, provide for themselves should be provided for by the State, not as a matter of charity but as a matter of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has followed the European pattern of high unemployment.  We have failed miserably to provide opportunities for our citizens.  There are 20 million unemployed in Europe, which is the unemployment blackspot of the world.  The unemployment level is the equivalent of the population of three member states &mdash; four <Col N="1118" /> including Luxembourg.  We do not yet know now many are unemployed in Ireland and the Minister may shed some light on this.  According to the live register, there are 270,000 unemployed but the Minister said that is not a reliable figure.  If it is not reliable, why are we paying unemployment benefit to 270,000 people?  The labour force survey, which the Minister and the Government says is the more accurate figure, is 190,000.  If that is the accurate figure, why are the taxpayers paying an extra 80,000 people unemployment benefit if they are not unemployed?  The gap between those figures is so enormous that the policy imperatives are equally very different.  If we do not know the exact figure we cannot really begin to address the problem in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>There has been recent evidence to suggest massive fraud in the social welfare system.  During the past two months, 20,000 people stopped signing on.  I do not think even the Minister is suggesting that 20,000 jobs were created in the last two months.  They stopped signing on because they were afraid they would be caught.  If we are to have a welfare system which looks after those in need on a fair and equal basis, we have to ensure that the taxpayers' resources which fund that system are concentrated on those who need it.  If people are defrauding the system, they are defrauding their fellow citizens, the elderly, disabled and those who have to rely on welfare to provide for themselves and their families.  These people should be rooted out.</P>
    <P>Whether one is unemployed, a taxpayer or an employer, we all respond to the system which has been put in place.  That is human nature.  Our tax system encourages people to opt for it both ways &mdash; to be part of the black economy and part of the welfare system.  They know before they go to work on Monday morning that they have more than £100 in their pocket.  They know the chances of getting caught are probably slim and the penal levels of tax so high if they become legitimate that they are prepared to take the risk.  A recent CSO analysis of the live register showed that 48 per cent of the register have been unemployed for more than a year and that 25 per cent have been unemployed for more than three years.  The 48 per cent figure represents about 130,000 people and the 25 per cent represents 70,000 people.</P>
    <P>We are told that the growth rate in the economy over the past two years has been in the region of 20 per cent.  Despite that growth rate, the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo;, as we like to call ourselves, has not produced employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed whose number is as high now as it was two years ago.  We need to focus on the effects of long-term unemployment, not just on the families in question but on the whole fabric of our society.</P>
    <P>Earlier, when I expressed reservations about the regulations we were putting into effect to limit the pocket money of young people, the Minister chastised me and spoke about slave <Col N="1119" /> labour.  We do not live in Dickensian times, we live in a country which has almost reached the 21st century.  We do not have slave labour, but many people are enslaved in a system of long-term unemployment because of the way we order our affairs.  Whole communities, our entire country, is being destroyed because of unemployment.  Too many of our people, young people in particular, are growing up in households where they have never known what it is like to see somebody go out to work; the dignity of their parents, their self-esteem, their worth as human beings is destroyed.  In our society, social conversation often begins with: &ldquo;where do you work&rdquo; or &ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo;  Too many of our people sometimes have to lie being too ashamed to admit the truth.  If ours is to be a caring, civilised society it cannot continue to assign so many of its citizens to the prospect of long-term unemployment and its consequences, including marginalisation, isolation.  Many young people who leave school and have no opportunity to work may become drug addicts and criminals. There is no doubt that many will end up in trouble with the law because idle hands always find things to do.</P>
    <P>Our society has a lot at stake when it seeks to address the question of unemployment.  As politicians we must address how we can begin to make an impact, in terms of legislation and budgets, to ensure that fewer people in the future are assigned to a life of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the regulations the Minister of State said she does not believe in Mickey Mouse jobs or Mickey Mouse wages.  I know she did not have a script but I do not quite know what that means.  Unlike the Minister of State I believe one is better with a lousy job than no job, that one is better on low pay than none; that is not just a soundbite, I believe that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I asked the Minister of State who would police the regulations I did not receive a satisfactory answer.  I predict they will not be policed because the law is not policed at present. One can go into any bar in this city and find young people serving into the very late hours. <Col N="1120" /> The Minister knows that to be the case.  All of this might be ideal in an ideal world but we do not live in an ideal world, we live in a very competitive world of globalised markets.  Irish companies have to compete in those markets in terms of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister of State.  Irish companies must be able to compete in those markets in terms of quality and price if we are to sell our products.  As we move into the 21st century, if we really want to encourage employment, the patriots will be those who create enterprises and take risks because it is through their risk-taking they provide opportunities for themselves and others.  Rather than hounding those people through more and more regulation, bureaucracy and higher taxes we should seek to encourage them because the society we want to create needs more people like them.</P>
      <P>We Irish have understood the link between tax incentives and activity.  When it comes to manufacturing industry, we have a 10 per cent tax on the profits of manufacturing companies.  As a result we have done extremely well in attracting very labour-intensive industries of a manufacturing kind.  Although ours is one of Europe's smallest countries, when it comes to some key sectors of our economy, we have attracted 23 per cent of all mobile investment from the United States in some key manufacturing areas consequent on that 10 per cent tax rate.</P>
      <P>Last year Irish subsidiaries of foreign companies made pre-tax profits of £4.5 billion. That means they paid approximately £450 million in tax to the Revenue Commissioners whereas, had they been paying tax at the European norm, of approximately 30 per cent, they would have paid three times more tax, or £1.5 billion rather than £450 million.  That 10 per cent tax is worth £1 billion Irish pounds to those Irish subsidiaries of foreign companies.  That is the main reason they remain and will continue to remain here if we are able to bring our standard rate of CPT down so that we do not have two different rates which will not be allowed within the European Union in a number of years to come.</P>
      <P>Equally the financial services sector, where some 2,000 people now work, has been extremely successful.  Profits in that sector are taxed at 10 per cent also which is the reason we have so much activity in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have used tax breaks to encourage the development of the film industry and that industry has responded very well.  We have used tax breaks to designate certain urban areas for urban renewal, to designate seaside resorts for development but, when it comes to work, we have never understood the link between tax and <Col N="1121" /> activity, between tax and effort and tax and reward.</P>
    <P>I want to pose some questions to the Minister. If we are talking about providing opportunities for the long-term unemployed, I must point out that initially they will obtain jobs for modest wages.  Let us consider the case of a single person on a weekly wage of £150 out of which he or she will pay £26.50 in tax and PRSI in addition to which their employer must pay employers' PRSI. Out of that salary the Government will take £39. The combined tax take, including what the Government takes in terms of employers' PRSI, amounts to 26 per cent.  If such a person is at present on the dole, taking into account the fact that they may be in receipt of a rent allowance if living away from home and will incur travelling costs going to work, consequent on working perhaps up to 40 hours per week, they will be £14 weekly or 35 pence an hour better off: that is the reality.</P>
    <P>If we move up the scale to a person I would not regard as a high income earner by any standard but who earns the average industrial wage, say a single person in receipt of £300 weekly, that person in the Republic of Ireland is £16 weekly worse off than his or her counterpart in Northern Ireland.  To allow their employer give them an extra £1 in take-home pay is 50 per cent more expensive in the Republic than in Northern Ireland.  If at a time when our economy is growing at an annual rate of seven, eight or nine per cent we cannot apply the proceeds of that growth to reduce the burden of tax on work, we shall miss an opportunity to put a real dent in unemployment once and for all.</P>
    <P>Of late we have heard much about the number of jobs created within our economy, two out of every three of which are part-time.  Job creation is measured by, for example, in the case of a supermarket owner replacing one full-time worker with three part-time, describing that more as two new jobs.  We need to re-examine how we calculate and interpret what exactly constitutes new jobs in terms of their full-time job equivalent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may be surprised to hear that I agree with one comment she made &mdash; that a rising tide does not lift all boats.  There is no doubt about that.  We have had a rising tide for a number of years past, a very successful economy in terms of fundamentals and growth rates.  As far as some people are concerned it is all boom but, when one translates that into activity on the ground, for those who are unemployed, particularly in the case of the long-term unemployed, they have not seen the benefit.</P>
    <P>Despite the high level of unemployment in this economy, estimated by the live register to be 270,000 or by the Labour Force Survey to be 190,000 &mdash; it does not matter which figure one uses for this purpose &mdash; in the catering industry they cannot find people to take up jobs.  We now have the lubricious circumstance in which I <Col N="1122" /> understand Spanish workers are being brought here to work in our tourism and catering industry. What does that say about our commitment to solving unemployment?  Our current system of managing employment services and unemployment compensation, divided between two Government Departments, needs to be examined.  The Department to which the Minister of State is attached, is at present responsible through FÁS for employment services but has no control whatever over what I would regard as payments to unemployed people.</P>
    <P>I commend the local employment service but it is not available to all unemployed people.  We need to integrate employment services with the unemployment compensation payments scheme. If unemployed people, particularly those who have been unemployed for three years or more, are not given the assistance and skills they need to help them return to the jobs market then opportunities will pass them by.  The functions carried out by the Department of Social Welfare in terms of the payout of benefits to unemployed people should be integrated with the functions carried out by the Department of Social Welfare Employment through FÁS.  Many workers in the two Departments work side by side with each other but the systems are not integrated.  As a result there is a lack of efficiency and, more importantly, unemployed people do not get the advice they require.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the famous Jobstart programme, which has become something of a joke.  The Minister for Finance trumpeted the programme as a major initiative to help long-term unemployed people return to the workforce.  We were told that £1 million was being provided and that 5,000 people would qualify for inclusion in the programme.  One does not have to be a mathematical genius to work out that a sum in the region of £20 million per year would be required if 5,000 people qualified for inclusion in the programme at a rate of £80 per week.</P>
    <P>The programme has not been a success and the Department recently undertook a massive advertising campaign, which included availing of prime time spots on RTÉ radio and, presumably, on local radio stations, to promote it.  One does not have to tell employers about the benefits available to them and the reason so much effort has been put into advertising the programme is that it was doomed to fail before it ever started. This is why no more than 400 people have been employed under the programme.</P>
    <P>If task forces, committees, consultants, programme managers, advisers and Government schemes could solve unemployment then we would not have a problem.  However, the reality is that there are more people on Government job schemes than working in the food industry and there are more people working in job creation agencies than working in some of the traditional industries such as brewing or distilling.  We have adopted a bureaucratic response to the problem of unemployment.  The Culliton report <Col N="1123" /> recommended the adoption of a different approach and referred to the need to lower the burden of tax on work and to streamline the number of agencies delivering advice and assistance in the job creation area.  Instead of this, we got the opposite.  We missed a great opportunity when we adopted a bureaucratic approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>For every ten people at work there are approximately 22 dependants.  Of the ten who work, two work for the State and eight work in the private sector.  For every person working in the private wealth creating sector there are three dependants.  The smaller the wealth creating private sector becomes the more dependants there will be.  We must ensure we do not put obstacles in place which would prevent that sector expanding.  It is only by expanding that sector that we will have more money for health, welfare, education and the host of measures we would like to see implemented if the resources were there.</P>
    <P>We must begin at the beginning and tackle unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, by ensuring that the incentives which operate in the economy encourage employers to expand their businesses in a way which requires them to take on more workers. The more regulations, bureaucracy and tax burdens we put in their way the less we will encourage them to employ more people.  Eleven per cent of those employed in the manufacturing industry are casual workers.  The reason this figure has doubled over the past five years is that in a world of globalised markets people will not make long-term commitments if obstacles are put in their way.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks three major companies &mdash; Chung Wa, Lucky Goldstar and Hyundai &mdash; decided to locate in Scotland, Wales and the United Kingdom.  Each of these labour intensive companies will employ 2,000 people.  They did not locate in Ireland because of the tax system and the regulations with which employers must comply.  It is interesting to note that even though the cost of employment in Wales is much lower than in Ireland the take home pay and <i>per capita</i> income of Welsh workers is higher than that of the average Irish worker.  We must learn lessons from this and ensure as we move into the next century that workers take home more of what they earn, that workers earning £300 per week do not pay the top rate of tax and that workers in Dundalk earning £300 per week are not £16 per week worse off than their counterparts across the Border in Newry.  If we are to grasp in the future the opportunities we grasped in the past then we will have to adopt a different approach and a different style of politics.  We need to focus on encouraging people to do things for themselves and putting in place a system of government and economic policies which bring out the best in people whether they are unemployed, workers or <Col N="1124" /> business people.  We need to adopt a different approach from the one which proposes more schemes, task forces, tax, bureaucracy and regulations.  This approach has failed and we must try the alternative.</P>

      <P>It is mind boggling to be lectured by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on job creation and unemployment.  When Fianna Fáil was returned to power in 1977 Deputy Harney was a member of that party.  The then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, said he would resign if unemployment went over the 100,000 mark.  Even though unemployment went over the 100,000 mark in 1980 Jack Lynch did not resign and Fianna Fáil did nothing about it.  Between 1977 and 1979 Fianna Fáil stuffed the Civil Service and the public service with workers.  During the late 1980s Ray MacSharry had to cut back on the number of people employed in these areas.  It is ludicrous for people who behaved in that fashion to shed crocodile tears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are only interested in swingeing tax cuts on the one <Col N="1125" /> hand and cuts in services on the other.  They are an irresponsible party which has no interest in a caring society where there is equality.  They are playing to a niche market of the wealthy and that is all they want.  That does not coincide with what has been a traditional caring attitude by Fianna Fáil in past decades.  I would urge Fianna Fáil to be wary.</P>
      <P>Two issues in terms of the quality of society relate to crime and unemployment.  This is the first Government that has begun to tackle those two issues seriously.  The huge portfolio of proposals we have put through on crime, particularly crime relating to drugs which is responsible for approximately 80 per cent of crime, is the first serious attempt by a Government to deal with the issue.  Fianna Fáil was in power for seven years from 1987 to 1994 and did little or nothing to reduce unemployment levels.  The Government current strategies are dealing positively with the problem and creating new jobs at an unprecedented rate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney mentioned the creation of jobs at all costs but I cannot accept that philosophy because it leaves workers open to exploitation.  We must protect workers.  Deputy Harney quoted the service industry which is the fastest growing industry in the country, particularly the catering sector.  Yet in that sector the average hourly wage is between £2 or £3, which in this day and age is exploitation.  No wonder it is difficult to find people prepared to work long hours in difficult circumstances for minimal remuneration and it is why foreign students are being recruited to work in the sector.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, for her constant involvement in the work of the National Economic and Social Forum.  A great amount of work has been achieved by the forum whose meetings the Minister of State has attended regularly over the past three years since it was established in 1993. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the contents of report No. 3 on long-term unemployment initiatives.</P>
      <P>The forum is an initiative, as so many developments under this Government have been, to get a better focus on unemployment.  Priority in its terms of reference is on unemployment and job creation.  The body is comprised of Oireachtas Members, the social partners and, most important of all, people in the community who would not normally be allowed into the decision making process.  These include women, the unemployed, the disadvantaged, youth, the elderly, people with disability, those with environmental interests and academics.  One of the main academics involved, Mr. Seán Healy, has made a tremendous contribution through his hands-on approach to dealing with long-term unemployment.  This means that all strands in society have an input into making policy on long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report welcomes the recommendations made by the Government, the measures put in <Col N="1126" /> place since the 1994 report, and the subsequent Government task force set up to prioritise its recommendations.  Nevertheless, long-term unemployment remains stubborn.  In 1995, for every 16 jobs created only one affected long-term unemployment.  This area clearly requires constant monitoring, effort and radical thinking.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced a plethora of measures in the last budget.  Some 13,200 new places were provided in various schemes.  The vocational training opportunities scheme was extended in addition to which we had the back to work scheme and the recruitment subsidy scheme.  Work experience programmes focused on community employment to orient it towards job creation.  The extension of PRSI cover to community employment participants is a major initiative and the idea of having whole time job options in selected unemployment black spots was a major development.  All these developments are welcomed in the report which also recommends regular monitoring of Government initiatives and further periodic reports on the manner in which these initiatives are implemented.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the major areas focused on in terms of the report in dealing with the problem, I will first address the local employment service. That is the key policy approach.  It does not matter whether one deals with the labour force survey or the live register.  What is important is to have a portfolio of people who volunteer to accept the employment service.  These portfolios will then be part of the responsibility of a mediator who enters into a client relationship with the volunteers.  The ratio is 125 volunteers to each mediator which is probably a little high but is recommended by the NESF.  It is calculated on the basis of 125 by 800 to be appointed which would deal with 100,000 long-term unemployed, the number estimated to volunteer for the service.</P>
    <P>Having established a relationship with the unemployed person, the mediator must also establish a relationship with the business sector employer to put together a portfolio so that potential employees can be introduced on a one to one basis.  Having determined what services might be required, the local employment service can determine what education or training is necessary and having availed of local services whether in the vocational education committee, FÁS, the partnership or through a Government scheme subsidy they can then seek to get someone into employment.  It is an extremely important concept.  It is a key one for dealing with the long-term unemployed.  The economy is burgeoning, with approximately 1,000 additional jobs being created each week, but the long-term unemployed are not benefiting proportionately. Employers are not known for their social conscience.  They are interested only in operating profitable and effective businesses and are not interested in employing the long-term unemployed when there are many young people, <Col N="1127" /> fresh out of college and training, on the job market.  The local employment service can make a radical difference to the cohort of unemployed, but to be successful mediators must be familiar with the people and businesses, whether local corner shops or large factories, in their designated areas.  They must also have access to FÁS data and, if necessary, provide training and education for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The local employment service has been slow to get off the ground.  It needs funding urgently.  A total of £6 million has already been provided, but it is not enough.  The NESF report recommends that £30 million should be provided to extend the service nationwide.  It currently operates in only 14 selected areas.  The service should be extended as quickly as possible and while a different approach will be required for rural areas, the principle will remain the same.  The service should be promoted by distributing leaflets and advertising and those enthusiastically seeking work should be encouraged to participate in the scheme.  Mediators should be vibrant and dynamic and deal with their portfolios in a personal and professional fashion.  The service should be monitored at all times.  It is the only means of dealing effectively with long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Access to the community employment scheme is limited because of the way it is targeted.  It should not discriminate against certain people. Lone parents are allowed to participate, but dependent spouses are not.  They have the option of swapping places with their unemployed spouse, but in the majority of cases it is women who lose out in terms of access to the community employment scheme.  We must address this anomaly.  Everybody who is unemployed should be allowed participate in the scheme.  We should not discriminate against dependent spouses.</P>
    <P>Child care facilities are also important.  It is difficult for women to enter the marketplace unless adequate nurseries and pre-school facilities are available.  Parental involvement in the marketplace is important, but parents, particularly women, will be discriminated against unless the necessary child care facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>The report deals with measures aimed at preventing young people drifting into long-term unemployment.  A total of 5,000 places will be provided in the workplace for young people who have been unemployed for up to six months and at risk of drifting into long-term unemployment, and they will be allowed retain their social welfare benefits.  While this is a welcome development, the five week job placement period is too limited.  A more structured approach should be adopted.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that the youth progression programme should involve counselling, foundation skills, job-work trails, a youth employment option and a job training scheme.  This area requires constant monitoring <Col N="1128" /> and great effort to ensure that school leavers at risk of drifting into long-term unemployment get sufficient training until job opportunities become available.  There is no reason it should not be compulsory for them to register with FÁS.</P>
    <P>The report does not deal specifically with unemployment blackspots.  Areas such as Ballymun, Finglas, Ballyfermot and the north and south inner city regions should be designated enterprise zones.  Employers in those areas should be given tax breaks, provided they employ a substantial number of local people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and the good things it said about the Government's initiatives.</P>

      <P>I have had hands-on experience of this situation.  Many of the measures implemented at present will not deal with the problem.  A huge number of reports have been published, but we know what the problem is.  We also know that creating a scheme for 2,000 jobs here and 3,000 jobs there will not deal with the underlying problem.</P>
      <P>I am surprised there has not been a debate in this Chamber on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, which is a major cause of concern for the unemployed.  Schemes such as Jobstart will not work because financial remuneration for creating employment in the short-term will not create long-term jobs.  I do not know of any employer who would choose employees on the basis of a subsidy.  Any employer, who looks to the long-term, will always choose the best employee available.  Some £60 or £80 a week subsidy for a limited period will not change that choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment blackspots have more to do with the social conditions in those areas than <Col N="1129" /> anything else.  However, these will not be addressed by piecemeal short-term schemes.  If we are serious about unemployment, we must look at our housing policy.</P>

      <P>We must never again build huge ghettos on the outskirts of our cities.  We must tackle the problem of address discrimination.  We all know there is a subtle form of discrimination against people from certain addresses which means they cannot get employment.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the tax and social welfare wedge which, with the underlying social problems, is causing unemployment.  I would like to make some practical suggestions which the Government might consider because we have heard too much theory today.  We will not create enough new jobs in the next three years to give full paid employment to everyone.  However, we could afford to increase unemployment assistance by 40 per cent or 50 per cent by making adjustments to the tax and social welfare systems. If we increased incomes and gave 40,000 of the 180,000 unemployed people an opportunity to work, surely that would be a major achievement in three years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give practical examples of what I mean.  People often come to me with opportunities for part-time employment. However, when they look at the possibility of taking this employment, they realise they will not be better off financially.  This problem is caused by the system of rent allowances, the social welfare code and the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A married couple with one child came to me recently with this problem.  They were in receipt of rent allowance and unemployment assistance which amounted to £146.20.  One of the spouses had an opportunity to get part-time employment. We did the calculations and I advised them on what they should or should not do to increase the household income.  I told them there would be no gain on the first £30 because the rent allowance would be reduced for every pound earned.  There would be a gain between £31 and £59 which would increase the family household income by £22.  However, I told them to be careful because if they earned another £1, the family income, which started at £146.20, would drop to £123.10 &mdash; a net <Col N="1130" /> loss of £23.10 &mdash; because of the way dependent spouses are treated by our system.</P>
    <P>If a person's take home weekly income were to increase to £150, according to the manner in which this is calculated, that person's take home weekly family income would be £168.  It includes an element of unemployment assistance for one spouse which, in this case, is better than family income supplement.  Taking a base level income of £146, the net family income increase is £22 and zero as between £59 and £150.  If a person could increase his or her weekly gross income to £230, yielding a take home pay of £200, that person's weekly family income would increase by approximately £54.  That means that in regard to a large range of income, it is better for people not to take up work because the more they earn the less of that income they take home.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is not revolutionary news to the Deputies present.  Most of them are well aware of this problem and could recount a myriad of examples of this type of problem.  Some people are dependent on social welfare, but if part-time work that might lead to better things is available, unless a person can secure a job paying £300 plus a week, that person has little to gain from taking up work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>After that period they are back into the system.  We need to change the mainframe system, not to introduce small schemes that are complex and to which limited quotas apply.  People want to live in the real world.  If a job is available down the road, they want to apply for it and, if successful, they want to benefit from taking it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course people want to work.  People have been told by those on high incomes that they cannot be expected to give up 50p tax in the pound, but they will happily say that it is not unreasonable for a person on a low income to pay 120p tax on every pound over a certain level.  That is the problem.  How do we address it?  All the fancy schemes will not address that fundamental problem.  Unemployed persons should be free to take up a job and for every £1 they earn they should be able to keep a proportion of it and the lower their family incomes the higher the proportion of that £1 they <Col N="1131" /> should keep.  That is a sensible and simple proposition.</P>
      <P>A first and rational step towards addressing this problem would be to factor the rent allowance into the mainframe social welfare system and we could then decide to institute a new system of means testing for social welfare benefits.</P>

As long as that is the case the allowance can be passed from agency to agency, but the problem will not be addressed.  That has happened for years.  We have passed the parcel, but nobody is willing to tackle the fundamental problem.</P>
      <P>We also need to institute a system directed towards establishing a basic minimum income, as proposed by people like Fr. Sean Healy.  Such a system would operate on the basis that everyone would have a basic minimum income taking into account rent costs and that in respect of every pound earned over that level there would be a deduction in terms of, say, social welfare income or there would be a clawback on such additional income which would ensure that a situation could not arise whereby if a person earned an extra £1 he or she could lose £30 net family income.  I do not know of any families who do not try through exercising a degree of effort to increase their income.</P>

      <P>I worked for a co-operative until I became a Member of this House.  I did not gain from the employment created.  We created those jobs because we believed in what we were doing.  We discovered when we moved away from a system under which people were losing money by taking up employment that it was profitable to create employment, for us as employers who had to be hard headed because we were operating in the commercial world, and for the workers, for whom the purpose of co-operative was to create employment.  However, we found that the main obstacle we faced was the social welfare and tax system that applied to the low paid.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister for Finance is not present.  I appreciate that resources are limited, but we have been told that there will be tax give-aways in next year's budget.  In that regard I make a plea for a special tax give-away. At present once a person, particularly if he or she has three or four children, earns over the exemption limit, he or she faces a major problem, that of paying income tax at the rate of 40 per cent.  The highest earners do not pay that rate of tax until their income reaches a certain level. Furthermore, irrespective of what one earns, the highest tax rate is 48 per cent.</P>
      <P>It would be relatively simple in the next budget to direct resources towards areas to which everyone professes they should be directed, to increase tax exemptions, particularly as they relate to dependent children and to reduce the marginal rate of tax for the low paid from the current 40 per cent to, say, 5 per cent over the lowest rate of tax.  If the lowest rate of tax were reduced to 25 per cent, the marginal tax rate could be increased to 30 per cent and if the lowest tax rate remains at 27 per cent it could be increased to 32 per cent.  In that way the unemployed could be eased into the system rather than the current situation where they have hit a stone wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal more I would like to say if time permitted, but I wish to refer specifically to community employment schemes.  I cannot understand why the unemployed who do not have alternative employment and where there is not a waiting list for such schemes, which occurs in some rural areas particularly on the islands, are not allowed to continuously roll over in terms of their participation on such schemes.  They should be allowed to continue to participate in such schemes working for their communities instead of being forced by the Government back on to the unemployment register for another period of detention before they can participate again on such schemes.  There is work to be done and sufficient places should be provided on such schemes to allow those who want to participate <Col N="1133" /> on them to do so.  By doing that the Department could direct its resources at inquiring into why some of the unemployed do not participate in such schemes.  I would prefer to see a flat rate of £160 for a four day week with those with dependent children retaining entitlement to family income supplement.  The introduction this year of A stamp contributions was a major step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>These jobs should be made more attractive, for urban dwellers in particular who do not find them attractive for various reasons.  One could then ask about those not taking up the scheme when one will probably find they are working and drawing social welfare payments.  They, in turn, may find that it would be better not to do so.  Rather than produce nice reports, express platitudes and introduce Mickey Mouse schemes we would do more for the unemployed if we took a few simple steps to tackle the tax, social welfare and rent allowance wedges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree fundamentally in principle with some of the reforms urged by Deputy Ó Cuív but the line taken by him and the Progressive Democrats is an indication that a harsh labour market policy will be followed, particularly if the Progressive Democrats are returned to Government.  When Deputy O'Malley was in office, 100 jobs per day were being lost.  This contrasts with the job creation record of the Government under which, as the Taoiseach and Tánaiste outlined in recent days, 1,000 jobs per week are being gained.</P>
      <P>The panacea of the Progressive Democrats, echoed to some extent by Deputy Ó Cuív and others in Fianna Fáil, is that only a market-led approach will work.  If one looks at the document on taxation and spending issued by Deputy Michael McDowell, one will see that this approach will only work if all of our great semi-State bodies, and parts of the public service, are sold off.  In the process we would lose tens of thousands of well paid, secure jobs.  That is the prospect we face if the Progressive Democrats get their hands on the levers of power after the next general election.  These jobs would be replaced by low paid, non-unionised, short contract employment.  We may even see Group Four, Securicor or some other security company being given a contract to provide security personnel in the precincts of the House?  The tragedy is that Fianna Fáil seems to be aligned to this axis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will be glad to learn, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the Labour Party carefully tracks the speeches of our colleagues in Fianna Fáil, especially its Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I have framed copies of a number of his speeches. In a speech to the Institute of Directors prior to last Christmas he said that, if returned to power with his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats, he would definitely cap and cut social welfare. Amazingly, unbeknownst to his elder brother, Noel, who in a poignant article wrote about their childhood in the Drumcondra area on the north <Col N="1134" /> side of the city when they cared for and looked after each other, in a speech to IBEC he said clearly that he would sell all of our major semi-State bodies, including CIE, Iarnród Éireann, Telecom Éireann, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and so on.</P>

      <P>The track record of Deputy Bertie Ahern in the constituency of Dublin Central which he has represented for 20 years does not stand up well to scrutiny when it comes to unemployment levels, social deprivation and drug related crime.  One has to pose the question where has he been for that length of time since his election to this House for the first time as a young man in 1977?  The same cannot be said of the father of one of the Deputies sitting opposite who made an impact on the north side of the city.</P>
      <P>One has to question whether Deputy Ahern will lead Fianna Fáil into a disastrous coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  The people would be foolish to give such a combination an overall majority in the forthcoming general election.</P>

      <P>Like many other Deputies, I read the report of the Assistant Secretary at the Department of Finance, Mr. Michael Tutty, on key developments in the economy in the past ten years which paints a rosy and favourable picture. Since 1987 there has been an annual growth rate of almost 5 per cent; an annual employment growth rate of almost 2 per cent; the unemployment rate has fallen from 16.8 per cent to 11.7 per cent; an annual inflation rate of about 2.7 per cent as compared with a figure of almost 5 per cent in the OECD; the general Government deficit has fallen from a rate of 8.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent while the general Government deficit-debt ratio has fallen to 76 per cent.</P>
      <P>The fact remains, however, that we have a serious unemployment problem.  It is right and proper that the House should debate this issue time and again.  I applaud the National Economic and Social Forum on the outstanding work it has done in recent years and on producing this timely report on long-term unemployment initiatives. We should retain a sense of outrage and remain determined to take every conceivable measure to find a remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The problem is acute in certain areas, especially the Dublin region.  If one looks at the unemployment statistics, it is striking that eight of the 12 employment exchanges in the biggest unemployment black spots are located in the Dublin region where approximately 38 per cent of the long-term unemployed are to be found. The other four are also located in urban areas. Large areas of the city from the north side to Tallaght are gripped by this problem.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies said, with social deprivation goes vicious drug-fuelled crime which has laid waste to many of these areas and made life intolerable for the population of the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we retain our sense of outrage.  Rosy pictures of the economy, painted in good faith by very able officials, must not influence the efforts of Deputies to improve the unemployment position, particularly in our capital city.  We should continue that job with ruthless determination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the NESF report which is timely in its attempt to monitor the major initiatives taken by the Government in recent years.  I agree with Deputy Costello that the implementation of the local employment scheme is a key initiative.  I am very proud &mdash; my colleague opposite will share these sentiments &mdash; that it was on the north side of Dublin, specifically under the Northside Partnership chaired by Pádraig White and directed by Ms Marian Vickers, that the local employment service scheme was piloted.  The number of people placed in jobs in the past three years in the constituencies of Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central is significant.  There is positive discrimination in favour of areas of great deprivation to enable people living close to huge concentrations of industry such as Dublin Airport, who are constantly by-passed for jobs, to qualify for jobs.  I congratulate the Northside Partnership on its work in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government is, however, dragging its heels in that only £10 million has been spent in this area, £6 million of which has been spent specifically on the local employment services in the 14 designated partnership areas.  The first major report of the forum recommended that a sum of £36 million be provided, but just over one quarter of that amount has been spent on the programme.  The necessary resources should be made available.  The staff in the Northside Partnership are often very busy dealing with a huge number of clients.  The report referred to the ideal figure as 125 people per mediator, but it is very difficult for mediators to deal with vast numbers of people.</P>
    <P>Many of the criticisms in the report are valid and we should respond to them.  For example, there should be no further delays in operating the local employment service in the 14 areas.  We should ensure there is sufficient staff so that mediators, who do a very good job, are not overworked.  People seeking work should be well <Col N="1136" /> represented on the partnership bodies which administer the local employment service.  Periodic reports on the operation of the service should be made available to the House so that Deputies may comment on them.  We should encourage the local employment service, FÁS and local educational bodies such as vocational education committees to interact closely to make people aware of the local employment service.  The report does not refer to the fact that many people, even in my area where the service has been very successful, are still unaware of it. Deputies constantly have to refer people to the excellent mediation staff.  FÁS should be required to widely publicise the service.</P>
    <P>The report rightly pays tribute to the Government for providing an extra 13,200 places: 1,000 for VTOS, 5,000 for the back to work scheme, 1,200 for the recruitment subsidy scheme, 1,000 for the pilot wholetime jobs option and 5,000 for work experience, all of which are valuable initiatives.  It is easy to deride the enormous efforts made in this regard by focusing totally on the labour market.  The Ministers, Deputies Quinn and De Rossa, will address some of the matters that have been raised.  The initiatives that have been taken are extremely valuable and credit should be given where it is due.</P>
    <P>I share some of the criticisms in the report of the community employment scheme, particularly in regard to the 12 months limit.  As Deputy Ó Cuív said, there is a roll-over of jobs, certainly in the Dublin region, in that some people remain in schemes for more than 12 months.  It would be unacceptable that a local voluntary body that takes on a very good worker who is well known in the locality would lose that person after one, two or three years.  That is a matter that must be addressed.  I understand that in Germany a massive jobs initiative programme has operated since World War II.  Many of our policymakers may not be aware that in the 1950s about two million people there were involved in working directly for the community, for which they were paid a certain wage.  Elements such as status and conditions must be considered in operating the programme.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of the NESF about the voluntary sector in term of its growing dependence on these jobs.  It is important that work which needs to be done in communities is well done under good conditions and that workers are granted proper status.  In the Dublin area there is a great take-up of the new jobs initiative programme.  In my area almost every programme is oversubscribed.  Even though there are problems with social welfare and taxation, people want to work and, if given a reasonable wage, will accept jobs such as school caretaker, offering advice on local voluntary projects or whatever.</P>
    <P>I support the report's recommendations on targeting.  We are targeting the major issues of the long-term unemployed, lone parents and so on.  I <Col N="1137" /> agree with Deputy Costello that, certainly in the Dublin region, we must provide increased resources for the major black spots, areas which experience many social problems.  A sustained effort is needed by the community to deal with those problems.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance will consider taxation measures which would help in that regard.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments about women who wish to return to work.  The fact that women do not qualify for CE schemes unless they are on social welfare is a disgrace and is unconstitutional. That matter must be considered.  The comments on the progression element of the programme are very welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report on employment initiatives and commend the Government for the steps it has taken.  It should take on board the criticisms made by the forum, which is widely representative of all parties as well as the social partners.  I hope our colleagues opposite will not wreck the social partnership, the consequences of which would be disastrous for the long-term unemployed and their families.  Our first objective should be to assist those people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the NESF report on long-term unemployment.  We are currently facing a major problem in regard to unemployed young people, particularly young tradesmen and apprentices in the workplace.  Because they are not encouraged by the education system, not enough young people are coming forward to take up tool making, carpentry, joinery, block laying, plumbing, plastering, stone masonry.  There is not enough emphasis in second level education on encouraging people to take up apprenticeships.  I understand it is almost impossible to get a carpenter for a building job in areas of this city. If we do not train young people there is little hope for the future.</P>
      <P>People in Dublin have told me that quite a number of the tradesmen employed in the Blanchardstown shopping centre have returned from working in England.  Why can we not encourage builders to take on young apprentices?  The time is fast approaching when there will no longer be any young people to do these jobs.  I served my apprenticeship as a carpenter-joiner and at that time there had to be so many apprentices per number of carpenters employed.  If such schemes are not brought back again we will face a major problem in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apprentices are currently recruited by employers.  They spend six months in FÁS and then return to their prospective employer.  They are paid by FÁS and that is a welcome step. <Col N="1138" /> These are excellent young lads interested in developing skills for the future.  They are not involved in drugs and they do not get into trouble.  They are interested in what they are doing.</P>
    <P>There is a real shortage of apprentices in the motor industry.  The Sligo FÁS centre recently lost its motor mechanic course because of a shortage of interested young people.  That is a shame.  Many years ago a former Member of this House and a good friend of Deputy Haughey's father, James Gallagher, encouraged industry to set up in Tubbercurry.  He knew there was a need for this in the area and he brought the first tool making factory to Tubbercurry, as a result of which we have much of that type of industry in County Sligo.  It is important that we pay tribute to people like James Gallagher.</P>
    <P>The reason there are currently so many people on the live register is that they have medical cards.  The difference in income between staying at home or going to work is not enough.  A person who stays at home is entitled to a medical card which is valuable if one has a family.  Children can avail of free school transport and medical care if they become ill.  A person with a reasonably good job, however, is not entitled to a medical card.  If a Minister introduced an incentive to redress that imbalance, many more people would be encouraged to take up employment.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers in this debate have criticised the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and Deputy Bertie Ahern.  When I first became a Member of this House after the 1982 election, the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey's policy document, The Way Forward, was voted down in this House. That Government fell and we had a Coalition Government for a period of four years.  That was the most disastrous Government this country ever had, led by Garret FitzGerald and including Deputy John Bruton as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Many excellent industries in my constituency closed down under that Government.  We had a new Government in 1987 which attempted to put the country back on the road to recovery, and if it were not for Deputy Dukes's support for that minority Fianna Fáil Government it would never have recovered. Labour and Democratic Left voted down every measure but they are now in power and they are reaping the benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear much talk in politics today about our booming economy, increased prosperity, high economic growth rates and our unprecedented business expansion.  Nevertheless people want more than that.  Women and children are afraid to walk our streets.  Our communities are disintegrating, we have drug addiction, poverty, social exclusion and urban ghettos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan will be happy to know that Fianna Fáil believes politics should be about real people, their hopes and fears, and that the political process should address the everyday life of families, parishes and communities.  The <Col N="1139" /> economy may be booming but in many ways our quality of life has deteriorated and a moral decline has set in.  At a time when we have the resources to improve the quality of life for ordinary citizens, we should do so.</P>
    <P>The objective of last year's budget, according to the PR people, was to tackle long-term unemployment, the buzz words at that time.  Yet Deputy O'Rourke told the House this morning that Ireland has the highest rate of long-term unemployment among OECD countries.  The measures introduced in last year's budget were nothing more than hype.  They have not had any real impact on the problem of long-term unemployment.  People should look behind the spin doctoring, examine the schemes introduced and consider whether they had any effect.</P>
    <P>I want to be parochial and refer to the north side of Dublin.  Northsiders generally hold the view that their area loses out in many ways.  For example, why was the Ballymun-Dublin Airport Luas project put on hold?  In some respects those of us representing that area of Dublin are to blame in that we do not lobby in a sufficiently strong manner for a better deal.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a recently established group called Nordubco which was set up under a Dublin City University initiative and the three area development partnerships &mdash; Ballymun, Finglas-Cabra and the Northside Partnership.  Its role is to promote the social and economic development of north Dublin as a region and to provide a forum where a coherent vision and strategy can be developed through dialogue between the various bodies which have a role to play in the area.  That is a welcome initiative.  It would be welcome if all the public representatives in North Dublin could come together, lobby in a co-ordinated way and draw up plans which will impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>I also welcome plans to develop the Liffey docklands.  The Custom House Docks Development Authority has been requested by the Government to establish a separate, broadlybased project team which, under general supervision of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force, will initiate the work of preparing a master plan to rejuvenate the Dublin docklands area which embraces 1,000 acres of land on both sides of the river Liffey.  The Riverrun consortium was appointed in September 1996 to develop this master plan.  It is claimed the redevelopment of this area will breathe new life into local communities, create employment, exploit the extensive waterways for tourism and leisure activities and create a new growth area for the capital city.  Local consultation has been initiated and that is a welcome development.  I hope the appropriate legislation can be debated in this House as soon as possible to implement that initiative which will impact on employment on Dublin's northside as well as in Ringsend and other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> I draw the attention of the House to a little known report published earlier this year after being left on the shelf for some time, the report of the task force established during the TEAM Aer Lingus crisis with which Deputy Broughan and Deputy Sargent are familiar.  This task force was set up to exploit employment opportunities around the airport region and the general northside area.  Its report, which is very good, was eventually published by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment but insufficient action has been taken on its recommendations. Some consultation is under way on the establishment of an aviation school.  It mentioned the Luas line and other needs of the northside of Dublin.  The report should be re-examined and progress should be made on implementing its major recommendations.</P>
    <P>One of the ways of dealing with long-term unemployment is to help people establish their own businesses.  We should examine what help is available to those who have an idea but do not have the resources to put it into effect.  Many groups give advice on how to start a business.  In Dublin, the Dublin Corporation public libraries give a great deal of advice on this area.  People must go to many organisations for advice and to several organisations to obtain financial help. Some rationalisation is needed.  The Dublin City Enterprise Board is one source of funding and people can go to banks for advice, assistance and finance.  They can also go to a business information centre, FÁS, Forbairt, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Liffey Trust, the Dublin Business Innovation Centre, Enterprise Link, First Step, Inner City Enterprise, An Bord Tráchtála, the Small Firms Association and the area partnerships.  There are so many different organisations and Government Departments that rationalisation is needed so that people will know where to go.  A one-stop shop for advice and assistance on how to establish a business is needed.  It has not been developed and it could go a long way to tackling unemployment.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the number of voluntary groups which deal with unemployment, especially long-term unemployment.  In Dublin North-Central, my constituency, there is the Larkin Unemployment Centre, the Northside Centre for the Unemployed, the Northside Partnership, the Donnycarney Unemployment Action Group, the Dublin Inner City Partnership, the Coolock Development Centre, the Inner City Organisation Network, which is well-known, and the Ballybough Resource Centre, to name just a few.  There is a plethora of voluntary organisations and community groups trying desperately to do something about unemployment. They should be supported.  Some of them are funded by trade unions, some by national lottery grants, etc.  Where a community voluntarily comes together to do something for itself, it should be supported in every way possible.  It should be given a greater role in <Col N="1141" /> dealing with the situation at ground level because local knowledge is a valuable asset.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk during this debate about the incentive to take up low paid unemployment.  I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív that it is the kernel of the issue.  There needs to be some cohesion in the taxation system, secondary benefits such as medical cards and supplementary welfare, and the social welfare system &mdash; I do not suggest we should cut social welfare &mdash; to help people get back to work, in low paid employment in some cases.  Deputy Ó Cuív gave some examples and said other Deputies would have similar experiences.  I have experiences similar to those outlined.  The major example is where someone has been offered a part-time job but will unfortunately lose rent allowance if he takes it. The advice I must give, with a heavy heart, is that he should not take the job because he will lose out.  For a TD to have to give that advice is appalling.  This must be dealt with because people will not take up low paid employment otherwise. They cannot be expected to do so if they will lose substantial amounts of money.  We have heard much talk about poorly paid workers and the various incentives, etc.  However, many of the promises made have not been fulfilled, especially with regard to the loss of medical cards, a matter which needs to be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>The Jobstart programme established by FÁS is aimed at long-term unemployment.  The condition that one cannot have worked for the previous five years should be relaxed to allow some flexibility.  Some people may have got one week's work during those five years and will thus be ineligible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the National Economic and Social Forum.  It is an excellent body producing excellent reports.  I note its criticism that the local employment service is not nationwide.  That is another important promise which must be fulfilled as soon as possible.  I hope this debate will go some way towards enlightening our policymakers in the area of long-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the NESF report on long-term unemployment.  The following paragraph in a Green Party economic policy document which deals with something not often referred to in this context states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pursuit of economic growth has been treated in recent years as some type of Holy Grail.  No debate has accompanied whether the large scale economic growth that has been achieved has been beneficial, or if it has, how has it been?  In some respects it can be argued that some growth has contributed other economic problems such as unemployment. The Greens believe in sustainable economic <Col N="1142" /> activity.  Where economic growth is achieved and does not result in social or environmental degradation, it can be welcomed; where it is pursued for its own sake, we may all be the poorer as a result.</P>
    <P>This is relevant to the report under discussion because all too often economic growth and unemployment are treated as separate entities.  It should be borne in mind that they are closely linked and one has a direct impact on the other.</P>
    <P>The NESF is outside this House and, in many ways, removed from the debate here, and not every party in this House is represented on it &mdash; for example, there is no Green Party representation.  However, the NESF does very good work and produces detailed reports.  I hope the Dáil will continue to debate its reports so that its work will be brought to fruition in decision making.</P>
    <P>When looking for solutions to unemployment, it is not often taken into account that it is directly linked to growth in mass technology. Unemployment is not a glitch.  It is with us as a result of what we call progress, and we should face up to that and deal with it.  There is no going back, but there is certainly call for a new way of thinking.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is part of the cutbacks that have been forced on many, particularly local authorities.  One example comes to light at this time of the year when people complain about potholes, bad services and insufficient staffing in local authorities.  How economic is it to cut back drastically on staffing when people with little more than a shovel or a pick could be employed to keep drains open, thus preventing the deterioration of road surfaces caused by the accumulation of large amounts of water?  The long-term picture must be taken into account rather than simply cutting back budgets on a year by year basis which often costs more in the long-term in financial and human terms.</P>
    <P>Most county councils complain that they are caught between a rock and a hard place because they are so dependent on FÁS for employment schemes.  This is an area that does not need radical change, but it does need change.  I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations, for example, CRYPTIC in Balbriggan, which, acting as a well developed youth club takes young people who have left school early or without adequate qualifications, and links them with employers who want to be assured that the people they employ are willing to work and able to acquire the necessary, often specialised, skills. That organisation gets no help from FÁS although it is doing vital work and making the links between education and employment that, all too often, are not made.</P>
    <P>In a wider sense we have to deal with such fundamental issues as tax reform.  People in this House constantly talk of tax reform and encouraging enterprise, which is laudable and necessary.  However, it is necessary that there is a fundamental shift in the burden of taxation, and <Col N="1143" /> it is not happening simply because of the rhetoric that until everybody else in Europe shifts taxation from a tax on labour to a tax on energy we cannot do so.  I urge the Government to take on board what experts in the ESRI have been saying for some time, that Ireland, because of its unique economic climate, would be able to maintain competitiveness if we were to lessen tax on labour and shift the burden to energy.  I urge the Government not to drag its feet on this matter. Action on it is overdue.  It is relevant to unemployment because the less it costs an employer to take on people the more people can be employed.  If people can work for money that would otherwise be paid in tax that would be an incentive to people to create their own employment as well as work for others.</P>
    <P>Community employment is more than simply a FÁS buzzword, but it is not sufficiently encouraged.  We are in a difficult and volatile international market, and the greater the sense of ownership and belonging on the part of people working in a company the greater will be their determination to hang on and work through difficult times and come out with the sense of having dealt with the difficulties and of having learned from them.  That is often not appreciated. Semperit is one of those sad cases where the company is little more than a puppet being pulled on an international string.  It has been said that the pension funds of employees in that company have indirectly contributed to the creation of unemployment.  Perhaps some investigative journalist might write about this &mdash; there is not enough time to deal with it here.</P>
    <P>It is important that we determine the quality of the employment being created.  Many enterprises which set up here are, of their nature, short-term and unsustainable, even though they are welcomed by the Government.  I urge the Government to vet employment and to place greater emphasis on repair and maintenance type industries.  As one example I cite the car scrappage scheme.  Buying new cars is all very well for sales people in garages, but it does not encourage repair or maintenance.  Unfortunately, a four-year wait before one has to have one's car mechanically tested encourages replacement of cars rather than maintenance and repair which would create long-term sustainable employment and should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Bullying in schools is an issue of particular concern to me.  It is a most complex and difficult problem and this is recognised in the depth and detail of our national policy which was prepared by an expert working group and put in place in 1993 following consultation with the partners in Education.  The policy includes guidelines which were issued to all schools and are available to the public from my Department.</P>
      <P>The guidelines on countering bullying behaviour and the policy which they underpin have attracted much favourable comment.  Indeed Ireland was to the fore in producing national guidelines of this type and they have been of real assistance to schools in dealing with this issue.</P>
      <P>We must constantly review our approach and learn from the practical experience of those closest to the problem.  I have now decided to review the present guidelines and as a first step I have asked the partners in education to submit their observations to me.  The nationwide study of Bullying in first and second level schools conducted by Trinity College, which was considered at the recent International Conference on Bullying in Trinity College, will also make a significant contribution to the review. The review will be conducted in consultation with the Partners during the current school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that I have increased significantly the availability of guidance counselling in schools.  I regard this additional resource as being central to the strategy of countering bullying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Trinity College survey one in 20 primary school children and one in 50 post-primary school children are bullied once a week.  One of the major problems is the reluctance of children, particularly as they grow older, to tell teachers or parents about the bullying.  Given the foregoing and the feelings of inadequacy such children must have, surely there is an urgent need to rapidly expand the educational psychological service to help children who need counselling?  Those who bully are also victims as a consequence of emotional turmoil and so forth.  We have a poor psychological service; 80 per cent of primary school children have no access to a psychologist.  Is there not an urgent need for the expansion of the psychology service to help these children who are suffering every week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right to draw our attention to the scale of the problem that has been identified.  It is also important to put it in perspective.  We do not know if the scale is increasing or decreasing, although the problem is more identifiable.  I share the Deputy's concern that younger children appear to be more prepared to tell adults and those who are responsible for ensuring they have a happy school environment about instances of bullying.  As children grow older peer pressure seems to strengthen.</P>
      <P>I wish to record my appreciation of the great work being done under Dr. Mona O'Moore in Trinity College.  The information yielded by her study is available to all who are intent on helping the community deal with the problem which extends far beyond the school.  The guidelines I have put in place are geared towards the prevention of the development of bullying in schools, not just for the sake of children who are bullied but also for the children who bully and who are also victims in the society in which they are reared.</P>
      <P>The guidelines have been in place for three years.  I intend to consult the partners in education &mdash; teachers, parents and those responsible for running the schools &mdash; to ask them to consider the guidelines and how they have operated and to increase the scale of help available to schools, whether it is through the schools psychological service or guidance counsellors.  At the end of this school year, when we complete the review of the guidelines, there might be a suggestion to upgrade them.  Certainly, we are starting from a much better informed source than when I came into office.  Ireland is the only European country with national guidelines. They were put in place not from on high but following consultation with all the partners involved in ensuring that a child can benefit from education within the school system.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, according to the President of the ASTI, not only is there a horrendous problem of bullying in schools but what we have learned about it is only the tip of the iceberg?  Is the Minister aware of the extent of bullying in our schools and will she agree that the lack of psychological services in schools is one of the reasons we are unable to deal with the problem?  Does she agree with the findings of the review and will she expand the school psychological service to the extent needed?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of cases that have been documented in which bullying has led to serious consequences?  The parents of one child who suffered and subsequently died from anorexia nervosa are convinced that the process was started by bullying in school.  They believe it led to low self esteem in the child.  Does the Minister not agree that this problem must be dealt with urgently and not pushed back for review once again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not underestimate the problem.  I assembled an expert group and, following consultation with the partners in education, introduced the only national guidelines on bullying.  That was done three years ago.  We must be careful with the facts and figures.  We must remember we have no previous figures on which to base the interesting material that is now available and which must inform new rules within the Department on tackling bullying.</P>
      <P>It is a complex matter and I will not comment on individual cases.  Responsibility for the school environment is one I share with the partners in Government.  I do not agree that consulting the partners in Government about reviewing guidelines in place for three years is shoving the problem anywhere.  Three years is a relatively short time.  More information is available to us and the complexity of services in schools has increased.  I should mention the stay safe programme which gives younger children the skills to communicate with adults where they feel they are not in a safe environment, the teacher counselling posts developed as a pilot scheme in the Tallaght area and the remedial services and extra guidance counsellors.  I am satisfied that more resources are available now.  So long as one child is bullied and those responsible for that environment have not declared bully-free zones for children the work of the Department of Education must continue on behalf of those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has avoided answering the core part of both questions.  Given that 80 per cent &mdash; the figure is available from IMPACT &mdash; of primary school children have no access whatsoever to a psychological service and that children are reluctant to speak with teachers and parents, will the Minister accept the need for more staff in the school psychological service? Will she accept that we need a nationwide school counselling service?  People with low incomes have to find the money for private appointments with psychologists.  I have had experience of this. It is only through such counselling sessions that children reveal the entire story and have an opportunity to retrieve the situation for themselves and the school.  The Minister should pay more attention to what is being said here.  It is not a flippant matter.  I urge the Minister to appoint more psychologists to our schools and provide a nationwide counselling service for the children who are being bullied.  Those children cannot wait for a review of guidelines.  They need help now and we should provide it, given the scale of the problem.</P>

      <P>Guidelines are in place following consultation with the partners.  The number of schools which has adopted the guidelines is encouraging.  There is an onus on all of us to ensure a bully-free environment. Resources have been made available to the psychological service, the teaching counsellors and the stay safe programme.  Guidelines are in place but the resource should not be finite.  So long as difficulties remain for children there is a responsibility on all of us.  More information is now available and a better spotlight is put on the needs of children.  There is no disagreement on the need for more support services.  The prevention of bullying in schools should be a top priority in the management of the school community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rightly pointed to the fact that this is a complex issue.  What proces is in place to ensure the guidelines are implemented?  What monitoring process is in place to follow up on their implementation?  Will she agree that to ensure those guidelines are implemented schools need the back-up of a school psychological service so that they can identify and deal with the problem?  Will the Minister agree it is not good enough to have psychological service pilot schemes, that we need a nationwide service to counteract this problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines were issued as national policy to all schools.  Part of the review is to monitor the effectiveness of the guidelines in different communities.  The guidelines allow for flexibility by each school in the prevention of bullying.  Parents, teachers and managers are involved.  I expect at the end of this school year when we have had a review of the guidelines through the primary and second level school systems that parts of those guidelines could be adopted.  More research will be available to us for the following school year.  All the partners must be involved in building a happy environment for school children so that they can benefit from the educational system.</P>

      <P>The guidelines were issued to all schools three years ago.  The impact of those guidelines is to be examined by the Department. That is a relatively short time in which to review them.  The working party drawing up the national guidelines involved all the interests of the school communities at the different levels so that each of the national organisations involved in the partnership for education had an input into the guidelines.  Those guidelines were issued nationally.  Three years later we have asked those <Col N="1148" /> same partners and organisations, those closest to the school communities, to come back to the Department of Education to review them.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if she will give permanent recognition to Crumlin multi-denominational school, Dublin 12; and the urgent steps, if any, she will take to provide suitable accommodation for the school in order to prevent an impending eviction from taking place.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21424/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Crumlin multi-denominational school had its origins in another multi-denominational school, the South City School Project, which up to March, 1993 was based in surplus school accommodation in the Crumlin area.  In March 1993, however, this building was destroyed by fire and the school project was eventually relocated in alternative school accommodation in Nutgrove, Rath-farnham. Because the decision to move to Rathfarnham was not acceptable to some parents, an application for a new multi-denominational school to serve the greater Crumlin area was submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>Temporary recognition was given to the new school, the Crumlin multi-denominational school, with effect from September 1994.  It is now in its third school year of operation at present and has an enrolment of 30 pupils.  The school has been asked to vacate its current temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>As with all new multi-denominational or all-Irish schools, initial recognition was granted to the Crumlin school on a temporary basis.  When such schools have been in operation for a number of years and can satisfy my Department with regard to their conduct and future viability, permanent recognition may be granted.</P>
      <P>While the school is operating with temporary recognition, it is the responsibility, under my Department's regulations, of school management to provide temporary accommodation under the present rules of my Department.  It is only when permanent recognition has been granted that such schools can claim capital grant-aid from my Department.  Crumlin multi-denominational school has temporary recognition at present and, accordingly, does not qualify for grant-aid for capital works.</P>
      <P>The school has applied for permanent recognition and this application is being processed by my Department as a matter of urgency.  Officials from my Department met a deputation from the management of the school and Educate Together on 16 October 1996 to discuss the issues.  The views put forward by the deputation will be taken into account in the examination of the application for permanent recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of all national schools with temporary recognition, future viability is a key <Col N="1149" /> consideration when decisions with regard to permanent status are being taken.  The growth potential of such schools must be closely examined at a time when overall pupil numbers at primary level are falling at a rate of 11,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay in processing this application and that the accommodation problem will be reviewed immediately in the light of that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I find such complacency breathtaking.  The school has not been asked to leave, it is under threat of eviction by the developers.  Two parents have been summoned to court as financial guarantors of the school.  Drug addicts are operating in the back sheds of the school, which was burgled yesterday.  I spoke to a teacher who said the school is under siege. Conditions are appalling.  It is five months since the Minister became aware of the threat of eviction hanging over these 33 children and their two teachers.  It is disgraceful and scandalous that she has not intervened and accommodated these children more suitably.</P>
      <P>In line with the White Paper on education, early and permanent recognition must be given to the schools so capital moneys can be released to facilitate a more permanent setting.  Despite the cant about developing multi-denominational education, these children who are in a perhaps disadvantaged low income area with few resources are not getting help from anybody, least of all from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has painted a picture of a sudden eviction.  The premises were given to the school on a one year lease so it is a matter of concern rather than surprise.  I do not underestimate the amount of time and help the Department officials have given to this group of people.  There were difficulties in rehousing the south city school project.  The Department, in conjunction with Educate Together, were able to rehouse the original group in a school, which was not easy.</P>
      <P>The school accommodation committee will examine the present rules.  Under the rules by which this group set up its second school, temporary recognition is a problem because unless the Department gives permanent recognition it is not officially involved or obliged to involve itself in providing accommodation.  The Department has made every effort to accommodate this group.  There is a prefabricated building available, but we have not located a site for it.  The group want to maintain the multi-denominational group in the Crumlin area.  While many avenues have been explored by the parents and Educate Together, there is no obligation on officials under the rules of the Department.  While much time has been given, the outcome has not been successful.  We will continue to help a group of people who had accommodation for a year.</P>

      <P>The picture I painted is not mine. The principal of the school has made numerous attempts to contact the Minister and her programme manager.  They consistently failed to return the numerous calls to her office, despite being aware of the gravity of the problem.  They have not received any news since their meeting with officials on 16 October.  Do words mean anything any more?  Does the White Paper mean anything?  It promised early recognition of multi-denominational schools and gaelscoileanna.  This school has been in operation since 1993.  If we gave it permanent recognition, it would help to unlock the logjam that is preventing it from securing more permanent accommodation.  The regime that governs multi-denominational education is restrictive and is placing too onerous a duty on the parents concerned.</P>

      <P>A schools accommodation commission has been established, which includes a representative of Educate Together and the gaelscoileanna.  Given the fall in population, the future viability of schools has to be secured.  The present rules of the Department of Education were fashioned when the population was growing and there was no planning for a future where there were fewer children entering a better financed system.  It is more than timely to review those rules.</P>
      <P>It is important that not only are the general partners involved in determining a review of the existing rules but that Educate Together and the other schools that add a plurality of choice to the system are represented.  The news the group wants is that we have found them a school.  I spoke to them about their problems.  I look forward to the active participation of Educate Together and the other groups in the school commission so that the rules, which are not of my making, will be reviewed in the light of viability for the investment schools should receive.</P>

      <P>The caveat was: yes, you can develop it, it might be quite a good idea bearing in mind the numbers of people unemployed, taking into account the benefits of travel and language <Col N="1153" /> skills involved but it must be done within your budget.  On the one hand we saw the educational merits of Westmeath vocational education committee developing a VTOS, implementing some of its course in Montbard in France. However, my Department had to make it clear to the vocational education committee that while educationally we do not have any difficulty with this project it must be done within existing funding. There is an Act governing the funding of vocational education committees within whose provisions Westmeath vocational education committee went ahead, entered into negotiations and purchased a building beyond its statutory powers.</P>
      <P>My Department informed that vocational education committee on a number of occasions that it had acted beyond its statutory powers in this and other areas.  The outcome was that, while Westmeath vocational education committee was not in any financial position to purchase the building, and did not have the necessary permission to do so, another education authority purchased the building which continues to be used for educational purposes.  What gave rise to investigations, the results of which were published and made available, was the fact that Westmeath vocational education committee, in this and other cases, had acted outside of good financial managerial practice and was in no position to pursue the best of ideas because they did not have a penny with which to do so.  That was the outcome of the inquiry.  As the Deputy will appreciate, since then we have strengthened the financial systems within the overall vocational education committee sector to the extent that I now have confidence that such circumstances will not recur.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that only when a request for additional expenditure on the project was received via a letter from the chief executive officer of Westmeath vocational education committee to her departmental officials on 1 February 1994 did those officials go to the Department of Finance, seeking the requisite funding and that only on receipt of a negative reply from the Department of Finance, was the fax of 11 February 1994 sent to Westmeath vocational education committee?  The Minister should admit that she was totally supportive of the Montbard project, not merely in principle but in detail.  I might remind her that, in reply to a parliamentary question in May 1994, she said that, in various instances, vocational education committees provide accommodation for VTOS&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister were the chief executive officer of Westmeath vocational education committee and received a letter from her programme manager to the effect that he had received her portfolio in the case of the Montbard project, congratulating her on such an enlightened initiative, what signal would she think that would send to the people in Westmeath vocational education committee other than that she, the Minister for Education, was enthusiastically behind that project since her programme manager had congratulated them on it in April 1994?</P>

      <P>This matter was the subject of an inquiry whose findings were put in the public domain.  There was never any question about the educational interests that could be generated in having available a module of VTOS to those participating in that programme in France.

      <P>Its results were made available within the public domain, the consequences of which left no doubt that Westmeath vocational education committee was spending in areas in which it had not authority to do so.  While that vocational education committee had a project that was interesting educationally, there was no doubt in the mind of its acting chief executive officer that the constraints on him in responding to such a project were those of confining expenditure within his budget, which was where the difficulties arose.  I must point out that it was not something that culminated in a large bill to the Irish taxpayer because the building was sold on and is in educational use. The affairs of Westmeath vocational education committee gave rise to an inquiry, whose findings were published, the outcome of which resulted in there being put in place, within the overall vocational education committee sector, clear lines of communication on what can and cannot be spent.  As a result, as Minister for Education, I can now say to Westmeath vocational education committee and others that I have confidence in their financial management.</P>

As a first step in the review my Department has commissioned a research project on discipline in primary and second-level schools.  This study will identify the extent of discipline problems in the education system and models of good practice in the maintenance of discipline in schools.  It is expected that the report will be completed at the end of the current year.</P>

      <P>When I tabled a similar question a year ago the Minister said a research project would be undertaken by her Department.  Today she said that yet another research project will be undertaken.  The Minister has been negligent in developing strategies to combat indiscipline in schools.  The findings of the recent TUI survey and its statement raised widespread concern throughout the educational world about the lack of resources allocated to teachers and schools to combat this problem.  The Minister does not seem to have any answers for the schools concerned and it is ridiculous for her to say, one year later, that her Department has commissioned a research project on this issue.</P>

      <P>Research projects are not conducted overnight.  The Department's research and development committee commissioned Dr. Maeve Martin of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, to conduct research on discipline in primary and second-level schools.  The report is well advanced and will be completed by the end of the year.  The interim report submitted by Dr. Martin earlier in the year indicated that comprehensive literature research had been carried out on best practice, a questionnaire on discipline had been distributed to a representative sample of schools, meetings had been held with teachers, further interviews with stakeholders were planned and further meetings would be held with parents, teachers, management, deans of discipline, year heads and the inspectorate.  The aim of the research is to identify models of good practice and ensure the maintenance of discipline in schools.</P>
      <P>After the project is completed, there will be a review of the 1991 guidelines, and the TUI policy document on discipline will be helpful in this regard.  The partners in education who carry responsibility for the maintenance of discipline in the classroom are teachers.  I acknowledge the work already carried out by the TUI, and we will continue to talk to the partners in education.  The TUI policy document contains 46 recommendations and I will consider any recommendations made following the review.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that five years after the guidelines were published the Department is engaged in research on how to deal with this enormous problem in schools?  Has a specific timescale been set for completion of the research project?  Will the Minister agree it is normal to set such parameters when embarking on a research project?  It is five years since the guidelines were put in place.  As in the case of bullying, the Minister has resorted to commissioning research after the event rather than dealing with the problem.  When will the project be completed and when will a workable system to deal with the problem be put in place in schools?</P>

      <P>The guidelines were put in place for primary schools in 1990 and in 1991 for <Col N="1157" /> post-primary schools.  The information available does not suggest there has been a decrease in discipline problems over the past five or six years. The guidelines make a positive contribution to the environment in schools and it is important to remember that they are not reviewed by the Minister but by those who have access to international best practice.  The research project was announced one year ago and I received an interim report earlier in the year.  The Department is very concerned to ensure that schools are consulted.  Consultation with the partners in education has been completed and the research project will be completed by the end of the year.  The TUI has carried out very useful work in this area.  Guidelines need to be reviewed, and I asked for the guidelines on bullying to be reviewed after three years.  This work requires in-depth attention by the Department and cannot be carried out overnight.</P>

      <P>How many children are expelled from secondary schools each year because of discipline problems and what is the Department's policy on their subsequent education?  For example, what happens if they are refused entry to other local schools because of their record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific details on these matters but there are rules governing explusion at primary and second-level.  Primary school rule 130(6) provides that no pupil shall be struck off the roll for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school. In the case of secondary schools, the positive policy guideline on school behaviour and discipline provides that expulsion should be resorted to only in the most extreme cases of discipline and only after every effort at rehabilitation has failed and every other sanction has been exhausted.  If the Deputy wishes, I can give him details of the exemptions.  Schools should be aware of the legal consequences which might arise if a pupil under 15 years is expelled and alternative placement in another school is not secured for him.  For schools involved in the sad decision to expel children, there is a responsibility to find alternative accommodation for those under 15.  Children over 15 are outside the compulsory school age although an increasing number of students stay on at school well after the compulsory period.</P>

      <P>Management of schools is a matter for the boards of management.  The Department inspectorate liaises with schools and <Col N="1158" /> is concerned with problems of indiscipline and expulsion.  The Department has funded an in-career development unit which has made courses on classroom management and discipline available to teachers.  These courses were mainly designed by the teachers' unions, in particular the INTO and ASTI.  Teachers have been able to avail of such courses which are funded by the Department.</P>
      <P>In future we will see more investment for training teachers in classroom management and discipline.  The strategies and type of sanctions available to schools are outlined and in times of trouble communication is available between schools and the departmental inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply illustrates that the Department has not grasped the problem nationally and does not have a hands-on approach to the issue.  I tabled my question because a fresh initiative is needed on the key problem of school discipline, not just in terms of guidelines for techniques and methodology but to assist and resource schools.  In addition, adequate provision is required for a child who is suspended or expelled from class because the school judges that he or she is unduly harming the quality of education for the rest of the pupils.  No real alternative provisions are available to schools for such children who need help through a multidisciplinary approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been negligent in assisting schools to help such children and assistance could be given through a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio or the development of a special class to deal with unruly children.  A fresh initiative is needed to help children who are suspended or expelled for a variety of reasons.  It is not good enough to say that we must await the results of research, guidelines and all that nonsense because it is not focusing on the problem.</P>

      <P>Where there is a shortfall there will be a need for a review.  The Deputy mentioned the need to change things for children, and support services in schools have increased.  I will continue to seek more services.  With 84 per cent of children now staying on to sit the leaving certificate we must have a relevant curriculum. We must have options so that children are not utterly frustrated in the classroom and, in turn, display signs of behaviour which disrupts not only the child's education but that of the whole class.</P>
      <P>In handling the need for change and a different wider profile of children within the school, it is timely to have conducted a year of research.  I look forward to bringing to the House the new guidelines that will emanate not only from the research being carried out but also from the work done by the teachers' unions.</P>

      <P>I thought it was remarkably interesting that in answer to the question put by Deputy Wallace in relation to discipline, the Minister did not refer to the school psychological service.  In the context of schools being responsible for children's behaviour in class, does the Minister agree that support is required by the partnership involving the school, parents, children and the community?  We do not have a school psychological service, although we have a couple of pilot schemes.  Will the Minister agree that support is desperately needed, particularly in the case of a disruptive pupil who may behave in such a way because of psychological difficulties that need to be addressed?  An assessment and treatment service is needed for that type of pupil. Will the Minister agree that unless there is a fully implemented psychological service all the research in the world will not cater for such children who will be thrown on the scrap-heap?</P>

      <P>During my term of office we have increased the number of guidance counsellors available in secondary schools.  I know the Deputy has a particular knowledge of the career guidance service and I was concerned that the service available was very thin on the ground.  Therefore, I was able to set up the career guidance counselling service and introduce 100 new guidance counsellors so that such counselling would be available to students within the school <Col N="1160" /> system.  That should not be written out of the equation.  There are now much more support services in schools than before, including remedial services at second level and a dramatic increase in the career guidance service as well as an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Huge improvements have also been made in the curriculum that students are expected to study.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to commission research so it should not be dismissed lightly, as the Deputies have done.  I will use the outcome of that research to inform my Department as I seek to put more support services into schools.  For a long time such support services were few and far between.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested there are teachers who are so stressed they can no longer function in the classroom.  I hope, within the adult medical care provisions, such teachers can recover and return to the classroom.  This is where the guidelines will help and where the voice of the teachers and the board of management must be heard.  The Department of Education was able to respond positively to courses proposed by the teacher unions, the organisations in place to protect teachers.  They claim such courses will provide teachers with the necessary skills to deal with difficult pupils and other stress-related problems in schools.  The Deputy painted a rather sad picture.</P>
      <P>We recently announced the upgrading of education centres.  Teachers must not feel they are being left to cope on their own.  Teaching is a lonely profession.  For that reason the in-career development unit concentrates a great deal of money on upgrading teacher skills.  We have also provided a welfare service for teachers.  When teacher centres are upgraded and the guidelines on discipline are strengthened, teachers should not feel alone.  Deputy Wallace is obviously familiar with sad cases.  Those are the broad areas we are developing to respond to specific cases.</P>

To suggest there are no disciplinary problems in classrooms and that teachers are not affected by it is misleading.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 14, 19, 21, 28, 32, 45, 50, 54, 65 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to relocate the existing college in its entirety on the new site.  Over the past three years it has been found necessary to sanction the acquisition of additional land and property for five of the regional technical colleges including Tralee to facilitate the provision of accommodation to house the huge increase in full-time student numbers.</P>
      <P>In the case of Tralee regional technical college, following an unsuccessful attempt to acquire additional lands adjacent to the existing college, a site, which was considered suitable by independent consultants and the valuation office, was acquired within one mile of the college.  The new site is of sufficient size to allow all foreseeable infrastructure requirements of the college to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> Under the 1994-9 European Regional Development Fund Programme I have allocated a sum of £6 million to developments at Tralee regional technical college.  The project in question includes a hotel-tourist training facility, an information technology building and enhanced central facilities.  The present position is that a design team has been appointed by the college and discussions are ongoing between officials of the Department and the college authorities regarding the facilities to be located at the new site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In a letter to Deputy O'Malley, dated July 1996, the Minister indicated the cost of this long-term project would be in the order of £30 million.  Surely it would have made more sense to make a serious effort to purchase land adjacent to the college rather than selecting a site three miles outside Tralee which, for various logistical reasons, may not be the best site.  The people concerned believe a serious attempt was not made to acquire the land adjacent to the college.</P>
      <P>There appears to be considerable discrimination against other regional technical colleges.  Cork regional technical college is not receiving anywhere near the amount of money allocated to Tralee and Sligo regional technical college has not received matching funds from the Department for its development project.  Similar stories could be told about other regional technical colleges.  There are no plans to develop a regional technical college in the Blanchardstown-Finglas area which, because of its low participation at third level, was identified by the Higher Education Authority steering committee as the area in greatest need of an regional technical college.  There appears to be an uneven and somewhat discriminatory policy from the Minister in respect of particular regional technical colleges.  Dun Laoghaire and Tralee are doing well.  Is it a coincidence that the goodies are flowing to where the Minister and Tánaiste are based to the detriment of other areas?  There is a major hotel and catering training section in Cork regional technical college and it is now proposed to develop a top level rival down the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was part of the plan announced for the development of the regional technical college.  To allay the fears that no serious attempt was made to acquire land adjacent to the college, for cost and size reasons that was not possible.  Serious consideration was given to acquiring that land.  While in terms of proximity, it would appear to be the best site to purchase, it was not possible to pursue that acquisition.  Advertisements were placed in local papers and the site of 62.2 acres outside Tralee was considered suitable.  In accordance with normal open and transparent procedures, a valuation of £880,000 was agreed for the site and a sum of £6 million was allocated under the <Col N="1164" /> 1994-9 European Regional Development Fund Programme.  The facilities being provided have been agreed as part of a plan.  The breakdown of plans for other colleges is just as exciting, but the question posed related to Tralee regional technical college.  From visits I made to Cork, I do not believe that regional technical college has been forgotten.  I have also visited Sligo and Galway regional technical colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork regional technical college has attracted large funding because of the enormous influx of students to the regional technical college sector.  It is interesting to note that last year more third level students opted to go to regional technical colleges than to universities.  That does not take from the fact, as the Deputy pointed out, that the Higher Education Authority recommends further development of the regional technical college sector.  The development in Tralee, as in other colleges, is progressing to the satisfaction of those involved in creating more places for this third level sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What size was the site that was rejected as being inadequate?  I understand that 50 acres of land was available within easy reach of the college and that this 60 acre site is two miles away from it.  While I appreciate that Tralee is in the Tánaiste's constituency, did the Minister think of the additional cost for parents? Does she know that one third of all students in Tralee Regional Technical College are from Cork city and county?  Is she suggesting it is cheaper for parents to send their children from Cork to Tralee rather than expanding the college in Cork to meet the demand already there?  Cork Regional Technical College has the highest points system because it is the first choice of the majority of applicants.  However, because the Minister has not made sufficient moneys available to extend the Cork college, people from Cork are now going to Tralee at great cost to themselves.</P>

      <P>We now have the voice of Carlow Regional Technical College.  The regional technical college sector is experiencing exciting developments.  It provides degree, certificate and diploma courses.  The needs study addressed the development of third level education in which the regional technical colleges have a special place. They are not just institutions which allow students to take certificate and diploma courses. In the past year we have developed degree places in the regional technical college sector.  This sector has been reviewed.  I have been in contact with the management of the regional technical colleges and I have received proposals about the need to upgrade the colleges, to increase the number of degree places and to change their name.  Students in the regional technical college sector are given many choices and they receive a wealth of education.  I suggest those choices are more limited in the university sector.  The regional technical college sector is under review and is a great success story.  I have no doubt that the outcome of the review and the decisions regarding investment will be of interest to all Members who have spoken on behalf of the various regional technical colleges.</P>

      <P>This matter was not decided quickly, but I was assured that negotiations on that site would not result in a positive outcome. Because of a commitment to invest in the college I was then obliged not to be delayed by local fits of pique but to be in a position to acquire a suitable site to ensure that the development announced for Tralee Regional Technical College would progress.  That is where the matter stands.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I referred to the type of employment which many Members consider desirable, but which consciously or unconsciously is not being developed in the economic environment in which we live, that of repair and maintenance-based industries.  I referred to the MOT test initiative which is welcome in so far as it is a step in the right direction, but it will only be required in respect of four-year-old vehicles.  That appears to encourage replacement of newer vehicles rather than the maintenance of vehicles for a longer period, but that remains to be seen.  I hope this point will be taken into account and that it might result in a revised decision.  Many forms of work are recognised as labour intensive.  We should consider as many ways as possible to encourage rather than discourage &mdash; as often happens &mdash; that type of employment.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the area of organic growing in the context of the difficulties faced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, as a result of the BSE crisis and the lack of public confidence in the food production sector.  The problem in that sector is not only one of a lack of public confidence, but also one of employment.  A great number of people have left the land and the agricultural sector is diminishing as a primary area of employment.  That could be reversed and dealt with, but it requires a generous understanding of the potential of organic farming, which still appears to be a poor relation in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>The Kerbside company deals with a socially useful area of employment, that of reducing the amount of waste going to landfill sites through recovery and recycling, but unfortunately it is virtually totally dependent on FÁS initiatives and schemes.  That cannot continue indefinitely because it will not allow the initiative to develop to its maximum extent.  Kerbside would be capable of dealing with a far greater number of households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in the Dáil the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht welcomed the initiative from the Opposition to introduce legislation on the preservation of old buildings, particularly their interiors.  This work will be <Col N="1170" /> carried out by craft industries which are labour intensive to preserve our architectural heritage.  It will require a change of direction in the construction industry to allow this sector reach its full potential, which is considerable in terms of job creation.</P>
    <P>Many of the sectors to which I have referred do not provide full-time employment.  I have often heard it said, in disparaging terms, that unless one is employed for 40 hours per week one does not have a &ldquo;real&rdquo; job.  Those in part-time, seasonal and short-term contract employment are aggrieved about this.  Increasingly, these are the only jobs available.  The Green Party has recognised for a long time that this trend is much stronger than any Government initiative aimed at reversing it.</P>
    <P>We should seek instead to supplement the incomes of those in part-time employment through the introduction of a guaranteed basic income scheme.  This will be of interest to the many non-governmental organisations working with people living in poverty and in low paid employment.  While the ideas of the Conference of Religious of Ireland may not be in line with mine, in terms of the way forward they are much more perceptive than those of the Government, many of whose initiatives are aimed at reversing these work patterns.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to be courageous given that, in its own words, the economy is doing well and there is the potential to make the changes we were not in a position to make in the past.  It should depart from old style, traditional employment policies which have failed to tackle long-term unemployment in a realistic fashion. All they have done is tinker round the edges.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that we are being sucked further and further into the global economy with all the instability that entails.  If one looks at the detail, the outlook is frightening. Under GATT and other international agreements we are required to introduce free trade arrangements.  There is potential, however, to develop the local economy.  In France, for instance, local wine, bread and cheese production has long been cherished as part of its culture.</P>
    <P>Local economic activity is not dependent on the use of standard currency.  I refer in particular to the traditional Irish system of the meitheal. Deputy Mattie Brennan referred to the difficulties encountered by apprentices seeking employment.  It would be worth his while and that of others with an interest in this matter to examine the potential of what has become known as LETS, local employment trading system, first introduced in Canada but now found worldwide. It is in operation in 35 locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The local community in Westport has listed in a mini Golden Pages all the skills possessed by the unemployed, including carpentry, plumbing, tiling, bricklaying as well as mundane skills such as dog walking.  A local value or unit of currency <Col N="1171" /> over which the local community has control has been put on each of these valuable skills.  In this way its members are able to trade among themselves, hone skills of use to them in the formal economy to which they aspire and achieve a reasonable standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The point is not often aired in the House that, as well as looking at the formal economy, we must examine the potential of the informal economy to tackle long-term unemployment in support of the efforts of the NESF.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the National Economic and Social Forum on tackling this important issue.  It has helped to put long-term unemployment firmly on the political agenda and its report contains much of great importance.</P>
      <P>Recently I tabled a parliamentary question asking the Minister how many jobs have been lost and created in my area.  There has not been a net gain, despite the efforts of the many associations working to reduce unemployment.  I was disappointed to hear on local radio as I travelled to the Dáil earlier this week that the number of people registered as unemployed at the Buncrana employment exchange has increased by 124 in the past year.  This is disheartening at a time when the economy is performing well.</P>
      <P>The reasons companies are not establishing in Donegal include its peripheral location.  The difficulties are compounded by the lack of adequate infrastructure and we are constantly looking for improvements.  The airlink between Derry and Dublin which served north east Donegal has been withdrawn although west Donegal continues to be served by the link to Carrickfin.  This does not help to attract businesses to the area.  Money should be provided for infrastructural development, particularly in the north and north-west.  Only when that is done will factories be encouraged to set up there.  One of the main boards working to develop industry and enterprise in Donegal is the county enterprise board.  As I said when I came into the Dáil six or seven months ago, £1 million worth of projects &mdash; 27 in all &mdash; were proposed for the county but only £90,000 was provided to facilitate them.  The county enterprise board is doing tremendous work but it is starved of funds. Groups such as that which attract projects, thereby creating employment, should be given the necessary funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Donegal the fishing industry is our greatest resource.  It has the potential to create jobs, but greater investment is needed in piers and harbours.  Funding is also needed to renew the fishing fleet.  The report on safety at sea recommended that the Government seek extra financing to renew rather than modernise the fleet.  That would be of tremendous benefit to Greencastle, which concentrates on the whitefish sector.  Developments have taken place in the pelagic sector in Killybegs.  There is potential for <Col N="1172" /> the development of the fishing industry in Donegal and there should be greater investment in it.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about equality, especially for women.  To qualify for community employment schemes women must be on the live register.  They should be given the opportunity to go back to work.  The issue of child care for women wishing to go back to work must also be considered.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the youth, whom we must not forget.  We are talking here about long-term unemployment, but if we do not introduce measures to help the youth they will become long-term unemployed.  The peace and reconciliation fund assists the socially excluded, but much more could be done in that regard. Small rural communities which show great interest in the development of their youth should be given the necessary finance.  I would like to see improvements in community employment and FÁS schemes.  Many people who wish to continue on these schemes are sent back to a life on the dole and there are no alternative employment prospects for them.</P>
    <P>Personal assistants for people associated with the Centre for Independent Living take part in FÁS training schemes, but in many cases as soon as they are trained they have to withdraw from the scheme.  Disabled people experience difficulty in finding a personal assistant whom they can trust and it is unacceptable that when they find a suitable person, that person is withdrawn from the scheme and put back on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>The taxation issue must be addressed.  The present system causes much hardship for those at work and there is no incentive for the unemployed to get work.  There are many antifamily aspects which should be addressed. Measures, for instance those relating to rural post offices, pose a threat to rural areas.  The withdrawal of resources from rural areas results in increasing unemployment.  It is important to encourage people to remain in rural areas.  The idea of building up a massive city with great resources, while ignoring infrastructure in other areas, is unacceptable.  There should be a greater spread of jobs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the National Economic and Social Forum on identifying positive features and I hope they will be followed up.  It is important that jobs are created in areas such as Donegal. The county enterprise board should receive greater assistance, the paltry sum it receives at present is inadequate.  There is scope for development through various initiatives.  There are many local resources which, if tapped, could provide jobs in areas around the coast, thereby taking many people off the live register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the forum for its work to date in regard to long-term unemployment initiatives &mdash; the last report was published in April 1996.  I had the opportunity to evaluate and <Col N="1173" /> assess the recommendations of the forum and I appreciate its endeavour to address certain issues. People outside this House are of the view that the economy is doing well and every opportunity is available to the Government to take innovative, bold steps to address the unemployment problem, particularly long-term unemployment.  It is disappointing that those innovative initiatives have not been undertaken by Government.  I appreciate a number of new measures were announced in the budget, but some of them have not yet been implemented.  I look forward to the opportunity of evaluating those announcements late this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>The reality is that there are genuine people who are locked in the trap of long-term unemployment.  They are not being given the opportunity of enjoying real employment in the workplace.  We all know, however, that there are some people who are not genuinely seeking work but I am more concerned that the long-term unemployed are encouraged to participate in the workplace.</P>
      <P>I wonder if any evaluation has been carried out to date of various Government initiatives in regard to its decentralisation policy.  I admit I am biased in favour of the Dublin area but our capital city is the proper place to locate certain Departments.  I accept there is some merit in examining the overall aspect of decentralisation but it has caused a number of problems and it has taken certain quality jobs out of Dublin at a time when the city is identified as an unemployment blackspot.</P>
      <P>Dublin has been neglected by politicians from all political parties over the years.  We have not fought sufficiently hard for Dublin and we should not have allowed good jobs to be taken out of Dublin in light of the fact that alarm bells were ringing in relation to the growth of unemployment and the lack of incentives attracting business to Dublin.  Incentives were put in place to attract business to other regions at a time when jobs were being taken out of our area.</P>
      <P>Among the measures announced in the budget to tackle long-term unemployment was an initiative whereby some long-term unemployed people taking up work could retain their medical cards for three years.  Perhaps one of the Minister of State sitting opposite will take the opportunity to telephone one of those people to find out if this initiative has worked.  If they are in any doubt about it I ask them to contact the various health authorities which will inform them it is not working.  People who have returned to work have been denied their medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People enjoy the benefits of their medical cards until they are due for renewal.  Those applying for renewal of their medical cards in the Eastern Health Board area must complete an A4 application form on which is recorded the person's name, address, doctor's name and the names of the persons covered by the card.  On the inside of the form the applicant is asked if they <Col N="1174" /> are working or in receipt of social welfare and, if so, they must give the details.</P>
    <P>There is a quick ready reckoner in relation to the guidelines for those entitled to medical cards. The EHB does not intend to make any provision for including an additional question on the form asking if the person has been unemployed in recent years and if they retain their medical card under any initiative.  I understand that because of the costs involved the Eastern Health Board will not be issuing new renewal application forms.</P>
    <P>In regard to medical card renewal applications by persons who availed of the opportunity to return to work in the belief they could retain their cards, if the guidelines indicate they are over the income limit the medical cards are withdrawn. People like myself and other public representatives are then forced to lobby the administrator in the health authority concerned who is frustrated because he or she must operate under the appropriate criteria covering the issuing of medical cards.</P>
    <P>If two applicants for renewal of medical cards are being considered, both of whom are over the income limit, we are now saying to the person deciding on those applications that one of the applicants qualifies for a medical card even though their income is the same as that of the other applicant.  One person qualifies because of this initiative but the other does not.  That initiative is difficult to operate and it will continue to cause problems unless the Government is prepared to fund the necessary redesign of medical card renewal application forms.</P>
    <P>For a considerable period of time people who are now in Government talked about what should and should not be done in the area of child care. Little has been done by those people who are now in a position to deliver.  There has been a huge increase in the number of working couples wishing to avail of créche facilities.  I have a vested interest in this area as both myself and my wife work.  We have three young children and we are paying for appropriate child care facilities. There is a question mark over the regulations applying in this area and the body enforcing them.  The Department of Health is responsible for certain aspects of child care under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Local authorities are responsible for certain aspects of planning under the Planning Acts and other agencies are responsible for other sections such as fire regulations, etc.  It is a cumbersome system, no one is in clear control and there are no proper regulations or guidelines.</P>
    <P>The other concern is the cost of child care.  If either spouse of a married couple with two children is being encouraged back to the workplace after a period of unemployment, no tax allowance is given for the cost of child care or creche facilities.  This is not being considered.  I tabled many questions on this and was fobbed off on each occasion.  I am surprised that the people who now fob me off requested such measures a short time ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I welcome any scheme which allows individuals to obtain employment and feel that they are in the workplace, that they have a challenge and a job to go to.  The community employment scheme may help in this regard and can be beneficial to the community as well.  I am concerned there are abuses in this area whereby people are kept on CE schemes rather than ensuring they enter the workplace proper.  I am not sure if the CE scheme, while providing people with employment initially, is following through.  I have tabled questions about this abuse in relation to FÁS schemes.  I am sure my good friend the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprises and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, has been happy to see my question and equally so when I bring to his attention the amount of money spent on consultancies, etc.  I am concerned that we cannot evalute these schemes on which millions are spent by Departments.  When I ask simple question about how many people are in FÁS schemes, how many have left and how many have secured employment from them, I am told that information is not available.  I cannot understand why there is no system to obtain this information. The Minister for Finance seems to be the only magic man of the 15 Ministers who seems to have a system which works.  We should ask him to devise a system which will evaluate the benefit of these schemes.  It is disappointing and frustrating when one tries to do research by tabling a number of questions hoping to get relevant replies and is then advised it is not possible.  What evaluation or assessment has been done of CE schemes?</P>
    <P>There is huge potential in the apprenticeship area.  It is something which should be seriously considered, evaluated and examined.  A programme should be put in place to ensure we get the maximum benefit from apprenticeships.  It is frustrating for people who enter and serve an apprenticeship, find it unsuitable, request an alternative scheme and are then ineligible because they have already availed of a scheme. A number of people are affected.  I presume the Minister has the discretion and power to take the necessary steps to correct such anomalies.  If he does he would get a lot of assistance from Members who have come across such anomalies. They do not help and they give people no alternative but to go on the live register, become unemployed and perhaps miss a real opportunity to start a career, apprenticeship or trade.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Social Welfare a simple question about CE and other schemes.  I asked the age profile of the total number of unemployed people, the progress, if any, which has been made to reduce the number in the 25 to 34 year old age group and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The statistics are frightening for the age group 20 to 34.  A simple breakdown is: under 20,11,231 males and 8,000 females; 20 to 24, 31,000 males and 21,000 females; 25 to 34, 48,000 males and 30,000 <Col N="1176" /> females.  In the 35 to 44 age group there are 40,000 males and 21,000 females.  Out of a total of 275,000 on the live register, 193,000 are in the age group 20 to 44 and 30,000 places on CE schemes are reserved for those over 21 who have been unemployed for 12 months.  I do not know why eligibility for the scheme is not categorised as per the statistics on the live register.  We should focus on those age groups.  Another aspect of the scheme is that 10,000 places are reserved for those over 35 who have been unemployed for three years.  There is another option of 1,000 places to be provided on a pilot basis for people over 35 and who have been unemployed for five years.  This is poppycock when we have defined age and gender brackets and a greater proportion of those on the live register in the lower age brackets.  We should be focusing, targeting and evaluating the initiatives after a specified period to see what impact they had.  There should be proper evaluation of these schemes and this is what is lacking.</P>
    <P>One area has been brought to my attention, why can those on the live register not be encouraged by Government to do something on a community basis?  If people are signing to say they are available for work, they should be given work.  There is plenty to be done.  There should be some means of putting in place an appropriate scheme or mechanism for people who are genuinely anxious to work, even if it is not their desired work.  They do not want to sit at home and wait for money to be sent to their post office or bank account, they would like to earn the few pounds they get.</P>
    <P>The small businessman is taking huge risks for no reward, and there is no encouragement to gamble his few pounds and create jobs.  There should be some reward for the risks businessmen take.  Listening to the Government parties when they were on this side of the House two years ago, the long-term unemployed would have been very hopeful.  It is disappointing, therefore, that the Government has failed to deliver any real benefit or improvement to that group.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to have Deputies Keaveney and Callely contribute to the debate.  It highlighted the particular circumstances Deputy Keaveney drew to the attention of the House in respect of Buncrana and rural areas while Deputy Callely concentrated on deprivation in the Dublin region. An analysis shows there are large pockets of serious deprivation in the greater Dublin region that did not get their fair share of resources or attention in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the debate has been about the global phenomenon of unemployment.  However, that is not what this report is about.  We are in danger of developing a labour shortage in the kind of skills modern industry requires while at the same time we have a legacy of endemic long-term <Col N="1177" /> unemployment, especially but not exclusively in urban Ireland.</P>
    <P>This report seeks to measure the performance of different instruments introduced by Government to concentrate on that phenomenon of long-term unemployment which is distinctly different from unemployment as we have known it in the past.  It is not correct to say unemployment is rising.  It is transparently the opposite; there was a reduction of about 20,000 over the past two months.  I will come back to that because serious points that ought to be attended to were raised in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this important matter, and the Minister of State for coming here to reply.</P>
      <P>In April of this year, the Eastern Health Board drew up a service plan for the development of services for drug misusers in its health board area and identified the need to provide services for locally based groups seeking a response from the Eastern Health Board for persons requiring treatment in their area.</P>
      <P>One of the areas identified with a very high priority in the plan was the Coolock area.  This need was based on an assessment of information available from parents, community groups, and outreach workers and counsellors that a minimum of 150 people ranging in age from 16 to 25 years required drug treatment services in the Coolock area.</P>
      <P>Meetings and discussions have taken place since then between the health board and community groups involved in drug awareness, particularly in the Darndale-Priorswood area, which have been actively seeking treatment services.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the community groups which have worked tirelessly in an attempt to provide a remedy for the scourge of drug addiction.  These meetings have also been attended by the Garda Síochána in Coolock which is playing a very positive and supportive role in endeavouring to provide treatment services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this work by the community, seven months later there is still no sign of treatment services starting up.  This is a cause of great anger in the Darndale-Priorswood community where a <Col N="1178" /> number of public meetings with huge attendances have been held.  There have also been marches and demonstrations, and there are reports of pressure being put on alleged drug dealers, some of whom are reported to have left the area.  It is imperative that a centre be established in the community to provide treatment services for addicts to help contain the drug addiction problem.</P>
    <P>Efforts made in September last to provide treatment services from the Coolock Health Centre were unsuccessful owing to a number of factors.  The wider Coolock area extends over two Dáil constituencies, Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central.  When the idea of providing treatment services from the Coolock Health Centre was mooted, there was some opposition locally of a parochial nature. Regrettably, the two Fianna Fáil Deputies for Dublin North-Central supported the objectors which effectively blocked any hope of achieving a cross-party and cross-community consensus.  This contrasts sharply with the provision of treatment services from the Kilbarrack Health Centre where there was a united effort by the community and by public representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong, and the Deputy knows it.  There are treatment facilities for Darndale-Belcamp.  A centre has been found.  If the Deputy had any knowledge of what was happening locally he would know that a centre has been found.</P>

      <P>A stage has now been reached in the Coolock area where the Minister for Health must intervene due to the inability of the Eastern Health Board to provide a centre from which to operate a treatment service.  Two chemists in the area are willing to participate in the programme, a general practitioner is available to co-ordinate the treatment service, but the programme cannot commence due to lack of a premises.  The Minister for Health could take this up as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board which has responsibility for the provision of drug treatment services in its area has included in its 1996 drug service development plan a number of proposals, <Col N="1179" /> including the development of a series of local initiatives in various community care areas, including the area of Darndale/Priorswood.  In developing these initiatives the health board has had discussions with representatives of community and resident interests in a number of locations with a view to making a range of locally based facilities available.</P>
      <P>Following extensive consultation with community and resident interests in Darndale and surrounding areas, the board proposes to further develop its drug treatment service in the area.  The service will be for the residents of the Darndale, Belcamp, Moatview area.  It is proposed that the drug services which will be available in the centre will include treatment and counselling and will complement the outreach services already in place.  The outreach services currently provide prevention and education programmes to these areas.  Addiction counselling services are also available in the community care area.  Services provided include individual support and counselling, supply of information to local groups and community work.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the new services provided in the Darndale/Priorswood area will link up with existing voluntary and statutory services in order to provide a more comprehensive service to drug misusers from the area.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Lucan (Dublin) Public Library.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to raise on the Adjournment the issue of the provision of a public library in Lucan, County Dublin.  Lucan is an old village, located at the confluence of the Liffey and Griffeen rivers.  Weirs and mills have been documented at the location since the 14th century and in the 18th and 19th centuries there was substantial industrial development in the course of the first industrial revolution.  The area also became famous as a spa resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, as the Minister of State will be aware, there has been substantial development in <Col N="1180" /> the Lucan district.  Census data of recent years show that in 1986 the population of the three district electoral divisions comprising the Lucan district was 12,998.  At the 1991 census that figure had increased to 14,431 and in the census recorded this year it had increased to 20,172.  In addition, there has been substantial new housing development in the vicinity.  In the last three years over 3,000 houses have been constructed in the Lucan district.</P>
    <P>A site of approximately one acre has been reserved at the Superquinn Shopping Centre for a long period of time for the development of a library.  There is a need for a library service for local cultural community activities, for local historical studies and archives, for general community activities as well as to make information speedily available to individuals and groups.  The public library service review group in its report of 1987 made the point that the establishment of major new town and suburban developments in the Dublin area required, as a matter of urgency, the provision of adequate and proper community services in these areas.  A modern library service, in its view, was an essential focal community service in these new developments and its provision should be given a high priority.</P>
    <P>Lucan has had to wait a long time for a library. I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter earlier in the year and the Minister in his reply stated that the local authority's proposals in relation to this project were approved in principle in November 1992.  The authority was understood to be considering certain revisions to the project before making further submissions to the Department of the Environment.  This week the Minister confirmed that a revised sketch design and cost plan for a branch library in Lucan was received by his Department in September and is being considered but, having regard to the high level of demand for funding for library proposals generally, he could not say when it would be possible to approve the Lucan proposal.</P>
    <P>The site is available.  It is adjacent to the Superquinn shopping centre which is at the heart of much new development and housing construction.  I urge the Minister in the context of the preparation of the annual Estimates to make provision for this development.  It is an area with a population of 20,172 people, a substantial number of households and a long-standing demand.  The Minister should take a these factors into consideration in arriving at a decision to make the necessary funding available for the development of this project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, who is abroad on official business, has asked me to reply to Deputy Lenihan on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister accepts that the public library service is an important cultural network that is of value to both rural and urban dwellers.  It is a service with a long and respected tradition.  The total expenditure in 1996 on the public library <Col N="1181" /> service by local authorities is estimated to be in excess of £32 million.  The Department of the Environment has a capital allocation of £3 million to grant-aid library developments this year.  As with so many other areas of desirable public expenditure, the demand for library infrastructure exceeds the funds available.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for initiating library development proposals rests with library authorities.  For funding purposes, proposals are examined by the Department, in consultation with An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.</P>
    <P>A proposal for a new branch library on a site adjacent to a supermarket development at Esker, Lucan, was given approval in principle by the Department on 2 November 1992.  However, there appears to have been a measure of acceptance by the various interests involved that the priority should be to bring the very fine library project at Tallaght to fruition at that time. The Department completed its funding of the Tallaght library in May of this year at a cost of £2 million.</P>
    <P>Officers of the Department met representatives of South Dublin County Council in May to discuss the Lucan proposal.  The council agreed at that meeting to revise its proposals with a view to reducing construction costs.  The revised proposals were received in the Department at the end of September and are currently being considered.  The total cost of the project is now estimated at over £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated there is a provision of £3 million in the Department of the Environment Estimates for the local authority library programme this year.  This provision is fully committed to projects under construction or already completed.  Heavy commitments are already building up for 1997.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to say when it may be possible to give a firm financial commitment to the funding of the proposed branch library in Lucan.  I will, however, ensure that the points made by the Deputy in favour of the scheme are brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply.  I hope he can give the green light to stage 2 of the Ballina main drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>The preliminary report on stage 2 of the scheme has been with the Department of the Environment since 1992 yet it has not been approved.  Mayo County Council, Ballina UDC, employers, chambers of commerce, builders and developers, the unemployed and the ordinary people of Ballina are more than disappointed that the project has not been approved by the Department, a section of whose operations is based in Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> Ballina has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country, 3,000 unemployed people in a population of 8,000.  An up-to-date advance factory of 25,000 square feet lies idle while other parts of the country appear to have no difficulty in attracting industry.  There is a demand in Ballina for housing, which would provide employment, but this opportunity is stifled because of the failure to extend the sewerage system and make provision for surface water drainage in Ballina.</P>
    <P>Stage 2 of the scheme consists of improvement works to the sewage treatment plant of a minor nature, renewal of old sewerage in the town centre which was not renewed under stage 1, sewerage extension on various roads such as Bonniconlon Road and Church Road, surface water drainage on Killala Road and Church Road and, in the quay area, extension of sewerage to main treatment plant.  The improvement requested would help employment prospects and the environment and prevent pollution of the River Moy, the premier salmon river in Europe.</P>
    <P>Fleadh na hÉireann will be held in Ballina in 1997.  It is a great honour for the town.  Approval of the scheme would represent money well spent.  The Dáil discussed unemployment today and this is an opportunity to create employment and improve the infrastructure in Mayo.  The Western Development Board has highlighted the lack of infrastructure in Mayo as well as the causes of unemployment.  I urge the Minister to approve phase 2 of Ballina main drainage scheme and give the town a chance for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballina has a relatively new secondary waste water treatment plant, as well as two main sewer networks east and west of the River Moy.  The scheme came into operation about ten years ago and has capacity for a population equivalent of 20,000.</P>
      <P>A preliminary report for stage 2 of the scheme was received in the Department of the Environment in July 1992.  The proposal, costing an estimated £4.5 million, provided for the improvement of the existing foul and storm water sewers in the town centre as well as surface water collection systems for the Killala and Swinford Road areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moffatt will know there are many competing demands on the resources available for water and sewerage schemes both within the county of Mayo and the country generally.  With a view to addressing the most urgent of the sewerage needs of the town of Ballina, the Department requested Mayo County Council to prioritise the various elements of the proposal outlined in the preliminary report.  In June the council submitted a priority list of works for Ballina costing some £3.2 million.  This is being examined in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo is a big county, with substantial water and sewerage requirements to meet the needs of industry and tourism especially.  Nobody can <Col N="1183" /> argue that the county is not getting its fair share of the overall investment in environmental infrastructure.  Last year, the Department of the Environment provided some £10.6 million for such projects and a further estimated £9 million will be spent in the current year.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's concern to have the Ballina scheme advanced as soon as possible. Having regard to the existing high level of commitments under the water and sewerage schemes programme, it is not possible to advance the scheme at this stage.  I will ensure that the Minister is made fully aware of the concerns expressed by the Deputy that the scheme should be advanced at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As a Mayoman, I will advance the points made by Deputy Moffatt.  He will be aware that during a period when another Mayoman, based in Castlebar, was Minister for the Environment, Mayo did particularly well.  Ballina did not benefit to the same extent but we will try to rectify that as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Muslim community in Ireland is now 7,000 strong.  Today is a day of historical importance to that community with the opening by the President, Mary Robinson, of the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh which is in my constituency.</P>
      <P>In the grounds in which the cultural centre is situated there is a thriving and expanding primary school which is the only Islamic primary school in the country.  This school has 206 pupils and seven teachers.  Many of the children attending it are Irish citizens and were born in Ireland.  It also has a substantial number of children born outside the State who are now resident in Ireland with their parents.  All the pupils have at least one parent who does not speak English as a first language and nearly 60 per cent of the children do not speak English as their main language at home. Some children have very little English and a number of pupils are in urgent need of remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>At the end of the last academic year the number of children, born abroad, attending the school was 83.  The number of children with two foreign parents was 107.  The number of children with only one foreign parent was 62.</P>
      <P>Early in 1996 the school sought sanction from the Department of Education for two additional teachers, one an English language teacher and the second a remedial teacher.  The special needs and requirements of the school were fully explained and I made representations to the Minister for Education last spring asking her to sanction the appointment of these two additional teachers at the commencement of the new academic year in September 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> On 29 March 1996 the Minister in response to my representations simply noted my request for an additional English language teacher and a remedial teacher and promised that &ldquo;a further letter will issue to you as soon as possible&rdquo;.  Since then I have heard nothing further from the Minister or her Department and no additional teaching staff have been sanctioned for the school.  The additional two teachers sought for the start of the academic year in September 1996 were not made available.</P>
    <P>The objective of this school is to provide a comprehensive primary education for pupils coming from diverse backgrounds, a multiplicity of countries, many of whom have limited English linguistic abilities.  The school is striving to provide for them an education which both reflects their cultural and religious background and heritage and enables them to form part of the larger general community of this State.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that the special needs of these children are not being provided for by the Department of Education.  Sanction should be given through recruitment by the school of the additional teaching staff so urgently required by it to enable the staff to commence work in the school after the Christmas vacation period.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that I received no further communication from the Department of Education since March 1996 on this issue.  I am not quite sure of the meaning of the words &ldquo;a further letter will issue to you as soon as possible&rdquo;.  I had expected it would be sooner than now.  I regret it has been necessary to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  It is appropriate that I raise it today as the President, Mary Robinson, not only opened the new cultural centre, but visited the school complex, as I did.  I ask the Minister for Education to urgently address the school's needs and requirements and to provide the extra teaching staff, so badly needed, so that they are in place for the commencement of the next school term after the Christmas vacation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this important matter.  I draw his attention to the manner in which the staffing allocation of primary schools is determined.  The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing which has been entered into between the Government and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the Muslim national school on 30 September 1995 was 174 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and five assistant teachers for the 1996-7 school year. Earlier this year, an additional assistant teacher was sanctioned at the school because it achieved developing school status.  The school attained developing school status because it increased its enrolment by more than 25 pupils.  The school's current enrolment is 203 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The managerial authorities of the school sought the appointment of a special language <Col N="1185" /> teacher and a remedial teacher to overcome specific language difficulties at the school arising as a result of the diverse ethnic background of many of the school's pupils.  Unfortunately, existing resources available to the Department of Education do not permit the sanctioning of these additional posts.  The needs of this school will be sympathetically considered by the Department as soon as additional resources become available.</P>
    <P>Officials within the Department are exploring the possibility of organising a course for the teaching staff of the school on the methodology of teaching English as a second language, similar <Col N="1186" /> to a course arranged for those teaching the children of migrant workers.  The course would be organised by the staff of the in-career development unit within the Department.  The Minister is confident that such a course would prove helpful to the teaching staff in assisting them to overcome many of the difficulties being experienced at the school.</P>
    <P>I will bring to the attention of the Minister the strong case made by the Deputy on this issue and the matter of the delay in correspondence.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 November 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7, 60 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community contains more than 160 separate recommendations relating to education and training of travellers.  The recommendations are very wide-ranging and span the full spectrum of educational provision from pre-school to adult education.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the report in July 1995, the Government established an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of Equality and Law Reform, and including representatives of all Departments with an involvement in the area, to consider the feasibility of implementing the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The working group reported earlier this year. The recommendations which have implications for my Department are now being pursued.  The report of the task force recommended that additional posts be allocated to the visiting teacher service for travellers.  The House will be aware that I have recently announced my decision to allocate a further three teachers to this service in the current year.  These posts will be advertised shortly.</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that responsibility for senior traveller training centres, which cater for 15 to 25 year old travellers, be transferred from the Department of Enterprise and Employment to the Department of Education.  Agreement in principle has already been reached on this issue and my Department is working on the detailed arrangements for the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the interdepartmental group concluded that the co-ordination of the delivery of education services for travellers could best be addressed by creating a special committee in my Department which would consult with the various interest groups, including traveller organisations. <Col N="1188" /> This committee has now been formed and will hold its first meeting within the next week.</P>
    <P>My commitment to the future development of education services for travelling people is set out clearly in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future.  My aim, as set out in the White Paper, is to promote the full and inclusive participation of travellers at all levels of the education system.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, I am committed to developing initiatives to facilitate participation by mature students and part-time students in third level education within available resources. A number of measures in recent years have benefited mature students: improvements have been made in the student support arrangements to extend them to mature students and to enable these students to be assessed on their own means; mature students also benefit from the free fees initiative and from the provisions allowing tax relief on fees for certain third level courses and there are also special arrangements to enable mature students to train as primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority, in co-operation with third level institutions, is promoting the co-ordinated development of a system of modular course structures and related credit transfer arrangements.  Such flexibility in course structures has the potential to facilitate access and enable mature and part-time students to study for qualifications while remaining in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education was asked to examine the participation levels of mature students in higher education.  The committee identified certain difficulties for these students and made a number of recommendations which it felt would alleviate these difficulties.  The Higher Education Authority is currently considering proposals from the universities for funding in regard to mature students in the context of the report of the steering committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also recommended that mature students as a proportion of full-time entrants to third level education should be progressively increased from a level of about 1,000 full-time students in 1993-94 to 2,200 by the year 2000. Over 6,200 additional university places will be created by the year 2000 by the joint private sector-Exchequer £60 million capital initiative. Over the same period, a further 1,000 places will be created in the regional technical college-DIT sector with the establishment of the first phases of <Col N="1189" /> Dún Laoghaire Regional Technical College and Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute with funding from the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund programme.  The creation of these additional third level places by the end of the century will enable mature student intake to third level to increase.</P>

      <P>A number of proposals for the provision of a 50 metre pool are currently under consideration in my Department.

      <P>The priority for the provision of a 50 metre pool is being examined by the sport strategy group which is due to report before the end of the year.

      <P>I must emphasise that the criteria used in selecting schools for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself were devised and carried out by the Education Research Centre following detailed consideration of a range of indicators of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In the case of the rural phase of the initiative, the centre concluded that the initiative should focus on schools with fewer than five teachers and whose proximity to each other was such as to create a cluster which can reasonably be served by one locally-based co-ordinator.  Unfortunately, on the basis of these criteria, Ballyconneely national school was not selected by the centre for inclusion in the initiative.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in May 1996, I launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that a more targeted approach to tackling disadvantage be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The studies also concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population.  In <Col N="1191" /> this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>In the case of urban schools, the focus was on schools which already had disadvantaged area status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The second element of the initiative focused on schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and which have concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the school system.  Unfortunately, based on staffing and enrolment, the school referred to by the Deputy was not eligible to apply for inclusion under the new initiative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 41 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 232 child care assistants are currently in place in special schools and special classes throughout the country.  A further 56 child care assistants have been allocated to schools participating in the early start pre-school pilot project.</P>
      <P>The precise number of children currently in receipt of child care assistant support is not readily available to my Department.  The posts in question are generally allocated to special schools and special classes to address the needs of groups of children with disabilities.  The extent to which individual children in a special school or class require the services of a child care assistant will depend on the nature of the child's disability and is usually determined by school management in consultation with my Department's inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> I am arranging to forward the specific details sought by Deputy Ahern as soon as possible. Child care assistant posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  The key consideration is the nature and level of need of the individual children.  My capacity to allocate child care assistant posts in any year is determined by resource availability in that year and the level of competing demand in other special needs areas. At present I have no proposals to allocate further child care assistant posts to schools, including the school mentioned by Deputy Ahern.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 16, 20, 22, 29, 38, 48, 49 and 57 together.  In 1993 I established a scheme of annual grants to assist management bodies of primary schools in their work.  Four management bodies are assisted, namely, the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán Ghaeilge and Educate Together.  The scheme assists management bodies to defray administrative costs arising from items such as mail issues, organisation of seminars and meetings, reserch and publications.</P>
      <P>The amount of the grant payable to each management body is related to the number of schools represented by each.  In the case of Educate Together, an annual grant of £1,000 was paid each year from 1993 to 1995.  In 1996 the level of grant to Educate Together was increased by 100 per cent bringing its annual grant to £2,000.</P>

      <P>I recently received the submission from TARGET to which the Deputy refers and it is receiving consideration in my Department.  A response will be issued as soon as possible.  I am aware that there is a significant literacy problem in this country.</P>
      <P>My commitment to develop and enhance the programmes in place to address adult literacy and numeracy problems and adult education in general is reflected both in the policy measures proposed in the White Paper and the substantial additional funding provided in recent years to support these services.</P>
      <P>In regard to young children I should point out that fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. There are currently 1,188 remedial teachers in the primary sector.  Some 87 per cent of primary school pupils have access to a remedial teacher service.  My intention for the present is to continue concentration of available resources on the development of school-based strategies for children with specific learning disability.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> An evaluation of the programme was carried out by my Department's inspectorate in 1995.

My Department also holds regular meetings with the Department of Health and the child abuse prevention programme team to discuss and evaluate the programme.</P>
    <P>A nationwide network of 40 teachers, capable of supporting the programme on a part-time basis, has been put in place.  The network is targeting, in particular, those schools which currently are not teaching the programme.  Parent education continues to be a primary focus together with meeting the continuing in-service needs of teachers.</P>
    <P>A modified version of the Stay Safe Programme has been prepared for use in special schools and a programme of training for teachers in these schools is now under way.

      <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education reported in July 1995.  In relation to Waterford Regional Technical College the steering committee concluded that the upgrading and expansion of the Waterford Regional Technical College represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south east region.  The committee noted the high level of potential demand for degree level places, combined with a level of participation at that level below the national average.  In the circumstances, it considered that it would be appropriate that a major element of the expansion of the regional technical college would be at degree level while still maintaining the thrust of its activities at technical level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering committee accordingly recommended provision to be made in the medium-term for an increase in the total number <Col N="1196" /> of places from the 1994-95 level of some 3,500 to about 5,000, based on an increase in intake from about 1,260 to 1,700 and the major focus of expansion to be at degree level, with the percentage of award recipients who terminate in a given year with a degree increasing from a current 22 per cent of total to 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>The committee considered that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other regional technical colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
    <P>The committee was satisfied that these measures, combined with the proposed change of title to Regional Institute of Technology, should provide the necessary status and capacity for Waterford Regional Technical College to meet the higher education needs of the region over the next five years, within whatever overall constraints on expansion of higher education which may apply nationally.</P>
    <P>Current numbers in Waterford Regional Technical College are 4,457 full-time students, which is close to the level recommended by the steering committee.  Expansion at degree level is proceeding.  In the 1996-97 academic year there are 1,562 students attending degree level courses. In relation to a change of title for Waterford and the other regional technical colleges, my Department has consulted with the colleges and their responses are at present being considered.</P>

      <P>Tá sé i gceist freagra a thabhairt ar Cheisteanna Uimh. 27, 30 agus 61 le chéile.</P>
      <P>D'eascair na critéir ar baineadh úsáid astu i roghnú na scoileanna i gceantair faoi mhí-bhuntáise i dtionscnamh &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; as taighde a rinne an Foras Taighde ar Oideachas tar éis dóibh réimse leathan táscairí a mheá. Freisin, riaraigh an foras an próiseas trínar aithníodh scoileanna an tionscnaimh.</P>
      <P>I dtaca le gné tuaithe an tionscnaimh de, mhol an Foras Taighde go ndíreofaí na hacmhainní ar ghrúpaí scoileanna le fóirne níos lú ná cúigear oide a bheadh comhgarach go leor dá chéile chun comhaobriú lena chéile agus chun go bhfreastalódh comhordaitheoir amháin ar a riachtanais go héifeachtach.  Ní fhéadfaí na scoileanna a luann an Teachta a chur san áireamh ar bhonn na gcritéar seo.</P>
      <P>Tá tacaíocht shainiúil do riachtanais scoileanna tuaithe i gceantair faoi mhí-bhuntáiste sa raon acmhainní atá á chur ar fáil do na scoileanna sa ghné seo den tionscnamh.  Cheap an bhuíon oibre san Fhoras Taighde an raon acmhainní tar éis dóibh mion-staidéar a dhéanamh ar mhí-bhuntáiste oideachasúil mar a shonraítear i gceantair tuaithe é.  I gcomhthéacs na hachmhainní a bhí ar fáil don dá ghné den tionscnamh seo chun timthriail an mhí-bhuntáiste a bhriseadh agus ag cur méid na scoileanna tuaithe a bhí i gceist san áireamh, beartaíodh nach gcuirfí an cóimheas múinteoirí is daltaí 1:15 i bhfeidhm i gcás na scoileanna tuaithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bunaíodh na critéir ar baineadh úsáid astu i roghnú na scoileanna ar thoscaí i gcúlra sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta na ndaltaí.  Aithníodh na toscaí sin trí thaighde náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta mar tháscairí mí-bhuntáiste oideachasúil. <Col N="1199" /> Cuirtear an caighdeán oideachais a shroich tuismitheoirí na ndaltaí san áireamh sna critéir. Léiríonn an taighde go bhfuil tionchar suntasach ag tuismitheoirí ar chumas a bpáistí labhairt agus léitheoireacht teanga a fhorbairt i gceart agus go bhfuil gaol láidir ag caighdeán oideachais tuismitheoirí leis an bhforbairt sin.  Mheas an Foras Taighde, áfach, nár chóir go gcuirfí deacrachtaí ar leith le foghlaim teanga a tharlaíonn neamhspleách ar mhí-bhuntáise eacnamaíoch agus soisialta san áireamh sna critéir áirithe i gcás an tionscnaimh seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with this important issue on a number of occasions in this House in response to Deputies' questions.  To provide a maintenance grants scheme for PLC students along the lines, for example, of the third level scheme would cost in excess of £10 million per annum.  I am sure the House will appreciate that a balance has to be struck between competing demands for resources in the education sector between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement.</P>
      <P>In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme developments, in in-service training in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.  My Department will provide over £35 million this year towards the running costs of such courses, and I have abolished fees for PLC courses with effect from 1995-96.  Due to overall resource constraints I am unable to provide maintenance grants for PLC students.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The allocation of posts to primary gaelscoileanna is determined by reference to a schedule which differs from that used for allocating posts to mainstream primary schools.  The effect of the differential staffing schedules is that the pupil-teacher ratio in gaelscoileanna is more favourable than that which applies to mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>In applying a different schedule to gaelscoileanna, I am continuing a practice which has been in operation for many years.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that I am committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in mainstream primary schools generally.  In this context, since taking office I have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio from 25.2:1 to 22.9:1 in the 1995-96 school year.  It is expected that the pupil-teacher ratio will be further reduced to approximately 22.5:1 in the present school year.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the ongoing demands for increased funding from primary and second level schools. However, I must point out that, notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, since becoming Minister for Education, I have been able to secure significant increase in funding for both primary and second level schools.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the day-to-day running costs of schools through capitation grants.  Since 1992 I have been able to increase the capitation rate for primary schools from a level of £28 per pupil in 1992 to £45 per pupil in 1996.  This amounts to an increase of 60 per cent over the period in question.  Furthermore, I have introduced special higher rates of grant for schools serving areas which are designated as disadvantaged.  The rate of grant for such schools currently stands at £75 per pupil.</P>
      <P>A local contribution of £10 per pupil, or £9.50 in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged, complements the capitation grant. These rates represent a freezing of the local contribution for 1996 at its 1995 level.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have increased by 18 per cent the capitation rate for voluntary secondary schools from £150 in 1992 to £177 in 1996.  In January 1994 I provided an additional capitation grant of £15 per pupil to schools designated as disadvantaged.  This additional grant was increased to £30 from January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Corresponding increases have also been made to the budgets of the vocational education <Col N="1202" /> committees and community and comprehensive schools.  I have also provided substantial support towards the provision of secretarial and caretaking services at primary and second levels.</P>
    <P>Contributions from parents and other sources are not compulsory but, where they are available on a genuinely voluntary basis, they are a welcome addition to school resources.  The manner in which such contributions are collected is a matter for school authorities.  It should be emphasised, however, that the manner of such collection should not create a situation where parents and pupils can reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. The Deputy can be assured that the funding of education at both primary and second level is the subject of ongoing review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The approved allocation of Youthreach places for Cork City Vocational Education Committee and County Cork Vocational Education Committee is 75 and 80, respectively.  Requests for additional places for these vocational education committees are at present under consideration in the context of the expansion of the programme from 2,000 to 2,450 places.  I expect that a decision will be made on this matter shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department, as part of its ongoing review of the operation of the Youthreach programme and having regard to evaluation reports, is seeking to implement a more integrated approach at local level to the allocation of all additional places within the programme.  This approach seeks to ensure that there will, as far as possible, be complementarity with the activities of other agencies in this field and with the plans of the local area based partnerships under the local, urban and rural development programme.</P>
      <P>As part of this new process, vocational education committees have been requested to consult all relevant local interests, statutory and non-statutory, and to present an action plan for their area aimed at redressing identified deficiencies in provision for early school leavers.</P>
      <P>In this context, vocational education committees have been requested to pay particular attention to piloting new arrangements for progression for trainees to higher levels of training and to arrangements for groups with special needs, for example, lone parents and young offenders.</P>

      <P>My Department employs a total of 37 inspectors of guidance-psychologists.  Psychological and guidance inspection services have been provided to second level schools for a number of years.  In 1990 four psychologists were appointed to work on a pilot project in primary schools.  A further ten psychologists were appointed in 1995 to initiate a Department of Education psychological service for primary schools.  These are assigned, as a matter of priority, to schools serving disadvantaged areas. Any expansion of this service will take place as resources permit in the context of Government decisions on public sector numbers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 56 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The embargo to which the Deputy refers was a general public sector recruitment embargo which affected a range of services in 1995, including the visiting teacher service for travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this embargo has not been retained in respect of the service in question.  Indeed, I have recently announced the allocation of an additional three teachers to the visiting teacher service for <Col N="1204" /> travellers as part of a wider allocation of extra posts to special needs areas in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that as well as recommending the appointment of additional visiting teachers, the Task Force on the Travelling Community also recommended the establishment of a traveller education unit within my Department to ensure a co-ordinated delivery of education services for travellers.  An interdepartmental committee which considered the task force recommendations concluded that this objective could best be achieved by establishing a committee in my Department representing the various sections involved in traveller education.</P>
    <P>This committee has now been formed and, as part of its work, it will consult with all interested groups, including traveller groups, on matters relating to traveller education.  I would suggest that, in the first instance, the discussions to which Deputy Flaherty refers would best be conducted in this forum.</P>

      <P>In the case of the 13 exclusively multi-denominational schools established since 1978, no minimum level of overall enrolment, or of junior infant enrolment, was laid down for the granting of official recognition.  Rather, the growth potential of the applicant schools was determined by my Department on the basis of a detailed examination of each application.  The question of granting permanent recognition was considered in the light of each school's development after a number of years of operation, at which stage it would have been possible to project ultimate size and, consequently, the amount of State aided accommodation to be provided.</P>
      <P>More recently, however, as a result of significant demographic decline, my concern to ensure the viability of all applicant schools has increased considerably.  This was a major factor in my decision to establish the Commission on School Accommodation Needs, whose task it will be to draw up detailed criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.  I will consider what specific conditions may be required in the case of new multi-denominational schools in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that an action plan for the implementation of the White Paper proposals is currently being prepared in my Department. Among the issues being addressed in the plan is the White Paper commitment to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> I am not in a position at present to provide a precise timescale for the implementation of the measures which were set out in the White Paper. While I would be anxious to advance matters as speedily as possible, I must have regard to the realities of resource availability and the need to proceed on a basis and at a pace which has the support of the partners in Education.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some parties involved with literacy have criticised elements of the Education White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; relating to the extent of the literacy problem.  I would, however, emphasise that the White Paper identifies the policy priority in adult education as being to ensure that suitable and effective programmes are in place to enable adults to overcome literacy and numeracy problems.  I am also aware that there is a significant literacy problem in this country.</P>
      <P>My commitment to develop and enhance the programmes in place to address adult literacy and numeracy problems and adult education in general is reflected both in the policy measures proposed in the White Paper and the substantial additional funding provided in recent years to support these services.</P>

      <P>A total of four young persons are currently on temporary release under licence from the residential special schools for young offenders. Such releases are specifically provided for under the Children Act, 1908, which governs the operation of these schools.  The temporary release mechanism facilitates the phased reintegration of offenders back into society as they approach the end of their committal period.</P>
      <P>In considering a young person for release under licence, the special school must be satisfied that the person is suitable having regard to factors such as whether the person has developed the appropriate social skills; whether the person has a stable home or other residential placement to go to; whether a suitable educational placement, training course or job has been secured for the person and whether the person has a satisfactory record with any previous home leave.</P>
      <P>Such releases are planned in advance and form an integral part of the overall care and rehabilitation programme developed for each person placed in the special schools.  Where the conditions of the licence are breached, the licence is automatically revoked and the person is returned to the school to serve the remainder of the sentence.  It is also open to the school to revoke the licence at any time.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied with the outcome of the selection procedure used in the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  I am also satisfied that the Education Research Centre took all relevant data supplied by the schools themselves fully into account when selecting schools for inclusion in the scheme.  I <Col N="1209" /> have no proposals to change the selection procedures used.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the selection procedure to which she refers was devised by the Education Research Centre following detailed studies of educational disadvantage by the centre itself and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>Each applicant school was invited by the Education Research Centre to provide data relating to the pupils in its intake class under a range of objective criteria.  The criteria in question had been devised by the centre in consultation with the Combat Poverty Agency. The Education Research Centre selected schools for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of the data submitted by the schools themselves.</P>
      <P>I can readily understand that individual schools may be disappointed because they were not included in this very important initiative.  I can assure the Deputy that had more resources been available, I would have been happy to include additional schools in the scheme.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education I must operate within available resources and in doing so must have regard to the many other competing demands across the entire special needs area.  In the circumstances, the very considerable resources which I am deploying under the Breaking the Cycle initiative provide concrete evidence of my commitment to the children in question.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to make it clear that the criteria under which schools were selected for participation in this scheme and the selection process itself were devised and carried out entirely by the Education Research Centre.  I am satisfied that my decision to ask the centre to undertake this task was fully justified given the complexity of the issues involved and the recognised expertise of the centre and the Combat Poverty Agency in this area.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.  New regulations, which will give effect to the provisions of Part VII, will come into operation <Col N="1211" /> before the end of this year.  These regulations will apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, créches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.  A draft of the proposed regulations was recently made available to the public to enable individuals or organisations to make written submissions in relation to them.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will have an impact across the various sectors involved in pre-school provision ranging from the voluntary provision for disadvantaged children through to full day care provision in the commercial sector.</P>
      <P>A working group was established earlier this year within my Department to prepare draft guidelines on standards for pre-school services. These guidelines will form the basis of the regulations to be made under Part VII of the Act. The group is representative of my Department, the Department of Education, the health boards, the DHSS in Northern Ireland and a number of voluntary organisations which are involved in pre-school provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the costs involved for service providers in complying with the new regulations.  Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being atrisk or disadvantaged.  This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and <Col N="1212" /> provision of family support services.  This policy of supporting certain pre-school services will continue in the future and may include financial assistance to upgrade premises for these services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would like to inform the Deputy that the health allocation of national lottery funds for 1996 is £22.084 million.  This includes £4 million which forms part of the funding for the capital programme.  Of the remaining £18.084 million a total of £13.064 million is committed to fund ongoing services administered by health boards or by bodies which have a close relationship with my Department.  A further £3.340 million is allocated to health agencies to fund the respite care grants scheme and the schemes of grants to voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware a limited amount of discretionary funding is available to me from the proceeds of the national lottery.  The original amount available for 1996 is £1,680,000.  A total of £1,595,800 has been allocated todate, leaving an amount of £84,200 available from the original allocation.  I will, in the near future, decide on the disbursement of the unallocated sum.</P>

      <P>Hunting on State-owned foreshore, State-owned lakes and other accretions belonging to the State is regulated under section 30 of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The total number of section 30 permits issued each year from 1990 to 1996 is as follows: 1990, 504; 1991, 365; 1992, 293; 1993, 457; 1994, 490; 1995, 606; 1996, 562 (to date).</P>
      <P>As many permits are for multiple areas and for periods of up to five years, it is not practicable to give details of the permits issued in respect of particular lakes.  Permits may be issued to individuals or gun clubs which submit applications and it is not the practice to publish names of individual permit holders.</P>
      <P>A list of lakes considered as State-owned in the context of section 30 permits follows as Appendix I.  Permits are currently issued in respect of 31 of those lakes.  While the legal title to these lakes may be disputed in some cases, responsibility for the conservation of wildlife on State-owned lakes rests with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.  Other Departments, local authorities and State bodies have various responsibilities for diverse matters relating to these lakes.</P>
      <P>My Department has no plans at present to develop State lakes nor are there plans to sell them.  The Central Fisheries Board has made a proposal to the NPWS to lease a number of these lakes for the development of fisheries and this is under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>Tóghfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 agus 89 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The number of tourist shooters who visited this country in each of the years from 1990 to 1996 is reflected in the number of firearm certificates which were issued to non-residents for each of these years.  The provision of such details is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to (1) the criteria used in granting shooting days, (2) the way in which the carrying capacity of different lands is calculated (3) whether folio numbers or titles are checked and (4) the supervision of tourist shooters, the position is that commercial shoot operators are required to submit details of their shooting rights to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department so that these can be assessed to determine the &ldquo;gunday&rdquo; carrying capacity of the lands in question and hunting licences are granted with reference to these assessments.  Each application is considered on its merits.  Applicants must satisfy the NPWS that they have permission of the landowner to shoot. In some cases, at the discretion of the regional manager, checking of permissions may include checking of folio numbers.  For more information on these matters I refer the Deputy to the Official Reports as follows: (a) 11 May 1994, Volume 442 No. 6, columns 1255-1258; (b) 31 May 1994, <Col N="1219" /> Volume 443 No. 4, columns 779-781; (c) 24 April 1995, Volume 451 No. 8, columns 1818-1820; (d) 14 February 1996, Volume 461 No. 5, columns 1297-1301; and (e) 20 February 1996, Volume 461 No. 7, column 1892.</P>
    <P>Complaints received by the NPWS are investigated and, where appropriate, prosecution proceedings are initiated under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Details of the number of complaints are not available but I have directed the NPWS to record details of all specific written complaints made as and from 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to publish details of individual visitors or of commercial shoot operators and/or their clients as such information is considered personal and commercially sensitive.</P>
    <P>With regard to my policy on tourist shooting, I made a presentation to a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on 20 February last.  The presentation outlined the general background on the conservation of game species, particularly migratory species, and set out the procedure for issuing hunting licences to non-resident hunters.  I am arranging to have a copy of my presentation forwarded to the Deputy. Neither I nor my Department has had discussions with Bord Fáilte regarding tourist shooting in recent years.  Both I and my Department have had a number of meetings with the National Association of Regional Game Councils and the NPWS have met various regional game councils and gun clubs.</P>
    <P>The number of &ldquo;gundays&rdquo; allocated for each of the last four hunting seasons is set out below.  The figures for 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 are not available.</P>

    <P>The teacher allocation for the County Meath Vocational Education Committee for the 1996-97 school year includes an allocation of 0.2 wholetime teacher equivalents in respect of guidance in St. Fintina's post-primary school.  An <Col N="1227" /> additional ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance for this school is not warranted at this time.</P>
    <P>I understand that an allocation has also been made to the school in respect of pastoral care. The question of allocating further teaching resources to the school from within the overall approved teacher allocation for the vocational education committee scheme is a matter for the Chief Executive Officer of the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of allocating a resources post to the school, the position is that in 1995 I allocated 56 resource posts to second level schools to cater for the needs of handicapped pupils.  The posts were allocated on the basis of information supplied by individual schools on a specially designed application form.</P>
    <P>It was not possible to allocate a post to St. Fintina's school on that occasion.  However, the position of the school will be considered when next it is possible to allocate additional resource posts.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for school transport is determined by age and distance from the child's residence to the nearest appropriate school.</P>
      <P>Having reached the age of ten, the child in question is no longer eligible for free transport since she lives less than three miles from her school.</P>
      <P>Concessionary fare-paying transport may be allowed to ineligible pupils after all eligible pupils have been catered for and subject to accommodation being available on the bus.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I understand that there are no places available on the bus at present.</P>
      <P>The operation of the school transport scheme is currently being examined by the school review committee, which I expect will be in a position to report to me very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 29 November 1984, the Department recommended to County Dublin Vocational Education Committee that it should take the initial action to deal with the vacancy in the post of chief executive officer expected to occur on 31 August, 1985 and contact should be made with the Local Appointments Commission as early as possible.  Subsequently, in view of the Minister for Environment's proposals for local government reorganisation for the Dublin area, the Department informed the LAC in March 1985 that it no longer favoured the filling of the vacancy in a permanent capacity.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the filling of a chief executive officer vacancy resides with each vocational education committee subject to the approval of the Minister for Education.  Prior to June 1995, procedures for the filling of a chief executive officer vacancy on an acting basis were a matter for the committee concerned and the arrangements, including those relating to notification and advertising of the position, varied in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that in keeping with this practice the Department did not write to the vocational education committee outlining procedures relating to the filling of the position nor was any letter issued to County Dublin Vocational Education Committee giving permission to set in train the process of filling the acting chief executive officer position.  Sanction was given for the appointment of Mr. Jerry Cronin as acting chief executive officer of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee by letter dated <Col N="1233" /> 20 August 1985.  Ms Gemma Hussey was Minister for Education at the time.</P>
    <P>I understand that during the five years prior to his appointment, Mr. Cronin held the positions of Education Officer of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, special adviser to the then Minister for Education and temporary acting chief executive officer of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>In June 1995, I decided that the procedures for the filling of future chief executive officer vacancies on an acting basis should be standardised.  The revised arrangements include a requirement in relation to the public advertisement of each post and a competitive interview process.  These procedures have been adhered to in the eight acting appointments which have been sanctioned by me since July 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>I have already given a full report to the House on the outcome of the Garda inquiries in this extradition case.</P>
      <P>My reply to the Deputy's question of 21 May, 1996 as reported at columns 1665 to 1667 of the Official Report indicated that the outcome of the Garda inquiries in this matter was that the original warrant was mislaid by the gardaí and that the only explanation was that it was destroyed accidentally when copies of the warrant were being made.</P>
      <P>I also made a comprehensive statement to the House on this matter on 23 May, 1996.</P>
      <P>As regards Question No. 128, in the light of the exceptional circumstances of this case, I informed the House in the course of my statement on 23 May, 1996 that the warrant in question was endorsed and available for execution.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the warrant will be executed, when appropriate, following the conclusion of court proceedings in this jurisdiction against the subject of the warrant. The present position regarding those proceedings is that, following the granting of an injunction by the High Court on 13 November, 1996 which prevented the proceedings from being heard in the Special Criminal Court on that date, the accused is remanded in custody to appear before the Special Criminal Court on 14 January, 1997.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>This woman was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 31 October last for failing to comply with a court order made in the context of a dispute between neighbours over a boundary wall.  I understand that the committal order was issued by the Circuit Civil Court and that the matter had been the subject of at least one earlier court hearing.  I do not have the authority to intervene in a contempt of court committal of this type.  A person is committed to the charge of the Governor until such time as the contempt is purged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woman referred to by the Deputy was <Col N="1236" /> attended by a medical officer in the prison.  The General Prison Regulations, 1953 stipulate that &ldquo;when the medical officer considers the life of a contempt of court prisoner to be endangered by confinement, a report of the fact shall at once be made direct to the court under whose order such a prisoner is confined.&rdquo;  In this case the medical officer did not make such a report.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I can assure the Deputy that all relevant matters, including the age and state of health of the person in custody, are borne in mind by prison staff in their daily management and care of prisoners, all of whom have access to a wide range of medical and related facilities.</P>

      <Quest>if it is possible to relocate the social welfare officials administering the lone parent's benefit for Dublin lone parents back to Dublin in view of the delays in returning lone parents' books when lone parents take up or change employment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course, where lone parent payments have to be adjusted to take account of changes in circumstances, clients are not asked by the Department to return the books until all the necessary information is received.  After all information is received and processed, clients are then advised to return their book as soon as the last relevant payable order is cashed.  These returned books are readily identifiable for immediate processing and a new book at the correct rate is normally issued to the client's post office in time for the next pay day.</P>
      <P>Where lone parents return their books for adjustment otherwise than on request, inquiries are carried out by the Department as quickly as possible.  In case where a lone parent has taken up employment, a revised decision as to entitlement is required.  Every effort is made to keep this decision process time to a minimum.</P>
      <P>At present the Department is carrying out a major reassessment of over 11,000 lone parent allowance claims.  This intensive review work, due for completion in December, is causing some temporary delay in making revised decisions where lone parent circumstances have changed, but this factor will no longer apply when the new one parent family payment commences in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, however, the level of service being provided by the Department to lone parents nationwide is satisfactory.  Positive feedback, both from independent surveys of clients and from relevant interest groups, supports this.  Apart from the decentralised head office in Sligo, the Department's local offices in Dublin and around the country are also available if a lone parent or other client needs personal assistance or has a particular claim, query or problem.  Accordingly, <Col N="1238" /> I do not see a need to re-locate the administration of the lone parent's allowance to Dublin for Dublin-based clients.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, one of my priorities has been to improve the quality of services my Department provides to farmers.  The launch of the Charter of Rights for Farmers in April 1995 was a clear expression of that commitment.</P>
      <P>In each of my Department's main local offices, information is available on all schemes operated through our veterinary, livestock and farm development services.  These are the schemes of primary interest to the farming community.  One of the commitments in the Charter of Rights for Farmers was that an information desk staffed by specifically trained staff would be established at each main local office through which individuals could receive information on all schemes operated by the Department.  The necessary accommodation and telephone improvements to effect this are being carried out and work on an integrated computer facility is well advanced. Due to industrial relations difficulties with the main clerical union, the CPSU, the deployment of specifically trained staff has not proceeded as planned.  These difficulties are being addressed in the context of restructuring discussions taking place between the Department of Finance and the union.  Every effort is being made to resolve the matter to allow the introduction of this facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the recent 2 per cent revaluation of Ireland's agricultural conversion rate depends on the extent to which the various support mechanisms affected by the revaluation will be used over any given period of time.  Other market factors also influence returns to producers and it is difficult to isolate the effects of any single factor.</P>
      <P>It is possible, therefore, to give only qualified estimates of the possible losses to the various sectors in the coming year, by reference to recent levels of EU transfers in respect of the support mechanisms in the sector concerned.  These are beef, £10.0 million; Milk, £6.0 million; Arable crops, £0.25 million; sugar, £1.0 million.</P>
      <P>Estimates of losses in other sectors are not of significance.  Losses may be reduced by compensatory aid which is provided for in EU regulations.</P>
      <P>I should stress that there will be no impact on premium payments or disadvantaged areas headage payments to farmers, amounting to in excess of £700 million, as a result of the revaluation.</P>

The main closing conditions are the enactment of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 and clearance by the European Commission of the alliance from a competition viewpoint.  Work is in progress with a view to fulfilment of the closing conditions as soon as possible.  However, as the timing of the fulfilment of some of the closing conditions is not within my control, it is not possible at this stage to give a precise indication of the likely closing date.</P>

      <P>The nationwide survey being undertaken by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, to which the Deputy refers, is a series of regional surveys of radon gas in buildings in the country.  This radon is a derivative of uranium and provides only indirect evidence of areas of the country which would contain some amount of uranium in bedrock.</P>
      <P>In the period 1977-82, the Geological Survey of Ireland carried out general surveys of the natural geological radioactivity levels in Ireland.  These helped to indicate areas with potential for more detailed prospecting for occurrences of uranium-bearing minerals.  A brief phase of private sector prospecting followed but this ceased mainly because likely deposits were not perceived to be economic.  There was also strong resistance on environmental/safety grounds.  The technical results of this uranium prospecting are available for inspection in the offices of the geological survey in Beggar's Bush.  No direct studies or surveys of the distribution of uranium in Irish rocks and soils have been carried out by the geological survey since that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met with a group of western politicians on 6 November 1996.  The position regarding freight services on the rail line between Limerick and Claremorris was raised at that meeting.  Decisions in relation to the operation of services on any rail line are day to day commercial matters which fall entirely within the responsibility of the boards and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.  I have no function in relation to such decisions.</P>
      <P>In the light of information provided to me by Iarnród Éireann, I confirmed at the meeting on 6 November that Iarnród Éireann had not taken a decision to close the rail line between Limerick and Claremorris.  There are no plans within Iarnród Éireann to do so, and there are no proposals before me, or under consideration in my Department, for the closure of any rail lines, including the line between Limerick and Claremorris.</P>
      <P>It has been confirmed to me by Iarnród Éireann that it is the company's aim that freight traffic on the line should continue, provided that the right business conditions can be created and sustained.</P>
      <P>It must, however, be acknowledged that Iarnród Éireann faces very strong competition on the Limerick-Claremorris corridor from the road haulage sector, which enjoys advantages in terms of cost and flexibility.  The company has no option but to face up to the commercial realities of the situation &mdash; it must get its costs down if it is to complete successfully in this market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by Iarnród Éireann that, in the context of the company's cost reduction plan, potential savings of £250,000 per annum have been identified which could be achieved through a transfer of freight traffic on the Limerick-Claremorris line to other rail lines.  This underlines the urgency of making substantial reductions in the cost base of the operation. Iarnród Éireann has assured me that they are anxious to secure the future of commercial freight <Col N="1243" /> operations on the line by reducing costs, and especially the costs associated with maintaining the line in full operational order.  I welcome this positive approach and would wish to see the company arrive at a position where the future of freight traffic on this line would not only be maintained at existing levels but could be developed where suitable commercial opportunities could be identified.  In this regard, I have asked that Iarnród Éireann engage in an intensive marketing drive with the aim of realising the full commercial potential of the Limerick-Claremorris line.</P>
    <P>I have publicly urged both management and unions to enter into meaningful negotiations in a spirit of partnership and co-operation with a view to agreeing on ways and means to achieve the cost savings envisaged by Iarnród Éireann and the other CIE companies in their viability plans. The aim should be to meet these challenging targets by securing improvements in productivity and efficiency rather than by curtailing services.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated in this House in my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 261 of 30 October, 1996, and 174, 175 and 177 of 6 November, 1996 I have appointed only one set of consultants, namely those nominated by the EBU, to advise me on the South Coast case.  No other experts have been engaged by me in this matter.</P>
      <P>As a result of the court decision in that case, I undertook not to take action against the South Coast system pending a final decision.  The court decision dealt only with South Coast and so does my undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will, of course, have regard to the implications for other deflector systems which may arise from the consultants' assessment in the South Coast case, but unlicensed multi-channel systems cannot be granted immunity from any action which might have to be taken under the Wireless <Col N="1244" /> Telegraphy Acts.
