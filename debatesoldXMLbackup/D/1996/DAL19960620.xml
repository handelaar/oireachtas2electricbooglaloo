      <P>It is proposed to take No. 16. &mdash; Metrology Bill, 1996, Report and Final Stages and No. 17 &mdash; Statements on the Management Plan for the Burren National Park.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 16, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12 noon today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and (2) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 17; (i) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State or of the main spokesperson for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>There are two <Col N="658" /> matters to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 17 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters. I wish the Taoiseach well at this weekend's Florence Summit when the EU Presidency will be handed over to Ireland.  I hope he will manage to discuss something other than BSE and if he does not it will not be his fault.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach use the opportunity of his scheduled meeting with the British Prime Minister on the margins of the summit to raise the disgraceful situation where, after two weeks of multi-party talks, Senator George Mitchell is still not in a position to do what he was asked to do by the two Governments and what he kindly offered to do?  I doubt if there is another man or woman who would take on that task.  Will the Taoiseach try to resolve this situation and stop those people who are frustrating the efforts of Senator Mitchell to deal in a substantial way with what is an important agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy's good wishes are reciprocated by the Taoiseach.  The other matters are ones for the Taoiseach to determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish the Taoiseach well at the weekend in Florence. It is a pleasant place and I hope he gets the time to enjoy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as pleasant as Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish him well on the taking over of the EU Presidency from 1 July.  I share Deputy Bertie Ahern's concern about the way in which Senator George Mitchell is being treated.  The bickering that is continuing in Northern Ireland is playing into the hands of the paramilitaries.  If constitutional politicians cannot begin to negotiate a settlement for Northern Ireland the initiative will be handed <Col N="659" /> back to the men of violence.  I appeal to the politicians there to accept George Mitchell.  We are fortunate that he has made himself available to chair the allparty talks.  I cannot think of anybody more suitable for the task.  I am sure he must be becoming increasingly frustrated at the way he is being treated.</P>
      <P>The only statement we wish to hear from the IRA is that it has unequivocally restored its ceasefire. There must be no ambivalence about it. The only way it can enhance the democratic political process is by restoring a full and unequivocal ceasefire, not by having a tactical ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have matters pertaining to Northern Ireland raised on the Order of Business every day.  The Chair has shown considerable latitude in these matters.  I ask you not to raise them every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a way of raising these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  There should be some ways and means of dealing with them rather than at an inappropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the words spoken with regard to the prospect of success at the summit in Florence. We hope that there will be progress on a number of issues.  I share with Members an appreciation of the willingness of Senator George Mitchell and also General de Chastelain and Mr. Harry Hokkeri to make themselves available to assist in performing the role of independent chairmen in various aspects of the discussions.  We in this island and the neighbouring island are fortunate that people of this distinction are willing to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This conflict has endured in one form or another for up to 300 years.  The talks started only a little over a week ago.  It <Col N="660" /> was inevitable that there would be difficulties and differences regarding procedure early in this phase.  The resolution of these difficulties is not assisted by partial comments from outside.  It is best that the participants be allowed the space to work through the difficulties. The skill, tact and diplomacy of Senator Mitchell especially should be allowed to do its work in the way in which he is so eminently capable.  This is probably the best approach we should adopt in the House with regard to the matter, notwithstanding our strong admiration for Senator Mitchell and our perfectly proper anxiety that he be treated with the courtesy and appreciation his role so eminently deserves.</P>

      <P>In view of the comments of Deputy Eric Byrne this morning, will the Taoiseach advise when the legislation to curb stalking will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that questions were put yesterday by Deputy Eric Byrne on that matter to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice. The Minister of State told the Deputy that legislation on offences against the person is being drafted on this topic.  The legislation will take into account the Law Reform Commission recommendations on the matter of stalking.  It is hoped that the legislation will be published soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience of the Deputy's party in Dublin South-Central would not lead it to the conclusion that the victor of the by-election on that occasion is in any way a gullible person. On the contrary, he has shown his ability to win the confidence of the electorate in a way that perhaps the Deputy's party was unable to win it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 40, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Ned <Col N="667" /> O'Keeffe raised a number of matters in this regard and I agreed to consider the question of fees before Report Stage.  I am a firm advocate of State companies having as much commercial freedom as possible in their day-to-day operations. However, I have some sympathy with the points made in Committee by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, in particular because the activities concerned are prescribed by law.  My amendment will enable the Minister to retain control on the level of fees charged while, at the same time according a degree of commercial freedom to Forbairt.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe had also asked for a list of the current rates of fees charged by the Weights and Measures Service. Detailed information is available in the following regulations: Weights and Measures, Verification and Stamping Fees Order, 1992 &mdash; Statutory Instrument 18 of 1992; Taxi Meter Fees on Verification and Stamping by Special Inspectors (No. 2) (Regulations 92)&mdash; Statutory Instrument 261 of 1962. Examples of the rates in these regulations are: supermarket weighing scales &mdash; £18; weighbridge of 60 tonne capacity &mdash; £147; petrol pumps &mdash; £37; taxi meter &mdash; £20.</P>
    <P>Existing fee income is of the order of £400,000 per annum, or approximately 25 per cent of the total cost of operating the service.  A significant change in the level of income is not envisaged in the short-term.  As I said on Second Stage, because of its infrastructural nature, it is not envisaged that the new service will operate on a total cost recovery basis. This would require increases which could place fee levels beyond the capacity of many small traders.  Verification fees collected by Garda Síochána, <i>ex-offico</i> inspectors of weights and measures, are lodged in the Department of Justice whereas those collected by the weights and measures inspectors in Dublin Corporation and the area of the former borough of Dún Laoghaire are retained by those local authorities.  The 1995 incomes which Deputy O'Keeffe <Col N="668" /> asked about are as follows: gardaí, £280,000; Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, £107,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for providing the relevant information. Will the rates vary in line with increases in the economy generally?  Does he envisage that the Legal Metrology Service will be self-financing or will it continue to get State funding &mdash; in other words will the traders and business people who must by statute avail of the service fund it?</P>

      <P>Let us not forget the procedure which ought to apply on Report Stage.  Before I ask the Minister of State to reply to the debate on amendment No. 1 do other Members wish to intervene?  The Minister of State will reply to the debate on amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended that the Legal Metrology Service will function on a self-financing basis.  The fee income is of the order of 25 per cent of the cost of running the service and it is not intended that it will significantly change.  Given the nature of the service provided and its importance in terms of trade and so on, it is part of the infrastructure and it is necessary for the State to ensure that it is done properly and without prejudice to commercial imperative.  It is not intended that it will become a self-financing service, nor is there an intention that I can tell the Deputy about in regard to the fees charged.  As I explained, and for the same reasons as I outlined, it is important that the fees are pitched at a level that does not deter small traders. It is not the intention of the legislation to change the level of the fees charged, undoubtedly as the years pass there will be adjustments but they will be in line with the general philosophy I outlined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) an inspector for the purposes of the Weights and Measures Acts, 1878 to 1961, who agrees to be seconded from An Garda Síochána to Forfás,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I re-entered these Committee Stage amendments because of the problems that will arise for approximately 20 Sergeants of Weights and Measures from the old service on their transfer to the new service.  These people are looking for their entitlements.  I put forward the argument on Committee Stage and what I said then still stands.  These people have given sterling service to the weights and measure service and in many instances they have only a short period before retirement.  I understand there are proposals that they may revert to the Garda Síochána but it is not easy for people who have been involved in a different type of operation since they joined the Weights and Measures service with the status of sergeant to revert to uniform and be assigned to point duty which they might find they are not qualified for because of the work they did in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>These men have given excellent service and were greatly admired.  They advised traders on how to operate the scales and measures.  There should be a phasing in because of the small number involved and the length of their service. I am not aware of the Minister's position on whether he is accepting my amendments.  I will press my amendments as I did on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy O'Keeffe feels strongly about this issue I have had the matter examined in very considerable detail prior to and since Committee Stage, when I <Col N="670" /> acknowledged the arguments advanced by Deputy O'Keeffe and colleagues from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the committee, there is an agreement in place setting out the detailed arrangement under which the gardaí may opt for transfer to Forfás. This agreement was reached through the normal negotiating procedures of the Garda Conciliation Council after long and detailed discussions. Secondment, having been ruled out earlier in the talks, formed no part of it. The agreement provides that the Garda Weights and Measures inspectors who opt for transfer to Forfás will retain their existing pay rates and allowances as well as other conditions on a personal basis.  However, in deference to the views strongly expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe and other Members at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy and elsewhere, I agreed without commitment to raise this secondment issue directly with my colleague the Minister for Justice. Secondment is first and foremost a matter for the current employer.  I have received a comprehensive reply from the Minister for Justice and I will quote directly from her letter of 5 June 1996:</P>
      <P>The question of secondment of the Garda Sergeants attached to the Weights and Measures Inspectorate was raised in late 1993 when discussions started on the setting up of the new Legal Metrology Service.  At that time, the Garda Commissioner expressed to my Department his opposition to the secondment of members of the Force to the new Service and he has restated this view as recently as April of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties which would arise from a secondment arrangement is that the Garda Sergeants concerned would continue to be employed as members of the Garda Síochána but would be performing their function as Inspectors in accordance with the provisions in the Metrology Bill under the proposed Director of the Legal Metrology Service.  This in <Col N="671" /> effect would mean that they would not be under the general direction and control of the Garda Commissioner. Such an arrangement would not be in accordance with Section 8 (i) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925 which provides that &ldquo;The general direction and control of the amalgamated force shall, subject to regulation made under or continued in force by this Act, be vested in the Commissioner of the amalgamated force who shall be styled and known as the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In addition, the commissioner is subject to the constraints of the several Acts and regulations currently in place concerned with the management and control of the Force.  I fully agree with the commissioner's view in this matter and I am satisfied that the secondment arrangement is not a viable option for the transfer of members of the Force to the new service.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, 20 Garda sergeants are affected by the reorganisation of the weights and measures service. In the knowledge that secondment was not a viable option, discussions between your Department [the Department of Enterprise and Employment], the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and my Department were ongoing for a very lengthy period (over 2-3 years) on the conditions on offer to those Garda sergeants who choose to transfer to the new Legal Metrology Service under the auspices of Forbairt. The aim of these discussions was to ensure that members who so choose would not lose out in any way and would retain their existing pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached between all parties concerned in December 1995 on the terms and conditions of transfer to the new service.  The agreement stated that those members <Col N="672" /> who join the new service shall no longer be members of the Garda Síochána.  I must reiterate that agreement was reached after long and exhaustive discussion and all the parties involved accepted this agreement.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that the Garda sergeants concerned may opt to transfer to the new metrology service on the conditions and terms agreed or continue their careers in the Garda Síochána, an option which is, and always has been, open to them.</P>
    <P>In light of the position outlined by the Minister for Justice, I regret I am unable to accept Deputy O'Keeffe's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We were aware of what that letter from the Minister of Justice, in which she mentioned the Garda Commissioner, would contain. The issue is somewhat deeper than that. I am aware of the offers of transfer, the pay and conditions and the entitlements. However, the persons who have worked in this service for many years and are now in the final phase of their job are not really worried about pay and conditions, but about loss of status and change at a time when they have few years left in the work place.  The loss of status is the issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I could reach a compromise on this if he agreed to insert something into the Bill.  This House makes laws to be observed by our citizens.  If we want to change the law we have to bring in amending or enabling legislation or new Bills.  We on this side of the House look for new legislation every morning and get promises from the Taoiseach.  If the Minister of State accepted one of my amendments we could overcome this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people concerned will reach the end of their working lives in a few years, at which time they could retire graciously. We all dislike losing status.  I am sure there will be a change in this House after the next general election and the Minister of State in the Department of <Col N="673" /> Enterprise and Employment will not like being transferred to this side of the House and the loss of status involved but at least there is severance pay for Ministers.  He should put himself in the position of this small number of people who deserve recognition and better treatment.  The Garda Commissioner will adopt the statutory line.  Loss of status disturbs people and can affect their health.  I ask the Minister of State to re-examine this.  He has powers under the Bill and we will make the law this morning.  He can insert a provision whereby they can operate within the service.</P>
    <P>At present, they have the status of sergeants of weights of measures, having being seconded from the Garda Síochána.  It is a very influential position which was inherited from the previous police force in this country.  They have carried out their work with dedication and efficiency and provided an excellent service to traders.  Now, because of changes in the area of weights and measures, they are to be uprooted.  If that happened in the private sector, industrial action involving strikes and pickets, would be taken and they would be defended but in this case they have been left fairly defenceless.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to re-examine the matter and to agree to a compromise.  He knows the dates on which they should retire.  After the year 2000, which is only four years away, only two will be left, if my information is correct.  They are asking for a very small concession.  Government and Opposition should seek the welfare of all our people.</P>
    <P>There is only a small number of people involved in this very prestigious service.  They have an option of returning to the Force with the same rates of pay or of accepting the loss of status.  Entering a new service with a new management structure is a huge change for people who are over 50 years of age.  The service has worked well, there was no dissatisfaction with how it operated.  That is a measure of the dedication and strength of the people who <Col N="674" /> worked there.  We must give them the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is merit in my amendments.  I would not be as enthusiastic about pressing them if they dealt with issues of a monetary or business nature because I recognise the role of Government.  I am sure the Minister will give some ground so that we can reach an agreement on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Without deviating from the procedures which should apply at this time, and without precedent of any kind, if the Minister of State wishes to comment very briefly on the appeal made by Deputy O'Keeffe, the Chair will not intervene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbittee Mr. Rabbittee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbittee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to you, Sir, and I will be brief.  In all honesty, if I was on Deputy O'Keeffe's side of the House I would probably make similar arguments to those he has made.  If it was a matter of judgment only, in terms of the legislation being enacted, I would accede to his request.  However, it is a bit more than that.  The net issue at the end of the day is the violence which would be done to the Garda Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined this in considerable detail.  On the face of it, the request is a reasonable one.  I acknowledge that, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, it is not about retention of pay and conditions. However, it is important for me to put on the record of the House that the retention of pay and conditions is protected in the legislation, lest the impression to the contrary be given. Deputy O'Keeffe's assertion that it is a matter of the loss of status for the people concerned, is probably an accurate summary.  There is no doubt that in certain circumstances this can be an important matter to people who have done something career wise all of their lives.  It is not difficult to understand why the people concerned regard themselves as members of the Garda Síochána and do not want at a late stage of <Col N="675" /> their service to be considered otherwise I accept this.</P>
    <P>I accept also that this House has primacy and that one is obliged to look at our law.  It is the adamant opinion of the Garda Commissioner, which is supported in its entirety by the Minister for <Col N="676" /> Justice, that it would establish an extraordinary precedent and in the process do violence to the Garda Síochána Acts. I regret, therefore, that I have no option but to accept the advice available to me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to build a visitor centre near Mullaghmore was the subject of <Col N="685" /> passionate controversy from the time it became public in 1990.  The conservation bodies in the private sector as well as the National Heritage Council were ranged on one side in opposition to the proposal while the Office of Public Works was on the other side with many local supporters for the project.  In retrospect one can see that a resolution was difficult in view of the absence of a proper context in which the differing arguments could be placed and coolly considered.  In the absence of such a context the battle moved into the legal arena with no final decision still available. I emphasise that any proposals for the site at Mullaghmore are subject to the consent of the High Court.</P>
    <P>In the meantime there were interesting court decisions leading to the enactment of emergency legislation and a change of practice whereby public authorities are now required to seek planning permission for their developments.</P>
    <P>The Burren is by common consent a very special place.  It is rich in archaeological remains which represent the area's continuous occupancy for over 5,000 years.  This use of the land has combined with nature to produce an environment with distinctive flora and a landscape of great beauty.  We would all wish, I presume, that the harmonious balance which has produced an environment of such quality and attractiveness should not be disturbed in so far as this is possible, having regard to the present day needs of the local community. It is an area of international scientific importance and I hope it will in due course be recognised as a world heritage site.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long on the turbulent history of this case.  Suffice to say that, despite the wide opposition to the proposed centre, work began on the site in November 1992 but this was brought to a halt in February 1993, following a High Court decision.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court ruled in May 1993 that the State is not exempt from the requirement to seek full planning permission and the then Government <Col N="686" /> decided that the Office of Public Works should engage in wide consultations following which it should seek planning permission.  In January 1994 the Office of Public Works made a planning application for the retention of the partially completed structures and the completed bus and car park and for the completion of the development at Mullaghmore.</P>
    <P>With the change of Government in December 1994, the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> stated that the future of the proposed interpretative centres at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley would be a matter for decision by Government.  I immediately asked my officials to examine the options for the various centres and, in the light of this examination, I presented proposals to Government which were approved on 28 March 1995. In so far as the Burren was concerned, the Government's decision was to withdraw the planning application, which was still before Clare County Council, and to proceed with the preparation of a management plan for the Burren national park.  In the meantime, a decision on the completed bus and car parks was deferred until the management plan had been completed.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the question of the context in which the debate about siting the interpretative centre should be placed.  It was clear to me from an early stage that it was futile trying to achieve consensus on where particular facilities should be provided without a management plan for the park which would consider fundamental issues like the park's objectives and its resources, a zoning system for the park as well as how visitors should be catered for with access, information interpretative facilities. It was also important that the national park, which is relatively small, should not be considered in isolation but should be seen in the context of the whole north Clare area.</P>
    <P>Having appointed a steering committee to oversee the production of a management plan for the Burren National Park in the context of a conservation strategy for the north Clare area, the <Col N="687" /> consultants Brady Shipman Martin were commissioned to undertake the drafting of the plan.  The draft plan was completed in February 1996 and the views of the public were then sought on the proposals.</P>
    <P>My Department has also commissioned the same consultants, Brady Shipman Martin, to carry out a survey of monuments in the Burren and to address three main objectives: the preservation and conservation of the historic sites and monuments within the Burren; the preservation of the setting of the monuments; and to cater for the tourist potential of the area by providing facilities for visitors to view and enjoy a selected number of monuments.</P>
    <P>That report is nearing completion and I hope to have it shortly.  It will be based on a site assessment of over 30 monuments in the Burren and will make recommendations for actions required to ensure visitor access to the monuments, while minimising disruption to the site and its context.</P>
    <P>The strategy in this report and the overall strategy in the Burren National Park Management Plan are in accord with an earlier report by the same firm of consultants entitled &ldquo;Tourism in the Burren, a Strategic Plan&rdquo; which was sponsored by Shannon Development, Clare County Council and the Heritage Service of my Department.</P>
    <P>We now have a comprehensive set of proposals on which to base a strategy for the protection of the natural and archaeological heritage of the Burren while providing appropriate forms of access for visitors to experience the landscape and its elements.</P>
    <P>The consultation period for the Burren national park draft management plan expired on 16 May 1996 and I received a total of 29 submissions.  Two of these were joint submissions from a number of organisations while in another instance the organisation in question attached an appendix from a consultant and this could be taken as a further submission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> I would like to thank sincerely everyone who responded to my request for observations.  Most of the responses were quite detailed and clearly reflected very careful consideration and evaluation of the contents of the draft plan. I referred the submissions to the consultants, Brady Shipman Martin, for their views and I have now received these.</P>
    <P>The consultants in their report have chosen to refer to the location where the original interpretative centre project was undertaken by the townland name of Gortlecka and I will use that name &mdash; Gortlecka &mdash; when I am referring to proposals for that site.</P>
    <P>In broad terms the draft plan met a positive response.  For instance, the Burren Action Group commented as follows:</P>
    <P>The Burren Action Group would like to welcome the publication of the Burren National Park Study.  It is the first time in Ireland that there has been such a comprehensive attempt to integrate conservation with agriculture, tourism and the provision of employment opportunities on a regional basis.  The approach used in the Burren National Park study points the way forward towards the goal of sustainable development in the Irish countryside and for this the Minister is to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The Burren National Park Support Association has many positive comments on the recommendations in the consultants' report, such as the following:</P>
    <P>The Burren National Park Support Association accepts the recommendation that visitor use of the Park be placed in the wider context of the North Clare area.  It supports the recommendations for an integrated approach to visitor access and facilities throughout the region.  This approach accords with the Tourism Strategy for the Burren (Brady Shipman Martin, 1992) with which the Association broadly agrees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The Association furthermore concedes that the visitor/interpretative facility at Mullaghmore should not be regarded as a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; attraction on the North Clare landscape.  In fact, it has on several occasions put forward recommendations which it feels would facilitate a good deal of appropriate linkage between various elements of the Burren &ldquo;story&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While the support association is clearly unhappy with what it perceives to be the scale of the facilities proposed for the Gortlecka site, which it says is &ldquo;little more than a flimsy bus-shelter with a few token display panels&rdquo;, it goes on to state its belief that Corofin should have a central role and this is, of course, provided for in the consultants' report.  The following are the views expressed by the support association:</P>
    <P>It is the view of this Association therefore that Corofin should be regarded as a key centre for the preservation and interpretation of the North Clare Story.  It would also be ideally located for the creation of an archive as a repository for academic and specialist work related to the Burren as recommended at 5.22 (National Park Study).  If the existing Heritage and Genealogical Centre at Corofin were to assume a wider focus to include, for example, audio-visual and literary presentations of the very rich oral literature of North Clare, then the facilities at Corofin could comprise an ensemble of interlinked elements which would constitute an important visitor complex.  An important function of the facility there would be to seek to establish and promote the Burren area as a locality of research and academic excellence in a range of fields, including natural history, archaeology, folk history and rural studies as recommended in the Tourism Strategy for the Burren (page 19 Draft Strategy, 1992).</P>
    <P>There is a somewhat similar emphasis in the comments of the Burren Action <Col N="690" /> Group on the key position of Corofin. Having stated that there is a great deal of the content of the Burren National Park Study which is in full accord with strategies supported and advocated by the Burren Action Group, it says that there are certain points which it feels need further clarification, in particular in relation to the facilities at Corofin. The report states:</P>
    <P>There is a lack of clarity in the Burren National Park Study as to the exact nature and function of the facilities which are proposed for the village.  The Burren Action Group feel that the main National Park management facilities should be based at or adjacent to the village of Corofin.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated so far on the comments of the Burren National Park Support Association and of the Burren Action Group to draw attention to the extent of common ground that exists.  It is interesting that both organisations call for the Burren to be designated as a world heritage site which I hope will be achieved in the future.  It is clear that they, like the others who submitted comments, have a deep concern for the conservation of the Burren and for the welfare and prosperity of the local communities. What we all have at heart is the sustainable development of the Burren region.  There is very little between the various groups as to how best this can be achieved.  Looked at in this broader context, the question of the scale of the facilities, if any, to be provided at the Gortlecka site should hopefully be a manageable problem.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended that the Gortlecka site should provide car parking to accommodate existing and projected visitor numbers and to avoid unauthorised roadside parking; toilets; staff facilities; limited visitor information; basic visitor shelter, possibly with limited interpretative material&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of those who responded have taken the line that none of these facilities should be provided at Gortlecka or expressed some concern about them.  These include the Heritage Council, Plant Life, Comhar Cumann na Bóirne, Burren Action Group, Dr. Micheline Skeehy Skeffington, Eamonn de Buitléir, Godfey Nall, Martina O'Dea and Liam Kirwan. Others have taken the line that these facilities are inadequate.  These include the Burren National Park Support Association, Clare Heritage Centre, Corofin and District Development Company, North Clare IFA, Deputy Tony Killeen, Kilkeedy Development Association, Francis Brew and the Kilnaboy Community Development Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the general support that exists for the principle in the Burren National <Col N="692" /> Park Study of having dispersed interpretation the issue that remains to be settled is whether it is necessary to provide a special access to the park and, if so, the scale of the facilities to be provided at the access point.  Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the preservation of a way to discuss the future of the Burren is of benefit to everybody as we try to get it right for the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in particular to the submission made by the Heritage Council which included as an appendix a report commissioned from Mr. Maarten van Arkel, planning officer for recreation and tourism in the National Forest Service of the Netherlands.  The Heritage Council welcomes my initiative in commissioning the Burren National Park Study and in providing an opportunity for wide public consultation on the strategies proposed for the national park and for the wider north Clare area.  In general, the views of the council on the report are very positive and they endorse many of the recommendations in the study.  In relation to the proposals for the Gortlecka site the council has reservations such as:</P>
    <P>The council considers that the recommendations to site significant visitor facilities at Gortlecka is contrary to the overall management, conservation and sustainable development strategies adopted in the Burren National Park Study and in the draft tourism plan.</P>
    <P>I would lay particular emphasis on the council's use of the word, significant.  It appears that its concern is with the perceived scale of the facilities proposed.  I share its concern that the development there should be of appropriate scale. The consultants have placed great stress on the principle of appropriate scale and they have confirmed that they are satisfied that there is no conflict between their recommendations for Gortlecka and the strategies proposed in their various reports on the Burren.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the overall strategy of the Brady Shipman Martin series of <Col N="693" /> reports which suggest that any major developments should take place in centres of population but that modest provision should be made for access at various points.  Those who oppose the proposed developments at Gortlecka in general suggest that by extending the park to the wetlands in the vicinity of Corofin it would be possible to provide adequate access to the park at that point.  While I am prepared to consider the question of extending the park target area and of providing access from Corofin, I do not believe that this will satisfy the demand for access to the typical Burren limestone pavement and upland areas.  As the national park will not be clearly demarcated from surrounding private lands many general visitors may find it difficult to know which are the public lands that can be legally accessed.  A formal entry point to the national park will help to overcome this difficulty and will also allow for a greater degree of control.</P>
    <P>The proposals for Gortlecka, as outlined in the study, is intended to be primarlily an entry point from which visitors will access the park on foot, rather than an attraction in its own right.  The scale of the facilities proposed for Gortlecka is very small.  I have asked the Office of Public Works to prepare a plan for my consideration which I will present to the High Court for permission to proceed to a planning application. I sincerely hope that this compromise will meet with a wide measure of support and that we can proceed quickly to a final solution to the Gortlecka site.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the preparation of a plan for the Gortlecka site, my officials are considering the matter of providing facilities at Corofin, Kilfenora and Ballyvaughan. An outline of the facilities which I would hope to provide at Corofin include: (1) an audio-visual show; (2) a graphic interpretative display; (3) a nature study room for school groups; (4) the Park Management Headquarters; and (5) support for the Corofin Heritage Centre.</P>
    <P>In the last day or so some of my <Col N="694" /> officials have had meetings in Corofin and Ballyvaughan to discuss the possibilities of developments in these areas and I hope that officials will shortly have discussions with Comhar Cumann na Bóirne on possible joint co-operation at Kilfenora.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Burren National Park Study together with the other Brady Shipman Martin reports on the Burren &mdash;&ldquo;Tourism in the Burren, a Strategic Plan&rdquo; which I endorse and the forthcoming report on the Burren monuments &mdash; will form a sound basis for future planning in the Burren.  Is mian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Brady Shipman Martin agus leis an gCoiste Stiúrtha a rinne a seacht ndícheall chun an tuarascáil a eisiúint chomh tapaidh agus a rinne siad.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm, mar sin, an tuarascáil seo a chur faoi bhráid an Tí.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity of debating the management plan for the Burren National Park although it is strange we could not have had this debate immediately after the consultation period had elapsed.  However, I am pleased that we are now discussing this area of tremendous interest in my constituency of Clare.</P>
      <P>There has been enormous interest in the preservation and conservation of the Burren area, recognised by all as a national treasure.  As a public representative of the area, I am aware of the place it holds in the hearts and minds of the people of Clare.  Hence the impassioned debate on how we should best promote and manage the Burren. Over the past five years, genuine, deeply held, sometimes completely opposing views, have been expressed, in particular on the proposed interpretative centre in Mullaghmore.  Sadly this debate has caused division within the small community of north Clare where I perceive a wish for and progress towards a consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The positive element of all of this debate, argument and counter-argument, has been the further realisation on the part of the general public of the <Col N="695" /> sensitivity and vulnerability of the Burren region and the desire to conserve a national and international jewel.</P>
    <P>The three documents &mdash; A Strategy for the Overall Development of the North Clare Area, A Management Plan for the Burren National Park and A Nature Conservation Strategy for the Proposed National Heritage Areas represent a positive step forward, giving an overview of what is needed for the long-term management of the Burren.</P>
    <P>The Burren is an area of unique beauty and of ecological and archaeological importance.  It is a botanist's paradise and animals such as wild goats, lizards as well as the pine marten are well known in addition to in excess of 40 species of birds.  Human habitation over the past 5,000 years is evident in the Burren by the presence of ring forts, castles, fulachta fíadha, cairns, wedge tombs, medieval churches, high crosses, all to be found over north Clare.  Literature and folklore abound on this area. The Irish language survived in the area until the 20th century and, within living memory, has been the everyday language of some in this region.  The tradition of story telling has been recognised by the Irish Folklore Commission.  The area is worthy of world heritage site listing, which I was pleased to note the Minister recognised in his speech.</P>
    <P>In the Brady, Shipman Martin reports there is an attempt to marry the linchpins of economic survival in the Burren, agriculture and tourism, with the needs of conservation.  I contend it must be recognised that farmers in the Burren have been the first conservationists.  As they represent the key to the continued conservation and preservation of the area, their pivotal role must be not only understood but supported.  The National Heritage Council acknowledges the importance of the farming community in shaping and maintaining this heritage, pointing out the need for farmers in the Burren to become land managers as well as producers and recognising that farmers must be compensated for so doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> I should now like to quote from the submission of the National Heritage Council on the Brady, Shipman and Martin Burren National Park Study:</P>
    <P>The payments involved should not be negatively viewed as grants and subsidies but as the legitimate income of landowners who maintain a heritage resource which underpins the tourism industry of the North Clare area.  The Draft Strategy states that the only current way in which the dual role of farmers in the Burren can be funded is through the REPS scheme.  Since this is a voluntary EU scheme of limited...duration, other options for long-term support of the farming community must be considered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed national heritage areas, the National Heritage Council goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...Draft guidelines, the proposed NHAs and SACs represent a very significant fraction of the total acreage of the wider Burren area.  Since the bulk of these designated areas is in private ownership, the conservation and management of both NHAs and SACs is absolutely dependent on the positive involvement, appropriate remuneration and maintenance of the local farming population.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister is well aware that farmers are willing to participate in preservation and conservation measures, but they must be compensated and overall consultation is pivotal in any such arrangements and approaches.  The Irish Farmers' Association held a meeting in Clare specifically to discuss this matter.  It is the intention of my party to continue to hold meetings.  We had a discussion within our parliamentary party last week and will have further discussions within our party on the implications of NHAs and how we can best help landowners in this exercise.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister is also aware of the severe depopulation in Clare and, in particular, north Clare.  The people of <Col N="697" /> Carron have written to me to explain their particular difficulties with depopulation because of which they, and many like them throughout the area of north Clare, wish to maintain as many farmers as possible on the land.  In order to do so, some compensatory system must be devised, perhaps under the aegis of the REPS or other subsidy, to supplement any loss of income incurred by farmers. Their livelihoods would not be put in jeopardy as a consequence of conservation which will not only enhance their local area but the country's general heritage and tourism potential.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern about reclamation in the Burren over the past 18 months on which I understand a survey has been undertaken.  There is anxiety about what are referred to as new reclamation sites.  I am informed that, within a very small area, there have been 59 new reclamation sites, of which 31 are in proposed national heritage areas, 23 of which are located in the eastern part of the Burren.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to these sites which worry not alone members of the IFA but the general public in the north Clare area.</P>
    <P>Reading through all the submissions and reports on the Burren, one discovers a common thread, identifying what is necessary and achievable: first, the plateau region of the Burren should be designated as a world heritage site; second, &ldquo;Tourism of the Burren &mdash; A Strategic Plan&rdquo; should be published; third, well planned trails must be provided; fourth, most submissions, with some exceptions, identify the need for appropriate signage in the Burren, some recommending that a Burren logo be displayed on all approaches to the region; fifth, the need for a litter management programme is emphasised by all and sixth, the need for further listing of archaeological sites is noted.  The Minister referred to such a survey and I hope there will be consultation with farmers who have archaeological sites on their lands as that is the only way forward.  It is the least that can be done in seeking assistance from farmers and <Col N="698" /> showing respect for their lands and archaeological sites on them.  Road widening is a controversial issue and some people consider there is a need for proper parking facilities.</P>
    <P>The Kilnaboy submission refers to concerns about traffic congestion.  The people there are concerned about people parking their cars in gateways which would make life difficult for the local population.  The view was also expressed that if roads can be built to cater for the tourists surely good roads should be built to cater for the local people.  Some people are concerned that road widening may pose a danger to the ecology of the area.  At a meeting I held in Lisdoonvarna at the end of March to discuss this issue, it was suggested that if the sodden was taken away road widening may not damage habitats and would improve access to the Burren. Access to the Burren is already difficult as there are traffic jams in Ballyvaughan and Corofin.  Some people who attended that meeting suggested that buses parked around the national park could cause traffic problems.  A suggestion that carparking facilities be centralised and a number of mini buses with local tour guides run by local people be provided should be considered.  There is a great emphasis on the need for formal tour guides, but they must be local people.</P>
    <P>There is a need for further information and education and local people would welcome that.  Further educational programmes could be encouraged along the lines of the work undertaken by the Burren Symposium in Fanore which has undertaken great work in many fields.  The provision of pamphlets and leaflets comes under the heading of access to information, something on which we would all agree.</P>
    <P>The need to control the number of game shooters, raised on the Order of Business this morning, comes under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Justice and I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Farmers want to gain access to information about archaeological sites on their lands.  They would like one to one advice similar to that provided by a Teagasc adviser.  Consultation with a farmer during surveys on any archaeological site on his or her land should be automatic. At present maps are available showing some archaeological sites, but they are not always intelligible to the lay men or women.  It is considered unfair that farmers should bear the cost of an archaeological dig or of getting advice on an archaeological site on their lands, because that heritage belongs not only to that farmer but to the nation.  I ask the Minister to consider how farmers could be assisted in commissioning such archaeological works on their lands.</P>
    <P>Great concern was expressed by many on the disappearance of artefacts from the Burren.  A number of pre-famine headstones, slabs and waterfonts have disappeared.  We do not know how that happened, but we could make some guesses.  The people of the area and all those interested in heritage are appalled by their disappearance.  Will the Minister consider what can be done to prevent the disappearance of such artefacts? It was suggested that rangers or local guides could be employed to keep an eye on them and that may help.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion was that the Brehon Law School at Cahermacnaughton should be recognised and promoted appropriately.  The Minister will recall that I raised this matter on an Adjournment Debate and he gave a positive response, but that has not been followed through.</P>
    <P>The Clare County Council submission underlines the fact that the existing water and waste water facilities in a great deal of the North Clare area are grossly inadequate.  In its Cohesion Fund application it said the water supply in Ballyvaughan, Bellharbour, Corofin, Doolin, Kilfenora and Lisdoonvarna is inadequate.  The sewage problems in Ballyvaughan, Lisdoonvarna and Doolin are also well documented. Although they do not come directly <Col N="700" /> under the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I ask the Minister to discuss them with his party colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to ensure that badly needed Cohesion Funds are allocated to those projects.  The Clare County Council submission makes the point that a sustainable tourism industry is an important element in the future economic well-being of the area and sustainable tourism is dependent on the preservation of the Burren's unique qualities.</P>
    <P>The only real matter of contention remaining is the proposed visitor facility at Mullaghmore.  I was happy to note that at the meeting I arranged at the end of March in Lisdoonvarna to hear the views of my constituents on the Brady, Shipman and Martin report unanimous backing was given to a motion which called on all the people of the Burren and North Clare to come together to decide on how best this matter should be progressed.  There was general agreement that centres such as Corofin and Kilfenora should be supported and enhanced.  Corofin's success is due in great part to the tremendous drive, vision and commitment of the late Dr. Naoise Cléirigh who set up the genealogy centre in 1982 and the museum there needs new technologies to be more competitive.</P>
    <P>The hinterland of Corofin has some of the most significant archaeological remains in the west, including the triple ramparted fort at Cahercommaun and the megalithic cemetery.  It has one of the most dense concentrations of megaliths and other burial monuments in Ireland.  There are some suggestions that Corofin is ideally suited for the location and creation of an archive as a repository for academic and specialist work related to the Burren.  There is a lack of clarity in the plan for what is proposed for Corofin.  Although the Minister referred to it today I ask him to elaborate on it.</P>
    <P>The Burren Display Centre at Kilfenora has been in existence for more than two decades.  It was doing the work <Col N="701" /> of an interpretative centre long before interpretative centres were established. Such initiative and commitment must be recognised and funded so that it can be enhanced.  The Burren Display Centre gives good employment and generates revenue for the area and I would be pleased to hear what further plans the Minister has for Kilfenora.  He said certain discussions took place in the past few days, but I would like him to outline his views on and expectations for the Kilfenora centre.</P>
    <P>While the Burren Action Group and others are very much against any development at Mullaghmore, there is recognition in the Brady, Shipman and Martin report that there will be development there.  It states that Mullaghmore remains the most suitable location for a visitors centre in the national park and, among other requirements, includes carparking and toilet facilities, effluent treatment and other building services.  There is major concern in the area of north Clare that visitor facilities and an interpretative programme, commensurate with the quality and range of the park's natural and built heritage, are put in place.  Anything else would be a radical departure from what is in place at other national parks, all of which have meaningful visitor and interpretative facilities.  The Kilnaboy submission makes the point that the greater impact from large numbers of tourists already exists in the western Burren, that the lowest impact from tourism traffic exists in the east Burren and that the Corofin/Kilnaboy areas have, for a long time, missed out on large numbers of visitors, hence its view on the need for an interpretative centre at Mullaghmore.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the fact that the EU is considering the possibility of clawing back the funds that were available for Mullaghmore?  Will he outline categorically the final position on this as many people are worried about it?</P>
    <P>In view of the delays, a number of debates have taken place in Clare County Council on proposed road <Col N="702" /> improvement works.  I know that contractual agreements were in train with regard to landowners.  This debate and the ensuing delays are causing concern about the contracts proceeding.  Will the Minister outline the position?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that many submissions were made.  I also received many submissions, not only from the meeting in Lisdoonvarna but also from groups in Kilnaboy, the Corofin Heritage Centre, Corofin and District Development Company, the Burren National Park Group, the display centre in Kilfenora, the IFA, the Burren Action Group, Clare Council, the Heritage Council of Ireland, Plant Life, World Fund for Nature and the Mountaineering Council of Ireland.  Many submissions were also made on an individual basis by way of letter and telephone. All of these people are concerned.</P>
    <P>This matter has gone on for some time.  We have talked today about consultation. There has been an opportunity for such consultation and it is now time to proceed.  I hope the Minister will not allow that the content of these reports are definitive on these issues.  I hope he will be able to take the initiative, to move things further and to have further consultation with the people in the area.  If they are listened to we will then be in a position to bring about a situation which will be fair and will represent the views held by the vast majority of the people in the Burren.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting remarks made by the Minister to Seanad Éireann when speaking on the Heritage Bill:</P>
    <P>An historic shift in culture is required.  There was a time in Irish culture when people imagined that if one presented people with nearly finished items they would accept them. However, we are now at a point in our cultural history where people want to see things in the shape they are to come before consent is presumed. We must operate in that manner.</P>
    <P>This consultation period has occurred. <Col N="703" /> There is room for further consultation, but I do not want it to be used as an excuse for not moving forward.  I hope the Minister will approach this with an open mind to ensure that the views of the people of County Clare, of north County Clare and especially of the Burren are accepted and that we can move forward from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the preparation and publication of this plan.  It provides us with the best prospect to date for rational discussion on this sensitive and difficult matter.  It also provides us with the best prospect, at the end of that discussion, to get in place the right recipe for the preservation and conservation of what is one of our greatest treasures, the Burren.</P>
      <P>The recent history of the development of the Burren has, unfortunately, been a sad one.  It has been riven with conflict and dissention.  It has not done anybody, nor the Burren itself, any good.  Morover, the fact that £3.5 million of taxpayers money has already been spent in this region is a scandal.  This kind of expenditure could have been averted if there had been proper consultation and discussion at the pre-planning and planning stages.</P>
      <P>I hope we get it right on this occasion and that there will be full consultation and discussion with everybody involved, especially with the people of County Clare.  This is not a County Clare inheritance.  The Burren is the birthright of every Irish person, but it is located in County Clare and, being realistic, its future is in the hands of the people of County Clare.  They have been and will continue to be the best custodians of this great national treasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that at this juncture we should confer and listen carefully to all the people in that area.  It is of fundamental importance that we have the active support of the farmers in our effort to develop and maintain it in a proper manner.  We must also engage from the outset the support of tourism <Col N="704" /> interests and local historical and archaeological groups in the area.  When elements of the plan are put in place and the developers move out, these are the people who will be the custodians of this area, for this and future generations. Ultimately this will be the key to success.</P>
    <P>If we are to succeed every farmer must become a land manager in his own area.  In addition, if the Government is to succeed in transcribing the EU directive regarding NHAs and SACs into Irish laws and having them fully implemented on the ground, there must be ongoing dialogue with farmers.  Some kind of concordat must be arrived at with them which will not alone engage their interest and enthusiasm but will also make it financially viable for them to continue to be the best custodians of these areas of heritage and scientific importance.  Unless and until this dialogue is undertaken successfully and constructively these proposals will not work.  Farmers in the area are central to the preservation of this most precious of all landscapes in the Irish map.</P>
    <P>The Burren is an unique combination of very special elements.  In addition to the rock formation and archaeological elements, there is the flora, fauna and bird life.  It is a combination of unique features that are so precious and yet so delicate in their balance that if we do not seek to preserve them all in harmony, one with the other, inestimable long-term damage will be done.</P>
    <P>It is not an unrealistic aspiration that the Burren should be a centre of unique international importance. It can become that if we go about our business in the correct way.  It is fundamentally important to engage the minds and hearts of the people who live in that area.  It is also of fundamental importance that there should be programmes of education to enable people living in the area to appreciate fully the longterm importance of preserving what was given to them as their natural gift from their Creator.  In that respect I wish to pay fulsome tribute to the Burren Conservation Trust based in Fenore.  Over <Col N="705" /> the years that group has striven to hold symposia, to generate interest and enthusiasm and disseminate information about the Burren.  That is the kind of activity that is necessary to fuel a local pride which will lead to proper preservation and conservation practice, that will lead to the conclusion that there is no quick kill in the context of tourism but that if the business is gone about properly a tourist trade can be converted into a good economic asset.</P>
    <P>That is a philosophical outlook that Clare people would hold naturally.  Consider how they held on to their traditional Irish music.  Long before the media made it fashionable to do so they kept alive their music and their stories. I have the utmost confidence in the capacity of the people of Clare to look after the Burren if those of us whose task it is to officially design the national park do our business in the correct way. If we do that the people of Clare will respond in due measure.</P>
    <P>Central to this plan is the concept of breaking up the different elements of the national park and having a necklace of centres around its core.  I support that very good and welcome concept.  The centres should be strategically selected and properly funded and developed. What we do not want is a series of Mickey Mouse centres.  The roadways and the access routes to these centres should be such as not to constitute a gross interference with the wildlife and natural habitats of the area.</P>
    <P>My instinct and the range of submissions from interested parties tell me that no development should happen on the area that the Minister has defined geographically as Gortlecka.  That is the most delicate, vulnerable and brittle part of the whole Burren area, and anything that is there today ought to be dismantled. Although the experts say they would permit what they call limited development with car parking, restaurant and sewage treatment plant, I do not agree with that part of their report.  I would be fearful of the longterm damage that could be done to the most brittle and delicate part of the structure, the stone formation of that <Col N="706" /> part of the Burren.  My clear preference would be that no element, no matter how small, should be put in the Gortlecka area.</P>
    <P>Had I the choice, I would recommend to the Minister that the new roadway that surrounds that area should be removed and that there be proper zoning. The Burren is a vast area.  Certain parts of it are more delicate and more vulnerable than other parts.  I would like to see specifically stated in the report a zoning plan for the area that would allow for the control and regulation of the flow of visitors to the area.</P>
    <P>I keep in mind what has happened at Stonehenge in southern England and most recently in Iona.  The decision of the late Labour leader in Britain, John Smith, to be buried in Iona &mdash; I was touched at the time by his choice of burial place &mdash; generated fresh interest in Iona.  Large numbers of people, their curiosity rekindled, decided they would like to visit Iona.  As a result of this increased traffic irreparable damage has been done to the island.  This is what can happen when well meaning people prompted by curiosity, good marketing and good publicity go in their numbers to places as ancient and vulnerable as Iona.  We should learn from that experience.</P>
    <P>When the final plans are put in place we should make proper provision to ensure that we can control the flow of people, particularly on to Gortlecka, which is the most vulnerable and brittle part of the Burren.  I hope proper education programmes will be put in place not just for visitors to the area but for ourselves, that those of us who knew the history of the Burren better in our earlier days would be refreshed and have a heightened awareness and appreciation of the importance of the Burren and of its vulnerability and delicacy.</P>
    <P>It is important also to carry out an audit, listing all the items of archaeological importance, all the flora and fauna and other elements of wildlife in the area.  We would then have a clearer picture of what we want to preserve and keep in place.  A number of the pine <Col N="707" /> martens in the Fenore area have been destroyed for one reason or another, and that is a big loss to the area. Because we do not have a national or local audit it is hard to specify the extent of damage at a given time, and it is impossible to monitor the conservation of so many diverse elements.  It is, therefore, important to put an audit in place. It is also important to zone the area and, through that, to regulate access and traffic.</P>
    <P>It has been convincingly argued by people who know a great deal more about these things than I that the park should be extended to include the wetlands to the south-west.  In the Minister's opening address he said that although that would be laudable it might create difficulties in terms of access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an issue I will be asking the Minister to look at, not particularly in his response today but in further consultations.  I understand this plan is to be discussed for about 12 weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>If that can be done, it should be done.  We may not get another opportunity to do that and to incorporate the wetlands that are very valuable in their own right into the Burren National Park.  That opportunity ought not to be passed up.  I appeal to the Minister to take that point on board and work on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local people are the primary custodians of this place.  I would like to see them being involved in all the discussions henceforth.  At the end of the day this is probably one of the most exciting prospects that has been presented to this generation of parliamentarians. If we succeed in putting in place a proper plan for the Burren <Col N="708" /> National Park, and if through that plan we succeed in preserving for this and successive generations what is one of our greatest treasures, we will have done very important work.  I hope that this can be made to happen.  I hope the final plan will be the best fit for everybody.</P>
    <P>I stress again the fundamental importance of engaging the support of the farmers and the people of Clare.  This is a time for healing.  There has been a lot of division which I very much regret in such a close knit community.  It is a matter of great regret that the history of the Burren to date has led to so much dissension and division.  I hope that in the context of putting this plan in place we will be able to heal those divisions, reach consensus and move forward.  I very much hope that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Burren, as the Minister has said, is a place of great beauty, the result of the combination of the works of nature and of man during the past 5,000 years.  The early settlers left their mark on the landscape.  The dolmen or portal tomb at Poulnabrone is one of the country's most striking architectural features. The extraordinary geological feature that is Mullaghmore is one of the great works of nature.  Often when writers attempt to convey the special attractiveness of the area the words &ldquo;tranquillity&rdquo; and &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; are used to try to describe the particular charm and magic that people find in the Burren.  The word &ldquo;silent&rdquo; is sometimes used in this context.  A number of people came to my office in Ennis to express their concern and to explain to me the value of this silence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that during the past six years or so the words &ldquo;Burren&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mullaghmore&rdquo; have tended to be associated in many people's minds with protestation, rancour and tumult.  I hope the day is not far distant when all this will have faded into the past and the <Col N="709" /> Burren will once again regain its reputation as a place of beauty and tranquillity. The Burren has so much to inspire both the local community and the visitor alike.  Apart from the indefinable atmosphere to which I referred there is the great wealth of archaeological remains, the striking beauty of the limestone pavement and of the uplands and, of course, the distinctive flora which is of international scientific interest.  I understand that the limestone of the Burren, which occupies less than 1 per cent of Ireland's land area, contains more than 75 per cent of its plant species.  The Burren is able to support this wide range of species as a result of its unique combination of geology, topography, climate and altitude.  I pay tribute to the farmers who occupy the Burren area as they have contributed to the retention of this habitat.</P>
    <P>Those of us who know and love the Burren will commend the Minister for commissioning this wide-ranging study. The consultants, Brady, Shipman and Martin, have a long and credible track record in landscape and tourism planning. It is worth mentioning again, as the Minister has done, that their report has received general approval across the spectrum of opinion, but this is to be expected from such a reputable firm of consultants.</P>
    <P>There has been a good response to the Minister's consultation process.  I wish to point out, particularly to Deputy de Valera, that in February the Minister set a final date of 16 May for receipt of observations on this study.  This debate has come on us very quickly.  I do not think there has been any untoward delay.  The Minister's intentions have been honourable.  He has to return to the court to present a document which will have to satisfy a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister was agreeable to this matter in the first instance, but the Deputy seems to give the impression that the Minister was trying to delay matters, avoid consultations and hide from her.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There was no need for the Deputy to thump the table. That was unnecessary dramatics.</P>
      <P>There was extensive consultation and a great many people made submissions. I acknowledge all the submissions.  We received a joint submission from Burren National Park Support Association, Clare Heritage Centre and Corofin and District Development Company; individual submissions from the Burren National Park Support Association, the Clare Heritage Centre and the Corofin and District Development Company which had particular points it wanted to make outside the joint submission; John A. O'Reilly, architect and North Clare Heritage Association.  The consultants agreed with most of this submission.  In fairness, Deputy Killeen did a great deal of work on his submission, making 50 strong points, some of which we agreed with and others we did not.</P>
      <P>Submissions were received from Kilkeedy Development Association, the Tubber Game and Gun Club, Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, David Drew, John Foster on behalf of the Burren Action Group, Eamonn de Buitléar, Lisdoonvarna Fáilte Ltd., Liam Kirwan, Kilnaboy Community Development Association, Comhar Conradh na Boirne, local representatives of Lisdoonvarna, Burren Consensus and the National Heritage Council.  The National Heritage Council also submitted an appendix. Submissions were received from Francis Brew, Tubber, Plantlife and the Burren Action Group.  Some 26 observations were given to the Minister on the draft management plan.  This is indicative of the keen interest in the Burren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, there has been something approaching a consensus that the future lies in smaller rather than in larger-scale developments and I am pleased to see the proposals for centres <Col N="711" /> at Corofin, Kilfenora and Ballyvaughan. The Minister has referred already to the key role to be played by Corofin and to the large measure of agreement on that matter.  I support this fully.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy de Valera in taking this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of the late Naoise Cleary who was the inspiration behind the Corofin Heritage Centre and whose pioneering work has been an example to many others throughout the country.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that his proposals for Corofin included support for the heritage centre.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, be careful that we do not do an injustice to Kilfenora. A careful balancing act will be required to ensure that one centre does not advance to the unfair disadvantage of the other.  Like the Corofin heritage centre, the Burren centre at Kilfenora grew out of the local community.  This year it is proudly celebrating its 21st anniversary.  I wish it well and hope it will survive and prosper to celebrate another landmark.  It is important that the centres at Kilfenora and Corofin should complement each other so that visitors will be encouraged to visit both and, of course, the proposed centre at Ballyvaughan.</P>
    <P>There are many interesting stories to be told about the Burren.  Kilfenora, with its rich architectural and archaeological remains, is well placed to tell the story of the built heritage.  Ballyvaughan, by the sea, might concentrate on the maritime influence on the Burren and the rich marine ecology.  These are just ideas.  The important thing is that there is co-operation and co-ordination of the three centres so that each can benefit from the other and together present a comprehensive picture of what the Burren has to offer.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward for the Gortlecka site may be seen as a compromise, which on its own is a good thing. Most arguments are solved by compromise, but there is also a compelling logic in the arguments put forward in support of this solution.  The next step is for the <Col N="712" /> Minister to satisfy the High Court that he may proceed with a modest development at Gortlecka, and then for him to submit a plan for planning permission.  I sincerely hope that people on all sides will exercise as much restraint as possible and consider the Minister's proposals when they emerge as objectively and honestly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with the Burren national park study, an excellent document. I look forward to the report on the Burren monuments which the Minister has commissioned and which he expects to have very soon.  We now have a vision for the future of the Burren, and it is up to us to work together to ensure it comes to fruition.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the work of the steering group, which comprised Seán Ó Cofaigh of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; Professor Frank Convery of An Taisce; Dr. Alan Craig of the National Parks and Wildlife Service; Doreen Graham of Rural Resources Development Limited, who represented Leader; Ciaran Lynch of Clare County Council; Michael Roberts of Shannon Development and Professor Curtin of UCG.  They did a good day's work in undertaking this task for which I thank them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the only Member of the Oireachtas who lives in the Burren area, I tend to feel &mdash; as do many people in the Burren &mdash; that what I have to say in relation to this troubled matter might be disregarded to some extent.  Many of the people of that area feel their views are disregarded.  I certainly felt that the report produced by the steering group, for which I am grateful, deserved a <Col N="713" /> response.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, said, I submitted a long and sometimes critical response.  The general thrust was in support of a great deal of what is outlined in the report, with some serious reservations.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say there is a significant level of agreement in the submissions I have seen on many of the basic issues. Having seen the population trends in the first document, I am greatly surprised there is any member of the Oireachtas from the Burren area because of the falling population. Unfortunately, as almost everybody has said, the national park project has had a troubled history.  Mistakes were made on all sides.  Everybody has to acknowledge that and start from that point.  I have attempted at all stages to set out my own views &mdash; sometimes very strongly, but truthfully and honourably &mdash; and for that I have suffered.  The Minister probably believes that also applies to him, as does everybody who has strongly expressed their views on the issue.</P>
    <P>I was very critical of the fact that the elected members from north Clare were not represented on the steering group. The function of Clare County Council in relation to the preparation of the development plan was strongly impinged on in some of what was contained in the report.  Equally, in regard to the preparation of the conservation guidelines for the NHAs, there ought to have been a representative of the farming community, either locally or nationally, on that body.  These omissions undermine, to some extent, the credibility of the reports produced.</P>
    <P>In common with other speakers, I am grateful for the documents I received from a host of groups, including my local community in Kilnaboy, three joint submissions from Corofin, the Burren centre in Kilfenora, the Burren action group, the IFA, the Heritage Council and many others.  I appreciate the courtesy of people, many of whom disagree strongly with me on aspects of this issue, in making available to me copies of their submissions.  I intend to <Col N="714" /> pursue this issue in that spirit.  As I said, I made a submission as a concrete and constructive contribution to advancing the debate.  I think it will be treated in that manner.</P>
    <P>In a sense, I feel sorry for the Minister because many of my neighbours and people who live in the Burren are saying he is not an objective judge &mdash; which is no more than they would say about me if I were in that position &mdash; to decide on this issue.  It is being strongly said by people in my area that the Minister has a vested interest in a particular direction. It would be a great pity if that was the basis on which his final decision in this regard was judged.  Unfortunately, a great deal of damage has been done to relations between the indigenous Burren population and the environmental lobbies generally.  That is unhelpful and the upshot will be greater difficulty in having a meaningful and worthwhile conservation policy for the Burren.  The people of the Burren and the landscape in which they reside ought to be the overriding considerations in whatever is decided by the Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the draft conservation guidelines for the NHAs, I have already mentioned that there is no farmer representative on the steering group.  Farmers feel there is very little appreciation of their rights in that area.  A number of them have said to me that they feel very strongly that the approach in relation to them was rather high handed.  The IFA submission sets out much more briefly than mine, and probably more cogently, the concerns of farmers, which include the need to address the population decline and the advantages of an enhanced role for REPS, including provision for access to lands.  I ask the Minister to consider that and take it up with his counterpart.</P>
    <P>Tourism is very important for the future of north Clare and is at the centre of the whole contention.  There is a fear that the Occupiers' Liability Act, which was passed last year, does not sufficiently address the liability of farmers. I often said that we would have to await a court adjudication on the Bill to know <Col N="715" /> how good it was.  Farmers have told me very strongly about those fears.  The IFA submission states that the goodwill of farmers is of paramount importance, and that it is there to be won.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The IFA strongly supports the completion of the centre as originally proposed. Deputy Quill takes the entirely opposite view, as do some of the others who have made submissions.  In some senses, that is the kernel of the difficulty and the area which has to be ultimately addressed.  The proposal to remove all the existing work is a recipe for disaster. I strongly disagree with her contention that Gortlecka is a most vulnerable site. That does not accord with my memory of it, which extends over 40 years.  It was a very actively used quarry for a great deal of that time.  It subsequently fell into disuse and was an appalling and unsightly dump.  To the rear there was a bulldozed field.  By no stretch of the imagination could it be considered an extremely vulnerable Burren habitat.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the local community in which I served as a teacher for 18 years and very much in tune with the views of my neighbours expressed strongly in their submission.  Some minor matters could be addressed without too much difficulty.  These include the completion of the car park at the local church in Kilnaboy where for at least six months of the year members of the local community are severely inconvenienced when they attend Mass on a Sunday by buses and other traffic travelling to the park.  This results in a huge build-up of traffic in a rural area.</P>
    <P>The car park cannot be completed because of the successful court action brought by the Burren Action Group to which the Minister referred.  As a direct result the county council is prevented from completing roadworks and the property of many farmers has been left open on the roadside.  This means that their animals often stray on the road and neighbouring properties which is not conducive to good relations.  The <Col N="716" /> matter ought to have been dealt with much sooner.</P>
    <P>Some farmers have expressed concern that, if reasonable access is not provided to public lands in the park, their lands will be used to gain access by visitors to the area.  This would be unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the Burren and north Clare regional water services plan submitted by Clare County Council to Brussels in 1994 which appears to have been abandoned.  To make development in north Clare possible and meaningful the schemes at Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, New Quay, Lahinch and Corofin need to be completed. The people of the Burren have said that despite all the concern expressed at national and European level there is no commitment to the Burren and its people.  I agree that is the inescapable conclusion.</P>
    <P>A number of minor points should have been dealt with in the report.  A considerable number of vehicles park on the roadside at the site in Gortlecka extending into more vulnerable areas. This will continue throughout the summer until the matter is resolved.</P>
    <P>The baseline study of lichen growth in the area undertaken by the county council is not mentioned in the report. It is important that this material is built on.</P>
    <P>The Ballyline weather recording station is operated by the ESB but there is a view that monitoring in the area ought to be carried out independently. This should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The American mink has, unfortunately, encroached on the park.  Despite what the report states something needs to be done about this.  I have seen quite a few in the past year and they have the potential to become a major problem.</P>
    <P>The reference in the report to a sense of tranquillity is slightly exaggerated. While this may be the case in part of the park area it is not the case at Gortlecka, the proposed site for the centre.</P>
    <P>One sentence in the report is insulting and condescending to local people.  It reads: &ldquo;... to help local people understand and appreciate the need for the <Col N="717" /> park in their area&rdquo;.  This is the kind of approach which does most damage to relations between those interested in conservation and those who live in the area.  Many local people have said they are surprised at the level of interest shown by outsiders in the Burren in recent years, the national park in particular, when they were oblivious to the dumping at the site I mentioned and many other problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to carry out a study of monuments in the Burren.  This is extremely important. In seeking planning permission applicants are required in many instances to carry out archaeological digs which can be extremely expensive.  The Minister should consider subsidising them and storing the body of information gleaned in his Department.</P>
    <P>I stated in my submission that the host community has for generations preserved the natural environment of the area, and that, unfortunately, more damage has been done in the last five or six years during the dispute than in several previous generations combined. I also said it is no accident that many locals in the Burren have rejected the practices and beliefs of centuries regarding the environment partly at least in reaction to condescending and, occasionally, insulting preaching from people who claim to be interested in conservation.  That is the nub of the problem which will have to be addressed.  We will have to reach the stage where local people and farmers feel included.</P>
    <P>The report contends that large scale development would not be readily accommodated in towns, villages and rural areas.  No evidence is presented in support of this statement.  I can see no reason villages such as Corofin, Kilfenora or Ballyvaughan could not accommodate a large centre.  In general the report's conclusions and findings, under the heading of tourism in particular, have not been proven.  I strongly disagree with its thrust.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="718" /> Carey, said, the Burren Centre in Kilfenora has been operating successfully for 21 years for which congratulations are due to the people involved.  Since 1990 £120,000 has been paid in PAYE and PRSI, £50,000 in VAT and £400,000 in wages.  There are four permanent and many part-time jobs.  In the debate where people were either pro or anti on the national park my views on the centre in Kilfenora were misrepresented. This was unhelpful and did not reflect the reality.</P>
    <P>I stated in my submission that the suggestion regarding a partnership approach with the Burren Display Centre in Kilfenora in paragraph 2.23 of the report was not new; that, unfortunately, many of the problems previously encountered in bringing it to fruition were likely to continue and that the main stumbling block previously had been the requirement for the local community to provide a substantial level of funding from their own resources.  I went on to say that unless this could be successfully circumvented and aid at or close to 100 per cent could be provided the prospects for Kilfenora under this strategy seemed far more negative than under the original national park proposal. That is still the case.  The matter needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the Kilfenora centre should have been the first, not the last, to be given the opportunity to meet departmental officials.  This is a matter of regret.  People from other centres had meetings with them in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>I see great danger for the Kilfenora and Corofin centres in the fragmentation and necklace of small centres proposed, some of which, inevitably, will prove unviable.  There will be great difficulty in agreeing the division of subjects to be interpreted.  They will have minimum impact.  The question of capital and current funding will have to be addressed.  If the Corofin Heritage Centre and the Burren Centre in Kilfenora have to compete with a number of small centres whose capital or current funds are provided by the State they will be in <Col N="719" /> a worse position than they would have been under the original proposal for the national park and its centre at Gortlecka. That must not be allowed to happen.  In regard to what might happen at Corofin, the views of those involved in the Corofin Heritage Centre should be taken on board.  Those people have a successful record in what is a difficult area because by its nature it is not designed to attract huge numbers of people.  They have experience and have made a worthwhile contribution to the area.</P>
    <P>The late Dr. Naoise Ó Cléirigh who taught me at primary school and who frequently referred to the need to defend the honour of the little village imbued in all of us a sense of defence of our own place which was open to the construction during this debate that we were anti other places &mdash; certainly that is not the case.  I say with pride that I would like to see worthwhile development take place there and the excellent work there should be complemented by whatever is provided.  The same applies to the Dysert O'Dea Castle development where excellent work has been done on a shoestring budget and where those who have carried out this work feel under grave threat from some of the proposals in this report.</P>
    <P>In Ballyvaughan there are two centres and a third is under construction.  I do not know the proposals in relation to developing those centres or providing a new one.  If it involves providing a new centre we will come to a stage in north Clare where there are many centres, none of which will be particularly strong.  The danger of competition and fragmentation is real and has to be addressed at this stage.  Equally a case can be made for developments in Lisdoonvarna, Doolin, Ennistymon, Kinvara and so on but in each development one needs to establish in advance the interest and interpretation or whatever is appropriate to the area.  It is particularly important to establish that the development does not cut across one of the existing centres or that the end result does not mean they are all so <Col N="720" /> weakened that they militate against each other and have minimal impact in the overall context of north Clare.</P>
    <P>The principal fault with this report is that in my view at the back of their minds the steering group, the consultants and others had to arrive at a solution which would gain a level of acceptance.  We commend them for that. In doing so they may have erred in going for a dispersal of proposals to a greater extent than can be accommodated and sustained in north Clare, particularly in regard to tourism. Further consultation is needed.  I accept the Minister is constrained by the court's ruling and has to return to the court with a proposal.  The view of the people in my area is that they are not satisfied with the present level of consultation and would like to have a further input.</P>
    <P>The cause of conservation in the Burren and attempts to provide a viable community would be better served by allowing more time and doing the job better.  While the Minister has to make a proposal to the court he ought to consider asking for time for further consultations.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to offer my assistance towards reaching a solution.  I believe strongly that the original proposal would have been better but I live in the real world and I know that accommodations have to be reached.  At the end of the day we all have to play a part in reaching what I hope will be an amicable solution.  My support and help is available to the Minister but I will continue to point out that certain options are more acceptable and useful in the long-term than some of those proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MoosajeeBhamjee" hpid="Dr. Bhamjee Dr. Bhamjee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Bhamjee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed speech and giving us the legal history because this issue has caused enough controversy.  It has resulted in my election victory and that of Deputy Killeen and the loss of Brendan Daly to the Seanad.  It is strange that an issue of conservation should result in political problems and people <Col N="721" /> losing parliamentary seats but, unfortunately, that is the case.  We should also thank the steering committee who have put in much work and read many submissions in the preparation of this document and who will continue to work to bring the plan to fruition.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he continues to have daily consultations with people.</P>
      <P>The Burren National Park is an area of unique beauty.  People visit it for its isolation and silence and for its flora and fauna.  It is essential that its uniqueness is preserved for future generations because we now live in a world that is mechanised and there is noise and pollution around us.  The areas to which we can escape are declining all the time. We in Ireland are fortunate that we have more than our fair share of them but when we look to modern Europe it is not difficult to understand why areas like the Burren are so popular with visitors. I listened to the radio this morning and heard two Dutch people say they holiday in Ireland for the scenery and isolation.  We must be careful not to lose this asset.</P>
      <P>The Brady Shipman Martin report is most welcome and will be appreciated by most people not only in Clare but in the rest of Ireland because the problem of the Burren was not a problem of north Clare or County Clare or of Ireland, it extended to the whole of Europe and, indeed, further afield.  Submissions have been received from all parts of the world.  In global terms the Burren is unique.  Hence its inclusion as a World Heritage Site listing.  We in Ireland have an obligation to preserve it not just for ourselves but for the countless thousands of visitors who come to study and enjoy it.  During the controversy there were many visitors resulting in traffic jams in Corofin.  It was good to see people enjoy the Burren.  Nowadays our children appreciate only television and radio and we need to encourage them to appreciate nature in all its forms and beauty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not underestimate the potential threat to the environment in <Col N="722" /> the region.  For example, one of the submissions showed there is a market for limestone paving across Europe.  The Burren is an obvious source for such material.  We must make sure we do not allow short-term prospecting licences or any form of mineral exploitation in the area.  It would be detrimental to think even on those lines.</P>
    <P>The potential for this report is enormous because it is the first time in Ireland that such a report has sought to integrate the competing goals of environmental conservation and local economic development.  On this the report's authors and the Minister are to be congratulated.  The establishment of natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation to form the nucleus of a national park are welcome and long overdue.  The assignment of special areas of conservation should allow Ireland to sign up to the EU habitat's directive and to control potentially damaging developments in land use.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Deputies Killeen and de Valera it is good to note that we are not as acrimonious as we might have been some time ago.  It is our duty to lead the community and set the example.  This is a good report and we should encourage the community to follow it and do all we can to improve tourism in the area.  I thank Deputy de Valera who applied much pressure on the Minister to have this report discussed. It is good to see all of us working in the one direction.  This is about reconciliation.  As Deputy Killeen said, the issue was divisive and is still a problem in the community.  Let us try by our example to get it going again.</P>
    <P>The people of Clare have had time to reflect on the proposed site for Mullaghmore and the majority believe &mdash; in contrast to Deputy Killeen's view &mdash; that the original proposal, which was described at the time as the only option available, was too narrow in its prescription. I believe now, as I did then, that the dispersal of visitors from the environmentally sensitive areas, such as Mullaghmore, to the local villages, <Col N="723" /> including Corofin, Kilfenora and Ballyvaughan, is required.  The report endorses this point.  It ensures the environmental damage which existed with the Mullaghmore site is prevented and maximises the economic potential for locals.  Many people would like to benefit from the environmental potential of the area and the wider view of the location's development is now shared by an increasing percentage of the population.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of the report is the highlighting of how the pressure on agricultural production in the 1970s and 1980s affected the conservation of the region.  We must thank the farmers who did much work but preserved the area. They must be encouraged to continue to do so, but they also need adequate economic and agricultural development. They must be encouraged to stay in the area because one of the problems facing rural areas is depopulation.  The Minister for Education recently announced that the small national school in Carron, which was due to lose a teacher, will be retained as a two teacher school.  This is an encouraging sign that the Government is interested in rural areas and concerned about depopulation.  This should be welcomed.  This matter is not just a small local issue; other major aspects are involved.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Killeen said, tourism is essential for the well-being of the region.  Winter tourism is particularly important and the Minister for Tourism and Trade is considering how to encourage this type of tourism in the area.  The plan is strong in that regard because one can go to the mountains in January and February in Ireland.  In Europe people go to the mountains for snow holidays and many Irish people take sun holidays at that time.  It is nice to encourage walks in the area and this should be done.  If the idea of winter tourism was taken on board, people might open bed and breakfasts over Christmas and families might be encouraged to go to the region.  This aspect is important in terms <Col N="724" /> of development and increased revenue in the area.</P>
    <P>Tourists should be encouraged to visit the different areas in addition to the local centres because each part of the Burren has a different aspect which can be enjoyed.  The centres should be used to encourage people to visit the various parts.  The impression is that only one type of tourist visits Ireland, but the Burren attracts many different types, including people on bicycles, backpackers and those who love walking.  Provision should also be made for these people.  If these aspects are considered, different types of tourists could be attracted to the area.  Even if they only spend a few pence here and there, it all helps the development of the area.</P>
    <P>Road widening is not necessary to encourage such tourists to visit the area. Narrow roads are part of Ireland and small lay-bys encourage people to stay alert.  It is important that the roads are not widened because this damages the environment.  Clare County Council caused some damage, but restrictions have been placed on it.  It should be encouraged to go back to rectify some of the damage, if possible.  The Minister mentioned another contentious issue, the car park in the area.  However, this matter can be overcome with further consultation.  The dispersal of cars to different parts should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Everybody in north Clare will benefit from the plan and it should be considered as a major resource.  Other areas are pertinent to the overall development of the region and some people have missed out.  I recently received submissions from the GAA asking me to examine the development of Michael Cusack's house in the Carron area.  This could be a great tourist attraction because although we lost last week, hurling is still an attractive sport.  Our team is young and we will be back next year. I asked the GAA for a business plan regarding the development of the house. It has been lobbying me for some time and this matter should be considered.  It is good that I am being lobbied by <Col N="725" /> different areas.  People may have other ideas about this matter in the future.</P>
    <P>A telephone mast was developed near ancient tombs in the Burren recently. This is contrary to the report and it is of concern because it shows what could happen in future.  People do not want such masts in the Burren because it would ruin what everybody has been trying to achieve.  It would be helpful if the Department examined this matter. Mobile telephones do not work well in that region and this is the reason for the mast.  However, it could be placed elsewhere and this aspect should be considered.</P>
    <P>I was also lobbied recently about Lemenagh Castle.  Between 300,000 and 500,000 people visit the historic castle each year.  It was part of earlier discussions and EU funding should be sought for its development, which is important.  Perhaps the Minister could consider these aspects because it could be another Bunratty Castle.  The more development which take place in the area, the better for everybody.  The work will cost £3 million and I do not know if the Minister has that type of money.  However, perhaps he will consider its development when he is part of the next Government.</P>

      <P>The issue which faced the previous Government was money.  If the project was not completed within a certain time, the money would not be available from Europe.  I am glad that aspect has faded into the background because conservation and heritage are priceless.  They will be there when we are all dead and buried.  However, a time limit should be set for the project and money be allocated to it.  People are concerned that pressure should be brought to bear in that regard to ensure it gets up and running.  I thank the Minister, Deputies de Valera and Killeen are also concerned about this matter.  Progress will be made and reconciliation should be encouraged.</P>

I will not ask the Minister for money for Mayo because if Deputy Bhamjee's long list of requests are met, his budget will be almost exhausted.  However, I wish him the best of luck over the next five years, inside or outside the House.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his efforts in the previous and current Governments to establish a national park in Mayo.  It is a worthy project which is well supported by the county and particularly by the people in the vast region between Newport and Erris.  This area contains thousands of acres of unique blanket bog.  If I recall correctly, approximately 12,000 acres is under the ownership of the Office of Public Works.  I urge the Minister to continue to enlarge that unique area.  With the co-operation of Mayo County Council, a joint study is being carried out and consultations are taking place between local people, elected representatives, statutory bodies and experts.</P>
      <P>My main reason for contributing to this debate is that there are parallels between what happened in the Burren area and what the Government is trying to achieve in Mayo.  While the Burren study involves four reports, I will concentrate on the one on natural heritage areas.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to make a formal announcement about the Mayo national park sooner rather than later.  That park would be capable of attaining the status of a world heritage site and could be considered under the NATURA 2000 programme.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has had an opportunity to visit the Céide Fields.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>While there can be too much consultation, particularly with outsiders, on some matters, the Céide Fields might not have been developed if there had been the controversy that surrounded attempts to establish other interpretative centres.  The Céide Fields are located in a scenic area and have been developed sensitively and the people there are proud of its success. The building, which has magnificent architecture, is located in a remote area and, apart from what it interprets, the project has been extremely successful.  I hope many other centres are established with the co-operation of all concerned.</P>
      <P>Mayo has the largest proposed acreage designated for natural heritage status, and this includes a large area west of Ballycastle and Lough Mask. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that every commonage to the west of those areas is mountainous and has encouraged farmers to avail of REPS to rejuvenate the commonages. We have had extremely heavy rainfall for the past ten years, but because of the good weather last year and so far this year, most of the commonages are green again.  We should endeavour to do what people have done in Scotland for the past 20 years and what is now being done in Australia. Soil should be tested and, with the agreement of the landowners, liquid aerial manuring should be carried out to fertilise those mountains.  The problem relates to climate, not stock.  While I accept we do not have the necessary scientific evidence to prove this and that officials have good intentions, I want my constituents to be able to make a viable living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry's call for sustainable farming in accordance with farm by farm inspection.  It has suggested a stocking level of one ewe to one acre up to a level of one ewe to seven acres, depending on the farm.  In more severe cases it has suggested a lower rate for one or two years until the commonage is rejuvenated.  I support the Department's stance in that regard <Col N="728" /> as it would ensure viable farming and encourage farmers to avail of the REPS. To date no farmer in my area has been notified that his or her land has been included in NHA.  Those who are aware their lands have been included were not given formal notification.  They received the information at public meetings or inspected maps which were deposited in various offices.  The consultation process leaves much to be desired.  It is important to have the support of the farming community.  I support the main thrust of what the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I met members of the western committee of the IFA last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the IFA does not represent all farmers. Officials of the Office of Public Works met officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry last week to discuss the most suitable stocking rates for farmers in NHA areas applying for REPS.  It has been suggested there should be one ewe ranging six to 17 acres of blanket bog, depending on the condition of the bog, but that was not greeted with great applause in Mayo where there are many acres of blanket bog.  In effect, a farmer with 100 acres of commonage, if at the upper end of the range, might be entitled to have only six ewes on that 100 acres and he would not be inclined to apply for the REPS. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has suggested sustainable numbers.  The Office of Public Works stocking rates should be linked to the rates for degraded areas suggested by the Department.  The bogs in Erris traditionally carried out for five ewes and in the main farmers would accept the Department's formula and strongly resist that proposed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past farmers have been encouraged to avail of EU and State supports. In west Mayo farmers increased stock numbers, as advised by Teagasc.  Isolated degraded areas are a direct result <Col N="729" /> of State and European intervention. Farmers are the best conservators of a rural environment.  They are not there for the short-term, they want to pass on a viable and sustainable holding to their sons and daughters.  Like parts of Clare, the population of west Mayo is decreasing. We do not want it to become solely the playground for the playboys of Europe who come here on holidays to inquisitively look at how we eke out a living and leave us wondering how we managed without the tourism dollars for nine months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works proposals that drains on deep wet areas should be blocked, presumably to ensure that the bogs do not dry out, have not been widely welcomed.  Farmers believe that if such drains are blocked, bogs will become wet and pose a danger to their sheep.  If the proposed stance of the Office of Public Works is adopted people considering availing of the REPS and reducing their stock levels may not proceed, which could prolong the overgrazing problem.</P>
    <P>I tabled a number of questions on mining in the recent past.  There have been attempts to renew a prospecting licence in the Doo Lough-Delphi Valley. I congratulate the Minister who, apart from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, had the courage to answer the questions.  Questions tabled to the Ministers for the Environment, Marine, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Tourism and Trade were passed to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. I was encouraged by his reply. The proposed prospecting area south of Westport and Croagh Patrick, which runs westwards as far as the Atlantic coast, is part of the largest natural heritage area in west Mayo.  Why is it unacceptable for farmers to carry out certain traditional type farm practices while it is acceptable for mining companies to engage in prospecting, which involves drilling, trenching and noise? This natural heritage area in Mayo is frequented by a small flock of geese, although I have never seen them.  I am <Col N="730" /> not an expert on conversation, but I was encouraged to hear the Minister say he is concerned about such matters.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the legislation.  I will make every effort to protect our natural heritage and ensure mining does not take place.  The future of the country is in agriculture and tourism.  Since only a small number of people are involved in the mining industry it would be of little benefit to the local community and would provide only a short-term gain.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Seamus Hughes as a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Ba mhaith liom chomh maith chomhgháirdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire as an tuairisc seo a chur os ár gcomhair. Is ábhar maith díospóireachta é.  Tá roinnt rudaí ann gur féidir linn aontú orthu agus cúpla rud eile nach féidir linn aontú orthu.</P>
      <P>The Minister probably expects me to talk about Dublin North but, even though Dunsoghly Castle in St. Margaret's inspired the roof of Bunratty Castle, I will refrain from doing so and instead direct my attention to the Burren.  The Minister is trying to come to terms with the aftermath of a controversy.  He is in a difficult position given that part of the development, particularly at Mullaghmore, was far advanced when work was stopped as a result of legal action and there was a call for the matter to be reconsidered.  The foundation of the interpretative centre is, however, still in existence, as is the sewerage infrastructure, allowing for a future administration, in which Labour may be involved, to revert to the original plan.</P>
      <P>As in the case of the Burren, the decision not to go ahead with the casino in Dublin West was a good one.  My colleague in the European Parliament, Patricia McKenna, sought reassurance in that regard, and I hope Fianna Fáil gives an assurance that if it returns to Government it will stand by the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that such an assurance be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to answer the Deputy's questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand over my request, which is reasonable and should be answered in a civil way.</P>
      <P>There is a reference in the report to the fact that villages such as Corofin will act as tourist centres, providing information on the Burren.  That principle, which is welcome, should be further developed.  The question, however, still needs to be answered as to why a facility is needed at Mullaghmore.  Different figures have been quoted as to the number of people who will visit the area &mdash; 100,000 was mentioned and some people even forecast that the number will be 200,000.  The Cliffs of Moher, an attraction that provides little revenue to the State, attracts 450,000 visitors.  In terms of conservation, the figures given are horrendous, and the area may not necessarily benefit in economic terms.  I hope the sewerage works will be dismantled so that there will not be a temptation in future to go ahead with the original plan.  The fact that road widening took place is also an invitation to those who may wish to revert to the original plan in the future.</P>
      <P>Given that the size of the national park is minimal in a European context, a vast extension of it would be welcome taking into account ecological factors such as the wetlands, as referred to by Éamon de Buitléir.  The Minister has a limited remit in regard to the Burren. We should aspire to conserving the Burren by devising an integrated plan, taking into account the needs of farmers, people involved in tourism, local people and those with a wider interest in the Burren.  If the area is to be conserved such a plan must be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> I hope the Minister will develop the concept that local villages will be the main tourist centres and that the Mullaghmore site will be protected by removing any temptation for a reversion to the original plan.  Local people should be involved in development of the area, not only through consultation, but there should be greater local autonomy, with decisions taken on a democratic basis.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile debate.  We are dealing with an issue of national importance, but the debate should be locally focused.  It is important that all those who made submissions are thanked, as they played a major part in the development of the area.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the rural environment protection scheme is very welcome but we must be vigilant in regard to its implementation as I understand certain unscrupulous people participating in it may be considering disposing of some artefacts because it costs too much to protect them.  That aspect should be taken into consideration when we are talking about a conservation policy.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Minister makes every effort to have the habitats directive transposed into Irish law as soon as possible.  Because of the existing vacuum we are losing precious habitats and artefacts to overseas countries.  That should not be allowed to continue and I hope the Minister will give this matter urgent consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has put on the record the details of the Brady Shipman Martin report.  We must now take stock of what was achieved by the protracted, tortuous and highly expensive exercise that was embarked upon.  The Minister, who one might say was opposed politically and otherwise to the Office of Public Works proposal, is now trying to find fancy words and is quoting extracts from the Brady Shipman Martin report to recommend what is now being proposed for the new site, lest it ever be deemed that he said toilet and staff facilities, <Col N="733" /> limited visitor information, basic shelter, etc. should be provided on the Mullaghmore site.</P>

      <P>I am simply addressing the issues arising from the Minister's contribution; if he cannot listen to them, that is his problem.  The reality is that the Minister does not have any confidence now in the Office of Public Works.  He dragged an organisation through the courts and he comes back into this House waffling about getting the Office of Public Works to lodge a planning application for the Mullaghmore site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister is doing and it is a most incompetent way of dealing with this whole area.  Do we need people to come from Holland to tell Clare County Council the value of the Burren, its historical background and the need to protect it?  That exercise was the greatest waste of taxpayers' money and the European Union will probably demand its funding be returned, thanks to the Minister's inefficiency and incompetence in this matter. That is the reality, courtesy of the Minister's contribution today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister tried to dress up the incompetence he has displayed since taking office.  Has he ever visited Glenbeigh, one of the finest parks in Ireland, where the Office of Public Works built an interpretative centre which is sensitively <Col N="735" /> located in such a way that it blends in with the local environment?  People were looking after our environment long before the Minister ever took an interest in it.</P>
      <P>The Minister fouled the due process in the case and the matter ended up in the courts with points of law being considered in regard to planning matters. He now tells us the matter must be clarified even before he can allow what he believes is the correct report to be implemented.  That is what has happened here.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister ever hear of a special amenity area order?  Does he not appreciate the fact that Clare County Council has a county development plan into which various protections are built? Why did the Minister not trust the officials in Clare County Council to evaluate environmental impact studies? Does he not have the same trust in the elected members and officials of Clare County Council?  He should have trusted them but he did not, for political reasons.  Some of his academic colleagues in Galway launched a campaign and he hitched his political wagon to it. He has done a U-turn in regard to the proposal he supported in this report, and he cannot deny that.</P>
      <P>Rather than have it said that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht proposed development on the Mullaghmore site, he came up with a townland name to which he referred in his opening statement and which he says is the name by which the site will be known.  That is totally different from what was proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to outline what I believe will happen in regard to this site. Hopefully, because of awareness nationally and internationally of the Burren, many thousands of people will visit the area.  At some stage in the future the Minister, or his successor, will inform the House that the facilities to which he referred in his opening statement are being extended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;due to the chaos being caused by the increase in the number of visitors.  If the Minister does not take any action now, chaos will be created in this area because people will always want to visit the Burren due to the worldwide interest in the area.  If the Minister does not provide facilities for those visitors, the local people will be totally inconvenienced.  The facilities to which the Minister referred in his opening statement will probably have to be extended because of the level of interest in the area, and the Minister will be unable to do anything about it.  He cannot turn people away and he will be caught in the mess he has created.</P>
      <P>The original proposal was put forward by people who have distinguished records in regard to protecting our environment.  The Glenbeigh park is probably the best example of how an interpretative centre should be built having regard to the local environment, yet the Minister told us today that such sites should have basic audio-visual facilities.  They were provided for in the original proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brady Shipman Martin were also involved in preparing a report on the canals.  The parks department of Dublin County Council has responsibility for approximately 6,000 acres, including the most sensitive parkland settings in the county.  It has done excellent work in this regard over the years.  Are these reports and studies an excuse because the Minister does not have the funding to carry out the work?  We did not need a study of the canals to be carried out <Col N="737" /> to tell us that tow paths are needed, the locks need to be replaced and basic facilities should be provided.</P>

However, my Department has a comprehensive control programme which includes checks and reviews carried out on a regular and targeted basis to ensure that social welfare payments are only received by those who are entitled to them and that employers and the selfemployed are fulfilling their PRSI obligations.</P>
      <P>In recent years the reorganisation of my Department's structures and ongoing technological developments have combined to facilitate a more coordinated, focused and effective approach to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 500 staff working on fraud and abuse control activities, including specific investigation units which work at local, regional and national level within the Department. These units, one of which works in conjunction with Revenue staff, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare payments, review customers' means for assistance payments and monitor their ongoing entitlements <Col N="739" /> to social welfare payments.  In 1995 some 243,000 claim reviews and 8,000 employer inspections were carried out, resulting in savings of £124.5 million to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have initiated a fundamental re-appraisal of control procedures in the context of the strategic management initiative.  The objective of this review is to ensure that the Department's resources are deployed in the most cost-effective manner to maximise returns in terms of eliminating incorrect payments and reducing fraud and abuse. Arising out of this review the current control approach is aimed at having systems and procedures in place that prevent and minimise the risk of incorrect payments, fraud and abuse; detecting incorrect payments, fraud and abuse of schemes at the earliest possible stage, and detecting unpaid PRSI contributions by employers and the self-employed; and ensuring that the public are aware of the risks and penalties for defrauding the social welfare system and dealing decisively with cases of fraud and abuse detected.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new computerised system, known as the integrated short-term schemes system, has been implemented in local offices.  This system has enabled a greater focus on control at claim registration, particularly with regard to establishing the identity of claimants and validating increases claimed for dependants.  This system will also facilitate the computerisation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the first time.</P>
    <P>As part of the development of this system a major review of data held on both the central records and short-term schemes databases was undertaken. This review has assisted in preventing incorrect payments and will ensure that up-to-date quality data will be used in deciding claims.  In addition cross checks are carried out with other databases to highlight any irregularities.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them and are <Col N="740" /> delivered in an effective and efficient way.  I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</P>

      <P>In terms of specific control activities in 1995, 8,000 employers were inspected and 242,000 claimants had their claims reviewed.  A study of fraud and abuse of unemployment and disability payments was carried out on behalf of the Department in 1987.  This study showed the level of abuse to be 2 per cent in the case of unemployment payments and 1 per cent for disability benefit payments.  Savings from control activity in 1995 were £124.5 million, comprising £16 million in PAYE-PRSI arrears determined as a result of employer inspections and £108.5 million from scheme savings.  The total savings for the period 1991-95 amount to approximately £500 million. I can give the Deputy a breakdown of this figure if he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question, which seeks to establish to what extent I think the £124.5 million was a result of deliberate fraud.  It is <Col N="741" /> impossible to state categorically that X percentage of that amount which has been saved for the taxpayers arises from deliberate fraud.  In many cases over-payments are made because people simply have not informed the Department of changes in their circumstances.  In some cases failure to do this can result in a person not receiving his or her due entitlements.  It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to say that a particular proportion of this amount can defin-itely be attributable to fraud.  As I said, a survey carried out some years ago indicates the level of fraud at 1-2 per cent, depending on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 9, 29 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's report for 1995 which was published last week shows that a total of 574 complaints against my Department were received by his office in 1995.  This figure shows a reduction on 1994 when the number of social welfare cases received was 712.  There has been a steady reduction in recent years in the number of social welfare complaints made to the Ombudsman.  The number in 1992 was 820.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman completed action on 550 social welfare complaints during 1995, of which well over half were either discontinued, withdrawn or not upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the number of complaints, regard has to be had to the huge <Col N="743" /> scale of my Department's operations.  A measure of this is given by the fact that my Department makes over one and a half million decisions on individual entitlements during the course of a year. Another interesting statistic for comparison purposes is the number of appeals made to the social welfare appeals office against decisions given on claims made by my Department's deciding officers.  In 1995 a total of 12,353 such appeals were made.</P>
    <P>Although the trend in the number of complaints to the Ombudsman about social welfare claims is downward, I would obviously like to see a situation where there was less, and, ideally, no need for people to have to contact the Ombudsman.  Our aim is to ensure that all people who claim get their entitlements as speedily and accurately as possible.  This is something we are actively addressing in the context of the strategic management process within my Department.</P>
    <P>In his report the Ombudsman states that the fundamental cause of many complaints which he receives is a failure to provide appropriate information or reasons for decisions made by public bodies.  As far as my Department is concerned, the officials who administer the schemes are very aware of the importance of providing accurate information to people on their entitlements and of the need to ensure that those who make claims for social welfare payments are given full and easy to understand information about how their entitlements are worked out.  We have made significant progress in this area in the last few years and further improvements will be made in future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of this report and assure the House that I will be examining all of the points made by the Ombudsman in his report for 1995 which concern my Department to see what lessons are to be learned and what actions might be possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that 49 per cent of complaints in <Col N="744" /> relation to all Government Departments relate to his?  What precise audit procedures has he put in place within his Department to ensure that staff carry out their duties in an informative manner since the Ombudsman claimed that, while not furnishing incorrect advice, in many cases, that furnished by departmental staff was inadequate?  Has any action been taken on foot of any audit procedures undertaken to provide all claimants with a better service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of my Department to eliminate, in so far as humanly possible, the need for any claimant to have recourse to the Ombudsman.  The Deputy is correct, approximately 49 per cent of all complaints lodged with the Ombudsman relate to my Department.  I have already indicated that, within the context of 1.5 million decisions annually, 572 complaints to the Ombudsman is very low, particularly since half were found to be without foundation or were withdrawn before being concluded.  Therefore, the Deputy will see that those statistics are quite favourable to my Department overall.  I do not say that in any complacent sense.  My Department is fully aware of the need to ensure staff treat all claimants with due respect and furnish them with the fullest possible information. A bulletin will be issued to all staff shortly drawing their attention to the principles of good administration, as outlined by the Ombudsman, among other things, citizens' right to be heard, to receive sufficient information, to assistance and representation, to be given reasons and to be told what remedies are available to them.  I reiterate that my departmental staff are very well informed and reminded constantly of the rights of all claimants who seek assistance from our offices.  Given the relatively low level of complaints to the Ombudsman, compared with the overall number of annual decisions taken by my Department, we have been reasonably successful.</P>

      <P>The Ombudsman investigated claimants' complaints, particularly in relation to arrears or inadequate information and, in the case of one, as evident from his report, the person concerned had to wait some eight years before receiving full payment. Resulting from his investigations of claimants' complaints, will the Minister inform the House of the largest three or four payments made by his Department resulting from such investigations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately half the complaints to the Ombudsman were found to be without foundation. The case to which the Deputy refers was that of a person who applied and received an old age pension in 1973 whereas provision for an adult dependant allowance was introduced only in 1974.  For one reason or another, the pensioner concerned was unaware that he could apply for such adult dependant allowance and did not learn of his entitlements until 1993.  When this matter was brought to the attention of my Department, despite the fact that legislatively we are confined to paying six months arrears only, it was decided in 1993 to backdate arrears due to him to 1985.  In 1993 the Ombudsman asked my Department to reconsider the matter, which was done, when it was agreed that arrears be paid from 1985 to 1993.  This was a specific case with attendant specific circumstances.  Responsibility for claiming any benefit must rest on the shoulders of those who believe they have an entitlement.  It would be impossible for my Department to seek out every individual who might have an entitlement to ensure they receive it. We do our best in terms of information leaflets, television and newspaper advertising, a whole range of methods to disseminate information, through the Department's information officers, through the National Social Service Board, information, unemployment and women's information centres but ultimate responsibility to claim must lie with an applicant and it would be <Col N="746" /> impossible to put that onus on the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of settlements reached with the legal representatives of married women who initiated legal proceedings arising from the delay in according them equal treatment under the Equal Treatment Directive, in accordance with normal legal practice in such circumstances, my Department will meet the plaintiffs' legal costs.  In the absence of agreement on the amount of legal costs, these costs are adjudicated by the Taxing Master under the normal procedures whereby a solicitor's bill is examined by the Taxing Master who may either allow it or reduce the amount involved.  It is open to either party to proceedings to insist that costs be adjudicated by the Taxing Master or on review by the Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular care is being taken to reduce, as far as possible, my Department's liability for costs in these cases. The costs experts in the Chief State Solicitor's Office, in conjunction with outside costs consultants and the Attorney General's Office, are keeping bills of costs submitted by the solicitors concerned under close review, in particular, with a view to limiting overall exposure to costs.  Claims for costs will be met only without recourse to the Taxing Master or the court if the expert advice available to us is to the effect that <Col N="747" /> requesting the Taxing Master or the court to adjudicate would be likely to result in higher expenditure by the Exchequer.</P>

A total of £170,000 in fees was paid in cases arising in 1992 or earlier; £515,000 was paid in 1993; £176,000 was paid in 1994; £135,000 was paid in 1995 and up to May 1996, £628,000 was paid.  I have rounded those figures. Claims amounting to £3.397 million were made.  The bill of costs in those cases was reduced by £1.767 million and £1.63 million was paid on foot of those claims.  Effectively the claims were reduced by half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter, which can only be referred to as a fiasco <Col N="748" /> in cost terms, dates back to 1987 when the European Union adopted a directive on equal treatment which obliged all member states to treat women in regard to social welfare on the same basis as men.  The Government of the day asked for a derogation for a number of years which was deferred until 1984. Subsequent legislation providing for the implementation of the directive was not implemented until 1985.  The manner in which the directive was implemented gave rise to a number of cases in the Irish courts and later at European level and various judgments were handed down against the State.  Some changes were made subsequently in legislation which gave rise to a legal challenge in the Irish and European courts.  The European courts found against the Irish State and that gave rise to further compensation. When I came into office I found that 70,000 women had entitlements arising from the various decisions and the failure to act since 1987.  It was my view and that of the Government that we needed to end the saga once and for all.  If the matter had been dealt with correctly in the first instance, it would have cost the State something like £18 million, but it is now costing the State £260 million plus legal fees to rectify errors made over the years.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply, where we are not satisfied that the claim for costs is reasonable, we are having them referred to the Taxing Master.  We will pay them only where we are satisfied that, based on our internal advice and external expert advice, such a course of action would result in an increased cost to the Department.  As I indicated, out of claims for £3.397 million we have had that figure reduced by £1.767 million and paid a figure of £1.63 million.  By careful scrutiny and management of <Col N="749" /> those claims we have reduced the claims being sought to date by about half.</P>

      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question some weeks ago the Minister told me that his Department had paid legal fees to the tune of £616,000 in one case and more than £500,000 in another.  What assessment was made in regard to the level of those substantial fees?  Even if a solicitor who charges £50 an hour is paid £616,000, he or she will have to chalk up 12,000 hours to earn that money.  That sum appears exorbitant by any standards.  What steps has the Minister taken to assess that level of fees in the case of each of those payments?</P>

      <P>I indicated we have been careful in the manner in which we deal with claims for legal fees. We have made sure that in all cases fees are reasonable with regard to what the Department might expect to pay and cases were referred to the Taxing Master. Based on the figures I provided in respect of bills amounting to £3.397 million, we have had those bills reduced by £1.767 million and, consequently, have saved the State and the taxpayer that amount of money by careful examination of the claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is most unsatisfactory because solicitors were paid in excess of £500,000 and by any standards that is exorbitant.  Even if a solicitor who charges £100 per hour was paid that fee he or she would have to chalk up 6,000 hours to accumulate that bill.  Fees of £616,000 and £502,000 were paid.  What assessment was made in those cases to satisfy the Minister that the solicitors in question were entitled to that level of fees?</P>

As a Member of this House I am entitled to information regarding the cavalier approach of the Minister to the expenditure of these substantial amounts of money.</P>

      <P>My Department, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Attorney General have carefully addressed this matter and we have ensured we are not paying more than we ought to pay with regard to the legal fees for the cases which women were forced to take because of the unwillingness of the previous Minister for Social Welfare to meet their legitimate claims. They would not be in court and would not have solicitors if the then Minister had met these claims as we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment to publish a White Paper was first given by the then Minister in 1990.  Following a round of consultation with voluntary and community groups, an interdepartmental task force was set up to assist the Department of Social Welfare in drafting material for the White Paper on Voluntary Activity in 1992.  The task force completed its work in July 1993. The work of drafting the text for a White Paper then commenced in the Department of Social Welfare and a draft had been prepared by December 1994.</P>
      <P>I reviewed the draft when I came to office.  I did not consider that the draft adequately reflected the various developments that had occurred in the intervening period.  My intention was then to have the White Paper published by the end of 1995, but it was not possible to do so due to the introduction of a number of new policy initiatives which in themselves had the potential for a substantial impact on the relationship between the voluntary and community sector and statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The essential difficulty has been that much has been happening in the community and voluntary sector and related areas which are likely to have an impact on the draft white paper.  This includes reform of the Department of Social Welfare grant schemes for voluntary organisations, implementation of the programme for local urban and rural development and perhaps most importantly of all the national anti-poverty strategy.  I might also mention in this context the Taoiseach's announcement of the establishment of a western development commission to promote coherent action for economic and social development by public bodies, social partners and communitybased groups throughout the Western Region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy is designed to fundamentally change the way in which Government tackles the issues of poverty and social exclusion and has involved a widespread consultation process with the voluntary sector. <Col N="752" /> The strategy, after an essential lead in period of consultation, is now entering its most critical stages of policy development. Not taking the NAPS process into account in the White Paper would have meant it would have been out of date even prior to its publication.</P>
    <P>These developments necessitated a detailed re-drafting of the text of the draft White Paper which is nearing completion. As I indicated in my previous reply, I hope to be able to make an announcement on the White Paper in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a similar question on 22 February 1996. He replied then that he would circulate the White Paper to his Government colleagues and obtain replies from them. Did this happen?  Has the Minister's Government colleagues been slow to reply?  What has happened since last February?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think that is good enough?  He has been in office 17 months and the White Paper was virtually ready when he took up office.  Seventeen months later and four months after he advised that he would do something in the near future he is still talking about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not accepted the importance of the White Paper to voluntary organisations.  The voluntary bodies are fund-raising, struggling, helping out, and are unsure of funding.  They depend on the White Paper charter that may give them core and multi annual funding.  They have been waiting for the White Paper for 18 months.</P>
      <P>It is very disappointing that the Minister has not circulated the paper to his Government colleagues.  Will he ask the extra staff in his office to concentrate on the White Paper and charter for voluntary organisations?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the proposed White Paper on the voluntary sector is important, but I would caution her not to believe it will produce a magic formula to solve the funding problems of the voluntary sector in general.  Since taking up office I have undertaken initiatives which involve the voluntary sector.  The national anti-poverty strategy involved widespread consultation with the voluntary sector and has taken it on board in preparing the documentation for that strategy.  The voluntary sector will also be involved in its implementation.</P>
      <P>We have established a Commission on the Family which also consults with the voluntary sector with regard to how services can be enhanced and integrated for support for families.  We have also involved the voluntary sector in the preparation and delivery of the security package for the elderly which I introduced since I took up office.</P>
      <P>We are involved with the voluntary sector in a range of initiatives.  The development of the money, advice and budgeting service obliges us to act in partnership with the voluntary sector and other State agencies such as the health boards and local authorities.  The community development programme, which we are developing and expanding, is a partnership between my Department and the voluntary sector. We provide funding to a range of national network organisations which support the voluntary sector in its contribution to the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
      <P>This is only a small sample of what my Department and staff are doing in working with the voluntary sector.  Any claim or indication that the absence of the production of a White Paper means nothing is happening in this area is false. It indicates a lack of understanding of what is taking place and how my Department is supporting the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will produce the White Paper as soon as I consider it is appropriate and ready for publication.  It is important in itself, but it is even more important that <Col N="754" /> it be properly prepared, that it properly reflect the reality of what has been achieved and what can be achieved in the partnership that is developing between the voluntary sector and Government Departments and State agencies generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister sounds plausible, but he said this in February. He also said then he was keen to publish a White Paper which would clearly state Government policy which would have a realistic prospect of implementation during this administration whose time is running out.  Is there anything sinister in the fact that this is always being pushed forward and nothing is happening.  In February the Minister said he was keen to do it properly during this administration, that it would be a clear statement of Government policy, that it would be circulated to Government Ministers, that the replies would be back and that it would all happen tomorrow.  Four months later we are no further on.  Why was the White Paper not circulated as promised on 22 February in the Dáil?  Why are we no further on than we were than, even though voluntary organisations throughout the country are waiting for it?  Is it not being treated by the Department as seriously as it should be, or is there something sinister about this undue delay?</P>

      <P>That is as precise as I can be.  The Deputy asked specifically why it has not been circulated to the other Departments.  It is quite simply because I want to get it right before I circulate it because when it goes to other Departments I want to be sure it gets through them and into Government with approval as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the voluntary sector, State agencies and Departments is changing and evolving all the time.  The world is different now from three or four years ago when the idea of a White Paper was first proposed.  It would be ridiculous to circulate a draft White Paper based on circumstances that existed in 1993.  It simply would not make sense, and the voluntary sector would be the first to say it was nonsense, as it would be.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has satisfied himself that all aspects of the transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance are in place to ensure the smooth transfer of the scheme to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, contains provision to enable the transfer of the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards to this Department.  The Act also <Col N="756" /> provides for some significant improvements in the conditions of the scheme and the assessment of means, as well as a change of title to disability allowance. It is intended that the transfer will be effective from 2 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The necessary arrangements are being made at present and involve my Department, the Department of Health and the eight health boards working together to effect the transfer.  I am confident that all the issues arising in this fairly complex process will be resolved in time to enable the transfer to take place smoothly as planned and with the minimum inconvenience to recipients of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be an information campaign aimed at the recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance, many of whom are anxious to know the position?  Does the Minister intend to meet the voluntary organisations to clarify the present position? What is the Minister's timescale regarding the necessary commencement orders and regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, the intention is that the transfer will be effective from 2 October 1996.  All necessary orders and arrangements will be in place before that date to ensure that people have their books and in a position to make their claims on and after that date.</P>
      <P>On the question of information, we have consulted widely on the transfer of this scheme.  I am sure that, being involved at constituency level, the Deputy knows disabled person's maintenance allowance is currently administered by eight health boards with different administrative procedures.  We have had to take on board all the information from eight boards and codify and simplify it to make it possible to ensure that every person who has an entitlement on 2 October will receive payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking the scheme in hand we have provided for a number of important improvements in it.  We are providing a disregard of £45 a week plus travel <Col N="757" /> expenses in respect of the earnings of the working spouse.  We are also providing a significant improvement in the provision for the assessment of capital, including a disregard of the first £2,000. We are providing for the payment of two full personal rates of payment where both spouses are in receipt of the allowance.  We are providing that where a person on disability allowance goes into hospital, provision is made for its continued payment for a further 13 weeks.  This is an improvement on the existing regulation which allows payment for only eight weeks in any calendar year.  Where a dependent child remains in full-time education, an allowance will be made in respect of him or her until reaching the age of 22 &mdash; this allowance is currently paid up to age 21. Where a dependent child goes into hospital, child allowance will no longer be terminated after eight weeks.  In addition we are seeking to guarantee that everyone who has an entitlement will be paid by the Department as and from 2 October.  We had a range of consultations with a variety of organisations last year and again this year.  My understanding is that the concerns raised by the various voluntary organisations dealing with people with disabilities are being dealt with by my Department. There is no reason for any person currently in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance to be concerned. They will receive their money and nobody will be at a loss.  Many will be better off as a result of the transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like clarification on this.  When will the persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance receive information from the Department as to the implications for them personally?  Will they get it in July, August or September?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The target date for the transfer is October 1996.  Areas which have been addressed by the project team include claims processing, investigation of means, medical assessments, links with other health services <Col N="758" /> and payment methods.  It is intended to administer the scheme from the Department of Social Welfare offices in Longford which also deal with the other long-term disability schemes.  On transfer, disabled person's maintenance allowance will be paid in all cases initially by personalised payable order books which can be cashed at post offices.  A person may also appoint an agent on his or her behalf to cash the payment if he or she is unable to do so.  Payment by electronic fund transfer is currently being examined both for individual clients and for making bulk payments to training agencies who have large numbers of people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance in training at any particular time.  I have no doubt that before 2 October, and in good time, people who are currently in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance will receive information on the payments and where they should go.  My expectation is that they will be asked to nominate the post office from which they want to have their payment made and, if they are not in a position to go and collect the payment themselves, to nominate somebody who is in a position to do that.</P>
      <P>Staff from the Departments of Social Welfare and Health and the health boards have worked very hard to ensure that this transfer will be smooth, that it will be an improvement for many and that no one will be at a loss as a result.</P>

That will continue to be done by the health boards.  The assessment of means will be carried out by the Department of Social Welfare.  The community welfare officers are employed by the health boards but the funding of community welfare officers and the moneys they disburse are provided by the Department of Social Welfare, not by the Department of Health.

The rate of processing varied from health board to health board.  The rules were applied differently by various health boards.  We are standardising the way in which applications will be assessed.  Obviously there will be a requirement for a person to be approved by a doctor to be medically entitled to the allowance.  Not only will a means test be carried out, but there will also be a medical requirement to prove the person's medical eligibility for the allowance.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision to transfer the disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare.  I understand from the Minister's reply to Deputy O'Rourke that in future the social welfare officer will be the investigating officer and the community welfare officer will not be involved in this.  All maintenance payments except supplementary welfare allowance will be paid from the Department of Social Welfare; supplementary welfare allowance will still be paid by the community welfare officer.  Does the Minister envisage that his Department might take over the payment of supplementary welfare allowance to ensure that people who are granted the allowance are paid in time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a scheme of last resort whereby people whose income falls below certain levels, usually for a temporary period, can go to a community welfare officer in the <Col N="761" /> local clinic to seek assistance to top up their income.  The delivery of that income has been brought into the Department of Social Welfare's integrated short-term schemes computer system.  It will enable community welfare officers to deliver faster decisions on claims for supplementary welfare. There are no plans to take the scheme entirely within the purview of the Department of Social Welfare.  Clearly there are major staffing implications in doing that.  The community welfare officers are currently employed by health boards, although the budget for their pay and the money they disburse is provided by the Department of Social Welfare.  I have no doubt that this will be addressed in the near future but I am not too sure what the outcome will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it would be a logical progression that all maintenance payments be made by the same Department because there are difficulties with the present system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are arguments in favour of what the Deputy says but the community welfare officers' view is that their role is wider than the question of providing temporary top ups of income.  Their very title implies they are integrated as part of a team at local level provided by the health boards to support families at risk.  Whether it would be wise to separate the income support aspect of that support and bring it into the Department of Social Welfare, leaving the community welfare officer without any such role is questionable. However, if we were to bring into the Department of Social Welfare the community welfare officer and the income maintenance function as one task, we would be leaving the question of their wider role, in tandem with other members of the community team that the health boards provide, open for discussion as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, it seems simple to transfer all the income maintenance schemes to the Department of Social <Col N="762" /> Welfare.  However, it is a much more problematic area when one looks at the diverse role which a community welfare officer ought to have.  In theory the officer has that role but in practice it is only some cases.</P>

      <Quest>the current waiting time in relation to appeals before the Social Welfare Appeals Office outlining the time elapsing between the date of submission of the appeal and final notifications of the outcome to the claim in question; and the plans, if any, he has to improve the situation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Social Welfare Appeals Office statistics on appeals finalised during the first five months of 1996 show that the average processing time was just over 17 weeks.  Appeals involving oral hearings tend to be above this figure, whereas those where the appeal can be determined on the basis of the documentary evidence would be below the average figure.  When the slowest 10 per cent of cases is discounted the average falls to 14 weeks. A survey of appeals completed in 1995 found that approximately one third were disposed of within two months of being registered in the appeals office.</P>
      <P>For an appeal to get the attention it merits, the grounds advanced in support of it must be fully investigated.  This will often require a further report by an investigating officer at issue or, for disability benefit claimants, a further examination by a medical referee.  The periods indicated above cover the time taken to deal with all phases of the appeal, including additional investigations into the grounds advanced, the arrangement of oral hearings, adjournments which may be requested by the appellants or their representatives, determination by an appeals officer and notification of the outcome to appellants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has made significant progress in the five <Col N="763" /> years since its establishment in 1991.  Up to the end of May 1996 more than 85,000 appeals had been processed and the number of appeals on hand has decreased from 8,287 at 31 December 1991 to 4,261 on 31 May 1996; this has brought about a significant improvement in the service provided to appellants.</P>
    <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  While it is unlikely that appeals currently awaiting determination will be disposed of much more quickly than the average for the first half of the year, the achievement of further improvements in response times is a high priority.  However, it is necessary to ensure that progress in this area is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all of its merits.</P>

If that is the average waiting time, many appeals must take longer than 17 weeks.  I know that some take up to six months.  What steps is the Minister taking to reduce that inordinate delay?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If an appeal takes six months, it is not because of any inefficiency or inadequacy in the Department of Social Welfare or the appeals office, but because a person who may feel aggrieved as the result of a decision of the Department is seeking an oral hearing and for new evidence to be introduced in support of their case. If the Deputy has a specific example of an appeal which has taken six months, and there is no obvious explanation for the delay which he believes resulted from inefficiency in my Department, I will have that case investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average waiting time is 17 weeks, and when the slowest 10 per cent of cases are discounted the average falls to <Col N="764" /> 14 weeks.  We are talking about the time from when the appellant receives notice that he may appeal and when he lodges an appeal.  He may have to go for a medical examination if it is a disability benefit case and he has to be given time to produce medical evidence, which can take two to three weeks.  The Department has to verify the claim and the documentation.  All of these matters take time.  We are talking about appeals where a person has been refused a payment. In the first instance, the Department is entitled to present its case for the refusal, and the person is entitled to present their case for receiving the payment. That inevitably gives rise to delays.</P>
    <P>According to published British social security statistics, the average time taken to process appeals for all benefits by tribunals in the UK in 1994 was approximately 38 weeks.  A recent report of the International Social Security Association, covering complaints procedures in the field of social security in institutions in 22 countries, found that appeal processing times varied between three and 20 months.  Compared to how appeals are dealt with in other countries, we are doing reasonably well. However, that is not to say we will not seek to improve the passage of appeals as far as we can.</P>
    <P>One of the primary objectives of the Department is to reduce the number of appeals.  That has been achieved to a significant extent, as I indicated earlier, by ensuring people fully understand the reasons a claim is refused.  That has resulted in a significant drop in the number of appeals.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister serious when he blames the long delays on the clients waiting to submit new evidence rather than his Department?  Is he satisfied that during the period when these clients are waiting for their appeal there is proper co-ordination between community welfare officers and the Department of Social Welfare to ensure they have adequate incomes?  Many of them have young families to look after.  Is he <Col N="765" /> satisfied there is no problem there?  I can assure him there is.  Will he address that problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the sole reason.  However, I am arguing that the time it takes to deal with an appeal is not primarily &mdash; or at all, in my view &mdash; the result of inefficiency on the part of the Department of Social Welfare or the appeals office.  We have to have some regard for the use of resources in the delivery of our services.</P>
      <P>Our primary objective in this area is to reduce the number of appeals by making clear to people the reason for a claim being refused.  If they are not happy with the reasons given, they obviously have the right, in justice, to appeal, and many do so.  However, because we are dealing in a much clearer way with the reasons for claims being refused, the number of appeals has dropped dramatically.  That is the way we need to proceed.</P>
      <P>It is important that a person lodging an appeal has an opportunity to present their evidence in either written or oral form.  Providing for oral hearings obviously takes time.  If there are thousands of appeals, each case has to be dealt with fairly.  There is no point in having a system operating like a sausage machine churning out standardised decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Each case has to be reviewed and decided on its merits.  The system is working well.  I am not arguing that it is perfect but that the improvements will ensure the number of appeals will fall.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spent some time trying to justify what I consider a disgraceful situation where people have to wait 17 weeks on average for their appeal to be decided.  This causes hardship.  Does he not consider it most unreasonable that the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare provided for a cut of four in the number of staff in the social welfare appeals office whereas the number of personal staff recruited through his party's head-quarters for party political purposes was increased by 13?  Does this not display lopsided priorities?</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce a system whereby persons with 40 years paid rather than credited PRSI contributions could qualify for full contributory old age pensions or qualify for full old age pensions plus 33? per cent, whereby the resulting vacancies would be filled by young workers under 25 years; and if he will give the estimated annual costs of each of these options.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a system whereby an old age contributory pension would be paid to persons with 40 years paid contributions could lead to persons qualifying for such a pension from the age of, say, 57 onwards.  This would have major financial implications, as would the Deputy's proposal to pay an extra 33? per cent in those cases.</P>
      <P>The cost of reducing the pension age for old age contributory pension by one year, for example, is estimated at £30 million per annum.  In addition, there is no certainty that vacancies created on foot of such a proposal would be filled by workers under 25 or that they would be filled at all.</P>
      <P>As a part response to demographic changes and to reduce future pension costs on foot of these, measures have been taken to increase the official age of retirement in the coming years in some EU member states, for example, Germany, Greece, Italy, the UK and Finland.  In all cases, a major aim has been to bring the retirement age for women into line with that of men in conformity with equal treatment provisions, though this has been achieved by increasing the former rather than reducing the latter as was envisaged a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report, Developing the National Pension System, considered, in principle, that a standard qualifying age of 65 for retirement and old age pensions should be introduced but regarded this <Col N="768" /> as a low priority.  It considered that there was only limited scope for offering pensions on a cost neutral basis at earlier ages and recommended that this could only be an option where the person who takes early retirement has other income or earnings.  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce an approach along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There are no costings available within my Department for the options outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make two basic points on behalf of workers around 60 years of age who are finding the going a bit tough and would like to retire with dignity because their health is suffering and they feel they have made their contribution to society.  Does the Minister have any figures for the number of persons with 40 years paid rather than credited contributions?  The categories I have in mind include manual workers such as barmen who have to work unsocial hours.  I am sure the Minister is conscious of the fact that in recent years workers have been seeking a redundancy package from their employer, more or less selling their job. This is a bad development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>By implication the answer to the Deputy's question is contained in the final sentence of my initial reply which reads: &ldquo;There are no costings available within my Department for the options outlined by the Deputy&rdquo;.  This implies that we do not have the statistics he is seeking for the numbers of persons in the 57-60 age group with 40 years service.  It may in theory be possible to find the figures but the time it would take would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question relates to persons who would like to retire but would not have an occupational pension which would allow them to do so with some comfort. This is a problem that will grow because of demographic changes.  The proportion of elderly people continues to grow compared to the numbers in the <Col N="769" /> economically active age groups.  It would be foolish, therefore, to follow the example of other countries and lower the retirement age to 60.  Most are now seeking to push it back up again.</P>
    <P>The problem cannot be solved by the Department in relation to social welfare pensions.  One could not confine it in the way the Deputy is suggesting.  It would cost about £30 million to reduce pension age by one year.  This allows for the possibility that some of the people concerned are already in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance or a preretirement allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the people I am talking about may be able to draw on a small occupational pension.  If they decide to take redundancy, they will receive unemployment benefit for 15 months.  They may then find that they will be excluded from receiving unemployment assistance because of their occupational pension.  I accept that the matter raised in the first part of the question could not be included as a rule but the matter raised in the second part could be targeted and limited as it would be linked to the employment of a young person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem lies in ring-fencing any such initiative.  The Department is coming under pressure from self-employed persons who from 1988 have been paying PRSI contributions and because they will reach retirement or pension age before the ten year contribution period is up, they are seeking a pension without having paid the full ten year contributions.  Once an initiative is introduced there are all kinds of pressures.  The only solace I can offer the Deputy is that we are actively reviewing the report of the National Pensions Board.  It is intended to introduce some initiative in the pensions area in the social welfare Bill next year but I cannot at this stage indicate what that might be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing this matter I will compare it with practical experience in my constituency in the Liffey Valley.  In 1984 I proposed that the county council should examine the possibility of designating the Liffey Valley as a special amenity area.  This was supported by a colleague of the Minister, Councillor Michael Gannon.  At that time we had a three member electoral area in that part of the country. The planning officer and a senior parks officer set about the task of studying the valley, which was in excess of 500 acres. They identified the various amenities that exist in the Liffey Valley and eventually submitted their draft report to the council many months later which was unanimously endorsed and sent to the Minister for the Environment.  Fortunately, given the excellence of the proposal, the amenity area order was signed.  I am proud to have been the one who proposed it.  At that time I think it was the only special amenity area order that had ever been signed, although some have been signed since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This did not require a raft of consultants or result in delays or controversy. The task was undertaken to ensure we could provide protection for an excellent amenity running virtually into the heart of Dublin city.  Comparing that with what has happened in this case, one cannot help but feel the Minister when in Opposition took a particular view and a vigorous line of opposition to the expertise within the Office of Public Works, the people to whom he is now going back to dig himself out of this sorry mess.  Those people are being <Col N="876" /> asked to submit a scheme.  These are the people to whom the Burren project was entrusted.  It is a sad reflection on responsible political and other community leaders that they should have doubted, queried, questioned and differed so vigorously from people who have given a life's work within the Office of Public Works protecting the environment and bringing forward praiseworthy proposals and superb projects. Nobody could assume the Office of Public Works or Clare County Council would have any hand, act or part in damaging the Burren or any other area of high amenity value for which it is responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution clearly said that following the protracted delay, we are virtually trying to put the wheels back on the wagon, however small they may be.  We have a new name, lest anybody would say that a car park and other facilities were built at Mullaghmore.  The Office of Public Works will prepare a planning scheme and Clare County Council will consider it.  I do not know what position the Minister's former fellow travellers will take or whether they will vigorously oppose it as they did previously.  At least the Minister will be on the right side of the argument on this occasion and this might bring the matter to a conclusion. The former Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, was responsible in his approach and ensured that what was to be done at Mullaghmore was to the highest national and international standards. He was trying to ensure that visitors to the Burren would be facilitated in a proper environment and was certainly not going to damage the Burren.</P>
    <P>The conclusion is that we are going back to where we started, with modifications, courtesy of the Brady Shipman Martin report.  To put a further favourable gloss on the presentation a wider area of County Clare is being embraced.  I do not think the consultants have proposed anything the County Clare planning team would not do under its development plan.  In their <Col N="877" /> written statement they have incorporated all the various suggestions as in the normal preparation of any county development plan.  If the truth were known, substantial parts of the consultants' report may be direct lifts from the written statement of the Clare county development plan.  The designated special amenity areas are of special interest.  They will be included in the current county development plan and will be protected because those people are entrusted to ensure that what will happen in County Clare will be to the highest national and international environmental standards.  The planning application will emerge in due course and I do not doubt it will be approved.</P>
    <P>However, a narrow point of law must be considered first.  Every arm of the State should be required to go through due process.  For years, the Department of Education, the Office of Public Works and various other State agencies did not have to go through the rigours of the planning system.  In a controversy, this understandably gave rise to the probably incorrect belief that the Office of Public Works was in a position to go ahead with something in the Burren without planning permission.  It created the impression that the Office of Public Works could railroad through the system, something which would not get planning permission.  This is where the real mistakes were made.</P>
    <P>When it was decided the Office of Public Works must apply for planning permission, due process should have prevailed.  The professionals in the Office of Public Works and An Bord Pleanála planning sections should have been allowed to go through the process and come to their conclusions. However, the position is vulnerable because of the Minister's hasty action at that time.  The EU has every right to seek the return of the funding it provided for the projects.  It can point out that the Minister and Government of the day decided not to allow procedures to conclude.  The work of the other arms <Col N="878" /> of the State evaluating the proposals was halted and the application was withdrawn. This gave rise to the belief that there was something basically defective in the proposal.  This was unfortunate and we must now ask the EU to provide funds for a modified proposal for the same project.</P>
    <P>There will be two choices if and when the number of people seeking to visit this wonderful amenity cannot be accommodated.  The numbers can be restricted or facilities must be built to cater for them.  There will be a problem if the projected number of visitors and the facilities it is intended to provide do not gel.  Deputies from the county are aware of the inconvenience endured by local people in terms of illegal car parking which prevents them having access to their homes and farms.  They will be confronted with a most unsatisfactory situation unless proper facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>Nobody doubts the new awareness and knowledge among non sun worshipping visitors from Ireland and abroad. There has been a change in the type of holidays people want.  People have a tremendous interest in visiting cities with historical backgrounds, such as Dublin and other European capital cities, particularly in eastern Europe. Others are interested in visiting the Burren and in mountain trekking holidays.  People have more disposble income and the number of tourists is colossal.  Places such as the Burren, which is unique, are bound to be on the itinerary of many visitors from home and abroad.  They must be accommodated and this is the purpose of the plan. It was also the original intention.  I visited Glenveagh park which is an ideal facility provided by the Office of Public Works.  Having regard to all the controversy about Mullaghmore it is deplorable that responsible people who managed many good facilities around the country were so doubted.</P>

      <P>This debate on the Burren national park should not be necessary.  We should be in the Burren either enjoying the facilities of the park or attending an official opening there following the completion of the centre.  I was honoured in 1987 by the then Taoiseach and Government to be appointed as the first Minister of State with responsibility for heritage affairs.  I was attached to the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Taoiseach and had the pleasure of serving for eight years as a member of successive Governments and for two terms at the Office of Public Works.  Much of my time during that period was taken up with consideration of proposals by the Government and the Office of Public Works to create national parks in various parts of the country and to expand the tremendous record of investment, conservation and heritage management by the Office of Public Works over the decades.</P>
      <P>We considered the serious economic situation in which the country found itself when we entered Government on 11 March 1987 and examined heritage tourism as a key area in terms of recognising the uniqueness of the country and the opportunities it presented to the nation and the wider international world for people to visit and enjoy our clean environment, open spaces and heritage.  As far back as 1973, the Office of Public Works was directed by the Government to proceed with land acquisition in County Clare to create a national park, something which had been done with great success in the United States of America in the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Minister and key senior Office of Public Works officials, including some scientists, visited national parks in the US, Australia and the <Col N="880" /> United Kingdom.  Based on their experiences and their knowledge and commitment to heritage conservation they felt they knew the best way to proceed regarding the development of national parks.  I joined an office staffed by enthusiastic and committed people operating to the highest professional standards.  They were committed to providing the best conservation standards in unique parts of the country; County Clare was one of those areas.  Other places examined were Kerry, Wicklow, Donegal, Mayo and Meath.</P>
    <P>The debate displays hypocrisy.  As a result of the change of Government and ministerial personnel, three sites appeared to cause particular problems for the smaller parties, and specifically the academic left of the enlarged Labour Party which tried to dictate the position within Government.  The sites included Luggala in County Wicklow. With my full support and knowledge of the decision, and the full support of the then Fianna Fáil Government, the Office of Public Works acquired a site in the Wicklow mountains in a modern coniferous afforested area to build an interpretative centre for the Wicklow national park.  The idea behind this was to enhance the beauty of the area, create opportunities for the capital city and encourage tourists to visit the area and enjoy the facilities, and to create opportunities for local people.</P>
    <P>However, people with vast resources invited international stars to the area and eventually persuaded members of Government and others that their privacy could not be interrupted.  Their view was that ordinary people should not be brought to special parts of the island which should be preserved for elite snobs.  I rejected that view and I cannot understand why the decision was taken not to proceed with Luggala.  This project should proceed.</P>
    <P>The position was different in royal Meath.  The current Taoiseach is from County Meath and a Labour Party <Col N="881" /> Deputy is also from the county.  It was easy for the new Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to concede at Cabinet that they should get their centre. We were then left with Mullaghmore and the Clare national park.  I know a good deal about Mullaghmore but I do not claim to know as much about County Clare as the Minister who was born there.  I know a good deal about rural Ireland and the people of Clare and admire the uniqueness of their heritage and culture.  My constituency straddles the northern boundary of County Clare from the River Shannon at Banagher across to the sea between New Quay and Kinvara in the lower northern periphery of the Burren.  As a child I often visited the area with my parents.  As a young person I worked in the marketing field in County Clare and spent at least 18 months there at one time.  As I matured I had reason to visit County Clare on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I consulted widely the people of that county on this issue and I thank them for showing the way and supporting the Government and the Office of Public Works in their efforts to invest in the uniqueness of the Burren.  We have not capitalised on that.  We considered the development from a conservation, geographical, archaeological, geological and commercial point of view.  We believed the western part of the county was well served by people in small towns who, with private and public support, established visitor centres.</P>
    <P>Rather than create a mass tourism drive along the western periphery of the county we believed we should bring the people to the unique parts of Clare, to the heart of the Burren.  The shrewd professionals in the Office of Public Works acquired a site within 1.1 miles of Mullaghmore mountain which consisted of a disused quarry and a bulldozed field and was totally different from the adjoining unique area.  I was under intense pressure from professionals and one or two politicians at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> Major campaigns were launched in the media against the Government, me and, in particular, the Office of Public Works to block the investment in the Burren National Park.</P>
    <P>I have always had an open and objective mind.  As one matures one must recognise the advice of professionals and accept their submissions and contributions. However, when one is elected to represent the people and appointed to Government to make decisions, ultimately, one must make up one's own mind about a project.</P>
    <P>Over a three year period I brought many people from my home area, members of my family, foreign professionals, visitors to this country and others to the proposed site.  I did not tell them where they were going or why I was taking them there.  I asked them if they agreed we should invest in a visitor centre on that site and not one of them said I should not proceed with the development.  I also had the benefit of professional advice from the staff of the Office of Public Works.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State used the words &ldquo;Office of Public Works&rdquo; in their speeches today.  Obviously, the Minister, aided by the Government, wants to rubbish that office.  An agency that has served conservation well for more that one-and-a-half centuries is being taken out of State service.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State acknowledged that, with the co-operation of County Clare property owners, residents of the area and the farming community, the Office of Public Works carefully, honourably, positively and slowly acquired land for a national park in County Clare.  There was no friction or agitation involved in that process. However, when a decision was made to proceed with the investment, academics from various institutions &mdash; some of whom are well known to the Minister and have been appointed to State boards, presumably in appreciation of <Col N="883" /> their assistance in achieving his goal &mdash; and others at international level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;put forward various negative proposals regarding the project.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works I received 300 letters, typed on computer, from various countries in opposition to the proposal.  This was organised to impede a decision with which the democratically elected Government of this country wanted to proceed.</P>
      <P>The advice available to me at the time was that these people had a certain agenda.  One man took up the matter with the National Heritage Council, a non-statutory body at that time, and recommended we should not proceed with the development.  That led to the resignation from the council of one of the most honourable public servants on this island at the time.  A latent effort was made to scuttle proposals to proceed with the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told it might not be advisable to meet these people but I felt it was my duty to do so.  On an Easter Monday in a hotel in the Minister's constituency I met four of those eminent scientists and professionals and we discussed the matter for four-and-a-quarter hours.  I listened to their objections and put forward my point of view.  They told me pollution from the treatment plant was their only concern and I assured them that a dual system costing £300,000 would be installed.  I also assured them that the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment and Clare County Council were adamant that the project would not damage the environment, the ground water systems, the natural lakes or the ecology of the area.  Furthermore, I told them that if <Col N="884" /> we were in any doubt about the treatment plant we would hold the effluent in tanks and, in co-operation with the local farmers, have it removed from the area.</P>
    <P>I trusted those eminent people, some of whom grasped an opportunity to espouse their position from a rostrum in the Minister's constituency.  I thought it peculiar that the affairs of another county should be imposed on a public that was far removed from them.  The following day <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a lead story stating that the Minister met a group of people, admitted there was a major problem and that the effluent would have to be removed.  Obviously, the more commitments one gave and the more honourable, open and accessible one was, the more one was obstructed.  That resulted in even more people jumping on the band wagon. There were latent commercial interests in Clare, although small in number, who did not want investment there.  Similar objections were raised with Ionad na Blascaodí, the Blasket Island Centre in beautiful Kerry.  I met the people involved and told them there was no reason to worry, that the Office of Public Works would do an excellent job and that the investment was fully justified.  I am delighted that some of the objectors are today employed in the centre and agree it was a great investment.  I told them that would be the outcome because I was certain from the advice available to me it was the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>Some groups believe that the interpretative centre for the Burren should be located in Leminagh Castle, the great historic seat of Máire Rua O'Brien.  I visited that area on three occasions where I met Deputy Killeen and others.  I also met members of the Burren National Park Support Group, to whom I pay special tribute.  They are honourable, decent people who took tremendous flak from a small group of national and international people who <Col N="885" /> stated at meetings that it is unacceptable to allow mass tourism in County Clare, that this area should not be open to ordinary people but only to certain groups such as scientists and others, that the ordinary people of this nation have no right to education and information on what is unique to this country.  I abhor that attitude.  Nobody has a right to place a boundary on any area or to deny access to it.</P>
    <P>I regret that, as a Clare man, the Minister let his people down.  He produced three reports, which I read, by eminent consultants, some of whom I know well.  The Minister changed the name of the centre from Mullaghmore to Gortlecka and proposes to proceed in a different manner.  I heard Deputy Bhamjee say that the roads should not be widened.  That is a silly statement.</P>
    <P>The desecration of the heart of the Burren is a tragedy.  Investment has been made, but the project has not proceeded. The Minister should admit he is under threat of losing EU funds.  Unless this matter is rectified quickly the European Commission will instruct the Government that funds will not be available.  How much compensation will have to be paid if the project does not go ahead?  It is unacceptable that the Minister decided not to proceed with this project in the Burren, in the heart of County Clare, which is unique and has such a heritage history, culture and tradition.  That decision was made for the sake of a small agenda by a small group of people who believe they are better than others, for the sake of a short-term political agenda by a party or a group within parties who want to obstruct the progress of a nation.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day when we are discussing a national park that should be a gem internationally.  In the interests of our nation, particularly County Clare, the Minister should rise above the negativity that surrounds him.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has let down his county and his constituents.  While <Col N="886" /> centres are built in various parts of the country, the Minister is unable to persuade his Government colleagues to proceed with this project.  This opportunity should be taken for the people of Clare.  The Minister has a duty to his county and country to proceed and not to waste further public funds on unnecessary reports when it has been proven conclusively for 23 years that this park is fully justified and has the support of 98 per cent of the people of Clare.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate, which for the most part has been constructive and helpful.  A number of points raised will be of value.  I have long paid tribute to workers at all levels in the Office of Public Works.  I recall doing so in the Seanad in the period 1973-77.  As regards being familiar with their work, I visited Glenveagh on perhaps a dozen occasions ten years ago when work was starting there.  Almost every year I visit the Patrick McGill Summer School and was there only last week.  I am familiar with the work of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>In this case a significant court decision was made, and my proposals must satisfy the court.  It was necessary to establish a consensus, and it was indicated that could be best done by bringing forward the proposal in a certain context, hence the three studies, which have been very valuable.  I hope progress will be made in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the points made by Deputy de Valera and others about the importance of consultation.  We have negotiated with farmers in North Clare, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Teagasc and others, a scheme for interpreting land management, a model that will probably be used in other parts of the country.  That was brought about in co-operation with <Col N="887" /> the IFA and other agencies.  On the points made by Deputy Hughes, particularly relating to sheep farming, I met west of Ireland representatives of the IFA last week.</P>
    <P>I wish to give as much information as I can on the points made.  On the proposals for Kilfenora, a matter raised by Deputy de Valera, it is important that the organisation in Kilfenora, Comhar Cumann na Bóirne, is deeply involved in the development of proposals.  I will keep an open mind on this matter and will not dictate what should be done.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was correct in raising the question of stealing artefacts.  I would like to have more staff available to help protect portable artefacts in the countryside but to do so would require much public expenditure.  At the end of the day it will be impossible to guard totally against the actions of determined speculators.  I am at one with the Deputy and I will seek severe sanction in this regard.  There is already international co-operation on two matters for which we will seek jail sentences.  We may have to go the same road as other countries and bring some important artefacts into safe custody.  That is not something one likes to do, but it must be considered in the case of vulnerable artefacts.  It is a very drastic solution and I would be very slow to take it on board because I see artefacts as part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The contributions of the Clare Deputies were helpful, constructive and positive and emphasise that there is much on which there can be agreement. In the case of Deputy Killeen's contribution, he isolated the part on which there is disagreement.  There is no attempt by me to suggest casuistry or confusion about Gortlecka.  This is simply the townland involved.  It is the site of what had been the proposed interpretative centre.  I am not suggesting anything other than that.</P>
    <P>On the specific question, which is an <Col N="888" /> interesting one, concerning the cost of archaeological digs, it is true that the principle that the developer must pay is a good one in relation to carrying the cost of the archaeological impact on sites.  I am sympathetic, however, to cases where hardship would arise and I am willing to examine them in a general context because it is appropriate to invite a person to take responsibility for something provided the person has the means to exercise that responsibility. Cases of hardship are obviously very different from a developer who will make a speculative gain from a development. I will consider that point without sacrificing the general principle that the developer must pay and, if resources allow, I will be sympathetic to assisting the cases mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill gave the cost of the works at the Gortlecka site as £3.5 million. I am sorry to have to correct her but the figure is approximately £2 million. In relation to the question of the European funding, requests for progress reports have been made from time to time by the European Union.  There never was a request&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can give Deputy Treacy the facts, and I will deal with his contribution shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the REPS and NHAs.  A small working group consisting of officials of the NPWS, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the IFA examined the special conditions in the Burren <Col N="889" /> and came to an agreement on the parameters that should apply.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes raised a question of a similar nature in regard to the blanket bog in the west.  He referred also to the proposed Mayo national park which will be bigger than he suggested.  In that case the management plan will be launched shortly.  There will be a period of discussion, similar to the case of the Burren, and a decision will be made on implementing the national park in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I respect professionals but I also respect the process of consultation.  I differ fundamentally with Deputy Treacy who used the phrase &ldquo;those who know best&rdquo;.  We would have avoided a great deal of conflict in County Clare if that kind of thinking had not prevailed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>One can avail of professional expertise without the cost of an adequate and properly structured public consulatation process.  That is what will take place in Mayo.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes's contribution was positive and helpful and there was little difference between his views and mine on the questions of achieving sustainable farming.  The question arose, however, in regard to deciding the parameters and the principles to be applied in achieving that, particularly in relation to commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of incomplete roadworks was referred to by Deputies de Valera and Killeen.  It is a matter for Clare County Council to consider their contractual relationships in that regard. <Col N="890" /> I cannot intervence in the matter.  I dealt with the question of European funding raised by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>I fundamentally disagree with the contributions by Deputies Lawlor and Treacy.  Deputy Lawlor made a number of suggestions which are simply unsustainable. We can debate in future our efforts in relation to waterways and canals but if it is so obvious that all this work should be done, why was it not done by previous Governments?  What is the objection to commissioning a study, having consultations on it and engaging, as I did, local communities and then putting an implementation group in place to begin the work?  We have done that.</P>

      <P>They are competent to do that and they are the obvious people to ask.  The position is as follows. The heritage service, formerly the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, is now part of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and it is involved in the proposals for the Burren.  The Office of Public Works is the building agency for Government Departments and it has been asked to prepare plans, as an architectural service, in the same way it provides such service to every Government Department.</P>
      <P>I welcome what I believe to be an undercurrent in the debate, best represented by the contributions from the Clare Deputies, namely, the anxiety to take as a fresh starting point the report which provides a framework in which we could move to a consensus on what will not please everybody, or any one side, but which may emphasise the fact that we can take the long view of ecological responsibility and, at the same time, have local community involvement and sustainable development in the short-term.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht did not remain in the House to reply to this matter but I thank the Minister of State for being present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter relates to the urgent need to allocate a grant of £60,000 towards the provision of an arts and culture heritage centre in the village of Scartaglin, County Kerry, to be organised by the Scartaglin Rural Development Committee. This community cultural arts centre will be utilised to the maximum in the promotion of the great tradition of culture, heritage and arts in the east Kerry <Col N="894" /> area.  The project includes a large portion of north-west Cork which is also in the Sliabh Luachra area.  The area around Scartaglin, east Kerry and north-west Cork is steeped in tradition and its history in music, dance, song and folklore goes back centuries.  The people of this area are very proud.  I am referring to such people as the late Padraig O'Keeffe, a famous musician and singer of Irish songs who lived during the first half of the century.  This area is the homeland of famous poets and writers such as the late Eoin Rua Ó Sulleabhain and Aodán Ó Rahilly.  Every year during the August weekend the féile ceoil in Scartaglin attracts traditional musicians and others from Kerry, Munster and throughout Ireland who have a deep interest in culture and history. Many people also travel from abroad to attend this great annual event and it is customary for emigrants to arrange their holidays to coincide with it.</P>
    <P>The proposed cultural and heritage centre in Scartaglin must be constructed urgently.  The local community has a deep involvement in this project which could not better be proven than by the £25,000 it has raised on a voluntary basis.  The outstanding committee is working very hard in collecting money and promoting the centre.  All the members of the committee are very annoyed with the Minister and the Department for the extraordinarily long delay in allocating a substantial grant to this project out of EU and State funding. I am surprised that this project was not placed at the top of the priority list for grant aid by the Department.  I strongly urge the Minister and the Minister of State to take a personal interest in this project.  The best way they can do this is by allocating a grant of £60,000 at the earliest possible opportunity so that work can commence on the centre. When completed, this project will help immensely in the promotion of agritourism in the large catchment area. This proposal was high on the agenda set out in the McNulty report on projects which would enhance the promotion of tourism in County Kerry.  I <Col N="895" /> sincerely hope the Minister of State is in a position to announce the allocation of this grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Leary for raising this matter which relates to an application for grant aid for the development of the Scartaglin-Sliabh Luachra cultural centre.  The application was submitted by the Scartaglin Rural Development Committee under the cultural development incentive scheme which I am administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999.  I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the position not only in regard to the Scartaglin-Sliabh Luachra project but also in regard to all applications submitted to my Department under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The cultural development incentive scheme is designed primarily to assist the four main categories of the visual and performing arts &mdash; arts centres, museums, theatres and galleries.  Following an invitation for applications under the scheme by way of advertisements in the national press a total of 170 applications were lodged with my Department.  The total amount of assistance sought under these applications is £87 million.  The total amount available to me under the scheme during the five year period 1994-99 is £19.7 million which, together with the matching funds that have to be provided by successful applicants, will enable a total capital infrastructure of at least £26 million to be put in place during the period to 1999.  Having regard to the number and quality of the applications submitted, I decided to designate a total of £14.7 million from the £19.7 million at my disposal under the scheme for allocation to successful applicants from the 170 applications received.  The remaining £5 million available under the scheme will be allocated following a second and final call for applications.  This call will be made later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the 170 applications had been <Col N="896" /> lodged with my Department I engaged the expertise of a number of State agencies to carry out an examination of them.  I asked An Comhairle Ealaíon to carry out a detailed artistic examination of applications for projects such as arts centres, galleries, theatres, etc., and engaged the Heritage Council to assess applications in respect of museum and other heritage-type projects.  In addition I engaged the expertise of Bord Fáilte to carry out a financial and marketing evaluation of projects as required.  All necessary assessments and evaluations have now been completed in respect of the 170 applications.  I also established an advisory committee whose brief, following consideration of all assessments and evaluations, was to make recommendations to me on the projects which I felt merited funding.  The advisory committee consisted of eight members representing the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Tourism and Trade, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Heritage Council, the County and City Managers' Association and the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>Last February the advisory committee made its first recommendations to me based on applications received from the priority zones, comprising nine counties and centres of excellence, comprising four cities, as identified in the Comhairle Ealaíon arts plan.  As a result of these recommendations, I approved in principle the funding of eight projects under the scheme.  The projects approved by me in February will involve total capital investment of almost £8 million, with grant offers of £5.649 million.</P>
    <P>Following its recommendations in February the advisory committee considered the 162 remaining applications, including that received from the Scartaglin Rural Development Committee.  I am pleased to inform the House that the committee has recently submitted its recommendations to me on the projects which it considers merit funding from <Col N="897" /> these applications.  I am at present considering the committee's recommendations and I hope to be in a position to announce my decision on the Scartaglin and all other projects in the near future. I must make it clear at this point that the total amount of grant aid available to me for distribution among successful applications from the 162 projects I am now considering is £9.051 million. Deputies will appreciate from this figure that some very difficult decisions will have to be made in selecting the projects to which funding will be offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.  In recent months I have raised this issue twice by way of parliamentary question, which underlines the importance I attach to it.</P>
      <P>The provision of a new fire station at Dowra in north-west Cavan has been an ongoing project.  In January 1993 the then Minister for the Environment approved the provision of a new fire station and the county council was requested to prepare and submit working drawings, plans and a bill of quantities. In March 1994 the council submitted the contract documents to the Department but it is obvious that very little progress has been achieved in the meantime as the contract documents have not been approved and the council has not been given permission to invite tenders for this much needed project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dowra is situated in north-west Cavan, an area of beautiful but difficult terrain, where the Cuilcagh mountains are also located.  The nearest fire station in County Cavan is located at Ballyconnell, some 22 miles away.  The nearest fire stations in adjoining counties are at Enniskillen, almost 20 miles away, and Drumshanbo, 11 miles away.  In inclement weather it would take a fire tender <Col N="898" /> considerable time to travel from Ballyconnell to Dowra, crossing the Cuilcagh mountains.</P>
    <P>Over many years a huge afforestation programme has taken place in that portion of north-west Cavan, with the constant attendant threat of a major fire outbreak, adjacent to a populated area. Last year there was a serious fire in a forest near the village of Dowra, manifesting to the local community in no uncertain terms the absolute need for an adequate structure and applicances there at present.  Large tracts of forestry have also been planted very near isolated rural homes.  There is an ageing population in this area.  Unfortunately, fires have taken lives and property all too often, particularly in the case of elderly people residing alone.</P>
    <P>Adequate emergency services should be available in all regions.  The national primary route, the N16, runs through part of this area.  Since the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland on 31 August 1994 there has been a remarkable increase in traffic on that route.  In the event of accidents or other emergencies adequate local fire services should be available to deal with them. The existing fire station at Dowra, which is totally inadequate and antiquated, covers a large catchment area, comprising the Glangevlin, Blacklion and Dowra areas.  Situated near Blacklion is Loughan House with a large number of inmates.  Such institutions may need to avail of those emergency services from time to time.</P>
    <P>A new fire station would be a tremendous asset to an area where there has been very little State investment to date. I appeal to the Minister of State to give my renewed representations favourable and urgent consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval in principle was granted to Cavan County Council in January 1993 for the development of a proposal for a new fire station at Dowra.  Contract documents were submitted to my Department by the council in March <Col N="899" /> 1994 and the council has sought approval to proceed to the next stage of the project, which is the seeking of tenders for the construction of the station. While the question of allowing the project to go to tender stage is under consideration in my Department, I cannot say at this stage when the proposal can be released having regard to the current level of demand under the fire services capital programme.</P>
      <P>The capital available for the fire service development programme in 1996 amounts to £4.5 million.  This is the same as the amount provided in 1995 and represents an increase of half a million pounds, or 12½ per cent, over the amounts provided in the years from 1992 to 1994.</P>
      <P>While we have been able to increase the funding available in recent years for the fire services, various demands must be met from the overall provision, including the building of new fire stations, the purchase of appliances and other equipment, and the provision of a regional communications and mobilisation infrastructure.  In addition, the carry-over of commitments in respect of work in progress or recently completed places a heavy demand on the available funds.  These upfront bills represent a first call on the moneys available in any year.</P>
      <P>Dowra fire station comprises a nissen hut which I understand was relocated from Ballyconnell only a few years ago. The level of operational demand on the Dowra service is quite low.  Nevertheless, there is a case for replacing the existing structure as soon as resources allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is fully aware of the importance of a modern and efficient fire service in the community and will continue to support the valuable work being done and the development of the service.  Since 1981, over £80 million has been invested in the construction of over 90 fire stations; the purchase of well over 300 new fire appliances and <Col N="900" /> other equipment and the development of the Regional Computer Assisted Mobilisation project.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council has shared in the benefits deriving from this investment. In 1987, a new headquarters fire station was completed in Cavan town and new stations were provided in Killeshandra and Ballyconnell in 1986 and 1987.  Over £1.3 million was provided to Cavan County Council in grants for these improvements.  In addition, almost £1 million has been provided to Cavan by my Department since 1982 for the purchase of appliances and equipment for its fire services.  We will continue to give full and careful consideration to the needs of County Cavan as resources allow, but these needs will have to be considered in the context of the overall demand from all parts of the county.</P>

Mar sin caithfidh mé glacadh leis nach deascéal ar bith do mhuintir Rosmuc nár fhan an tAire &mdash; a bhí anseo deich nóiméad ó shin &mdash; leis an gcás seo a phlé liom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táim ar iarraidh cás a dhéanamh do mhuintir Rosmuc.  Go minic nuair a bhím istigh sa bhaile mór cuireann sé íontas orm nuair a chloisim iad ag rá go mba cheart áiseanna spóirt a chur ar fáil ar chostas iomlán an Bhardais nó an Stáit.  Ní mar sin do cheantair tuaithe, áiteanna in a mbíonn daoine sásta cur ar a son féin.  Tá fhios ag an Aire Stáit ó tharla gur Aire Stáit na Gealtachta é <Col N="901" /> na fadhbanna móra a bhaineann le ceantar Rosmuc.  Tuigeann sé go bhfuil titim leanúnach tubaisteach ar an daonra sa cheantar sin agus go bhfuil an ceantar in ísle brí.  Ainneoin sin agus uile rinne muintir an cheantair an-ghaisce le cupla bliain anuas agus tá £84,000 bailithe acu le páirc peile a thógáil sa cheantar sin.  Mar a chonaic muid in ár gceantar féin, go minic nuair a thosaíonn pobal ag cur ar a son féin ó thaobh cúrsaí spóirt agus caithimh aimsire de is é a tharlaíonn in a dhiaidh sin ná go gcuirtear chun leas eacnamaíochta an cheantair.</P>

Tuigtear dom ó mhuintir na haite go bhfuil bliain imithe ó chuir siad an chéad iarratas isteach go dtí an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta le deontas chun cuidiú leis an togra seo. Cuireadh meastachán criochniúil go dtí an Roinn i mí Márta seo caite.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because of the deep public concern about the continuing Bord na Móna saga which has been running for over two months.  It has been an unseemly, vicious and nasty battle dominated by manipulative media leaks.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna has become a successful State company for a number of years.  However, no more than any other business, it cannot afford to lose two months of the time of the board and its management, but that appears to have been the consequence of this affairs. The eye of management and the board has been taken off the real issues of importance to Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>This matter has also impacted on the morale of the Bord na Móna workforce. Staff morale has been seriously dented and irreparable damage has been done to the company's corporate reputation by the stream of newspaper headlines. Much of the comment that appeared in the media has been based on leaked reports constructed in a fashion to maximise the damage to the reputation of one individual.  This has not happened by accident.  There is an agenda at play in Bord na Móna.  It is a disgraceful way to conduct an investigation and amounts to trial by selected medial leaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to explain his role in this <Col N="905" /> affair.  What part has he played in leaking these reports?  He and his Department are among a handful who have had the documents and have had access to additional information.  Have they briefed the media on this matter?  I want the Minister to say what he thinks about the campaign of half-truths and manipulative media leaks.  I would also like him to explain what contacts he has had with the chairman of Bord na Móna during this controversy.</P>
    <P>Last year we saw how the Minister does business in relation to semi-State companies.  We saw his lack of respect for the offices of the State and the manner in which he and his army of advisers briefed journalists.  We saw the Minister trying to defend himself and, in turn, trying to destroy the reputations of some individuals by the selective leaking of information.  There are echoes of that campaign in the Bord na Móna affair and I see the Minister's hand in several parts of the controversy.  To quote from <i>The Irish Times,</i> the Minister should take a hand now to bring matters to a speedy conclusion, not least of all in his own interest.  As <i>The Irish Times</i> reported in its editorial, surely it is remarkable that so many issues within the Minister's purview seem to terminate in recrimination and grief.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Bord na Móna investigation has been conducted is disgraceful and breaches many of the principles of natural justice.  If the Minister refuses to step into the affair I would ask the Taoiseach to take urgent action to return some dignity to our State enterprises.</P>
    <P>A number of issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There should be a full examination to establish where the responsibility lies for these selective leaks.  It should be established who authorised the widening and deepending of the terms of reference of the Price Waterhouse report.  The reports prepared by the chairman of Bord na Móna on the remuneration of the chief executive, as required by the Cromien guidelines, should be placed in the Oireachtas Library, as requested by the <Col N="906" /> Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Ahern, yesterday.</P>
    <P>The former chairman of Bord na Móna, whose silence in this affair has been remarkable, should immediately come before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies and answer questions.  The Minister must bring this shameful spectacle to an end.  He must investigate and explain this matter and put a stop to the secret agendas in regard to Bord na Móna in the interests of the 2,500 people who work in that fine State company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues raised in the reports referred by the Deputy are the subject of ongoing consideration by the board of Bord na Móna.  The board had several recent meetings to discuss these issues and is meeting again early next week.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate in the circumstances to say anything further in the House on this matter until the board's deliberations are completed and the chairman has reported to the Minister. However, I confirm that Deputy Molloy, during his tenure as Minister for Energy, advised Bord na Móna that strict adherence to the Report on Guidelines for State Bodies, often referred to as the Cromien Report, was essential.  Deputy Cowen as Minister directed that Bord na Móna observe in detail the requirements of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Renumeration, Report No. 35, referred to popularly as Gleeson 2.  As the House will know the reference to pay and expenses in that report are explicit.  Furthermore, the former Chairman of Bord na Móna affirmed to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in 1995 and to his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, in 1993 and 1994, that Government guidelines on the pay of the chief executive were being complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm the statement made by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications yesterday that one <Col N="907" /> copy of the draft Price Waterhouse Report was received by the Secretary of the Department, it was not copied and at all stages was kept confidential.  The same is true of the final Price Waterhouse report.  Any inference that somehow the submission of these reports to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications can be linked to information in the media is wrong.  At no stage has the Minister for Transport, <Col N="908" /> Energy and Communications had possession, or even sight of, the draft report, the final report or any appended information.  However, he has been kept informed of developments by the Secretary in his role as Accounting Officer for the Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 June 1996.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from previous questions she has raised on this matter, I undertook to contact each of the transport operators currently participating in the free travel <Col N="771" /> pass scheme on the question of accessible transport.  There are currently 52 operators which include the CIE Group, Northern Ireland Railways, 37 private bus operators, 11 private ferry operators and two private airline operators.  Last November my Department wrote to the 48 transport operators who were in the scheme at that time requesting details of any arrangements which they had in place to cater for the specific needs of disabled or infirm people wishing to use their transport services.</P>
      <P>In particular, the transport operators were asked:</P>
      <P>(1)if their drivers were encouraged to assist disabled passengers in embarking or disembarking from their vehicles,</P>
      <P>(2)if they had boarding ramps to enable wheelchair to embark and disembark in safety,</P>
      <P>(3)if they had spaces on board their vehicles which were set aside for the exclusive use of disabled passengers,</P>
      <P>(4)what plans, if any, they had to provide such facilities in the near future, and</P>
      <P>(5)if they had any other ideas how access for disabled people might be improved on the transport services they provide.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 36 written replies have been received and reminders have issued to those operators who have not yet responded.  Most of the operators who replied have indicated that they were able to provide some form of facility for the disabled.  All of them stated that their drivers assist disabled people in whatever way possible.  Some respondents said that they would be prepared to adapt their vehicles or invest in new ones if they received financial assistance from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated previously, I will review the situation in the light of the responses received from all transport operators to see what can be done to <Col N="772" /> further address the issue of accessible transport for infirm people or people with disabilities within the scope of my Department's free travel scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 22 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  I share with the rest of the community a deep appreciation of the vital role played by people who devote their lives to the care of others.  This role, in itself, is an indicator of the potential of the scheme and has been highlighted on a number of occasions by interested <Col N="773" /> organisations, notably the Carer's Association.</P>
    <P>At the end of April 1996, a total of 7,587 people were in receipt of the carer's allowance at a cost this year of some £27 million.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the scheme has come in for some criticism since it was introduced in 1990, mainly due to the operation of the means test.  Nonetheless, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years. For example, in 1995 the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further improved with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipients of occupational pensions.  Last week, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 to £67.50 which is an 8 per cent increase on last year's rate.</P>
    <P>In addition, I also announced last week the introduction of new regulations which change the basis of assessment of means of carers for the purpose of determining entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance. As a result of these changes, carers who are receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements from the health boards stand to benefit by as much as £29 per week.  The new regulations also mean that some applicants who previously failed to qualify on the basis of their means will now be in a position to qualify for the allowance.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any request made to me to commission the ESRI to undertake a cost benefit study on the potential savings on institutional care that would accrue from an improvement of the means test for the allowance.  I would point out, however, that the further development of the carer's allowance is currently being examined in the context of a review of the allowance which is being carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health having regard to general health care provision in the home for elderly and disabled people <Col N="774" /> requiring care.  In this regard, all aspects of the current operation of the carer's allowance are being considered in the light of our experience to date.  Any proposals arising from the review would, of course, have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to the answers I gave to Question No. 128 on Tuesday 11 June and to Question No. 8 on 3 April 1996.  The situation in relation to the Poverty 4 Programme remains unchanged since then in that the proposed programme is still effectively blocked at council.</P>
      <P>Despite interventions by myself and other members of the Irish Government, two member states remain strongly opposed to the Commission's proposals for a fourth poverty programme. Indeed, apart from raising the matter at Council of Ministers meetings, I have had detailed meetings with Ministers in the countries concerned and will be continuing this process in the context of the Irish Presidency.  It is clear however, that these objections are deep seated and that there is very little likelihood that the Commission's proposals will gain acceptance in their current form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> I reject the view that this issue should be seen purely in terms of obtaining additional EU funds for Ireland.  To do so is to misunderstand the role and importance of a further EU poverty programme.  From Ireland's point of view the issue is not a budgetary one. The real question is what we can do about the gulf between those European citizens who benefit from increased economic growth and those who do not.</P>
    <P>A European dimension to tackling poverty and social exclusion is essential if we are to make significant progress in tackling what is a European-wide problem. For this reason, the Deputies may be interested to note that I am undertaking two separate initiatives.</P>
    <P>First, as part of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Government will seek a treaty change on social exclusion.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the European Union will be better able to combat poverty in the future.  While this initiative will not directly affect Poverty 4, it is to be hoped that if we are successful, two things may happen.</P>
    <P>The competence of the EU to engage in such programmes will be clarified and, second, it will permit more significant European poverty initiatives in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee of course that we will be successful, nor should Deputies expect this objective to be delivered overnight.  I have no doubt it will be a very long and difficult process of negotiation.</P>
    <P>But tackling poverty and social exclusion is something that I believe is so important for all the peoples of Europe that we must try everything in our power to make sure that it remains high on the European agenda.</P>
    <P>The second initiative I am undertaking is to endeavour to ensure that social exclusion remains a high priority issue all through Ireland's Presidency.  At the first informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers' meeting in July we will be discusssing the general issue of social <Col N="776" /> protection and long-term unemployment but with particular reference to making our social protection systems more effective in helping the most disadvantaged members of society and their search for employment.</P>
    <P>I will seek to further the debate regarding social exclusion through discussion wherever possible, including, for example, at such conferences as the &ldquo;New Directions in Social Welfare&rdquo; conference in Dublin in November.  At the Social Affairs Council in December I hope, in the context of the discussion on the Commission's Communication on &ldquo;the Future of Social Protection&rdquo; to lead a discussion among my fellow Ministers on what we should be doing to address this most important issue.</P>
    <P>In this context, I would also hope to share with our European partners my experience of the development of our own national initiative currently under way to combat social exclusion, the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, a process which I know a number of other European countries are watching with great interest.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 30, 38, 42, 52 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the student summer job scheme is to provide income support for the less well off third level students who are debarred from qualifying for unemployment assistance during the summer months by virtue of the provisions of section 126 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>Priority therefore is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students who have no other means of support to participate within the overall financial allocation for the 1996 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objective this year was to provide as many places as possible within the financial allocation of £10.2 million for students who are debarred from qualifying for unemployment assistance. Students who still have a legal right to <Col N="778" /> claim unemployment assistance during the summer period, such as mature students and those who have completed a course of study, are not deprived of income support and therefore are not eligible for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The hourly rate of pay was increased by me to £3 last year and this increased rate applies again this year.  Post leaving certificate, PLC, students are, in general, not eligible for the scheme as the vast majority of them will have their courses completed this summer and are entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer period if they fail to obtain employment.  However, a small proportion of PLC students, who have not completed multi-year courses, are being accepted for this year's scheme as they are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The scheme was never intended for those who are entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  To include such students would squeeze out the more needy students.</P>
    <P>The non-statutory nature of the scheme allows some measure of flexibility in its operation and administration. For example, this year I was able to allow students who reach 18 years during the course of the scheme to participate from their 18th birthday without the need for amending legislation. There are however certain advantages in having the scheme statutorily based and I will consider this in the context of next years scheme.</P>
    <P>The primary reason for the decision to discontinue the payment of the £200 allowance to students whose parents are reliant on social welfare payments was to allow the maximum number of eligible students to avail of the scheme this year within the budget allocation of £10.2 million.</P>
    <P>A review of the 1996 scheme will be carried out later in the year when the scheme is finished.  I have no plans to evaluate the scheme until all the relevant information and statistics are available to me during the latter half of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years my Department has introduced a number of new payment methods and options for social welfare customers.  My intention is to continue this process to ensure that the most modern and the widest range of payment methods are available for people.</P>
      <P>An Post is currently the principal agency through which payments are delivered to social welfare customers. Each week An Post delivers an average of 872,000 payments with a total value of £52.37 million to social welfare customers. An Post liaises closely with An Garda Síochána in relation to the security of its cash transit operations and arrangements.</P>
      <P>Payment by way of cheque is available for certain schemes, principally for people claiming disability benefit and for some unemployed people.</P>
      <P>Electronic funds transfer, which enables payment to be made by direct credit to personal accounts at An Post, banks and certain other financial institutions, is available across a number of social welfare schemes, including child benefit, pensions, unemployment and sickness schemes.  Currently some 88,900 people are availing of this option and some 25 per cent of all new child benefit and 16 per cent of all new pensions customers opt for this method of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New technologies and cashless money transmission facilities which are now coming on stream are being examined by my Department with a view to further expanding the range of payment methods from which customers may <Col N="780" /> choose.  In this context, exploratory discussions have been held with the banks and others to establish the role, if any, which the cashless payment methods can play in the delivery of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>My Department has also had exploratory discussions with the credit union movement with a view to extending an electronic payment option to their members.  A number of issues of a banking, technical and administrative nature have been identified and need to be resolved before this option will become available.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will understand that, by and large, we still live in a cash-based society and people must have ready access to cash, particularly to meet their day to day needs.  This requirement is not unique to social welfare customers, it applies to society in general.  Consequently, movements of bulk cash are unavoidable at present.  However, every opportunity to reduce the volume of cash which must be transferred in bulk to meet the needs of social welfare customers is examined and is availed of, where practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 47 together.  During the debate in this House on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, I made known that I was taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one-parent family payment and disability allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all the various social assistance payments.  In determining entitlement to these payments, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of these provisions to other social assistance payments will have to be done progressively over a period of time.  However, in view of the significant administrative implications involved.  There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment at present and the means of all those with capital will have to be <Col N="782" /> reviewed on the introduction of changes to the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>For this reason, it would not be feasible from an administrative point of view to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients as rates fluctuate.  I consider the provisions for the assessment of capital under the new one-parent family payment and new disability allowance preferable to the uncertainty likely to be caused to low income families from any attempt to assess actual interest earned on capital.</P>
    <P>In addition, the substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rate for most recipients and will mean that claimants are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.  The cost of extending these arrangements to other social assistance payments is in the region of £9.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I would, firstly, refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to a similar question asked by him (Question No. 250) on Tuesday, 21 May 1996.  The Combat Poverty Agency (CPA), a statutory agency under the aegis of my Department, has in co-operation with Area Development Management Ltd. (ADM), responsibility for three measures under the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money allocated under the Department of Social Welfare, administered through the Combat Poverty Agency is approximately £13 <Col N="783" /> million, counting both Exchequer and EU funds, over the initial funding period for the programme (up to end 1997). The funding is allocated under the following measures: Measure 3.4 &mdash; Cross-Border Community Reconciliation; Measure 4.1 &mdash; Developing Grass Roots Capacity and Promoting the Inclusion of Women; and Measure 4.4 &mdash; Promoting the Inclusion of Vulnerable Groups.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the CPA is managing its part of the Programme jointly with ADM, taking on board a total of 12 measures under the special support programme and totalling approximately £33 million.  I have been informed by the joint CPA/ADM Office in Monaghan that a figure of the order of £1 million will have been agreed in the form of grants to projects by the end of this week.  The Combat Poverty Agency's contribution to this will be roughly half the total figure.</P>
    <P>It is a condition of the agreement between the CPA and ADM and the European Commission that projects seeking funding will be evaluated and awarded funding, where appropriate, independently of any involvement by Government Departments.  For this reason, while my Department has been involved in the policy and planning stages of the programme's development and while it continues to be involved in an advisory capacity and supporting role, it has no responsibility for awarding funding to specific projects under the Programme and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment on such awards, particularly since, as I understand it, a public announcement in relation to the funding of projects under the programme will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has recently finalised its report.  The practical arrangements for printing of the report are under way, and it is intended to publish the report in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The group has already submitted two sets of proposals to Government.  It was asked to furnish an interim report on measures which could be undertaken in the 1994 budget to reduce poverty traps and increase incentives to work.  It presented this interim report in late 1993.  This made two specific recommendations for the 1994 budget.  These were easing of the means test for lone parent's allowance to make it more attractive for lone parents to take up work, and abolition of the arrangement whereby employers of medical card holders had to pay the health contribution and employment and training levy on behalf of these employees.  Both these issues were addressed in the 1994 budget, and the necessary legislation was included in the 1994 Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>The working group also submitted a number of proposals which were implemented by the Government in the 1996 budget.  These were: retention of the medical card when a long-term unemployed person takes up work; allowing a long-term unemployed person to retain child dependant allowances for up to 13 weeks on taking up employment, pending a decision on their FIS application; and simplification of the means test for unemployment assistance, to make it easier for unemployed people to take up casual or parttime work.</P>
      <P>When I have had time to consider the group's final report in detail, and in the light of the public response to the report.  I will be consulting with the other Departments concerned, with a view to putting forward specific proposals for a structured response by Government to the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 37 together.  As the Deputies will be aware, one of the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly was that my Department introduce a £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary groups in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.  Subsequently, I established an advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association for Victim Support, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána are represented, to devise a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme, entitled a Scheme of Community Support for Older People was advertised on Wednesday, 28 May, in the national newspapers.  The scheme is open to any voluntary or communitybased organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people.  It was decided that to make the <Col N="786" /> funds available through voluntary organisations was the most appropriate way of ensuring that the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  I was aware that many voluntary organisations are already providing services such as those covered by this new scheme and have developed expertise and local contacts.  Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the greatest need in their communities. Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application and can have their needs met with the minimum of administration and without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances by Department staff.  I am satisfied that this is the most appropriate way in which to structure my Department's response to the situation.</P>
    <P>The deadline for receipt of applications is 28 June 1996.  This is to allow time for my Department to assess all applications and to ensure that those most at risk benefit from the available funds before the onset of winter.  Applications received after the formal closing date will still receive consideration, in the light of the resources still available at that time.  However, Members will appreciate the need to commence assessment of applications and to have grants made as soon as possible to ensure that the scheme benefits people before the nights get dark.  To formally extend the closing date could be counterproductive in that regard.</P>
    <P>My Department had been in contact with a number of relevant national organisations prior to the formal advertisement of the scheme with a view to disseminating information on the grants and enabling voluntary organisations to compile applications in advance of the public advertisement.  The scheme is being administered in each of my Department's regions with the aid of a regional advisory committee which mirrors the composition of the national advisory committee referred to above.</P>
    <P>A total of eight applications had been <Col N="787" /> received in my Department's regional offices at close of business yesterday. This follows the normal pattern seen in relation to my Department's grant schemes in that the bulk of applications are received just before the closing date. As the closing date for the scheme is 28 June, no applications have yet been approved nor have any payments been made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 48 together.  I am aware of the comments made by the Ombudsman in his recently published 1995 Annual Report, relating to the existing provisions for the payment of arrears of social welfare payments on foot of late claims.  As I indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions, my Department has been reviewing the provisions which limit the period in respect of which arrears are payable to six months.  The work undertaken to date indicates that if there were no restrictions on the payment of arrears in the case of retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension and widow's and <Col N="788" /> widower's (contributory) pension, the cost would be in the region of £5.7 million. Any relaxation in the present arrangements would have to be considered, therefore, in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced a number of initiatives over recent years aimed at improving the quality of service delivery.  These initiatives include: the provision of more services locally; substantial improvement in claim processing times; introduction of new payment methods; provision of new offices and systematic refurbishment of older offices; and better access and focus on the provision of privacy facilities.</P>
      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative recently launched by the Government has presented an opportunity to build on these initiatives.  Priority is being given to the development of a customer service action programme, the primary objective of which is to develop and build on the existing customer service culture that exists across my Department.</P>
      <P>Specifically the objectives of this programme are: to put in place participative structures where customers can express opinions and give feedback thus enabling the services to be delivered in a way which is more responsive to their needs; to equip staff, through training and development, to fulfil customer service objectives; to develop measurable customer service quality standards; and to provide better quality information and advice about entitlement in individual circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> Customer consultation has been part of the normal activity of my Department over the past number of years.  It is facilitated through customer surveys, customer comment cards and customer panels.  The objective of this activity is to elicit feedback on the various services that we deliver on an on-going basis and to ensure that we are aware of customer needs, attitudes and expectations.  It is through this process that we will improve the quality of our services in a way that is responsive and relevant to the needs of our wide range of customers.</P>
    <P>My Department recently commissioned an independent customer survey which was undertaken on our behalf by MRBI.  The results of this research showed a high level of overall satisfaction among existing customers and further confirmed the improvements that have already taken place in the quality of the services which we deliver. The survey also provided valuable feedback regarding areas that are still in need of further improvement.  The survey highlighted that further attention is required in the areas of information dissemination and the provision of privacy facilities.  This confirmed what had also emerged from other feedback.</P>
    <P>It is our goal to provide relevant, timely and accurate information and continually seek to identify new ways of getting information on our services to those who need it, when they need it. We are examining the implications of the survey findings to see how best we can adapt our procedures to achieve this goal.  The provision of privacy facilities will continue to receive primary consideration in the design of all new local office buildings and in all office refurbishment projects.  I am committed to the ongoing development of our customer service programme which will ensure that the quality of our services are enhanced and meet the highest standards of what can be provided.</P>

      <P>This year, the back to school clothing and footwear scheme will be run on a different administrative basis compared to previous years in so far as the scheme is now paid on an age-related rather than a school-related <Col N="791" /> basis.  An allowance of £43 will be payable in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and an allowance of £58 will be payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years of age.</P>
      <P>This change was necessary in order to facilitate the computerisation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the roll-out of which began this week and will take up to mid-1997 to complete.</P>
      <P>Once computerised, the back to school clothing and footwear scheme can be administered more efficiently. From 1997, applications under the back to school clothing and footwear scheme will be processed on computer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the current social welfare system is a very complex and wide-rang-ing system which provides a comprehensive range of services to those in our society who are in need of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the nature of the services we provide, it is inevitable that the evolution of the social welfare system has been largely on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis over a number of decades with new schemes being developed to meet urgent and emerging needs of the day.  As a consequence, we now have a system <Col N="792" /> which is, in my view, overly complex and which requires to be reformed and streamlined.</P>
    <P>I believe that such reform is necessary for a number of reasons.  First, the system must be simplified so that clear and easily understood information on social welfare entitlements is readily available to all our citizens.</P>
    <P>Second, we need to tackle the internal inconsistencies which have developed within the social welfare system, and third we need to ensure that the social welfare system interacts more efficiently and more effectively with other areas such as the employment services, taxation, and the health services.</P>
    <P>The substantial reform of the social welfare system which is now required is clearly not capable of being achieved overnight.  It is necessarily an incremental process but one on which a start has already been made.  This year's Social Welfare Act, for instance, provides for the introduction of the new one parent family payment, which will amalgamate the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and will remove the concept of desertion from the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas which are receiving priority attention.  In the area of income adequacy, the increases provided for in the 1996 budget have enabled us to make real progress towards achieving the main target rate set ten years ago by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Contributory pensioners remain well ahead of the main rate while, for the first time, widows, widowers and deserted wives have reached the target rate; carers and invalidity pensioners are now on 99 per cent and 97 per cent of the rate, respectively; and all other groups are either at 92 per cent or 95 per cent of the target rate.</P>
    <P>I have also commissioned the ESRI to review the minimum adequate income rates that were recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and I look forward to receiving their report in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Attention has also been directed to <Col N="793" /> the area of supporting those engaged in part-time, casual and low-paid employment. The Social Welfare Act, 1996 provides for radical reform of unemployment assistance which will greatly simplify what is now an extremely complex system and which will make it more attractive for people to avail of parttime and casual work opportunities.  It also provides for significant improvements in family income supplement, for substantial pro-employment PRSI changes, and for the retention of child dependant allowances for 13 weeks in the case of people who have been unemployed for over a year and who have secured employment expected to last for at least four weeks.</P>
    <P>In addition, the forthcoming publication of the final report of the expert group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems will provide further opportunities for planned and effective reform of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In relation to child income support, the Deputy will be aware of the very substantial increases provided for in child benefit in 1995 and again this year.</P>
    <P>Taking the two years together, a 45 per cent increase has been provided in respect of the first two children and a 36 per cent increase for other children. Child benefit is one of our most effective means of tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.</P>
    <P>A further crucial area relates to the issue of funding our pensions system in the future.  The National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; has put forward a range of recommendations which are being examined at present in my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> The priorities for the ongoing programme of social welfare reform are those clearly enunciated in the Programme for a Government of Renewal agreed between the three Government parties and the social welfare commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreed with the social partners.  Progress in achieving those objectives must have regard to the availability of resources in the overall budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of undertakings having been given along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  I did, however, give very clear and specific undertakings that I would introduce in advance of the divorce referendum the changes necessary to ensure that no spouse or child would be disadvantaged in terms of their social welfare entitlements as a result of their legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  That commitment has been met in full by way of the provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>The method of assessing means for the purpose of entitlement to unemployment assistance is provided for in legislation.  It includes a notional assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicants.  The first £400 of capital is assessed at 5 per cent, while the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.  Where an applicant for unemployment assistance is in the process of changing residence and has capital in hands for that purpose arising from the sale of his/her previous residence, my Department's general approach would be to have regard to the particular circumstances involved and not to automatically assess that capital as means. While each case would have to be assessed on its merits, the possession of capital in such circumstances would not necessarily affect entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy may have a particular case in mind and, if he will provide me with the details, I will have the matter examined by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Family Income Supplement (FIS) is currently available to employees on low earnings with children.  A significant number of improvements to FIS were provided for in the 1996 budget, including an increase of £10 in the weekly income limits used to determine entitlement, thereby ensuring that most recipients will receive an increase of £6 per week.  The Social Welfare Act, 1996, also provided for a related improvement, which allows people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more to retain entitlement to increases for children (Child Dependant Allowances) payable at the full rate, for a period of up to 13 weeks on taking up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This improvement will alleviate the difficulties encountered by some families during the period between the termination of their unemployment payment and the award of FIS.  This is designed to complement the support provided by FIS for low paid workers.  While it is not possible to estimate the number of children who will benefit from this measure, about 35,500 children will benefit as a result of increased FIS payments alone.</P>
      <P>The extension of FIS to self-employed people with children was estimated in 1994 to cost in the region of £30 million in a full year.  This cost is in addition to the existing cost of providing unemployment assistance to self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the cost <Col N="800" /> of extending FIS to community employment workers as the number of such workers who would qualify is not available.</P>
    <P>The cost of basing FIS on net income is estimated to be in the region of £16 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed under the Programme of Renewal to enhance the overall child income support system of which the current FIS payment is an important part, in order to combat the incidence of child poverty.  Various options for reform have been examined by the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare. The group has completed their final report and this is expected to be available within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Claims by non-nationals for social welfare payments are determined in accordance with the same statutory conditions as claims by Irish nationals and, accordingly, the nationality of social welfare claimants is not an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU social security regulations are a complex set of regulations covering migrant workers who are EU nationals and members of their families. The regulations provide for equality of treatment between workers who are nationals and other EU nationals in relation to Irish social insurance and social assistance payments covered by the regulations.  The regulations provide, among other things, for the aggregation, where necessary, of a worker's insurance record in all member states for the purpose of acquiring or retaining the right to benefit.  Thus, workers who <Col N="801" /> do not satisfy the contribution conditions in our national legislation can rely on aggregation to qualify for payment of Irish benefits, such as disability benefit and unemployment benefit and in certain circumstances, invalidity pensions.</P>
    <P>If such persons have been insured in Ireland for at least one year, they can qualify for <i>pro-rata</i> pensions (i.e. invalidity pension, survivor's pension and old age contributory pension) paid by Ireland if they do not qualify for such payments under our national legislation only.  With regard to supplementary welfare allowance, which is not covered by the EU regulations, all persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs may qualify for payment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also concluded bilateral social security agreements with a number of countries which are designed to protect social security (pension) rights and prevent the possible double liability for payment of social security contributions. The agreements do not cover short-term social security payments such as unemployment benefit, disability benefit, and so on.</P>

      <P>The social welfare amnesty, announced in June 1993, was designed to give social welfare customers including recipients of payments and those liable for PRSI contributions, whose affairs were not in order, an opportunity to regularise their positions.  The amnesty ended on 14 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 596 persons who had received payments to which they were not entitled, were granted the social welfare amnesty.  The total amount of savings assessed from the termination of <Col N="802" /> claims and the determination of over-payments amounted to £2.3 million.</P>
    <P>The collection of PRSI and the imposition of penalties in respect of arrears is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  Persons who availed of the general tax amnesty were required to pay their PRSI liability with other taxes to the Revenue Commissioners. Some £5 million PRSI was collected in this manner.</P>
    <P>The incentive tax amnesty operated by Revenue did not cover PRSI, but arrangements were made for 2,399 persons who availed of the amnesty to pay their PRSI liability in full direct to my Department.  The total received to date is almost £1.3 million.</P>

      <P>First, I should explain that under subsection 172(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, people in full-time education are excluded from entitlement to assistance, including rent supplements, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance, SWA, scheme.  However, subsection 172 (2) allows a person in a full-time education an entitlement to SWA, including rent supplements, in respect of their adult or child dependants.</P>
      <P>Article 7 of SI 382 of 1995 also allows persons participating in specified second chance educational schemes to retain SWA secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which they may have qualified for prior to participation on the scheme.  Any extension of rent supplementation to students would have major financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question relating to the national anti-poverty strategy, the development of the whole strategy has been characterised a process of &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; consultation.  This is perhaps not surprising considering that the issue is one of how to tackle social &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first stage in the consultation process involved an invitation, by way of an information leaflet which was circulated to a very wide range of interested organisations last year, seeking views on the content of the strategy and the process by which it should be prepared.  The Union of Students of Ireland, USI, submitted a paper at that time.  Two hundred and forty one submissions, including USI's contribution, have been summarised, published and circulated for consideration.</P>
    <P>The second stage in the consultation process took place last January when regional seminars on the strategy were held in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Monaghan. A further major process of consultation in relation to the strategy is planned in the near future and the Union of Students of Ireland will be able, in the same way as other interested organisations, to contribute to the process.</P>

      <P>Death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18. The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the grant, which was introduced with effect from 1 October 1970, was to help with funeral and other <Col N="804" /> post-bereavement costs.  The rate of grant payable has not been increased since 1982.  Clearly, the value of the grant has fallen having regard to average funeral costs.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, that there are other measures in place which are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement.  For example, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for six weeks. In addition, payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
    <P>The rate of death grant is reviewed in the context of the budget each year in common with all other social welfare rates of payment.  I will be reviewing the present arrangements with a view to developing improved provision for income support for bereaved persons generally.</P>

      <P>Discussions involving officials of my Department, the other interested Departments &mdash; Finance, Health, Enterprise and Employment &mdash; and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the issue of payment of PRSI and levies on maintenance income were concluded in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to an earlier parliamentary question from Deputy Clohessy, I informed the House on 4 October 1995, Dáil Debates, columns 1033 and 1034, that a consensus emerged from the discussions referred to above that no change should be made to the treatment of social insurance contributions on the <Col N="805" /> grounds that they form the basis of individual entitlements to social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Social insurance contributions confer substantial benefits on the contributor and ensure an adequate level of social protection.  I believe the arrangements whereby recipients of maintenance payments make social insurance contributions is equitable.  The effect of both spouses making PRSI contributions is that each spouse builds up a social insurance record in their own right.  In this way, for example, each spouse can, in due course, qualify for a retirement or old age (contributory) pension.</P>
    <P>This is preferable to one spouse being deemed an adult dependant of the other or, alternatively, having to undergo a means test for entitlement to an old age (non-contributory) pension.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right.  I feel that coverage under the system should be extended as widely as possible and should afford protection to separated spouses.  It is, therefore, appropriate that social insurance contributions be made in respect of income from maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>It was agreed in the course of the interdepartmental discussions referred to above that the health contributions and the employment/training levies should not be imposed on that part of the maintenance payer's income which is paid to his or her separated spouse under an enforceable maintenance contract. This was done on the basis that no specific benefits accrue to individuals on foot of paying these levies.  The exemption was implemented in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, with effect from 6 April 1995.  This brings the treatment of the levies into line with that of the tax system. Finally, maintenance payments made in respect of children are not subject to PRSI in the hands of the maintenance recipient.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.  Expenditure on the scheme this year will amount to some £32.7 million and benefit about 470,000 people.  The question of improvements is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the scheme since its inception in 1967. They are necessary on city and provincial bus routes because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.  However, time restrictions do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions apply in the case of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., Monday to Friday inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  The removal of these restrictions would have significant cost <Col N="807" /> implications for the transport companies involved which in turn would seek compensation from my Department.  In relation specifically to Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann, it is understood that both companies would not be in a position to lift the current time restrictions, even if appropriate compensation was offered, because of the major passenger capacity constraints operating in their case at those peak times of the day.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have no plans to alter the current time restrictions applying in the case of the free travel scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the community development programme, CDP, funding is provided towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in an area and to other specialised community development projects.</P>
      <P>The programme was established in 1990 when 15 projects were funded at a cost of £0.522 million.  It was expanded in the following years during the terms of office of my predecessors, Deputies McCreevy and Woods, and by the end of 1994 included a total of 47 projects with a budget of £2.2 million.  Sixty-three projects have signed funding contracts with my Department and a further 17 are in the pipeline.  In addition, funding is provided for eight support agencies, five island development associations and ten family resource centres.  The budget for the programme this year is £4.46 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to further expansion of the programme to meet the needs of <Col N="808" /> the many disadvantaged local communities and groups that could benefit greatly from the support and resources available under it.  To this end, I am in the process of establishing an expert group to advise me on the inclusion of new projects.  It will have a role in advising on new applications.  It will also have the task of assisting my Department in drawing up a list of 30 new areas throughout the State to be proactively targeted for inclusion in the programme over the next three years.  The 30 areas involved will be identified on the basis of: baseline studies and mapping exercises which indicate geographical areas of need and other sources of information on poverty indicators to identify greatest need among communities of interest; advice on priorities and prospects within regions obtained from local support agencies and the Department's regional offices; and advice on areas and groups to be targeted from ADM, the Combat Poverty Agency, etc.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is a very broad one and touches on just about all areas of my Department's activities not to mention a number of other Ministers' portfolios as well.  I will confine myself to a number of main points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, and most important, the Government, at my suggestion, has embarked on a major project to combat poverty by means of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS.  At the UN World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995, the Irish Government, with other Governments, agreed a programme of action geared to a substantial reduction of overall poverty and inequalities everywhere.  After <Col N="809" /> the summit, the Government accepted my proposals for the development of a strategy by a high level interdepartmental policy committee.</P>
    <P>This committee is composed of representatives of Government Departments and national agencies, FÁS and ADM and has been charged with preparing a report which will form part of the national report for the United Nations, to be completed before the end of 1996 to demonstrate national progress in implementing the UN commitment.</P>
    <P>The strategy has, to date, involved: the preparation of a statement setting out the nature and extent of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland and the evaluation of submissions from the voluntary and community sector, the social partners and other interested bodies and individuals; the selection of key issues &mdash; policy areas which must be addressed if poverty and social exclusion are to be tackled, i.e. educational disadvantage, unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, income adequacy, regenerating disadvantaged communities with concentrations of poverty, and tackling poverty in rural areas; discussing the type of institutional mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the issue of reducing poverty and social exclusion is firmly on the agenda of all Government Departments and agencies and that there is appropriate co-ordination across and between Departments in this area; the holding of regional seminars to discuss the submissions received further.</P>
    <P>The next steps in the process will involve the following: the NAPS process will feed into the Strategic Management Initiative currently under way in the public service &mdash; each Department will review its activities in light of the anti-poverty strategy and areas will be identified which cut across Departments and strategic responses will be developed; the review of and the setting out of institutional mechanisms which should be put in place to ensure that the issue of social exclusion remains a high priority; the voluntary and community sector will <Col N="810" /> continue to be engaged and consulted as part of the process; a report to the UN will be finalised before the end of the year setting out progress to date and a strategy for the future.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to fund and work closely with the Combat Poverty Agency, a statutory agency whose primary aim is to provide policy advice, carry out pilot anti-poverty programmes, commission and carry out research and provide public education and information in order to reduce poverty, inequality and social exclusion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the agency continues to maximise its resources in the fight against poverty, an independent review of its activities has recently been carried out.  I expect to publish it shortly.  The report recommends various proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the agency which I intend to ensure are implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I have overseen the continued expansion of my Department's community development programme.  The programme provides financial assistance towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in areas of disadvantage.  My plans for future expansion and development of the programme are outlined in the reply to a separate question on today's Order Paper.</P>
    <P>There are almost 80 projects participating, or in the process of being set up, in the programme.  The 1996 budget for the programme is approximately £4.5 million.  Other grant schemes to aid the community and voluntary sector to combat poverty are also operated by my Department.  These include schemes of grants to voluntary organisations, locally based women's and men's groups, lone parents groups and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</P>
    <P>I have recently introduced, in the context of the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, various changes to the social welfare system itself which are in various ways designed to combat poverty and social exclusion.  These include: a 3 per <Col N="811" /> cent increase in weekly personal and adult dependant rates of payment and an increase of £2 in the monthly rates of child benefit; and an important reform of the unemployment assistance scheme with the aim of making it more attractive for people to take up part-time employment by enabling them to retain a higher proportion of their social welfare payment when they do so thus attempting to reduce so-called &ldquo;poverty traps&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the latter context, the Deputy will wish to note that the working group set up to look at integration issues in relation to the tax and social welfare systems is due to report shortly.</P>
    <P>A prime focus of its work has been the reduction in the number of poverty and unemployment traps in these systems.</P>
    <P>In the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency, I hope to be addressing the matter of social exclusion at EU level in a number of ways.  I hope to be in a position to brief the House from time to time on progress in this area.</P>

      <P>The question of achieving savings in the schemes and services operated by the Department of Social Welfare is part of the normal day to day management of the Department.</P>
      <P>As part of the modernisation of the Department there have been significant changes and improvements in the schemes and services over the last number of years.  These have been designed to improve customer service and to achieve economies and efficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> A number of pro-employment changes were introduced this year to help people move back to work and as a consequence reduce the demands on the unemployment payment schemes. These included: changes in the pay related social insurance, PRSI, scheme; family income supplement, FIS, changes; the extension of payment in respect of child dependants for people on unemployment assistance, to make employment more attractive; the extension of the back to work allowance scheme by 5,000 places, and the provision of 15,000 places on the student summer job scheme.</P>
    <P>On the administration side a number of major changes have taken place in recent years viz: a new central records computer system was introduced to provide a more resilient and comprehensive database of all social welfare customers; a new computer system to integrate the processing of all unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance claims; reduction of the requirement for unemployed persons to &ldquo;sign-on&rdquo; at local offices and improved procedures and processes; elimination of cash payments from departmentally staffed local offices; improved procedures to control abuse of social welfare system.</P>
    <P>My aim is to provide, within available resources, an efficient, modern, responsive and effective service to members of the public who use the Department's services.  The Strategic Management Initiative, recently launched by the Government, with its emphasis on delivering a quality customer service and ensuring value for money, will give additional impetus to this programme of improvement in future.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 enables county boroughs, urban district councils and town commissioners to make arrangements for the provision of meals for children attending national schools in their districts.  The Department of Social Welfare reimburses each local authority up to a maximum of 50 per cent of their expenditure on the provision of such meals.</P>
      <P>The expenditure on the school meals scheme in 1995 broken down by local authority is set out in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.  This shows that a total of £733,263 was spent on the scheme in 1995.  The legislation does not provide for participation by county councils in the scheme.  The Department of Social Welfare has no function in initiating school meals programmes in schools. The Department's function is confined to reimbursing local authorities and approving participation in the scheme.</P>

    <P>County councils are not included; however, following the aboltion of the borough of Dún Laoghaire which participated in the school meals scheme the arrangements were continued in respect of the Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils.  Section 39 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 provides the legislative basis for the continuation.</P>

      <P>While it is clear that the decentralisation programme provides significant benefits to the centres in which offices have been located the effects on Dublin are less clear cut.  However, it is clear that decentralisation makes a contribution to reducing congestion and upward pressure on the cost of office and residential accommodation.  Furthermore, any <Col N="815" /> reduction in total consumer expenditure is marginal in the context of Dublin and will have been offset in recent years by other economic developments.</P>

      <P>Full driving licences are available for one, three and ten year periods and the charges are £4, £12 and £20, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issuing of driving licences to older people is related to the particular requirements which they must fulfil. Over the age of 70, a medical certificate stating fitness to drive and valid for a one or three year period at the certifying practitioner's discretion is required. A one-year licence may be granted in exceptional circumstances where, for medical reasons, a longer-term licence cannot be granted.  This medically related criterion also has implications for the issue of licences to persons aged between 60 and 70 years.  Persons over 60 but under 67 years of age may apply either for a ten year licence which will expire when a person reaches 70 years <Col N="816" /> or for a three year licence.  Persons aged 67 or more may only apply for a three year licence.</P>
    <P>As regards discrimination, I would not accept that older drivers are unduly penalised.  The present costs of driving licences were fixed in 1989 and cannot be considered onerous in the context of motoring costs generally.  On that basis I have no plans at present to alter the current arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.  There is no obligation on Ireland to introduce hepatitis A and B vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation programme. While the WHO has issued recommendations in relation to hepatitis B immunisation, a number of northern European countries where the incidence of hepatitis B is low, including Ireland, do not have plans to introduce this vaccine into their schedule at present.  Hepatitis B vaccine is available to all high risk categories as recommended by the WHO.</P>
      <P>In relation to hepatitis A, the WHO has not issued any recommendations in relation to its inclusion in primary childhood immunisation programmes. Immunisation is generally recommended for frequent travellers to areas of high or moderate prevalence, where there is an occupational risk of infection or where deemed appropriate in an outbreak of infection, for example, in an institution or school.  In the latter circumstances, the vaccination of primary teachers against hepatitis A would be a matter in the first instance for the school's board of management in conjunction with the local health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The drug cost subsidiation scheme, DCSS, caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified by their general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
      <P>Last year the health boards carried out a review of the community drugs schemes generally.  In the case of the DCSS, that review showed there were a considerable number of people who, although holding a DCSS card, had ceased to use it, indicating that they no longer had an ongoing monthly requirement for prescribed medicines in excess of £32 per month in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  A subsequent review by the Southern Health Board of drug cost subsidisation scheme in its own area confirmed this position. Accordingly, card holders who did not meet the criterion for eligibility under this scheme were written to by the board and advised that arrangements were being made to cancel their cards. The board wrote to each person concerned, noting this fact, and suggesting that they should contact the board to discuss their present situation.</P>
      <P>In the case in question the Southern Health Board indicated that it will consider any representations which the person's parents may wish to make outlining why they consider the card should be retained.  The board has confirmed that, in the meantime, the DCSS card will not be cancelled.</P>

      <P>I understand fluoride occurs naturally in the environment and is, consequently, found in water and food.  It is also added to public water suppies in many countries, including Ireland, as a public health measure at a level not exceeding one part per million.</P>
      <P>Information available to my Department confirms that the amount of fluoride ingested in Ireland is not a cause for concern and epidemiological markers confirm this.  I also understand that, according to the World Health Organisation, extensive reviews on foodborne fluoride from plant and animal sources show that fluoride concentrations are low and are not a cause for concern.</P>

      <P>The rights of Irish nationals, who do not come within the terms of the Architects Directive (No. 85/384/EEC), to practise architecture in Ireland are not affected in any way by that directive.</P>
      <P>Persons who do not come within the terms of the directive may, however, encounter difficulty in practising architecture in other member states.  To address this situation, my Department has submitted an amendment to the directive to cover persons claiming established rights to practice here at the date of entry into force of the directive. Applications received from or on behalf of persons wishing to be considered for inclusion in the event of the amendment becoming effective are being reviewed by my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the directive, membership of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland is already one of the formal qualifications which enables a person to take up activities in the field of architecture in other member states by virtue of established rights or existing national provisions.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, states that a number of ordinary primary schools will be designated as centres where students with particular disabilities may be educated.  The concept of the designated school is part of a proposed continuum of provision aimed at ensuring that children with special needs will have access to a variety of placement options capable of meeting their evolving needs in their own areas.  This provision will extend from placements in ordinary primary schools, with special back-up support if necessary, through placement in a designated school, to placement in a special facility dedicated to particular groups.</P>
      <P>The designated schools will be selected on the basis of their capacity to make a positive contribution to meeting the special needs of children with disabilities in their area and having regard to suitability of location.  In addition to offering specialised support for children with disabilities, the designated schools will provide out-reach support services to special needs children attending ordinary schools in their areas.  Special additional resources will be made available to enable designated schools to undertaken these functions.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently developing detailed proposals in relation to this matter in advance of consulting with the relevant partners in education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently launched an important initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, <Col N="858" /> Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers, and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, inviting their application.  The centre will prioritise all applications in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage.  Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>The school authorities recently submitted the developed sketch scheme for this project to the post primary building unit of my Department. When this documentation has been examined in full by my Department's technical staff, the project will be progressed further.  This project is being planned in accordance with the Department's design team procedures relative to large projects, and accordingly, it must proceed as outlined in these procedures. Therefore, it is not possible to combine any of the stages outstanding in the architectural, planning of the proposed new extension.  As the building project is in the early stages of planning, I am not in a position to indicate a proposed timeframe for completion of the extension.  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to progress this project.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that a proportion of the certificates issued each year relates to applications received in a previous year.</P>
    <P>Records of refusal of applications for naturalisation only date back to 1 April 1992.  There were 116 applications refused between 1 April and 31 December 1992.  Figures of refusals for 1993, 1994 and 1995 were 107, 81 and 100 respectively.  It should be explained that many of the those classed as <Col N="861" />&ldquo;refusals&rdquo; on first application would have been naturalised at a later date, having at that time complied with the statutory requirements.  It would involve a disproportionate use of staff resources to prepare an analysis of the cases on the basis of country of origin.</P>
    <P>The review of practices within the Immigration of Citizenship Division with a view to improving its services to the public, including making the process more transparent, is an ongoing process. Developments in this respect in relation to the granting of citizenship do not necessarily require statutory change.</P>

      <P>DNA profiling in criminal matters commenced <Col N="862" /> in the Forensic Science Laboratory in January 1994.  The laboratory has been provided with the necessary specialised equipment at a cost of approximately £180,000 and additional equipment at a cost of approximately £115,000 will be purchased this year to enable it have a faster method of DNA profiling.  The annual cost of bio chemical material for use in the process is approximately £20,000.</P>
      <P>Two molecular biologists were recruited and were trained in this country and in the United Kingdom in the specific techniques in DNA profiling. The cost of these scientists is included in the salaries subhead for the laboratory.</P>
      <P>In 1995, a total of 43 DNA cases were undertaken by the laboratory in which approximately 430 samples were analysed.  Prior to January 1994, it was necessary to forward samples to a commercial company in the UK for testing. Occasionally samples are sent to the British Forensic Science Service in a small number of cases when they cannot be handled by the laboratory because of the volume of samples in any one case or for technical reasons.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Forensic Evidence Act, 1990, if suspects are to be charged, they must be within a period of six months from the date on which they give a sample or in some exceptional cases an extension of time can be applied for to the court.  I am satisfied that the laboratory supplies the necessary statements of evidence to the Garda authorities within the same time limits specified in the Act.</P>

    <P>Since 13 June last, when the increases awarded in this year's budget took effect, the current rates of payment for the above schemes are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Widow's/Widower's Pension/Deserted Wife's Benefit:</i> £68.10 per week with an increase of £17 paid for each qualified child.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Lone Parent's Allowance:</i>£64.50 per week with an increase of £15.20 per week for each qualified child.</P>
    <P>As with any person dependent on long-term social welfare, health board payment or similar payment, parents in receipt of payment under the above schemes may also be entitled to a fuel allowance and assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (which would include help with rent/mortgage and back to school clothing and footwear allowance).  Both lone parent and two-parent families may also qualify for family income supplement payable where the average weekly family income is below the fixed amount for the size of the family.  Lone parent's allowance recipients &mdash; along with all persons in receipt of means-tested social assistance payments &mdash; also receive butter vouchers (two each month plus an additional two in respect of each qualified child).</P>
    <P>From January 1997, the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's payments will be amalgamated into the new one-parent family payment.  This new payment will bring about full equality between men and women and will remove the concept of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; from the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The new payment is designed, under the latest proposals, to make employment a more feasible option for lone parents, a process my Department have been pursuing for some years.  A parent will be able to have earnings of up to £6,000 a year and still qualify for the full payment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> I am committed to ensuring the parents of one parent families who are at serious risk of poverty can improve their employment prospects and I am confident that the new payment will be successful in this regard.  There will be no loss to existing recipients of lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.</P>

      <P>Contributions from liable relatives towards the cost of social welfare payments amounted to £342,000 approximately in 1995.  This sum represents payments in respect of deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance and lone parent's allowance.  There were 251 liable relatives contributing at the end of 1995:</P>
      <P>The contributions are largely weekly or monthly but in some cases they are made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It is estimated that 39 per cent of liable relatives who paid contributed towards lone parent's allowance.  The operation of the scheme is being reviewed in the context of the new one parent family benefit.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the Casual Trading Act, 1995, is to achieve greater decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation of casual trading by the local authorities than was possible under the less flexible regime provided by the Casual Trading Act, 1980.

      <P>As the Casual Trading Act, 1995, came into force on 1 May last and as local authorities are presently preparing bylaws for adoption under section 6 of the Act, I do not intend to exercise my powers under section 2 (3) of the Act at this stage.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 104 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation to implement the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982, more commonly known as the Food Labelling Regulations, came into force in 1982. Enforcement of its provisions did not, however, begin until 1988, when the Director of Consumer Affairs was given statutory responsibility in this area. Since then the number of prosecutions has been as follows: 1988, two; 1989, one; 1990, four; 1991, one; 1992, none; 1993, none; 1994, three; 1995, two; and 1996, seven.  Available statistics show that the greatest number of prosecutions on a geographical basis have <Col N="870" /> been in the Dublin, Cork, Leitrim and Sligo areas.</P>
    <P>Regarding costs incurred by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs in prosecuting offences under the regulations, it is not possible to isolate these costs from other costs incurred by the Director's office. However, the single biggest and most identifiable element of the total cost of a prosecution is that which relates to retaining legal representation and, on average, that amounts to £200 per case. The other costs would be those associated with the Director's other legal and administrative expenses and the travel and subsistence expenses of his technical staff, both in relation to the detection of the offence and its prosecution. Depending on the decision of the judge, costs can be awarded to the Director which offset to some extent his incurred costs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has expressed concern regarding the onus of compliance being on the retailer in relation to the regulations. The 1982 regulations make it an offence to sell foodstuffs which do not comply.  This in effect allows the Director to prosecute not only a retailer but also a producer who is selling direct to the public or who is selling on to the retailer.  If the product is sold indirectly through a supplier then the supplier can be prosecuted.  In practice most prosecutions are against retailers because in many instances the manufacturer will be outside the jurisdiction of the State which would make prosecution impossible. Furthermore, many products are repackaged by the retailer which would make prosecution of the manufacturer inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Regarding prosecution policy, when the director is of the view that the regulations are being infringed he first draws the alleged infringement to the attention of the retailer or supplier or manufacturer, as appropriate, and gives them an opportunity to rectify the matter.  It is only where his warning has not been heeded that the Director considers initiating prosecution proceedings, which he regards as a last resort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> As a general point of information, it is worth noting that, in accordance with section 9 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, the Director is independent in the performance of his functions.</P>

      <P>Proposed natural heritage areas &mdash; NHAs &mdash; are essentially a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>My Department has an involvement, through a supplementary measure to the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  Supplementary measure 1 to REPS deals with the conservation of proposed NHAs.  Farmers who have lands in such areas and who join REPS must abide by the conditions for the conservation of the proposed NHA as prescribed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service &mdash; NPWS &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This is a mandatory REPS measure for farmers who have some or all of their lands in a proposed NHA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who have lands in a proposed NHA and who join REPS can avail of an additional payment of approximately £30 per hectare on top of the basic REPS premium of approximately £125 per hectare, subject to a <Col N="872" /> maximum of 40 hectares.  Obviously it is only possible to make such payments to farmers who, on joining REPS, agree to protect the proposed NHA as laid down by the NPWS.  Where farmers with proposed NHAs on their lands do not agree to abide by the conditions laid down by the NPWS for the protection of the proposed NHA, it is not possible for them to obtain payments under REPS.</P>

      <P>Irish beef processors lodged bids for a total of 500 tonnes of beef under the intervention tender of 11 June.  However, these bids were not accepted by the EU Commission at the Beef Management Committee Meeting of 14 June, as they were outside the parameters set down in Article 14 of EU Regulation 2456/93. Only bids which are below the average market price, recorded in the previous week plus a processors margin of 10 ECU, can be considered for acceptance. As the bids received from Irish traders were above this price they were ruled ineligible.</P>
