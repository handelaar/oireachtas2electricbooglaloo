      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business I feel sure Members would very much wish to join me in extending a most warm welcome to Mr. John Prescott, Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party.  We express the ardent hope that his visit to Ireland will be happy and successful.  I extend to you, Sir, on behalf of all the Members of this House, a most hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1 &mdash; report of Committee of Selection: No. 12 &mdash; Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, Report and Final Stages; and No. 13 &mdash; statements on the beef industry. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 1 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 12, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.30 a.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted <Col N="630" /> by the Minister for Health; the proceedings on No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>There are three questions to put to the House.  Is it agreed that No. 1, report of Committee of Selection, be decided without debate?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 12, Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, Report and Final Stages, satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 13, statements on the beef industry, satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Taoiseach will have a meeting with President Santer in the next number of weeks.  If so, will he tell the House if a date has been fixed for that meeting and if he has any plans to try to de-escalate the serious crisis now emerging between the United Kingdom and our European partners?  As the incoming Presidency I am sure the Taoiseach wants to de-escalate that row.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is not strictly relevant but the Taoiseach may wish to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have plans for a meeting with President Santer in early June.  Obviously we are looking forward to the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which may make a contribution in the near future to resolving the problem.  It is, of course, a continuing concern that any member state <Col N="631" /> should be in the position to block business indiscriminately.  That is not conducive to pursuing the best interests of all concerned.  It is important to note that the European Union provides many benefits to all member states.  For example, it is providing financial assistance to Britain to deal with the consequences of BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  It is important that we debate the BSE issue today, but we hope that the argument between the European Union and the UK does not move into other areas that will affect the Irish Presidency.  I wish the Taoiseach well in trying to de-escalate that argument.</P>
      <P>The Lassen group has proposed a reduction of 40 per cent in the total allowable catch across the Union.  This would decimate the Irish fishing industry. Does the Taoiseach propose to take action to put forward the Irish case? The 40 per cent reduction in quota would cause more damage here than in any other country.  How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the matters that can be raised at this time.  I would prefer if that matter were dealt with in a more appropriate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>President Santer will have a number of meetings in Dublin tomorrow and I will meet him again in early June.  Obviously we will also meet him at the commencement of the Presidency. Those matters can be dealt with during those meetings, but this is not the place or time to deal with the detail of EU policy.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask about two items of promised legislation.  While I am aware the Taoiseach replied yesterday on the Children Bill, will he be more specific as to when it will be introduced? Also, will he state when the much awaited greyhound industry legislation will be published?</P>

      <P>There is no legislation in the current programme of the Dáil to deal with that matter but in view of the Deputy's comments and public concern in relation to it I will have inquiries made to ascertain if legislative changes would assist.  Obviously existing legislation places obligations on people to avoid cruelty to animals.

The Taoiseach does not seem to understand the difference between these two roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, is to make provision for making available, without charge, certain services to persons who have contracted hepatitis C. Eligible persons are those who have contracted the hepatitis C virus directly or indirectly from the use of human anti-D product on receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion. The Bill is a concrete expression of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality health care service to such individuals and is the product of consultations with representatives of the various support groups, Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Haemophilia Society.  As soon as the Bill has passed all Stages in both Houses I hope to finalise negotiations with professional groupings representing doctors and pharmacists to put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for the delivery of the health services set out in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank Members on both sides of the House for their support in the passage of the Bill. I also thank the chairman of the committee, Deputy Pattison, who was helpful in carrying the Bill through Committee Stage.  I thank in particular the many Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I renew my thanks to the Minister for responding with this legislation to a very difficult <Col N="640" /> and sensitive issue.  I was extremely concerned at the Minister's reply to a written parliamentary question from me this week in which he indicated that only 490 persons applied to the tribunal for compensation, yet the Department spent almost £1,000 per application in advertising &mdash; the total figure amounts to £412,000.  That is a phenomenal amount of money for any Department to spend in trying to pressurise victims of hepatitis C into a tribunal which they consider &mdash; I am aware the Minister disagrees with this &mdash; to be flawed and incomplete.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister, before the passage of this Bill, to accede to the requests by Deputies in all Government parties and both Opposition parties &mdash; a unanimous decision was made in this regard by all parties represented on the Select Committee on Social Affairs &mdash; to seriously consider the extension of the deadline from next month on the basis that there are outstanding concerns that must be met by the Minister.  I am aware that he is sympathetic and has been from the beginning, but that sympathy needs to be shown in a very concrete way.  To defer the deadline date until after a court decision would be very welcome and would show the Minister's bona fides in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister said he will enter negotiations.  I presume negotiations have already taken place with general practitioners, other health care professionals and health boards on how the regulations under the Bill will be implemented.  It is important that there is uniform application of the regulations. Sometimes a measure may work very well in one health board or a number of health boards while there may be the odd blip in the service in a specific health board area or small part of a health board area, particularly in rural areas.  There are many victims of hepatitis C in rural areas, male and female, young and middle-aged, and it is very important that the level of service extended to their urban counterparts is available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will the regulations which <Col N="641" /> accompany this legislation be prepared and published?  I think it was in reply to Second Stage a commitment was given that the Minister could discuss the contents of the regulations with the representative groups of hepatitis C victims. It is important that is done and I am anxious to know whether the Minister still intends to discuss and, I hope, agree the contents of the regulations. What additional level of funding does the Minister propose to make available to the various health boards to implement this legislation?</P>
    <P>The health boards which contacted me said there is no way they can provide the extra medical services required under the legislation from within their existing budgets and that to provide them they will have to cut back severly on services in other areas.  We are all aware of the difficulties experienced by health boards and I would not like to see them exacerbated by this very worthy legislation.  The services which will come under most pressure are home nursing-help services and dental, aural and ophthalmic services.  Will the Minister say how he, in co-operation with the health boards, intends to resolve any difficulties which arise in this area?</P>
    <P>There was a reference, during earlier Stages, to counselling services.  The Select Committee on Social Affairs discussed this issue with the Department's adviser.  It is important that the independent counselling providers and support groups are consulted by the Minister's officials on the best way of providing this essential service for the victims of hepatitis C.  It is very important to remember that the spouses and families of the victims have also been very much affected.  Many victims have not told their wider family, friends or employers that they have hepatitis C.  The continuation of independent counselling services for the victims and co-operation between departmental officials and the groups which provide these services is essential.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I wish to <Col N="642" /> remind her that we are on Fifth Stage.  I have shown her much latitude but there is a long standing precedent in the House that the Fifth Stage debate is confined solely to the Bill and not to what should be in it, which, of course, is the subject matter of the Second and Third Stage debates.  I have given the Deputy much latitude but I do not want to allow a situation to arise where Deputies make what are tantamount to Second Reading speeches.</P>

      <P>My comments are on section 2 which provides for health services without charge to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  I am simply pointing out that those services should concentrate also on counselling services which go hand in glove with the health services.</P>
      <P>It was proposed to establish a consultative council which would deal with hepatitis C and an order was to be made to establish it.  This was part of the health agreement between the Department and the representative groups. Will the Minister say when this council will be established?</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for talking on board some Committee Stage amendments tabled by Fianna Fáil.  The implementation of the provisions of the Bill is vitally important and I hope the necessary financial resources will be made available for them to be implemented in a uniform way.</P>

      <P>Given the way in which these people were infected with hepatitis C we must, at a minimum, guarantee the best possible health services for them.  Much consultation was required before it was agreed to put these health services on a statutory framework.  I agree with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that the psychological injury inflicted on these women is as great as their physical injuries.  The relationship between the support groups and the Minister on the question of the tribunal is fractured and I hope it can be improved by the extension of the date <Col N="643" /> before which the victims can apply to have their case heard by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The women infected by hepatitis C had to fight very hard to get a package which suited their unique needs.  I hope the Minister will ensure the highest level of service possible for these women who have been so damaged through no fault of their own. They have unique needs and I hope the Bill will go a long way towards ensuring the very high level of service they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and O'Donnell for their help and co-operation in dealing with the Bill.  We all appreciate that this issue has been fraught with difficulties.  This is understandable as the persons who contracted hepatitis C, their families and immediate social circle are concerned about these events.  I will continue to take all measures necessary to resolve any outstanding difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the question of the consultative council, I consulted the interested groups and circulated a draft establishment order to them.  I am currently considering a number of amendments to the order to take account of the views expressed.  On the question of regulations, it was proposed in the original draft to extend the Bill by way of regulation to cover groups other than the women who had contracted hepatitis from an anti-D product.  On further consideration, including examination of the amendments tabled by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, it was decided to make the extension part of the primary legislation; in other words, to include people who had contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions.  It may be necessary at a later date to extend the Bill to cover unspecified persons who have not been fully identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The counselling services will continue. On Committee Stage I indicated that each health board would be asked to designate an officer who would act as co-ordinator, ensure that the whole <Col N="644" /> range of services would be made available without delay and that any difficulties which might arise would be brought to our attention very quickly. We will pay whatever costs are necessary. In terms of the health services as a whole, we are talking about a small cohort of between 1,400-1,600 people and there are no huge additional costs involved in terms of the overall budget. Even though this will give them extended services, some people will already be covered by a general medical card and the GP service will be available to them.  The cost of this initiative is not huge but if it necessitates additional funds, and it will, they will be provided.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is working very well at present, hearing about 12 cases per week, and its procedures are in line with those requested by the interest groups. They requested changes in its terms of reference to ensure that certain procedures would be followed as a matter of course by the tribunal.  In my view, confidence is building in the tribunal. To date 62 awards have been made and none has been turned down.  That is a fair indication of the confidence, not only of applicants but of the legal profession supporting them, in the fairness and adequacy of the compensation awards being made.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a huge range of compensation awards because cases differ enormously.  To date, the smallest award was approximately £15,500 and the largest approximately £324,000. When we last ran the averages, the figure was £106,000.  For example, yesterday 511 applications were submitted. From our contact with the secretary of the tribunal we know that solicitors have indicated to him they will be submitting a large number of applications in coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The matter of advertising is a difficult one because we have an absolute obligation to draw the attention of all potential applicants to the fact that the tribunal is available to them.  If we did not do so, we would be leaving ourselves open to legal confrontation.</P>
    <P>On initial calculations, aggregating <Col N="645" /> persons who received antibodies or full-blown hepatitis from the anti-D product, in respect of whom we have a defined number arising from the national screening programme in the course of which 58,000 persons approximately were screened, persons represented by the Irish Haemophilia Society, in respect of whom we have an absolute number, persons represented by the Irish Kidney Association in respect of whom we have virtually ascertained an absolute number, and those persons for whom we do not have an absolute number who contracted hepatitis resulting from a blood transfusion and for whom we have look-back programmes and a national screening programme, which is the variable within the overall numbers, we are still below the estimated cohort.  Based on a certain premise I suggested that the whole cohort may be approximately 1,600.  The figure may be somewhat lower but, if we add letters received from solicitors, which would indicate proceedings being opened in the courts, letters to me, to the BTSB and so on and, without trying to cross-match those applications with those submitted to the tribunal, we are still significantly short of the total cohort.</P>
    <P>There is a need to continue our advertising.  The House would be amazed at the numbers of people who telephone my Department saying they never knew anything about this tribunal, even though it has been a matter of controversy for almost 12 months.  I stand over the amount of money being expended on advertising because it is very important, in so far as we can, to get the information to the last person, and certainly to the last solicitor.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any reason to extend the term of office of the tribunal and I will give some reasons for so saying. The tribunal, having received 511 applications this morning &mdash; if they did not receive any more &mdash; have 12 months' work on hands, sufficient to take them well beyond Easter next, probably until this time next year, on the basis of dealing with 12 applications <Col N="646" /> per working week.  The case made for the extension of the tribunal is that a court case has been set down for 8 October next and that applicants should have available to them all the facts of the outcome of that court case before taking a decision.  Anybody who applies between now and the end of the month, within the normal scheduling, must expect that it will be well after the result of the court case has come to hand before they can possibly get a hearing before the tribunal anyway.  In terms of practicalities the issue does not arise.</P>
    <P>We are making it very clear &mdash; we put a little flier into the solicitors' gazette &mdash; that we are not seeking complete and final applications by 17 June.  All we are seeking are completed application forms; the supporting evidence can be submitted subsequent to that date.  We are not driving people up against a deadline they will find it difficult to meet.  It is a question of completing the application form to the best of their ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We wanted to signal, coming up to the end, that a completed application form is sufficient. Two things are necessary to the administration of the tribunal.  As far as possible, we would like an indication of the total cohort to ascertain whether its term of office will last a year, 18 months, two years or three years.  If it is to last for too long a period, we shall have to examine how we can obtain extra resources because we do not want applicants waiting too long.  On the basis of a continuing tot and striking averages I need to be able to indicate to the Department of Finance the amount of <Col N="647" /> money which might be necessary for this purpose.  I will give the House an example of the manner in which we have proceeded to date.  When I first discussed this with the Minister for Finance I said we might need £100 million in 1996.  Subsequently we settled for a figure of £60 million which, as Members will recall, was the subject of some controversy before Christmas last.  It now appears as if approximately half that amount will be expended in 1996 on the basis of the average compensation award and the caseload being dealt with each week.  Because the tribunal is not a statutory one, it has a lot of discretion to allow applicants to have their applications considered even after the final date, which will be clear to anybody who examines its terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final matter is a problem I have experienced with Positive Action for some time.  When issues are raised, we discuss them and agreements are reached, they are kept on my side but the ground changes on the other side. We had a discussion with Positive Action about the expiry date for applications to the tribunal.  As Members will recall, its original terms of reference stipulated that applications should be submitted within three months of its establishment or within three months of the diagnosis of hepatitis C.  Following full discussions with Positive Action we extended that period to six months and it was agreed that that was an adequate period.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot see how the 17 June date will adversely affect anybody.  There are many benefits, in the administration, establishment and financing of the tribunal, in adhering to that date.  I suggest there are quite a number of benefits for applicants themselves, not least of which is the guarantee that solicitors will meet the deadline.  We know we have a great legal profession but we also know that, at times, they can be slow enough if there is a fixed date for the submission of applications, that should help many <Col N="648" /> applicants to ensure that their applications have been received by that date. Otherwise, we may well have a long-term drift.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to consider anything said here because the general advice I have been receiving from my Opposition colleagues has been very helpful. However, I do not see any reason for moving from our present position.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other matter has been raised but, if it has, I will deal with it privately.  The position we are in today is that, once we establish the consultative council &mdash; and we are on the way to doing so &mdash; the overall health package agreed with all the representative groups and ourselves in the Department will have been finalised and delivered. In respect of the health issues on the one hand and compensation issues on the other, we have now delivered on the health commitments to the satisfaction of all the representative groups.</P>
    <P>Two questions are raised constantly about compensation &mdash; what is the appropriate manner in which to pursue a claim and what is the appropriate compensatory amount in individual cases?  Progress has been made by the representatives of the litigant who is proceeding to the High Court, that case having been set down for 8 October next.  The tribunal is now settling down and the procedures it is following have inspired the confidence of applicants and the legal profession to the extent that nobody has turned down an award. I understand that a significant number of provisional awards have been made and that in no case has the tribunal refused any applicant who has applied for a provisional award rather than a full or final settlement.  I do not want to exaggerate the position, but there is a limited number of outstanding issues and we will continue to try to reach agreement on them.</P>
    <P>Progress towards reforming the Blood Transfusion Service Board is continuing. Significant progress has been made and donor confidence is still quite high.  Procedures have changed significantly and management structures are <Col N="649" /> being changed.  Mr. Liam Dunbar, who acted in a temporary capacity on secondment from St. James's Hospital, will be the permanent appointed chief executive officer of the board.  Professor Sean McCann, who has been appointed professor of haematology at Trinity College and retains his consultancies at St. Jame's Hospital, will leave.  That creates a vacancy for the post of chief medical consultant of the board and it will be filled as quickly as possible by an appropriately qualified person.  On looking back one sees the progress that has been made, but frequently when embroiled in the issues it may appear that progress is not being made as quickly as it might be.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their help on this Bill.  It will greatly assist those who have hepatitis C and give them confidence that they will have lifelong free health care with ancillary services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to open the debate on the current problems in the beef industry because it gives me an opportunity to inform the House about developments in the beef sector since 20 March when the current BSE scare commenced arising from statements in the House of Commons on that date.  I hope this debate will clearly demonstrate that the Government has taken decisive and clear-cut actions during that period at national and European level to compensate producers for income losses, to address the fall in cattle prices and to deal with the question of the substantial fall in beef consumption.  The resolution of the BSE <Col N="650" /> crisis is at the top of my agenda and that of my colleagues in Europe.  Special emergency meetings of the Council of Ministers and the Standing Veterinary Committee have taken place and the reverberations of this crisis have been felt across the world.</P>
      <P>Clearly and, perhaps, inevitably third countries responded to the House of Commons announcement by imposing a ban on all beef from Europe while others, intending to impose a ban on beef from the UK, failed initially to distinguish between Ireland and the UK and imposed a ban on Irish beef as well. The announcement also had a dramatic effect on consumption of beef in Europe.  In member states beef consumption fell by between 20 per cent and 50 per cent.  The difficult situation for Irish exporters was exacerbated by the development of strongly chauvinistic attitudes to beef in many continental member states with various types of labelling systems being introduced in many member states to identify home produced beef from imported product. This development resulted in a natural desire by consumers in these exceptional circumstances for guarantees as to the origin of beef and, in particular, assurances that it did not originate in the UK, as well as natural concern to protect the national beef market in a difficult situation.  The overall effect of these developments was to heavily hit beef imports into Europe among member states.</P>
      <P>On the position of BSE in Ireland, to date there has been a total of 127 confirmed cases, the first case was reported in 1989.  Based on an annual statistic of between 14 and 20 animals out of a population of seven million animals, we have an annual incidence of 0.0002 per cent.  Twelve of those 127 animals were imported.  Investigations into many of these cases show that the animals consumed imported feed or that they were old animals.  All cases have occurred in animals over four years and there has not been any case of a steer animal with BSE in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the control <Col N="651" /> measures now in place in Ireland for BSE are second to none and provide consumers and our overseas customers with all possible guarantees as to the safety of Irish beef.  The disease is notifiable in Ireland and a widespread campaign has been undertaken to ensure that veterinary surgeons are aware of the symptoms of the disease.  Of particular significance is our surveillance system, which includes ante-mortem and post-mortem examinations in factories and on farms whereby all animals are thoroughly examined prior to slaughter. Furthermore, when a case of BSE is confirmed, the entire herd from which the inffected animal originated is depopulated at full market value and the carcases rendered into meat and bone meal so that there is no possibility that the human or animal food chain can be affected.  The carcase of the infected animal is also destroyed.  Tracing is also carried out of the progeny of the infected animal and these are also slaughtered.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these comprehensive measures now in place can enable consumers, at home and abroad, to have full confidence in the quality of Irish beef.  These controls go way beyond what is recommended by the EU, international and other scientific organisations.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that the expert advisory group established by the Government following the rise in consumer concern due to the announcement of the British Health Secretary in the House of Commons last March came to the same conclusion.  The group, chaired by the Director of Consumer Affairs, was composed of experts from the medical and veterinary professions as well as representatives from various Government Departments, the grocery trade and consumer interests. The guidelines for consumers adopted by the group left no one in doubt as to the safety of Irish beef and beef products. The OAE guidelines for BSE have been amended within the past week and <Col N="652" /> our control system more than complies with these guidelines.</P>
    <P>The reaction at EU level to the developments in the UK was the adoption of a Commission decision on 27 March 1996 which prohibited the export of all live bovine animals, semen, embryos and products containing bovine material from the UK to any other destination, with the exception of those containing bovine material which originated from animals slaughtered outside the UK. Since the adoption of that decision, the House will be aware that a large-scale operation has been in place along the Border with the co-operation of the Garda and Customs to ensure that the UK export prohibition is effective.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána and Customs authorities for the effective way in which they have carried out their additional duties.  The operation is implemented primarily by the Garda Síochána, backed up by the Customs Service and the Department.  It consists of a continuous 24-hour police presence at each Border crossing, supported by mobile patrols, land and foot patrols and helicopter patrols of all Border areas.  The BSE operation is effective and it has been reviewed at first hand by the veterinary inspectorates of a number of countries which import Irish beef.  The current weekly cost is approximately £350,000, and it is a measure of the continuing commitment of the Government to safeguarding the Irish beef industry.  The operation is backed up by controls on meat plants which permit only the slaughter of animals with authentic identification and ear tag numbers.  I have no doubt that, if these control measures were not in place, serious questions would exist as to the continued access for Irish beef to many of our export markets.  In this context, I hope shortly to announce further controls in relation to the origin of cattle being presented at factories.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the authorities in the United Kingdom have been pressing strongly for a relaxation of the EU export ban which was introduced on 27 March.  The case has been <Col N="653" /> made, in particular, for a relaxation of the ban in the case of gelatine, tallow, semen and other beef derivatives which have undergone certain manufacturing processes.  Various EU scientific committees have supported the relaxation of the ban.  Ireland has supported the Commission proposal to relax the ban as far as these products are concerned during the discussions at the Standing Veterinary Committee in Brussels.  I will also do so next week at the Council meeting in Luxembourg.  However, there was a blocking minority at the Standing Veterinary Committee and the matter has now been referred to the Council for decision.</P>
    <P>The question of the ban on cattle and beef from the United Kingdom is much more difficult.  It is clear that many member states would have fundamental objections to the early lifting of the ban. I hope that during the Irish Presidency we can set out a framework for a progressive and incremental rolling back of the ban.  However, nobody should be under any illusion about the lengthy timeframe that will be required for a complete lifting of the ban.</P>
    <P>My objectives throughout this crisis have been to ensure that all markets remained open to Irish beef, that consumers in Ireland and in our main markets were reassured about the quality and safety of Irish beef, that adequate support measures were introduced to remove the beef surplus from the market and, finally, to secure compensation from the European Union for income losses incurred by producers arising from the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>The full services of my Department, the diplomatic service and An Bord Bia have been mobilised to reassure the authorities in our export markets of the safety and quality of Irish beef and beef products.  High level delegations have visited Egypt and Iran and a senior veterinary official visited a number of Gulf states to discuss at first-hand the specific issues raised by these countries.  The approach adopted was to underline the differences between the incidence of BSE in Ireland and the United <Col N="654" /> Kingdom and to highlight the comprehensive controls which have been put in place here.  Strong emphasis was also placed on the image of Ireland as a source of clean, green superior quality food based on our extensive grassland production of meat.  This concerted approach served to underline Ireland's high standards of public and animal health and to provide the maximum possible guarantees to customers.</P>
    <P>While the issues arising from the recent BSE developments are mainly technical, political interventions have also been made where necessary.  The personal intervention of the Taoiseach was critical to reopening the Lebanese market.</P>
    <P>I have just returned from an extremely successful visit to Russia where I have been promoting the quality and safety of Irish beef and beef products.  It has been my strategy over recent weeks to identify the Russian market as by far the most important in two respects.  There is potential over the next 12 months to sell 110,000 tonnes of beef &mdash; three times the next nearest market which would probably be the UK, followed by other markets such as Egypt, Italy, other European countries and Saudi Arabia.  Russia could take a quarter of Irish beef produced over the next 12 months, and that would be pivotal to providing a floor price for beef. Most important, they are taking the cheaper forequarter flank cuts for which there is not a ready market other than intervention.  That very much complements what is happening on other third country markets.  Particularly for the period September to April next, I will look to the Russian market as the key pivotal market.</P>
    <P>I propose to visit Libya as soon as arrangements have been put in place, if the arrangements with the Gadaffi administration were suitable, I would leave this evening for Tripoli.  There has been some ill-informed comment about the Libyan situation.  It was the Libyan authorities who, two days beforehand, decided to cancel the invitation to me to meet two Ministers on 15 May and for <Col N="655" /> which I had been making arrangements since the week before Easter.  It is clear they have not been in a position to lift the ban.  The tender for live animals that was anticipated to be for 150,000 animals was reduced to 60,000 animals, and in the past few days this has been cancelled. There has been a level of dissatisfaction with the Australians filling this. I am monitoring it very carefully because I see a window of opportunity. I am redoubling my efforts to get to Libya to try to ensure that the governmental concerns, which are entirely about the safety of beef, can be assuaged notwithstanding the drop in consumption, and there is a greater likelihood of progress.</P>
    <P>Iran is the only other market in which there is a major blockage and I have been in continuous contact with the Iranian authorities.  They are fully aware of my willingness to travel to Tehran for direct discussions on any suitable occasion.  After my recent discussions with Minister Foorozesh, the Minister for the Construction Crusade, I was advised that an exchange of letters answering questions would resolve the issue.  That has not proved possible. There was dialogue between our respective veterinary authorities in Paris at the OAE meeting last week and a veterinary delegation is to visit Ireland.  If I go to Tehran now I will be told to await the outcome of the technical visit.  It is appropriate, therefore, to time that visit sensibly.</P>
    <P>Problems are at their most difficult within Europe in terms of the very sharp cutting back on beef consumption. While there was an acute drop in consumption initially, and then some recovery, this has plateaued at an unacceptably low level.  My Department, An Bord Bia and I continue to work assiduously to restore consumer confidence in Irish beef.  Briefing documents outlining Irish beef and animal health controls and consumer information leaflets have been distributed widely.  In addition, consumer advertising and promotion campaigns have taken place in targeted <Col N="656" /> countries.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and I campaigned in Sweden, Italy, Spain and the UK.  The timing of such campaigns is crucial and further campaigns will be undertaken when market circumstances are favourable.</P>
    <P>A budget is being prepared in the context of Europe and nationally.  It is clear, however, that in spite of these efforts the scale of the decline in consumption, combined with the measures taken by several third countries in banning or cutting down on imports of beef from the European Union, has created major problems for beef producers.  I recognised at an early stage that this crisis was likely to have long-term major ramifications for the beef sector and, with my ministerial colleagues in other member states.  I persuaded the Commission to introduce emergency intervention measures early in April to cope with the crisis.</P>
    <P>The initial emergency arrangements providing for the weight limit on carcases which may be sold into intervention to be increased to 50,000 tonnes were unable to cope with the scale of the problems on the market.  When this became evident I, with my German and French colleagues, impressed on Commissioner Fischler the need to extend the scope of these arrangements.  The Commission responded to my request by waiving the carcase weight limit and relaxing the grading limits.  A court case governs the issue of carcase weight limits &mdash; a case we lost in the European Court.  Selection will take place tomorrow on the 25,000 tonne tender by the Beef Management Committee.  At tomorrow's meeting and next week I will be pressing for a further intervention intake for the month of June of 60,000 tonnes.  I will be seeking adequate flexibility in relation to forequarter beef and the carcase weight limits. I understand the Commission will again propose a further reduction in the carcase weight limits.  This will be wholly unacceptable to Ireland.  This is short-sighted of the Commission because it will mean intervention will not be successful as a way of dealing <Col N="657" /> with the short-term market crisis. However, the increase in refunds of 12 per cent has proved beneficial to Ireland.  Not only have we had the tender in May of 50,000 tonnes increasing to a ceiling of 65,000 tonnes, we have had a level of prefixations which shows there is a level of confidence among the exporters of Irish beef that they can find some markets.</P>
    <P>Steer slaughterings during the past four weeks have been significantly higher than in the corresponding four week period in 1995 and steer slaughterings this year have now exceeded 1995 levels.  I acknowledge that live exports are lower this year than in 1995 and this has to be included in any assessment of the extent of the backlog which still remains on our farms.  Slaughterings of cows and heifers have been considerably lower this year and this also has to be included in the equation.  I am satisfied, however, that the emergency measures have worked reasonably well and prevented a complete collapse in the market not only in Ireland but across Europe.</P>
    <P>Intervention cannot provide a complete solution to the market problems arising from the BSE crisis.  There is a GATT ceiling on beef exports outside the Union which is reducing by 60,000 tonnes per annum, and clearly huge volumes of intervention beef overhang the market and will probably have to be included in the quota to be sold outside the Union.  Intervention must be seen as nothing other than a short-term stop gap measure.  This is well recognised by all interests in the industry.  Clearly, it is essential that beef is sold on whatever commercial markets are available.  The Irish beef industry has responded extremely positively to the increase in export refunds by taking out licences for some 26,000 tonnes of beef and 5,000 head of live cattle in the days immediately following the increase in refunds. I am paying close attention to the question of the appropriate level of refunds and will monitor it to see if a further increase is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have always been conscious given <Col N="658" /> the nature and extent of the crisis that intervention or exports to third countries would be insufficient to support cattle prices at reasonable levels.  Since the beginning of this crisis, cattle prices have fallen by approximately 7 per cent on top of a 7 per cent fall earlier in the year because of the cuts in export refunds last autumn.  I fully acknowledge that this has created considerable financial difficulties for many producers, especially those who had bought store cattle at relatively high prices in the autumn of 1995.  For this reason, I insisted both at the emergency BSE Council during the first week of April and again at the usual meeting of the Agriculture Council at the end of April that provision should be made for compensation to be paid to producers who suffered income losses because of the crisis.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler presented his suggestions for compensation in May, suggesting the compensation package should be 650 million ECUs or £540 million.  I understand the Commission endorsed specific proposals yesterday which take account of the representations I made not to have a national envelope but to allow each national Government flexibility to target aid to where it is appropriate.  Farm organisations and others have clearly identified the winter finishers as a key sector.  In the context of the DSP, I will seek to apply of the order of £8 million to winter finishers because those who would have slaughtered at the higher rate of DSP have been worst affected by the 7 per cent drop in prices.</P>
    <P>I have to have regard to the technical assessment of those worst affected and it is my intention to avail of the opportunity to administer targeted aid to winter finishers.  That is not to say I regard the package of £540 million as acceptable. I will signal at the meetings next Monday and Tuesday that the compensation package is inadequate.  While I acknowledge it is a significant starting point payable immediately based on 1995 premium applications and that the broad thrust of the package is correct, I will have to state categorically that my <Col N="659" /> initial reaction, pending full details of what was actually agreed last night, is that the compensation package is not adequate and needs to be increased.  I will not only put forward this view to the Commission and the Council but I will have bilateral meetings with my French and German colleagues on Monday morning to ensure that the overall package is adequate and the support is directed towards those who have suffered most.  The combination of flexibility and additional resources will be the key points of my response.</P>
    <P>The compensation package is designed to compensate for losses suffered by producers to date and for the losses which producers are likely to suffer for the remainder of the year and it has to be balanced between these two categories.  What is important is that each category of producer receives an equitable share of the compensation provided from Europe.  That the compensation package is designed to cover future losses, as well as those already incurred, reflects the Commission's view that the effects of this crisis will remain with us for some foreseeable time and certainly into next year.  Unfortunately, I share that view.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that it will take a long time for the beef market to recover from the crisis.  Consumer confidence in beef has taken such a battering that it will take some considerable time for confidence to be restored, if it is possible to restore it to the levels prior to 20 March 1996.  In view of this, I have called on the Commission to implement a fully funded EU beef promotion campaign and to introduce national flexibilities and de-restrictions of some of the rules governing EU spend on national promotional campaigns.  In spite of our best efforts and those of member states, beef consumption in Europe is unlikely to return to previous levels.  The real question is to what extent beef consumption will recover, and if it will recover sufficiently to <Col N="660" /> restore the beef market to balance, taking account of the effect of measures adopted by the UK.</P>
    <P>The UK decision to destroy meat from all cattle over 30 months and to remove a further 80,000 cattle from the food chain will reduce beef production in the United Kingdom by up to 300,000 tonnes per annum.  In addition, the United Kingdom has decided to implement the calf slaughtering premium in order to dispose of 450,000 calves which would have been exported from the United Kingdom to continental Europe were it not for the introduction of the ban.  The reduction in UK output will only accommodate a 4 per cent drop in beef consumption across the European Union.  If we work on the statistic that beef consumption in Europe was 7.5 million tonnes annually before the BSE crisis and 1 per cent represents 75,000 tonnes it is clear that a drop of the order of 15 per cent plus in consumption would result in significant overproduction.  Prior to this, Europe was 104 per cent self-sufficient in beef and that combined with the GATT limitations that we cannot export beef with extensive subsidies into Third World countries shows that more radical reform of the EU beef regime will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I will give very serious consideration to the demand for reform by member states during the Irish Presidency.  We will consider giving priority to extensive grass based systems of production and cutting other more intensive forms of production might be worthy of aid.  This seems to be the clear way forward.  On consumption, it is quite clear that price will be a pivotal factor and we must make it more competitive having regard to the price of white meat.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that on 2 May I sought Dáil approval for a new service to provide emergency temporary financial assistance directly to the Irish rendering industry to prevent a shut down at that time.  I stressed at all stages the temporary nature of the assistance.  A breathing space was given to the various interests involved to enable them to get <Col N="661" /> together to discuss and agree commercial arrangements.  Three meetings took place and by the third meeting it struck me that my role was seen as undermining my position on subsidies with everyone agreeing on one thing, the taxpayer would be wheeled out to pay for another subsidy.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the scheme has worked well.  Claims have been made and payments are being issued.  I am pleased that the interests involved have now seen sense and that agreement has been reached between slaughterers and renderers.  Clearly, failure to reach agreement would have created major problems for producers who, I believe, would not have easily forgiven the renderers for their refusal to negotiate sensibly on this issue.  The matter has now been satisfactorily dealt with in a commercial fashion in terms of the disposal of offal.  If export contracts pick up, as I think they will, financial terms will be alleviated.</P>
    <P>There is a facile view that if the Government showed greater urgency everything would be all right.  This is not the view in any other EU member state or in any of the countries outside the Union which I visited.  This is a worldwide watershed in the beef market. There is no escaping the fact that beef has been a devalued product since 20 March.  Nothing I can say or do can gainsay that.  This is a situation from which we must extract the maximum possible.  The measures we have put forward have dealt, first, with the short-term fact that in the spring there were 200,000 animals stuck in sheds and no market to which they could go.  We have moved on extensively from that situation. We are intensifying our efforts to promote consumption and the reopening of markets.  We have made good progress in that there are only two markets which remain unopened &mdash; Iran and Libya.  We have started down the road to compensation.  I acknowledge that what has been provided to date is unsatisfactory.  It must be remembered that we are asking Brussels to fund the entirety of this compensation.  We are <Col N="662" /> significant net recipients and not contributors to EU funds.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate as an opportunity to discuss constructive proposals. My Department and I do not have a monopoly of wisdom on this issue.  I will meet all the farm organisations on Friday to hear their views as to the approaches which would be appropriate in the next series of meetings.  I hope, pending a BSE price compensation package being agreed, that during the Irish Presidency we will broker a solution which will alleviate the British problem, reorganise the EU beef regime and provide a sustained focus by the entirety of European governments from prime minister level to the General Affairs Committee.  Such a focus is perhaps only possible under our Presidency.</P>
    <P>Horizons is taking on a new marketing significance.  This will involve the largest ever promotion of Irish food and will take place from 11-13 June.  Some 10,000 trade people will come here, including the top 350 worldwide buyers. Representatives of the Mayor of Moscow's office and all the other key people will be here.  This event has taken 14 months to plan and it could not be more timely.</P>
    <P>The House will focus on what I and the Government can do.  There is also an obligation on producers and processors to look at quality assurance programmes and identifying and labelling segments and niches of Irish beef in order to give guarantees about welfare, residue and food safety.  This must be all encompassing.  The problem simply cannot just be left on my desk.  This crisis is facing the entire industry, including producers and processors, the whole economy and the Government.  I believe that through a true spirit of partnership and teamwork we will minimise the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil insisted on this debate for a number of reasons, some of which the Minister outlined. The interest of Members in the debate is unprecedented, certainly on this side of the House.  It allows Members to consider where we are with regard to agriculture and food, which is the most important industry in this country and on which many thousands of livelihoods depend.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis has shown once and for all that we cannot gamble with this industry any longer.  The customer is king and everything we do must reinforce and re-establish the confidence of the consumer that Irish food is of quality and nutritional value and produced to the highest environmental standards consistent with the practices one would expect in a modern and sophisticated industry.</P>
      <P>The response thus far by the Government to this crisis has been appalling and depressing.  Can anybody on the Government side say with any conviction that the Government has mobilised all the resources at its disposal, in the industry itself and in the State support services, to meet the daunting and undoubtedly difficult challenges being posed to the future of our food industry generally and our beef industry in particular as a result of the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March?  It has been puzzling and difficult to comprehend how a Government, even one of this political composition, can display such an ignorance of the critical issues facing the economy as a result of what has happened over the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many now in Government who used and abused the beef industry to enhance their own short-term political careers by making ruthless and politically motivated attacks on the industry which were comprehensively dealt with in the beef tribunal report.  It still beggars belief that the prejudice and venom displayed then continues to <Col N="664" /> dominate the considerations of the Government in dealing with the agriculture industry.  Even the Minister himself succumbed to the temptation in the Dáil on 29 February when he spoke about shedding no tears if prominent individuals were forced out of the industry. Having watched and observed the incompetance and strange disinterest of many members of the Government to the crisis enveloping the industry, it would appear from the perspective of thousands of cattle farmers that refusal to shed tears extends at this stage to the whole agricultural community.</P>
    <P>My only other reference to that deeply damaging episode, which was carefully and politically orchestrated and manipulated by prominent members of the Government, is to quote the beef tribunal report on the critical value of this industry and those who contributed to it to the well-being of the economy.  The report stated that: &ldquo;The importance of this industry in the economic life of this State cannot be overstated and the role of Laurence Goodman and the companies controlled by him in its development has been considerable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the debate in this House after the House of Commons announcement, I spoke of the amazement on this side at the failure of the Government immediately to take political decisions to put in place a co-ordinated political initiative involving producers, processors, State services and Ministers who would visit crucial markets on which our exports depend to assuage the fears of consumers about the quality of Irish beef and to aggressively promote and tell the good story which can be told about the purity and quality of our beef products.</P>
    <P>The decision was not taken and nothing has been done since, apart from visits by the Minister to Italy and Spain. Yesterday, two months after the crisis re-emerged, the Minister finally had the time or the inclination to visit Russia, which was our most important export market for processed beef in 1995.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, <Col N="665" /> visited Sweeden, which is a friendly country but, unfortunately, is not known for its bulk purchasing of Irish beef products.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad yesterday the Minister of State made an extraordinary statement about future ministerial visits.  He stated, &ldquo;The timing of such campaigns is crucial and further campaigns will be undertaken when market circumstances are favourable&rdquo;.  The simple point I have been making all along is that it is precisely because market circumstances are unfavourable that a co-ordinated political initiative is necessary.  The proof that my position is correct is that markets outside the EU, which are in some cases technically open for business, are doing no business.  Those countries have not been told by trade delegations from this country how significant, important and valued their custom is to us.  It is because they do not have full confidence in the quality of our product that this has not been communicated to them in a face to face manner.</P>
    <P>The negligence, neglect, complacency and perplexing apathy of the Government is unprecedented in the face of the scale and magnitude of the problem which confronts the Government, as outlined by the Minister.  It has been paralysed by inaction and ineffectiveness at both domestic and European levels.  Two and a half months after the crisis began, we still do not have agreement at European level on how to solve the British problem, let alone to move on to the discussion and agenda of the immediate problems of BSE free herds in Ireland and other EU countries.  The impact of BSE on future consumer trends is such that the Irish agriculture and food industry is now entering a new era.  Production and processing must be driven by the demands of the marketplace.  As we are aware, there is a move towards lower market prices.  As the biggest exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere, there is a need to find markets for our beef.  This <Col N="666" /> is of critical importance to the future well-being of the economy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that agricultural policy must become radical and confront the new reality.  The industry is crying out for leadership and direction to give it an opportunity to prosper in the new era.  Do we have the structures necessary to generate success in a market dominated era?  Given that market share is vital, particularly in the red meat market which is dwindling, successful marketing depends on the customer having total confidence in the quality and purity of food products.  Do we have the structures and marketing strategies necessary to confront this issue?</P>
    <P>On competitiveness in production and processing, does the industry have the technology and scale to allow it to compete with the best in Europe?  As we are aware, it is primarily concerned with the production of animal products: milk, beef, lamb, pig and poultry meat. Consumer confidence in the quality of animal produce and, in many cases, the methods of production is at an all-time low.  Fianna Fáil calls for quality assurance systems to be put in place at enterprise and meat processing level which are independently verifiable.  It is only in this way that our meat and dairy products will gain a pre-eminent position in the marketplace and, ultimately, guarantee the continued success of the industry.</P>
    <P>A continuous analysis of the impact of policies on the various categories of farmers and sectors of the industry is vital but it is not happening.  Based on this analysis, policies must be regularly updated and resources targeted.  An example of the poor targeting of support policies is that while £390 million was paid out in income supports in the cattle sector last year, the money is not getting to the many farmers heavily dependent on cattle farming for a living. Their income continues to decline.</P>
    <P>Average cattle farm income, bedevilled by low output, is just £4,000 per year.  Based on the replies I received to parliamentary questions recently, <Col N="667" /> over 75,000 farmers receive less than £3,000 per year in direct payments; 37,000 receive less than £1,000 per year or £20 per week and a further 28,000 receive between £1,000 and £2,000 per year.  How must does it cost to administer the payment of such paltry sums to farmers?  There must be a cheaper and better way of targeting resources to those most in need.</P>
    <P>On indirect income support necessary to sustain rural communities, what proposals does the Minister have to ensure, in keeping with the spirit of the MacSharry proposals, that we continue to move from a position where 80 per cent of the funds available in income supports was paid to 20 per cent of farmers under the CAP?</P>
    <P>Will attacks continue to be made in this House by Democratic Left speakers who seem to think that farmers are on a gravy train as far as direct income payments are concerned?  Displays of ignorance of that magnitude are best dispensed with in this debate if we are to find solutions to the crisis facing beef farmers.</P>
    <P>The compensation scheme at EU level has failed abysmally to address the unprecedented losses suffered by cattle farmers.  The way our case is being put is nothing short of a disgrace.  It has not been listened to.  The confidence of the agricultural community is draining fast, not alone in the industry, but also in the Minister.  He continues to use the &ldquo;I am all alone&rdquo; excuse in regard to the lack of support among his colleagues, let alone the governments of other member states.  How can he be expected to restore confidence in the industry when it displays so little confidence in him? Last week his naming in public of certain co-operatives under investigation created instability in the stock market. He soon went back to the bunker on that issue.</P>
    <P>In an extraordinary speech in the Seanad last night &mdash; I ask Fine Gael Deputies to read it &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, said: &ldquo;I would like to stress that the issues raised by the <Col N="668" /> recent BSE developments are mainly technical which are not amenable to instant political solutions.&rdquo;  This must be the greatest political cop-out by a Minister of State in the face of a crisis of such magnitude in the history of the State. The idea has been put forward that political decisions cannot be taken to deal with it.  This shows that the Minister and the Government are, simply, running scared.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given immediately to setting up a food quality authority to ensure that consumer concerns on quality assurance issues are met. Responsibility for food quality must be given to a single agency with significant representation from consumer interests and independent scientific back-up so that the consumer at home and abroad can be informed of the purity and quality of our food.</P>
    <P>This agency should assume responsibility for the approval and control of all drugs and chemicals used in the production of animals and crops and products used in the food processing industry as well as for standards, codes of practice and inspection approval systems for all areas of food production and processing. Emphasis must be placed on quality assurance to ensure the traceability of products and enforcement of quality standards in production with strict enforcement of all regulations in relation to the drugs and chemicals used in food production and processing.</P>
    <P>The agency should seek to implement the animal health, disease eradication, quarantine, import and export control functions exercised by the Department. It should have a controlling authority with representation from consumer interests, health professionals, producers and processors and scientific back-up.  It should have adequate funding arrangements consisting of EU funds and levies, if necessary, to ensure it carries out its functions in an effective manner.  It should take control of the staff and other resources devoted to this work in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Health and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> On traceability, there is a need for a comprehensive animal identification system.  This must be done now.  There is a need also for a national database for cattle similar to that launched in Northern Ireland in 1987.  This would enable the authorities to trace animals easily and should be complemented by a computerised movement permit system compatible with the system in Northern Ireland.  This would allow us to give a guarantee that no cattle from across the Border enter the food chain and, in turn, to redeploy the gardaí assigned to Border duty who should be policing our streets instead of monitoring the movement of cattle lorries at a cost of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>These decisions could be taken by the Government this evening, tomorrow morning or next week or whenever it next meets.  For the Minister to suggest that the problems in the beef industry derive from the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March is to seek to escape his responsibilities and the complacency displayed by the Department and the Government since the export refund system was dismantled, with his assistance, last November. This was the one country which needed that system because cattle prices in non-EU markets are dictated by third country prices and export refunds.  It provided farmers with a guarantee on price.  The Minister's inability to address the issue highlights the real problem, the Government's lack of interest in the industry.</P>
    <P>The idea promulgated that the Government is powerless in the face of the BSE crisis is crass nonsense.  There has been talk of a compensation scheme under which top-up payments of £17 and £20 will be made, but the extra £8 million available will not compensate beef fatteners for the unprecedented losses suffered in the early spring.  The announcement on 20 March only exacerbated the problem.  The one factor to which we can point consistently is the inability of the Government before and after that date to make decisions to the benefit of the industry. <Col N="670" /> I have outlined the areas where decisions can be taken and resources should be provided.</P>

Will the Tánaiste provide extra resources to ensure that the beef industry remains competitive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every debate we have had on agriculture since the Minister's administration came into office, Members have spoken out of the sides of their mouths, undermining the CAP and the national interest.  For a change, Members on the Government benches should support measures to ensure that farmers will not be taken off the land in their thousands and deprived of their livelihoods.  That is what is expected of Government backbenchers in this <Col N="671" /> debate.  I will sit here throughout the debate to see if those backbenchers support the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Even if I criticise the Minister about the level of progress he is making, Government Deputies should support what the Government is doing, though we feel it could do far more.</P>
    <P>We need to review State support services to agriculture.  Teagasc, which was established in 1988, has responsibility for national agricultural training, advisory and research services.  It is the major reservoir of science and technology essential for the development of a competitive agricultural and food sector.</P>
    <P>We call for a re-examination of the Teagasc mandate.  We look to improve the links between the research services in Teagasc and the universities, to establish priorities for the advisory and training services in the light of evolving agricultural policies and to improve significantly its working relationship with its parent Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  We call for an improvement of management structures in Teagasc with a significant increase in delegated responsibility in relation to how it runs its business while at the same time ensuring that it is more accountable for its output and the use of resources.</P>
    <P>The use of Structural Funds to renew Teagasc's scientific capacity has been botched by this administration.  It is unbelievable that £1 million of research money from the operational programme was sent back by Teagasc to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry because the Department could not ensure that personnel were appointed to that body so that research could be carried out, even though those salaries would have been paid for from the £1 million that was sent back.</P>
    <P>What a circular, paper pushing, biro twirling Government we have.  The Government cannot even ensure that the money it allocates itself can be spent properly by the support services to which it is delegated.  If we have that much incompetence in that area, what <Col N="672" /> level of incompetence do we have in relation to the major issues adverted to by the Minister?</P>
    <P>It is incomprehensible that since 20 March we have not had a Government statement recognising the potential consequences of this crisis, or that it is undertaking a root and branch review of all policies on support services, marketing strategies, the beef processing industry, animal identification systems, the need for electronic tagging, the need for a computerised movement permit system, the need for a farm food safety scheme at enterprise and factory level, the need to draw up Protocols and an independent verifiable assessment unit to ensure it happens, and the need to provide spot checks by Department officials to ensure those issues are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Those are medium to long-term issues, but they involve decisions that could have been taken by the Government since 20 January.  The Minister could provide resources for Teagasc as well as enforcing and implementing decisions to guarantee traceability.  The Minister could also sanction more personnel for the support services to provide better grassland management for cattle farmers.</P>
    <P>With world prices coming down in the long-term, it is clear that if the competitiveness issue is to be dealt with we need a hands on approach from people with the technical expertise in Teagasc, and we need more of them.  We do not want them doing administrative work for arable aid and premium schemes which, while necessary, is a secretarial job.  It can be done if there is a political will. More technical advisers should be on the farms before they become a memory. That is what will happen when one looks at the average cattle farmer's income of only £4,000 per year.</P>
    <P>As regards marketing strategies, what extra resources and personnel will be provided to An Bord Bia?  Only two people from An Bord Bia are looking after the UK market, talking to the four main multiple chains there.  They are backed up by 21 staff at home, but is that enough and <Col N="673" /> could we do more?  We need people in EU markets and beyond on a permanent basis to extend trade relations and improve agricultural orders.</P>
    <P>When I went to Iran with a delegation recently I was struck by the perception of people in those markets.  They feel that we go looking for them when we are in trouble, but we are never around when they are looking for something. International relations is a two way street.  These markets are so important to us that we need a permanent presence in them.  We need to mobilise trade delegations to visit such markets immediately.  There is no point in sending a vet today, a diplomat tomorrow and somebody else next week.</P>
    <P>If we were serious about keeping market share for our economy's most important industry, one would have expected the Government to make political decisions to ensure a co-ordinated political initiative to every one of those markets by now.  The Minister's report to the House should have been as a result of such consultations and visits, but all we are getting two and half months later is the fact that the Minister has identified Russia as the most important market for processed beef. The Minister was there yesterday and even brought the mayor of Moscow into his speech.  I am sure he is an excellent gentleman and we will encourage him to buy as much Irish beef as possible.</P>

      <P>Farmers saw what happened when other industries were in difficulty. Can any Fine Gael backbencher explain to rural constituents or PAYE workers in meat factories why it is that if a shoe factory is in trouble in Ballinasloe and needs soles manufactured in Spain, the Tánaiste can go there and sort the problem out?  Why is it that if Hewlett Packard or some other multinational talks about losing hundreds of jobs, the Government seems to be able <Col N="674" /> to do its job by speaking to people to maintain those jobs?</P>
      <P>However, when we come to the agricultural industry &mdash; which has 165,000 people directly engaged in agriculture, 40,000 others employed in the food and drink processing sector, which accounts for 11 per cent of gross domestic product, when agricultural produce represents 16 per cent of total exports and agricultural inputs are valued at £1.3 billion annually &mdash; why is it that, facing a crisis of this magnitude, we see nothing from this Government except one Minister talking about how he is trying to solve the problem?  There is no interest from anybody else.</P>
      <P>The electorate wants an opportunity to pass judgement on that neglect of the country's primary industry.  Originally they were waiting for the opportunity to pass judgement on Democratic Left and Labour.  That contagion has now spread to the Fine Gael back benches.  I encourage Fine Gael Deputies to come into this House and use the opportunity provided by this debate to insist that other members of the Government they support show even a little interest in the fact that thousands of livelihoods are at stake.  We will continue to press this issue and if Fianna Fáil got the time it had sought, we would be here for a week discussing the importance of agriculture. I hope the next time we have a debate we do not have to drag it out of the Taoiseach the way we had to drag this one out of him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disgraceful that for a debate on such a serious matter only one Government Minister is in the House.  It is an indication of the support <Col N="675" /> the Minister is getting from his Cabinet colleagues.  He has been isolated and abandoned in the past number of weeks.</P>
      <P>The crisis in the beef sector has highlighted the importance of consumer confidence in the source and quality of Irish food products.  The need to identify quickly and easily a product and its source has become of primary importance not just in the beef sector but in all food product sectors.  This problem has shown clearly that the crisis of confidence has serious implications for job creation and the entire services sector. This has become as much a consumer problem as a producer problem and should be recognised as such.</P>
      <P>The food industry response to consumer demand and the protection of consumer confidence is now of vital importance.  Consumer demand is becoming ever more sophisticated and critical.  The average consumer now requires the security of knowing the origins and the processing methods of every food item.  Consumers now look for a food quality guarantee.</P>
      <P>The beef industry is a consumer led industry and it now requires an independent certifying food authority with statutory powers to implement a new quality system for the food industry which would require each food processor to reach minimum standards of production and processing.  Such an independent food certifying authority would be independent of the producer and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry but would promote the interests of the producer as well as the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently it has become apparent that the branding of many Irish products abroad has not been as strong as it should be.  The national food certifying authority, as proposed by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, would fulfil a vital role in the branding of Irish food products as high quality products.  This quality system for food products would provide a role for an independent authority which would set certain minimum standards, ensure <Col N="676" /> open disclosure and transparency and aim to restore consumer confidence in the food sector.  Strong consumer demand is critical for the future development of the industry and for the benefit of the consumer, the producer and the State.  This food certifying authority should be established as a matter of priority to guarantee the quality status of Irish food products for consumers at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the beef sector has clearly shown there is a major lack of consumer confidence in the food area, particularly in beef.  This crisis did not begin in the past six weeks; it began with the reduction in the consumption of red meat.  There are serious implications not just for beef farmers but also for the many thousands of jobs in the beef processing sector.  While the Minister must find solutions in the short-term to the immediate problems in the beef industry, he will also have to address the long-term difficulties in this area of agriculture. I ask the Minister to at least seek the support of his Cabinet colleagues in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the beef sector is facing a crisis and while to some people the Minister's actions to date may seem to be fairly vigorous, one must look at the long-term implications of the trends in agriculture and the need for a greater focus on marketing strategy.  Our inadequacies in this area have been highlighted by the current crisis brought about by the BSE scare and the effect it has had and will continue to have in the future on consumer confidence in beef products. The tragedy is that this effect on consumer confidence is not confined to British beef, where this problem may have arisen, but extends to a much wider area affecting European and world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will focus on the question of the marketing challenge confronting the Government, the Minister and our agriculture industry as highlighted by the BSE crisis which has compounded the <Col N="677" /> problem.  The disappearance of intervention in the past number of years has given the impression that we now have a truly market driven beef industry but that is not the case.  The beef industry may be export oriented but it is not market oriented and it is important we avoid deluding ourselves into believing otherwise.</P>
    <P>Intervention has been largely replaced by the subsidised export of live and carcase beef to the Middle East.  It is important in a debate such as this to profile, from the figures available, the state of the beef industry in 1995.  On the domestic market, 10 per cent or 195,000 head of cattle were disposed of here.  Live exports, two-thirds of which go to third countries &mdash; Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia in the main &mdash; take 20 per cent which is approximately 368,000 head of cattle.  Beef export plants absorb 70 per cent which is 1,362,000 head of cattle.  The figures for the beef export markets &mdash; exports from the beef plants &mdash; are as follows: Britain, 100,000 tonnes; France, 75,000 tonnes; Italy, 22,000 tonnes; other European Union countries took 61,000 tonnes and third countries took 173,000 tonnes which is approximately 40 per cent of total beef exports from this country.  In addition, 150,000 tonnes of beef &mdash; old stocks &mdash; were withdrawn from intervention and sold to third country markets, mainly Russia, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia.</P>
    <P>Neither live nor beef exports to third countries would be feasible without the European Union export refunds.  Effectively Irish product is sold off at knockdown prices, sometimes below the world market price, and the exporter is paid a huge subsidy from Brussels to compensate. If we compare the price per tonne achieved in commercial and third country markets in 1995 for frozen boneless beef, we will see the value obtained for these products in those markets.  France paid £281 per tonne; Britain, £1,934; Egypt, £1,123; Saudi Arabia, £939 and Russia, which was mentioned in great detail by the Minister in his contribution, paid £874 per tonne.  These are <Col N="678" /> the prices paid by the customers and they do not take account of the &ldquo;cheque in the post&rdquo; export refund paid directly to the exporter by the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Middle East trade is volatile, low in added value and does not involve a long-term relationship with retail customers.  The third country trade, both live and carcase, represents a convenient mechanism by which the bureaucrats in Brussels can flush Ireland's seasonal surplus out of the European beef market every autumn.  It is clear that the future of this trade is not secure.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy will come up for review at the end of the decade.  With enlargement of the European Union imminent, the costs of maintaining the CAP as it stands may prove prohibitive for the taxpayers of Germany &mdash; the people who have to pick up most of the tab for this operation. The cost of extending the benefits of the present CAP to the five aspirant member states &mdash; the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia &mdash; is estimated at £10 billion per year. This bill might prove too high for the Germans.  If it does, something has to give.</P>
    <P>We will probably see a complete overhaul of the CAP and major movement in the direction of a free market in food.  We will not see entirely free trade but we are likely to see dismantling of some of the more expensive subsidy programmes.  The general world trend towards free trade will also be nudging Europe in this direction.  The Irish beef industry, as currently structured, would be singularly ill-equipped to cope with the challenges posed by a substantial reduction in, or withdrawal of, export refunds.  Last year about 50 per cent of the total beef cattle disposals for export, including both live trade and carcases, went down the subsidised third country route.</P>
    <P>Greater concentration of effort is needed in handling third country beef trading.  At present up to 20 Irish companies are chasing business in this area. Third country business is generally <Col N="679" /> transacted on a once off contract basis. The customers are usually state trading agencies in the Middle East, north Africa and eastern Europe.  The trade is almost entirely price driven and the quality and continuity of relationships count for little.  Processors have to compete for business with meat traders who supply third country contracts with products which they buy from the European Union's intervention stocks.</P>
    <P>The risk attached to third country trading is high and rising.  Several factors combine to make it a credit controller's nightmare.  The ever present possibility of war or international disputes can jeopardise payment, as Goodman International can testify.  Long delays in payment are the norm and expensive insurance cover is required. The privatisation of many of the importing agencies in the former Soviet Union has reduced its creditworthiness. The Minister placed great emphasis for the future on Russia.  Let us proceed with caution in that direction.  With individual contracts worth up to £20 million, the financial dangers can be life threatening for the companies involved.</P>
    <P>Ideally, Ireland's third country trade could best be handled by two or three specialist exporters which could be jointly owned by groups of processors. Such entities would have financial strength, good market knowledge and greater capacity to diversify risk.  The Irish beef industry, however, is not exactly noted for its co-operative spirit so it must be accepted that a cohensive approach to third country marketing may be slow to materialise.</P>
    <P>We face strong competition on these markets from countries such as Australia and New Zealand which enjoy tremendous economies of scale relative to European producers.  It is vital to adopt a coherent and co-ordinated approach to marketing our product in Third World countries.  It is clear that we have to reduce our dependence on this artificial market and concentrate <Col N="680" /> instead on the development of real commercial markets in Britain and continental Europe, otherwise we will have failed completely to capitalise on the opportunity presented by our original entry to the Common Market 25 years ago.  We will go into the next millennium with a beef industry that still has a fatal weakness in marketing terms apart from its image problems and the failure of its supervision.</P>
    <P>We should be willing to confront this issue now.  We must recognise that in the context of GATT and CAP reform the long-term prosperity of the Irish beef industry will ultimately depend on its ability to sell to commercial markets on the basis of price and quality and without subsidies.  Farmers, therefore, have a strong vested interest in ensuring that we develop a market driven beef industry and they must recognise that in our current heavy reliance on third country markets, we might be just storing up trouble for ourselves.  The clear strategic objective of the Irish beef industry should be to achieve maximum penetration of the British and European markets, aiming as far as possible to sell added value products through stable trading relationships with the main supermarket chains.</P>
    <P>Ireland produces about 500,000 tonnes of beef per year in excess of the requirements of the domestic market. We must not continue to view this as a surplus to be flushed out of the system by whatever means possible, but as a valuable resource from which the national economy should seek to derive maximum benefit.</P>
    <P>There has been no shortage of reports, committees and expert groups over the last ten years stressing the need for a market oriented approach to the development of the beef industry.  An Bord Bia must convince consumers, retailers and wholesalers in our major British and European markets that Irish beef is clean and wholesome and a product safe to eat.  Consumers themselves should be involved in this process.  That is why, when the An Bord Bia Act, 1994, was going through the Oireachtas, <Col N="681" /> the Progressive Democrats proposed that one ordinary member of the board should be appointed to represent the views and interests of consumers.  In proposing that amendment we suggested that such a move would strengthen the focus of the board and assist it in its remit to market effectively. Unfortunately, the amendment was not accepted.</P>
    <P>If An Bord Bia can succeed in marketing Irish beef effectively on this basis, it will have more than justified its existence and the whole country will reap the reward in terms of increased exports to high quality, high value markets. If the board fails to do so it will be in no small part due to our failure to put in place satisfactory arrangements for policing the beef industry, arrangements that can command the confidence of consumers right across Europe.  Unfortunately, our present arrangements for the policing of our food industry do not inspire confidence.</P>
    <P>The weekend press reported that there had been a collapse in the enforcement of food and hygiene regulations. As a result we do not apparently know if British beef is being imported to this country and sold to unsuspecting consumers.  At a time when consumers right across Europe are only too well aware of the unsavoury reputation of British beef it is remarkable that our much vaunted controls seem to be breaking down.  We have no coherent system for quality assurance in the food industry.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, through its veterinary inspectorate, has responsibility for ensuring quality control in the processing plants &mdash; a task it has discharged none too well in recent years.  The eight health boards, through their environmental health officers, are responsible for food quality and food hygiene at retail level in shops, restaurants and mobile stalls.  The two separate bureaucracies are engaged in very similar work but do not seem to have any links.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance and customer assurance are the key to success for the <Col N="682" /> Irish beef industry.  As long as market confidence can be maintained in the Irish product then all doors will be open to it.  Unfortunately, the BSE crisis has once again highlighted our failings in this area.  We express great pride in the clean and green image which our beef enjoys, or which we think it enjoys. However, this favourable image is useless and will rapidly disappear without proper verification standards.  We have an advantage but we are throwing it away because of our inability to convince international consumers of the good and safe nature of our product.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is responsible for policing the beef industry but its record in this area has left much to be desired.  Two months ago, at the same time as the BSE story was breaking, there was the disturbing revelation that a senior veterinary officer in the Department was facing criminal proceedings over irregularities regarding the sale of Irish cattle tags and health certificates to cover British cattle.  This was hardly likely to inspire confidence in our official control procedures.  There have been several other instances in recent years which have cast the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in an equally unfavourable light in its handling of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>It is time we considered putting new arrangements in place for the policing of the whole food production and food processing industry which is of such vital national importance.  We must be able to show that our food industry is properly and vigilantly policed.  We must ensure that Ireland's reputation as a producer of natural and wholesome quality meat is protected and verified. Too often the Department sees itself as an agent of the producer or, to a lesser extent, the processor.  We need more independence, more transparency, more credibility if our policing arrangements are to be taken seriously internationally. If our food inspection system commands international respect, our food exporters, including our beef exporters, will benefit in terms of increased sales. <Col N="683" /> In the free market post-intervention era producers and processors must recognise that unless they are seen to put the interests of the consumer first the industry has no long-term future.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of all those involved in the beef industry, including producers and processors, that a new system is put in place.  We need to create a single food inspectorate to handle all aspects of quality assurance and hygiene in the food processing industry.  This would be an independent executive agency combining the functions of the Department's veterinary inspectorate and the environmental health service of the health boards.  Producers and processors would be represented on the board of such an agency but so also would people from the retail trade and consumer interests.  If the consumer is king in a market economy that should be reflected in the composition of the board of our national food inspection agency.</P>
    <P>This option need not involve any appreciable additional cost to the Exchequer but rather the deployment of existing resources in a more efficient and effective manner.  The new agency should not just be independent of the Department but he seen to be so.  To this end it should report to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The new agency would ensure that consumers at home were adequately protected.  It would also give assurances to foreign buyers in terms of quality, hygiene and product traceability, thereby ensuring that our food exporters enjoyed a good reputation on foreign markets.  This would be all the more important as we move inexorably towards an era of free international trade in food products.</P>
    <P>As we move into the next millennium the future of our beef export trade lies in supplying high value products to retail chains in Britain and continental Europe.  This is a demanding, quality conscious commercial market, very different from the heavily subsidised <Col N="684" /> third country markets which are absorbing half our beef and cattle exports.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope to make major progress in commercial European markets unless we can demonstrate that we have reliable and dependable systems in place for ensuring the quality of our food products, otherwise British and continental consumers will not want to buy what we produce.</P>

      <P>Last evening in the Seanad I participated in a very useful discussion on a motion on the BSE issue.  While there were differences of emphasis from the speakers who participated, it was clear that there was a unity of purpose and a recognition that, because of the very serious situation facing all elements of the industry, everyone concerned should be pulling together to deal with the various problems as they arise.</P>
      <P>Any discussion on BSE must begin with the background of the position in Ireland in relation to BSE.  To date Ireland has had a total of 127 cases of BSE since the first case was confirmed in 1989.  This incidence, which represents an average of 16 cases per year, must be viewed in the light of a cattle population of seven million animals, by comparison the United Kingdom has had over 160,000 cases in a cattle population of about 12 million.  A comprehensive system of control measures has been put in place in Ireland to ensure that consumers at home and abroad can have confidence in Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE crisis was triggered by the announcement by the British Health Secretary in the House of Commons last March regarding possible links between BSE and its human equivalent, CJD. Notwithstanding the tentative nature of this link, this statement had significant <Col N="685" /> effect on consumer confidence in the safety of beef, not only in the United Kingdom but in all other EU member states, including Ireland, and in third countries.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted quickly to reassure Irish consumers through the establishment of the expert advisory group, composed of experts from the medical and veterinary professions as well as representatives from various Government Departments, the grocery trade and consumer interests.  The group concluded that on the basis of all the medical, veterinary and scientific advice available to it, Irish beef and beef products were safe to eat and could be consumed with confidence by Irish consumers. The developments also demanded a response at EU level.  In the aftermath the Commission decided on 27 March 1996 to prohibit the export of all live bovine animals, semen embryos and products containing bovine materials from the United Kingdom to any other destination, with the exception of those containing bovine material which originated from animals slaughtered outside the UK.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of that decision, the World Health Organisation and various EU scientific committees have reexamined the situation and have concluded that products such as gelatine and tallow &mdash; which have undergone certain manufacturing processes &mdash; and bovine semen could, with safety, be excluded from the export prohibition. Ireland has supported this partial lifting of the EU ban on the export of these products from the UK in line with the scientific advice to this effect and will actively participate in discussions on this matter in the Agriculture Council next week.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the EU prohibition on 27 March, a huge Garda and customs surveillance operation has been in place along the Border to ensure that animals or products are not illegally imported into the State in contravention of the prohibition.  The operation, which is undeniably necessary to ensure that <Col N="686" /> purchasers in markets overseas can continue to have confidence in Irish beef exports, has enabled Irish exporters to provide cast iron guarantees as regards the origin of their exports.</P>
    <P>As a major beef exporter, the Irish beef industry could not be insulated from the fallout of the BSE crisis.  One of the most immediate effects of the announcement on 20 March was to raise serious concerns in the minds of consumers about the safety of beef and this led to a dramatic fall in beef consumption worldwide.  All the services available to the State were marshalled with a view to assisting the beef industry to cope with the crisis and minimise its effects.  It is clear from the Minister's opening remarks that he has directed his efforts at ensuring that the European Commission introduce effective market support arrangements to remove surplus beef from the market and provide for compensation to be paid to producers who had suffered income loses as a result of the crisis.</P>
    <P>So far as effective market support arrangements are concerned, the Commission introduced emergency intervention measures early in April, subject to a ceiling of 50,000 tonnes, on purchases into intervention under the two April tenders and 40,000 tonnes of beef were removed from the European market under the second tender in April. The emergency intervention arrangements were extended this month and a 50,000 tonne ceiling was to be increased to 65,000 tonnes.  About 40,000 tonnes was accepted into intervention under the first tender which leaves 25,000 tonnes available for the second tender to be adjudicated on at the meeting of the beef management committee tomorrow.</P>
    <P>That meeting will also decide on the intervention arrangements next month. These intervention measures have been extremely successful in helping to eliminate the backlog of cattle which has built up on farms in the aftermath of the onset of the crisis and in removing surplus beef from the market.  The scale and depth of the crisis across Europe is <Col N="687" /> evident by the quantities of beef offered into intervention, particularly in Germany. Clearly these emergency intervention measures prevented what would otherwise have been a total collapse in the European market which would have devastating consequences for the Irish beef sector.  In this case, intervention for all its faults, has been used successfully to support the market.  The 12 per cent increase in export refunds on cattle and beef on 1 May, and the positive response of the Irish beef industry, is welcome.  The volume of licences taken out in the days following the increase of 26,000 tonnes of beef and 5,000 head of live cattle demonstrates a renewed confidence among Irish exporters in export possibilities to third country markets.</P>
    <P>Effective intervention support arrangements and increased export refunds are only two of the instruments available to the Commission to support producers' incomes.  I accept that, in spite of the intervention arrangements, cattle prices have fallen and producers have suffered substantial income losses as a result of the crisis.  It was recognised from an early stage that market support systems alone would be unable to maintain cattle prices at levels which would return reasonable incomes for producers. This is highlighted by the fact that the emergency Council meeting on BSE, held from 1 to 3 April, provided for the possibility of compensation payments to producers.  The meeting of the Agriculture Council from 29 to 30 April confirmed that compensation would be available and at a meeting from 20 to 21 May the Council discussed informal Commission proposals for compensation which have been formally adopted by the Commission.  The Minister has outlined the proposals that are on the table for consideration at the Agriculture Council meeting next week.</P>
    <P>The evidence to date suggests that this crisis will be worse than any other experienced by the beef sector in recent times.  It is becoming increasingly evident that there will be a permanent and negative impact on beef consumption in <Col N="688" /> our major markets.  We have to consider the prospect that consumption will not return to a level that will enable the European Union to live within the GATT ceiling on subsidised exports and that measures may be required at European level to restore balance to the beef market by reforming the beef regime.  A debate on this issue is already under way, with some members urging reforms sooner rather than later.  It appears at this stage that some type of reform is inevitable and Ireland's objective in any such reform will be to ensure, in so far as possible, that the premium arrangements continue to promote extensive production and that our share of payments under the premium system is not reduced.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on what he has done to date.  I have first hand knowledge of that.  The savage attack on him this morning by the Fianna Fáil shadow spokesperson was disgraceful and does not represent the national interest.  We should all work together on this issue.  When we were in Opposition we supported the Government when the national interest was at stake.  However, that same generosity is not forthcoming on this issue from the Opposition spokesperson on agriculture.  The people, especially the farming community, will recognise this for what it is, particularly at a time when we need solidarity.</P>
    <P>A difficult task lies ahead.  We cannot force the Germans, the Italians, the British or the French to eat more Irish beef.  We have the product, but we must sell it and that must involve a national campaign.  Irrespective of what side of the House we occupy in the future, I will sell a positive image of this country's food and not try to gain political capital from something that could cause a national disaster.  We must work together on this issue.</P>

      <P>Given Deputy Cowen's vitriolic contribution, I do not wish to respond to many of his comments. However, there are a number of matters on which I must comment.  He criticised the Minister for his slow response to the crisis.  Deputy Cowen will recall that in 1989 we had another BSE crisis and we lost our Middle East markets.  I was on the Opposition benches at that time and asked questions of the then Minister, Senator Michael O'Kennedy, and his successor, about the crisis.  I will not forget the wool-gathering nonsense and the lack of understanding of the problem at that time.  We were shut out of those markets for three years but the then Fianna Fáil Minister failed to respond. While I dislike referring to this matter now, people should be judged on their record.  The markets with Libya and Egypt did not become lucrative until three years later, but the then Fianna Fáil Progressive Democrat Administration did not make any meaningful attempt to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen spoke about the spirit of Commissioner MacSharry and our lack of commitment to the MacSharry reforms.  Those reforms would have been very bad for Ireland had we accepted them as they were first produced. The then Fianna Fáil Government was willing to go along with them even though they would have meant the loss of billions of pounds for our industry. We had to reply on France &mdash; even though they were looking after their <Col N="690" /> interests &mdash; to ensure that the final package benefited us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen spoke about the well publicised visit to Iran.  When he and his deputation returned it was suggested they had succeeded in reopening the market with Iran, but we now know that is not true.  That visit was commented on by many Members of the House, even by members of the Fianna Fáil deputation who accompanied Deputy Cowen on that visit.  The comments of a Minister of State to the House on the undiplomatic skills of Deputy Cowen in Iran are worth repeating.  He said it was like letting Mike Tyson into a ballet class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his response to an unprecedented crisis in the beef industry.  It is a watershed for beef and beef consumption. One can only condemn the British for the way their Minister handled the matter in the House of Commons and for their petty behaviour afterwards. The manner in which they withdrew co-operation at all levels of EU activity because they did not get their way in the BSE crisis is deplorable.  They seem to forget they caused this crisis which has had most effect in countries, such as Ireland, where there is a large dependence on agriculture.  I was pleased to hear the comments of President Santer on British television last Sunday and I hope his comments will be of a similar vein when he visits this city this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's comments about his recent successful visit to Russia and the fact that we have secured markets in Russia for 100,000 tonnes of beef, one-quarter of our total output in the coming year.  That is a significant breakthrough and the Minister is to be complimented on it.  It is the largest market we have secured in recent years.  We have exported to markets in third countries, particularly the <Col N="691" /> Middle East, but none of them represented a market as great as this.  The Minister is to be particularly congratulated for securing that market at a time such as this.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to hear that many of the Russian contracts are for forequarter beef, a product difficult to dispose of even at the best of times. That the Russian market will take a significant proportion of our forequarter beef is particularly welcome.  In recent years we have relied heavily on the European market, where the greatest fall in consumption is experienced.  We cannot be sure that market will be restored to pre-20 March levels.</P>
    <P>Everything possible must be done to sell the Irish product as BSE free.  We must sell our green image.  I agree with the Minister that in marketing beef in the Community in future we should concentrate on beef produced from grassland rather than factory production.  The use of intensive fattening units where meat and bonemeal is not properly processed has given rise to BSE.  The disease is transmitted to animals and possibly, although it is not proven, to human beings.  I would ask the Minister to take the opportunity as chairman of the EC Council of Agriculture Ministers during our Presidency to emphasise our BSE free status.  The Presidency presents us with an excellent opportunity in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that before the crisis occurred the EU was 104 per cent self-sufficient in beef, in other words there was 4 per cent more beef on the European market than could be consumed. Even though we had to find markets for the surplus, we imported a significant proportion.  After this crisis the EU will be 124 per cent or 125 per cent self-sufficient in beef.  If that trend continues the EU must consider the possibility of culling animals and restricting highly intensive beef production in factory-type conditions.</P>
    <P>We welcome the measures negotiated by the Minister such as increases in beef premium, the suckler cow scheme and <Col N="692" /> the deseasonalisation scheme, but they are unsustainable in the long-term.  If we are to tackle the problem through the market mechanism we must deal with highly intensive methods of production which result in a surplus on the market &mdash; it is those methods of production that have caused the BSE scare.</P>
    <P>I regret my contribution is restricted because of time constraints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to wonder whether many of us will find common ground at some stage in the future.</P>
      <P>Consumer confidence has been eroded by a number of factors, one of which is substance abuse, which did more damage to the beef industry than BSE.  The people who used illegal substances are guilty of damaging the reputation of the beef industry.  At last they have realised that is not the road to follow, that they should produce a superior product that will be sought after in a dwindling market.  We must put in place new marketing strategies to restore confidence, not only of consumers but also producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Producers will no longer endure the chaos that prevailed for the past four or five months when many of them lost up to £200 per head on winter cattle.  It will be practically impossible for them to <Col N="693" /> return to winter beef production.  We must produce a superior product which is traceable from birth to death.</P>
    <P>The new tagging system introduced recently will do little to boost consumer confidence.  Many tags get caught in gates and hedges and farmers have to pay co-operatives to have them replaced.  The Minister should have introduced an electronic tagging system. That is the only way to prevent abuse.  I understand that methods have been devised to deal with the replacement of tags, but they have failed and will fail in the future.</P>
    <P>To restore consumer confidence the Minister must take into account traceability, production methods and hygiene standards.  We must target a niche market for beef.  There is no point in producing large carcases with a dead weight of 1,100 lbs. or 1,200 lbs.  There is no longer a market in Europe for that type of beef.  In the UK producer groups of certain breeds of cattle command prices as high as 10p and 15p per lb. above what is paid for non-sourced and non-traceable commodity.  Funding must be invested in research and in those markets. As I said during the Question Time six weeks ago, all slaughtered carcases should be residue tested.  If the Minister does this he will do more to restore consumer confidence than anything that has been done over the past ten years.  It is time we put in place a system similar to the ISO 9000 system so that producers will be encouraged to produce a first class product.  They may not be able to sell this product for the prices they got in the past but at least they will be able to command a greater share of the market than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate but regret that my time is limited.  The agriculture industry has been lurching from crisis to crisis in recent months, for example, the export refund problem, the problems experienced by sheep farmers, the BSE crisis and the super-levy problems.  Each of these difficulties represents a fundamental attack on the <Col N="694" /> role of the family farm in sustaining the rural population and the fabric of rural society.  I regret that Deputy Connor sought to misrepresent the Fianna Fáil position.  As Deputy Ellis said, the two larger parties are most concerned about this issue.  The Minister can depend on more support from Members on this side of the House than he can from some of his partners in Government. Sometimes this involves being critical of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but generally we try to be constructive and put forward helpful suggestions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has control of the State support services to agriculture.  As Deputy Cowen correctly said, Teagasc must be given a key role in the development of a policy for the agricultural industry into the future.  One of the weaknesses of the industry is that farmers, individually and collectively, do not know where it is headed.  It is little wonder that individual sectors are beset with crises when there is no clear vision for the future of the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister also has control of the level and timing of many of the payments under the State support system. In some cases payments have been very slow and complaints have been made under virtually every heading, for example, REPS, the extensification scheme and the various premia.  In the present circumstances the Minister should ensure that payment is brought forward.  Many farmers are extremely concerned about their incomes and the Minister could bring forward payments, thereby mitigating the difficulties in the short-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Premia are provided to help farmers during the difficult periods they encounter from time to time.  The problems with the super-levy have led to many farmers in my constituency with quotas of less than 10,000 gallons being severely penalised and facing the threat of not having an income for two to three <Col N="695" /> months at this time of the year.  The co-ops have handled this issue in an insensitive manner.  The milk policy division of the Department must intervene directly in the matter and, if necessary, order the co-ops to deal with farmers over a period of years.  If the co-ops are so poor that they need support to do this then perhaps this could be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis referred to animal identification and feedstuffs.  It is crucial to the future of the beef industry that people believe the product is safe.  We are in a unique position to guarantee the safety of our product.  Some Deputies referred to the relatively easy measures which could be put in place so that people could be assured that the quality standards were genuinely being adhered to.</P>
    <P>Farmers are looking to the Government for leadership in this matter.  They want to know if they should be looking at different breeds, for example, smaller breeds which are ready faster for slaughter.  Those farmers who have a major financial commitment to existing beef breeds which came into the country over the past 25-30 years want an assurance that they are being looked after.  I accept that some of the difficulties are outside the control of the Minister but others are directly within it.  Farmers want a plan for the future and an assurance that they can continue in beef production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back from his trip to St. Petersburg.  I missed the beginning of his speech but I understand he gave us some good news. I hope that the promises he was given will be fulfilled as they are badly needed.  The indications are that the Russian market is weakening from a price perspective and may not be as good as last year, even though it will still be pivotal to the autumn trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has the Minister not gone to Libya?  He told us several times that he was making arrangements to visit this country but it seems that the Libyans do <Col N="696" /> not want him &mdash; they have not yet sanctioned a visa for him.  However, Australian cattle and sheep exporters seem to have no trouble getting visas for Libya where they are getting the lion's share of available business.  Maybe the Libyans and Iranians really want to see the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.  If this is the case they will be left waiting.  The Tánaiste is available to fly to any corner of the world for a photo opportunity but he is not available to bat for the beef industry.  It is ironic that many of the people in Cabinet who made their political reputation out of pilloring the beef trade are not now prepared to defend the industry against unfounded accusations.</P>
    <P>German and Libyan television stations have shown mischievous documentaries about the amount of BSE infected meat coming into the Republic from Britain through the North of Ireland.  Yet we have not heard a whisper of protest from the Minister for television and films, Deputy Higgins, about the wrong impressions being created. The Government seems to be totally oblivious to the crisis facing us but I will spell out some facts for it.</P>
    <P>Up to now the fall-out from the BSE crisis has mainly affected 5,000 winter finishers which were already under presure because of the Minister's failure to persuade the Commission to support the beef market from December onwards.  During the past fortnight the rot has spread throughout the industry &mdash; culled cow prices have collapsed, store prices have been badly affected and even calf prices have been hit.  I shudder to think what will happen to weanling prices next autumn, while at the other end of the scale many store producers will not be in a position to buy these depressed price weanlings.</P>
    <P>If the Government does not shake itself out of its lethargy cattle prices for 1996 will make the cattle prices for 1974 look like a teddy bear's picnic.  There is an air of alarm and fear in the cattle sector. We have heard reports about specialist farmers who have quietly <Col N="697" /> placed portions of their farms on the market, banks which have tightened up in their assessment of loans for the purchase of store cattle and the sale of culled cows for a song.  Over the past three months all those involved in the beef industry have seen the value of their assets reduced by 30 per cent. Farmers are queuing up for compensation. The IFA has estimated that, based on present cattle prices, the loss in the beef sector could be high as £206 million this year, equivalent to the loss of 18,500 jobs in rural Ireland.  The beef and livestock sector is worth £1.7 billion to the economy each year, involving 100,000 livestock farmers and sustaining approximately 30,000 jobs both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>The crisis we are witnessing will damage the very core of rural Ireland and it involves more than a worry about a ban on United Kingdom tallow and gelatine. While better market supports and compensation may go some way to reducing overall losses, the scale of the problem is so large the only answer is to get people generally, particularly those in continental Europe, to resume the consumption of beef.  We know that a scientific link has not yet been established between BSE and CJD but European consumers need to be reassured.</P>
    <P>The response of An Bórd Bia to the crisis so far would not merit any medals. Perhaps that agency is devoting most of its energy to preparing for the Horizon Food Fair next month, the Minister's own baby, on which, if rumours are to be believed, approximately £3 million is to be spent.  I hope the costs will justify the returns, that we do not witness a glorious junket or talking shop while the beef industry goes down the tubes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal component of our primary industry, agriculture, is the beef industry.  In recent years Members of the Government parties in Opposition condemned people involved in that outstanding industry.  None of them is here to defend and support that industry in crisis.  It is vital that the Minister has the full support of Government <Col N="698" /> and that consumers have confidence in our beef products.  Information available to me from my contracts in the Community is to the effect that French supermarkets have erected signs saying &ldquo;French beef only&rdquo; and their German counterparts have done likewise saying &ldquo;German beef only&rdquo;.  Where is An Bórd Bia?  Where is our marketing strategy? Where are the provisions of the Single Market, giving rights to this country, as a full member state of the European Union, to trade in these countries?  Why is not our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry with the Council of Agriculture Ministers and the Minister for Tourism and Trade with his Council of Ministers ensuring that our rights and those of our primary producers are protected?</P>
      <P>We have a cyclical production in livestock. Our primary producers in the west depend on finishers in the east and finishers in the east, midlands and elsewhere depend on a proper price being paid for our beef products.  It is vital that the Minister realises the price of prime beef in the factories today is £300 net per head less than it was three years ago, representing a drop of £100 per annum over three years.  The Government must tackle and resolve this crisis in our beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry visited Athenry in my constituency for national rural day.  He stated that in ten years time forestry would be more important here than beef.  That would be disastrous and would send shivers right across the industry.  While I am a positive supporter of forestry to earn additional agricultural income, we cannot undermine agriculture's primary component, the beef sector.  The Taoiseach failed to acknowledge that event which was attended by 20,000 who need Government leadership, acknowledgement and support.  This Government is travelling in three different directions and nobody knows its true route.  Our national primary industry is in crisis, requiring leadership, commitment, cohesion, the full support of the <Col N="699" /> Government.  It needs the full support of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Labour Party and smoked salmon socialists of this island and the full support of Democratic Left, who have traditionally tried to undermine our primary agricultural industry, not one of whose Members contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>On behalf of all our farmers, I appeal to the Government to show solidarity with them, to give leadership, get the markets right, to reassure European consumers, so that this industry can be sustained, expanded and developed and rural families enabled to maintain their livelihood through this primary industry which is so important to our economy.</P>

      <P>We had a display of bawling ignorance this morning from Deputy Cowen who had nothing constructive to say.  This is a matter that requires somewhat more analysis than the kind of thunder we witnessed from Deputy Cowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis that has hit the beef industry resulting from the BSE scare has been blown up on the very slimmest of scientific evidence, on the most tenuous of alleged connections between BSE and CJD.  It is incredible that a crisis could have been manufactured on so <Col N="700" /> little ground but, because it concerns food and health, the media have gone into a frenzy about it and every ill-considered remark of people with any scientific connection with food produces another page in every single printed media, another half hour of speculation on the subject on television.  We have been subjected to a series of the most incredible, unscientific and irresponsible pronouncements by professional people who have responsibilities, who should know better than to speak loosely as they have done about a matter like this.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that very many, if not all or most of our daily activities, including our eating and drinking habits, probably carry a greater, more immediate risk of mortality than does the consumption of beef.  We cannot repeat that often enough.  Even at that, some of our daily eating habits carry a level of risk disputed by medical experts.  Within the past two weeks or so we witnessed a fairly not dispute between two cardiologists about the dangers of different kinds of diets.  To examine that argumentation sanely and coldly on the one hand and the scare manufactured about BSE and its alleged tenuous link to CJD should make all of us sit up and ask if we will allow ourselves, as sentient, thinking human beings, be manipulated in this way by people who have no basis for what they say?</P>
    <P>It has now reached the point that when one asks for beef in a restaurant now, one is asked: &ldquo;Do you really want beef?&rdquo; It is absolute, utter nonsense to scare the wits out of half the world's population on the basis of the type of evidence available thus far.  The chances of winning £1 million in the national lottery are infinitely greater than those of contracting CJD from eating beef, but that is not reported because it does not suit the feeding frenzy of the media.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on his efforts to regain access to third country markets for our beef.  That is a far more exacting process, requires far greater preparation, than Deputy Cowen and <Col N="701" /> his colleagues claim.  To listen to them one would think there was an instant answer.  Indeed Deputy Cowen's much trumpeted visit to Iran, for example, produced a great many headlines but no sales.  There was a time when it appeared Fianna Fáil could lift the telephone and arrange a meeting in a tent in Libya.  It does not do so now, and it never seemed to do us much good when they did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague went on one of those trips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ellis should not tempt me.  I do not perceive much benefit to be had from the kind of nonsense being talked now.  If we are to regain more beef sales in, say, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Libya or anywhere else, we must prepare properly.  It is not sufficient for a Minister or anybody else to jump on a plane, and go to Libya to sell beef.  That is not the way the market works and Deputies opposite surely are in a position to know that.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to note that the Minister is putting in place a much needed compensation system.  I suggest he obtain the agreement of the European Union authorities to pay direct compensation for cattle slaughtered here since the beginning of this year, with a higher rate for cattle slaughtered since 20 March last when the crisis really blew up.  People with fattened cattle bought in the latter half of last year have borne the brunt of this crisis.  They are looking at cattle in yards that have been fed over the winter and are losing condition. I strongly suggest to the Minister that he should ensure that the compensation scheme includes heifers and young bulls.  Information on the cattle slaughtered is readily available through the records of the Department and the factories. Such a compensation system would address the immediate problem in a way that is most appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The renderers and the processors have a great deal to answer for.  The Minister provided them with a breathing space by providing a subsidy to tie <Col N="702" /> them over a period during which they should have been busily engaged in sorting out how they would handle that large proportion of offal which, because of the perception created by the scare, is no longer marketable in the way it was. Having listened carefully to what has been happening during the past few weeks it appears that the renderers and processors have done nothing.  Even though there is cross-ownership between those two parts of the sector, it appears they are engaged in a slow bicycle race with each other.  Neither side is doing anything and the result is that nothing is in place between those industries.  They should know there has been a shift in the market and in the conditions for their products.  Whether we consider it justified, the range of uses for animal offal will be much more restricted in future than has been the case up to now.  There is cost involved in that and the industry should be working out how to deal with it.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the only practical answer to dealing with large amounts of animal offal that cannot be used for traditional purposes is incineration. I and other Members saw what happened when we had to dispose of burnt meat following a factory fire in Ballaghaderreen.  Some of it was buried on a hilltop in County Roscommon, a lunatic policy.  More of it was buried in a disused quarry in Westmeath, another lunatic policy.  We need to dispose of upwards of 100,000 tonnes of animal offal annually and landfill is not the way to deal with it.  The only practical way to deal with it is incineration using the tried and proven, clean and environmentally friendly techniques demonstrated in other countries.  I call on Members to support that proposal.  I call, in particular, on the Green Party to stop the nonsense in which it has been engaged for the past five or six years that has the country driven mad and is cutting off our access to the most effective way of disposing not only of animal offal but of a great quantity of unrecyclable waste.  We should use this occasion <Col N="703" /> to introduce more sanity into that argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I cannot raise all the issues I wish to raise in the ten minutes at my disposal, therefore I will concentrate on a number of points.</P>
      <P>I agree with everything that has been said.  The current BSE crisis will result in greater financial losses to farmers than anything we have seen since 1974, including that year.  The signs are much more ominous than in 1974.  That year was a disaster for the beef industry, but the disaster was of a relatively short duration. The 1974 disaster in the cattle trade arose principally because we did not have sufficient killing capacity.  We had an explosion in our breeding herd and we were not good at marketing at that time.  There was only one ray of sunshine in 1974 in that there was no consumer resistance to eating beef.  We might as well accept that the beef industry is in the doldrums because 50 per cent of those who heretofore ate beef are not eating it today.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis is nothing short of a calamity for farmers, agriculture-related employment and rural Ireland.  Some farmers are financially ruined, particularly those with winter fatteners, but the rot has started in the store trade.  I was at the ringside of a County Galway mart and farmers were taking £70 to £80 less for their animals than they took the previous fortnight.  It appears that our seven million cattle will be devalued by between £50 and £100 per head, and in some cases by more.  In the context of the Stock Exchange that represents a devaluation of £700 million for the country.  If that devaluation occurred in the Stock Exchange in the morning we would be talking of another Black Friday, but because the devaluation is gradual and there is silence about it many people do not notice it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no shortage of crocodile tears on this debate.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Cowen said.  The only point I picked up from what he said, and <Col N="704" /> this is the only reference I will make to what he said, is that we should renegotiate the GATT deal, which took seven years to negotiate and to which it was sought to get 114 countries to agree. Who signed that deal on behalf of Ireland?  His colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh and the former Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, signed it.  The ink is not dry on that agreement and Deputy Cowen is calling for it to be renegotiated. I will return to that point later.</P>
    <P>More crocodile tears have been shed about the Libyan situation.  The Minister has tried on numerous occasions to get into Libya.  I congratulate Deputy Smith's colleagues on travelling to Iran. There was nothing wrong with doing that but why did they not travel to Libya?  Did they try to get into Libya?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Egypt and other countries are open to Irish exports, but the beef consumption in those countries has fallen by 40 per cent and the position is more or less the same in Germany and France.  That fact that we have seven times more dependence on beef than any other member <Col N="705" /> state of the European Union and that we export 85 per cent of our beef highlights that this problem, which originated in Britain, is killing our industry.</P>
    <P>BSE potentially spells disaster for us. The only escape we had for the past few months was intervention.  Or was it an escape?  In the bad old days before CAP reform we used intervention more than any other country.  France and Germany did not resort to it.  This month our beef is flowing into the cold stores of France and Germany.  What will happen to it later?  Because of the most recent GATT agreement we are not allowed to offload any more of our beef to Third World countries than the amount to which we agreed, at least 250,000 tonnes less than what we exported annually for the past four years to those countries. What will we do with the surplus?  I assume that through good marketing the market for beef will return to some level of normality as the months pass.  I hope it will, but it is unlikely that we will recapture 100 per cent of the market share we had prior to last February or March.  Even if there is a 10 per cent loss of market share we will have approximately 800,000 tonnes of meat in intervention across Europe.  Obviously this is a huge problem.</P>
    <P>The bloodhounds who are out to criticise the Minister should be careful.  To be blunt, the renderers and the factories tried last week to orchestrate a blackmail campaign to trap Irish taxpayers. They knew what they were doing, and they knew that no Government, whatever its colour, would pump taxpayers' money into that system because it is part of the industry.  I congratulate them on reaching an agreement, but I agree with Deputy Dukes.  I have no way of knowing how much meat and bonemeal we can sell in future but I know we will not be able to turn half of the offal we are likely to produce over the next few years into meat and bonemeal.  If it is possible to get feasibility grants for private enterprise, in this country or in Europe, to develop a process of incineration that will take up some of the slack, that is what we should do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> We are dealing with mad cow disease, but we have a touch of mad professor disease on our hands.  We saw on our television screens last night an eminent professor who somehow connected BSE in cows with the grass growing in our fields.  That is outrageous.  No scientific evidence has been found to show that the disease crosses species, not to speak of coming from the grass and the land, but that professor got a platform on national television.</P>
    <P>Today people denied what he said, but he did get the opportunity to speak on Irish television and sent a shiver down the backs of many people.  Let us have balance, accept the position in which we find ourselves, but not resort to scare tactics.</P>
    <P>I agree with the many speakers who spoke about quality assurance.  In future any animal presented for sale at an abattoir or factory should be accompanied by a CV detailing where it was born, what it ate, what it was injected with, etc.  Unless we do that we will not get the housewives of Europe to buy our product.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Minister for negotiating the compensation; we have to go back and knock on that door again.  If the principles and objectives of the original Treaty of Rome are anything to go by, now is the time for Europe to show it will not turn its back on the farmers of Europe or of Ireland which has a greater dependency on agriculture than any other country.  If those principles mean anything, now is the time for Europe to come to the aid of rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with a number of other Deputies.  What is baffling about the approach of the Government to this debate is that, for as long as I can remember, there has been a major international economic crisis in the beef industry.  It is extraordinary that the Government ring-fenced this issue into one sector of the economy as if all the answers lie within that sector.  That is not the case.  Agriculture is central to the Irish economy and to <Col N="707" /> the economic growth we have had over the past few years.  The non-involvement, non-participation and lack of interest on the part of the Labour and Democratic Left parties is quite extraordinary and represents a serious misreading of the situation.  Having watched this crisis unfold over the past few months, I cannot understand why the Taoiseach has not instructed a Cabinet subcommittee consisting of, at a minimum, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to deal with this issue.  The moneys available solely within the Department of Agriculture are not sufficient to meet the immediate problems and, apart from what we can derive from the EU, money will have to be found from Government resources. When Packard Electric was in trouble the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, conducted crisis meetings the length and breadth of Government buildings day in and day out.  This makes the Packard crisis pale into insignificance in comparison &mdash; that is not to diminish its significance to those directly concerned in Packard.  Is Deputy Rabbitte only a Minister for Tallaght?  Is that what the Department of Enterprise and Employment has become?  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has a direct responsibility to thousands of employees in the food sector, but there has been no acknowledgement from within Government of this crisis. The Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Ivan Yates, had to battle here on his own with no support from his so-called colleagues in Government.  It has been clear to me for a long time that the Labour Party and Democratic Left have no interest in the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer confidence is the key issue, not alone in this market but throughout our major markets in Europe.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to suggest he <Col N="708" /> is doing all he can, because he is not.  He is not getting the message across to the market-place regarding Irish beef.  For years we have been talking about how unique our product is in comparison to that of other countries, but we have failed to market the quality of Irish beef &mdash; and its unique selling points &mdash; throughout the world.  Now we have an opportunity to capitalise on what we have available to us here.  Unless resources are provided from the Department of Finance to boost what is available in An Bord Bia, we will not achieve a breakthrough in the market place.  The moneys that are required must be spent if this argument is to be brought into the homes of the European people in an effort to persuade them to continue their allegiance to beef. Nobody said that the market has collapsed to the extent that beef has been wiped out.  There is still a huge market and because of its uniqueness the Irish product has the capacity to sustain itself within the world and European markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> It is a disgrace that so little time has been allocated for this debate considering one of our primary industries is at stake. Listening to some of the speakers this morning one would think there was something seriously wrong with the beef being produced, but 95 per cent of farmers produce a top quality product.  It is the Minister who has failed to sell the product in the face of crisis.  Our whole marketing strategy seems to be out of place and we have not managed to convince the European consumer that there is a substantial difference between our product and that in Britain.  An Bord Bia was launched in a blaze of glory but it does not seem to be working.  I am amazed when I look up into the public gallery to see not a single person from An Bord Bia listening to the suggestions on marketing being put forward.  It is time the Minister made his present felt. The silence of the Taoiseach who comes <Col N="709" /> from a strong farming background continues to amaze me and it is time he raised his voice.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should set up a ministerial action team to implement a strategy that will help to reopen markets and restore confidence in our beef industry. The Ministers for Finance, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Enterprise and Employment and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; who seem to have gone to ground &mdash; should be involved with the marketing agencies and travel to wherever there is potential to sell the unique Irish product that farmers produce.</P>
      <P>Consumer confidence is at an all time low, responsibility for which rests squarely with the Government, and in particular the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and marketing agencies. We need to do something soon to restore confidence and the solution may be to set up an independent food quality authority.  If we are to win back the confidence of the consumer we must have product traceability, enforcement of quality standards in production and the control of drugs used in cattle production. At my home I share an entrance to County Wexford marts and on a daily basis I meet farmers who are very much affected by this crisis.  They are concerned that the family business they have built up during the years will be lost by the end of the year because they are losing £150-£200 per head of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are the lower prices paid to farmers not reflected in the shops and to the benefit of consumers?  It is unacceptable that farmers are losing a great deal of money while at the same time the price of beef in butcher shops is increasing.  The easiest way to restore consumer confidence is to sell the product at a reasonable price.  That is not happening.  If the crisis in the beef industry is not dealt with quickly many beef farmers will be out of business.  As a result the problem will trickle down into the urban areas with consequent <Col N="710" /> job losses.  It is time the Minister established a ministerial team to deal with this problem, if not it will be too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on the most serious issue to face the country for many years.  The contributions to the truncated debate on this issue are testament to the very serious position that obtains at present and the long-term implications for the industry.</P>
      <P>This debate is taking place against the background of a great loss of consumer confidence in beef.  This was triggered by mere speculation on the link between BSE and CJD.  The reality &mdash; a number of speakers have alluded to this &mdash; is that no scientific link has been established between BSE and CJD.  Yet, a media joyride has set off a serious loss of consumer confidence in the product that has resulted in prices to the primary producers in Ireland and across Europe plummeting to a depth that will see many farmers in grave financial trouble in the short-term.</P>
      <P>There is a need to tackle the problem decisively.  The process of rebuilding consumer confidence has to get under way quickly.  We are a victim in many ways of what has been an extraordinary attitude at official level in Britain to this problem.  Britain has been dealing with the BSE difficulty for some time yet there has been a serious lack of decisiveness in putting the necessary veterinary controls in place to tackle the problem. Perhaps it is because farming and agriculture are well down the priority list in Britain that there has been a lack of commitment to tackle the problem decisively.  Clearly the beef industry across Europe, and particularly in Ireland where it is so important to the economy, is paying a very high price for this lack of decisiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the outbreak of foot and mouth disease caused serious difficulties in Britain and one would have thought that the lesson would have been learned and the necessary trigger mechanisms for veterniary controls would have been <Col N="711" /> put in place much quicker than has happened.</P>
    <P>The patent lack of support during this debate for the Minister and the Minister of State at his Department from the two smaller parties in Government is a sad reflection of the poor commitment in the Labour Party and in Democratic Left to the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>To date no Member from the two smaller parties saw fit to contribute to this debate.  I spoke earlier about the need to rebuild consumer confidence quickly.  There is an onus on everybody to be part of the rebuilding process.  We export a huge percentage of our beef produce and consumer confidence must be restored in locations beyond our shores.  Clearly a co-ordinated effort at Community level has got to be set in motion quickly.  There is a responsibility on the Minister and the Government to introduce a proper compensation package to ensure that beef finishers, in particular, who are a vital link in the production chain survive the very serious financial difficulties and stay in business and that the industry survives and prospers in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.  This crisis requires very close attention.  If we could restore the housewife's confidence in beef, we would have solved the problem, but that will not easily be done.</P>
      <P>In my constituency farmers produce neither beet nor grain and depend in the main on beef.  Of the 6,500 herd owners, fewer than 1,500 are dairy farmers.  The farmers who depend on beef production face a very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I left my constituency on Monday morning for Leinster House a young farmer who has a 28 cow herd came to discuss his problems with me. Last week 18 of his herd went down <Col N="712" /> with tuberculosis and the best price he could get from slaughtering plants was 50p per lb.  This time last year a farmer would have no bother in negotiating 80p-85p for TB reactor cattle.  That man has ten cows left.  He built up a good quality cow herd but he now has massive repayments.  He receives about £15 per month in income support.  The Minister, in conjunction with ERAD, should look at individual cases like this and ensure such farmers have a future.  Their future now looks doubtful.  We would be inclined to appeal to factories to be decent and give reasonable prices. However, human nature being what it is, they will give as little as possible.  In cases like this, they only give valuation prices.  My county has the highest incidence of TB and this is causing great trauma.  The collapse in prices will certainly cause serious problems.  I pay tribute to the Garda and vets for their surveillance work along the Border.</P>
    <P>Several speakers spoke about identification tags.  In 1979, Mr. Tom Quinn of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards invited TDs to visit the institute, which was based on the north side.  The institute is now known as Eolas.  We were shown a box of tamper-proof tags which the institute was perfecting. We were watched closely in case anybody pocketed any tags.  I was interested in these tags because I had asked parliamentary questions about the importing of tags.  Two years later, when there was no further word about these tags, I wrote to Mr. Quinn.  He sent a letter in reply to say that the tags were faulty.  There has been no change with regard to tags in the 17 years since then.  We have been told over the years that there will be computerisation and better checks on animal movements and sales.  However, we are not making the progress we should be in this regard.</P>
    <P>A person I know well in Monaghan has a relative who grazes cattle in the Sliabh Beigh area of County Tyrone. His suckling herd strayed across the Border, was picked up by the Garda and the Customs and is at present under <Col N="713" /> investigation.  I ask the authorities to look closely at cases like this and to obtain information from vets and the Garda in the region in order to ensure that people will not suffer wrongly.  The Garda are doing great work in this area. It is a tough job to stand at a road in 12 hour shifts.  This costs the State £350,000 a week, which it can ill afford.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about marketing.  I read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> two days ago that IBEC, a group for which I have great regard, attacked the lack of a national policy on trade exports.  It stated that Irish exporters have been hindered for too long by a turf war mentality among Departments and agencies.  It called for trade conferences and associations to be involved in selling our produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I do so as chairperson of the Parliamentary Labour Party's sub-committee on agriculture and rural development.  As somebody who has been involved in agriculture for many years as an agricultural consultant and in many other capacities, I did not think this debate would be turned into a political football. The crisis we are now experiencing is above politics.  It is too important to be dragged down to the level of mud slinging and I would not partake in any debate of that nature.  I know the importance of this issue and can speak with authority on it because I was an agricultural consultant to many farmers for almost a decade and I come from Westmeath, one of the prime areas of beef production where many people involved in winter fattening have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to inform the House, and Members who may be guided in their views of the Labour Party's participation, that we have had a round of meetings with the IFA livestock committee and we are to meet the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association and the ICMSA.  We cannot be accused of showing a lack of interest in the development and importance of <Col N="714" /> agriculture.  I have always classified it as our green oil.  It is a natural resource to which we must attach tremendous importance.  It is worth over £1.7 billion and it makes a great contribution to our balance of payments.  It would be foolhardy, particularly for a party in Government, not to pay the greatest attention to this most important industry.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated earlier, the announcement in the House of the Commons on 20 March will live for a long time in the memories of beef producers and anybody connected with the industry.  I commend the Minister for his tireless and resolute work in promoting the industry abroad and I was glad to hear some positive news in his speech. The great tragedy for Irish farmers is that they are the innocent parties in this unprecedented crisis, which is not of their making.  It clearly has its origins in the mismanagement of the situation in Britain and we are paying the price for this because of the importance of agriculture, particularly the beef sector, to our economy.  Our dependence is seven times greater than that of any other European state.  Some 60 per cent of European exports to Third World countries are of Irish origin.  These statisticss indicate the importance of this industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from the original <i>faux pas</i> of the announcement in the Commons on 20 March, instead of taking positive measures to ameliorate the worst effects of the crisis, the British Minister announced last Tuesday that it would take up to six years to eradicate the last case of BSE from the UK.  I need not tell the House the devastating impact this would have for Irish farmers and the knock on effects it would have on the many thousands employed in beef-related industries.  During the last few weeks I have heard of small indigenous industries in various towns which have had orders cancelled because of the impact of the crisis.  Some of them were engaged in exporting to Britain.  Therefore, the crisis in Britain is affecting our industries which have an export potential. <Col N="715" /> Rather than engage in bluff and bluster, it is important that we be constructive in our comments and proposals for this important sector.  The level of beef consumption in the main European markets such as Britain, Germany, France and Italy, which represent about 150 million consumers, is still well over a third below the level which prevailed in March when the announcement was made.  This is a stark and undeniable fact.  The thrust of any initiative which we may embark on during our Presidency of the EU must be focused on regaining consumer confidence by means of quality assurance.  This must be based on a two-pronged approach focused at both European and national levels.</P>
    <P>At European level I agree with the thrust of the IFA's submission that there is a necessity to embark on a major generic promotion campaign throughout Europe.  I understand that up to 100 million in EU funding would be needed to launch and sustain a campaign of the magnitude and intensity required, but it would be money well spent and a good starting point in reassuring the consumer about the quality of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>I agree with Opposition speakers who said that An Bord Bia must be provided with the resources it requires to launch a quality assurance scheme to which consumers, as well as producers and processors, should have a significant input.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to speak to a group of school children on a visit to the House recently and was surprised that they were acutely aware of the BSE crisis. This shows the power of the printed and visual media and the influence of their parents.  When we went for a meal many of them were adamant that they would not consume beef, including burgers. This is an indication that the crisis had had a major impact throughout the country.  A promotional campaign, based on strong scientific evidence, should be launched to reinforce the <Col N="716" /> message that Irish beef is the best in the world and poses no threat to health.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that stringent measures have been taken to deal with the occasional outbreak of BSE.  These measures were introduced by Deputy Joe Walsh for which I commend and compliment him.  They include the total depopulation of herds, which is the right approach.</P>
    <P>It is important that measures are put in place to stamp out the use of illegal substances by a small minority of producers who have damaged the good name of Irish beef.  Deputy Ellis made practical suggestions.  He suggested a comprehensive test to detect residues and a stamp of quality similar to the one used in industry, ISO 9000, to promote a green and environmentally friendly product image.  Such measures are important in ensuring the consumers has full confidence in what I and my party believe is an excellent product.</P>
    <P>Beef consumption has been badly affected internationally.  The Egyptian market is showing signs of a slow down while the Iranian and Libyan markets remain closed to Irish beef exports.  We have to use whatever influence we have through political and diplomatic channels to ensure these markets are reopened.</P>
    <P>The European Commission put forward a 634 million ECU compensation package for farmers throughout the EU. Based on the 1995 take-up, we should qualify for approximately £60 million of this.  The Minister is making some strides, but, initially, the Commission adopted a broad brush approach.  The scheme was administratively simple and convenient but lacked focus as far as winter fatteners and beef finishers were concerned.  They have been the real losers in this crisis.</P>
    <P>Assistance will have to be targeted at heifer beef producers who are excluded under most EU income support schemes.  The Government should not be in a straitjacket, but afforded a certain degree of discretion in any regulations made by the Commission.  It is critical that every opportunity is taken <Col N="717" /> to convince Mr. Fischler and others to extend aid to these producers as well as bull beef producers in any compensation package agreed.</P>
    <P>The IFA livestock committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Raymond O'Malley, made a well prepared submission to the committee of which I am a member.  It based its calculations on the figures produced by Teagasc to compensate farmers for the losses incurred between January and mid-March, £71 per head, and between mid-March and early June, £138 per head.  I have had occasion in recent weeks to examine some farmers' books &mdash; I used to be their accountant &mdash; and it appears that on a 12 cwt. bullock farmers are losing approximately £120.  This has enormous implications for farmers in my constituency, some of whom indicated to me yesterday that they have abandoned their plans for the coming season.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Fitzgerald who represents County Meath, Deputy Gallagher who represents Laoighis-Offaly and Deputy Pattison who represents Carlow-Kilkenny, I represent a rural constituency &mdash; Westmeath.  What is worrying is that there has been a flight from the land, up to 6,500 farmers leave annually.  It has been estimated that by the year 2005 there will be only 30,000 full-time farmers.  This represents a huge reduction since I commenced my agricultural studies in 1974 and could have a devastating effect on rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In our policies we should focus on the retention of the maximum number on the land.  There is an old saying in County Westmeath that when the farmer has a few bob, he spends it.  This keeps many shops open.  He makes a major contribution at local level to churches and schools, thus contributing to rural regeneration, rather than degeneration.</P>
    <P>In recent months the 15,000-20,000 winter fatteners &mdash; there are 100,000 producers in total &mdash; have been suffering. As the scenario in the fall may be frightening, no effort should be spared in tackling the crisis head on.  The view <Col N="718" /> is that farmers will be compensated for the losses incurred, £71 per head up to mid-March and £138 per head up to mid-June, in the form of a beef finisher premium.  I can understand why that is the thrust of that policy line because it would incorporate many of the people who are suffering.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with an industry which has a total output of over £1.7 billion.  If the projected losses are correct, and I have no reason to doubt them having done some calculations at local level with County Westmeath farmers, we will be faced with losses of approximately £250 million to £260 million by the end of the year.  Given the average industrial wage of £15,000, one is talking about the equivalent of 17,500 jobs being taken out of the economy. That is the magnitude of what we are discussing.  It is not something of minor dimensions.</P>
    <P>We are the innocent victims of this BSE crisis.  We have just got over a couple of other crises in the past few months and export refunds had just come into play after a fairly significant reduction in November.  However, this crisis knocked many farmers for six across the country.</P>
    <P>Strenuous efforts must be made to ensure that the compensation package will be implemented on the basis of a direct payment system.  It is important to emphasise that we have seven million cattle while the UK has 11 million.  It should be possible to illustrate clearly to the Commission the vital importance of our industry and the just case we have for compensation.</P>
    <P>I support the point made earlier by Deputy Browne.  It is a cause of wonder and concern among the general public as to why, when farmers are losing £120 per head of cattle, this is not reflected in the shops.  I once did a study called market margins which showed this type of thing was prevalent in the sheep meat sector also.  Consumers react to prices and if the price of the product comes down in the shops it will boost consumer demand.  That is critically important for retail outlets. <Col N="719" /> Any claim that the Government, and the Labour Party in particular, is not committed to protecting the beef industry is simply not correct.  It is nothing more than empty political rhetoric and nonsense.  I depend on support from the farming population and I am glad to say that well over 20 per cent of my vote comes from farmers.</P>

      <P>Empty populist criticism does not address the issues which need to be addressed if we are to restore confidence in the beef industry.  I am disappointed that there is no media interest in this debate.  The press gallery is empty.</P>
      <P>We are in the midst of a crisis now but certain producers were suffering unsustainable losses even before the BSE crisis.  It comes down to the fact that when the CAP reforms were introduced they did not take adequate account of our unique system of cattle production whereby most cattle are not finished on the farms where they are born.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to put the Labour Party's position on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time that everybody, including those outside agriculture, realised that this is a crisis, but how can we tackle it?  In the short-term we must put a rescue operation in place. Many people do not like intervention but we have to find an outlet for a great number of cattle and a large amount of beef.  The introduction of intervention is vital in the short-term, although it is not a medium or long-term solution by any means.  Many people, including myself, do not like intervention but we need it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will face the autumn in a dreadful situation.  However, we do not want to face it in the way we faced the problem which began last October when export refunds were dramatically reduced. <Col N="720" /> Everybody knew that the New Zealanders and Australians undercut us in the North African market but we still did not get the message.</P>
    <P>In the medium term we must restore export refunds to their former position. They are still 0.5 per cent down on what they were.  We need the political will to reopen markets in Egypt and Libya. There is no use pussyfooting around, it must be done in the medium term to open that safety valve outlet for our live exports to the North African countries.</P>
    <P>In the longer term there is no point in me or other rural Deputies saying that we have the finest beef in the world because many people, including the young, do not believe it.  There is no use in saying that the scientific evidence is there because the fact is that we have an image problem.</P>
    <P>The sooner the better we get safety measures in place so that people realise beef is safe to eat.  The only way to do that is by having ante-and post-mortem testing.  The product will thus be labelled as safe in the same way as every other product is labelled.  In supermarkets, dairy products and other foodstuffs are labelled according to their ingredients and place of origin.  At the beef counter, however, you do not know what the source of the product is, even though it might be labelled &ldquo;prime beef&rdquo;.  What does prime beef mean?  It means a lot to us who know about it and who know the individual farmers.  In some cases we know the actual cattle that produced the beef, but the ordinary consumer does not trust it and they are walking away.</P>
    <P>We must implement measures that will be credible internationally.  Our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Cowen, has put forward proposals to do that.  Deputy Penrose mentioned quality marks similar to the industrial ISO system. We have to get to that level of sophistication because of the image involved.</P>
    <P>We are now told that Russia is our most important market, and so it is. However, the most sophisticated and remunerative market is at our doorstep <Col N="721" /> in the UK and in Continental Europe. How many people are marketing and selling Irish beef in the UK market, which is worth tens of millions of pounds?  We have only two people for the entire UK.  That does not make sense and the sooner that is addressed in a sensible and professional manner the better.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying that agriculture is our most important industry and that beef men are the cornerstone of it.  We know that, but we also know that when we pass fields of bullocks on our way home this evening, eight out of every ten animals has to find an export destination. If we are not serious about underpinning that and giving the procedures a chance, then there is an onus on the factories and the marketeers to ensure that profitable outlets are found.</P>
    <P>Even if we increase domestic consumption of beef by 100 or 200 per cent &mdash; which in itself would be desirable &mdash; we will still have the bulk of our beef, over 80 per cent, going abroad.  So, we need to look after those markets.  We must put in place a rescue operation; increase the export refunds for the export of live cattle to North African countries and put in place quality assurance measures in the medium and long-term. That has to be done immediately in a country where we have twice as many cattle as people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 May, Prime Minister Major announced in the House of Commons that without progress towards lifting the ban on the export of the British beef, Britain could not be expected to co-operate normally on other Community business.  He indicated that progress would not be possible in the intergovernmental conference or elsewhere until Britain had agreement on lifting the ban on beef derivatives &mdash; tallow, semen and gelatine &mdash; and a clear framework in place leading to lifting of the wider ban.  In the light of the Prime Minister's statement British Ministers and officials have blocked the adoption of measures and conclusions where unanimity is required in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>British action was taken in response to the failure of the Standing Veterinary Committee at its meeting on 20 May to give a positive opinion on Commission proposals to lift the ban on the export of derivatives.  The issue now goes to the Agriculture Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on Monday next.  If Agriculture Ministers fail to decide then it will fall to the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to lift the ban on the derivatives. <Col N="723" /> Ireland has supported and will continue to support the Commission's proposals on the derivatives.  Ireland has a major interest in the restoration of confidence in the beef industry within the Union.  We also have a vital interest in the restoration of confidence in European beef in third country markets.</P>
    <P>The strength of the European Union lies in its capacity to demonstrate solidarity and reach European solutions, even to apparently intractable problems. Confidence can be restored only if the member states act together showing solidarity with each other.  The solution to mutual concerns can be found only in common action and decisions on the basis of sound scientific advice.  This involves member states demonstrating, as Ireland has done, an understanding of British concerns, including the seriousness of the problem of BSE and its impact on British public opinion. Equally, the restoration of confidence involves an understanding by Britain of the legitimate concerns of partners.</P>
    <P>I regret the actions taken by the British Government.  They pose problems for the conduct of Union business.  It does not serve anyone's interest that the Union's freedom of action should be impaired.  For instance, it cannot be in anyone's interest that agreement be held up on measures designed to ensure the efficient operation of the Single Market from which all member states, not least Britain, have benefited.  Similar considerations apply in other areas such as development co-operation and EUROPOL.</P>
    <P>At present the problem of British non co-operation is one to be dealt with by the Italian Presidency.  I understand that Italy is in contact with Britain at the highest level to find a solution to the BSE problem and to urge a measured approach.  I support the Presidency in its efforts.  I also support the determined efforts being made by the European Commission to find a solution.</P>
    <P>I hope that a solution can be found at Union level to British concerns before Ireland assumes the Presidency.  It is too <Col N="724" /> early to say at this stage what the effect of continued UK non co-operation might be although I am sure that in any event our partners will want to continue to make progress on the Union agenda to defend the gains of European integration. Finally, it is worth recalling that all member states, including the UK, depend on an effectively functioning European Union.  It is in everyone's interest to avoid a spiral of actions and reactions which in some circumstances could have a very damaging effect on the operation of Union policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the so-called mad cow disease problem not only affects Britain but it is having a huge effect on our economy?  The beef industry is our largest industry. Will the Minister agree that the Government and all its agencies should make every effort to persuade the British to end its non co-operation with Europe and to assist hard pressed farmers in finding markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little to add to my formal reply.  One must accept this is a serious problem for the Irish economy which is evident from the debate.  It is a problem the Taoiseach, myself, other Government Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, our embassies abroad and the State agencies have set out to address in every fora to do everything possible to reinstate confidence in the Irish beef industry.  We will continue to do that and I know we have the support of every Member given the importance of the beef sector in the Irish economy.  It is a European problem which impacts severely on our economy and one which we want to bring to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  It is currently very much a problem for the Italian Presidency as we are now in the lead-up to the European summit in Florence.  I know from my brief discussion yesterday with the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Dini, that he intends to have discussions with his British counterpart. The new Italian Prime Minister has <Col N="725" /> been in contact with the British Prime Minister to see if a resolution can be found.  The meeting of the Agriculture Ministers on Monday next in Brussels will be an important one.  If the ban on derivatives can be lifted in the first instance, we can move on to finding an ultimate resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House the reason he has not visited any of the third countries with which we have markets in order to assist the beef industry?  The Minister will be aware that in third countries decisions are taken at a political level in relation to purchasing of products, particularly beef, and yet he has not visited any country as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Why has he been so negligent in relation to that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Burke's allegation that I have been negligent in my duties.  The Government has taken steps as appropriate in relation to this difficulty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister hopeful that the Italian Presidency will succeed in resolving the issue between the EU and Britain?  Has the Minister any assurances to that effect and what contingency plans has he laid against the possibility that we will have a non-functioning European Union when Ireland takes over the Presidency a few weeks from now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an indication of our thoughts on that matter when I replied formally to the question set down by Deputy Burke.  One has to appreciate the fact that the problem of BSE affects all member states of the European Union.  The resolution to the problem will be found only by a restoration of confidence in the beef industry <Col N="726" /> in the European Union and by all member states acting together and showing solidarity.  I said to Deputy Burke, in the formal reply and in the supplementary, that a number of weeks remain of the Italian Presidency.  I had discussions yesterday with the Italian Foreign Minister and I know that at highest level there have been discussions between the Italian Presidency of the European Union and the British Government.  We have to support those efforts.  The meeting of the Agricultural Council on Monday next will have a significant bearing on the seriousness of the problems facing the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>BSE will remain an issue during our Presidency.  It would be foolish to think otherwise, given the scale of the existing problem.  On assuming the Presidency, and indeed in preparing for it, we will analyse the issue in light of future developments, including for example the Agricultural Council meeting next Monday. We will work with our partners towards finding solutions to the problems posed by the BSE crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that one might usefully import a twin-track approach from other negotiations?  The Minister might, for instance, put the beef derivatives into a particular category. Will he agree there is a strong case to be made for making concessions to the United Kingdom, on some of the derivatives at any rate, in order to create some sense of momentum in that country and enable them to feel they are in a process which is resolving the issue, rather than coming up against a stone wall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, we have supported the proposal to lift the ban on the derivatives and we will continue to do so, based on the technical veterinary advice available to us.  If that happens next Monday, it will be a step in the right direction.  We can then have a discussion with the British Government at European level to work out a satisfactory timeframe for the resolution of the larger problem. <Col N="727" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>At the Western European Union ministerial council in Birmingham on 7 May, which I attended as an observer accompanied by the Minister for Defence, the Western European Union confirmed that the Western European Union observer countries &mdash; Ireland, Denmark, Austria, Finland and Sweden &mdash; have the possibility, on a case by case basis, to participate in the so-called Petersberg tasks.  Ireland had made known its interest in the possibility of taking part, on a case by case basis, in the humanitarian and rescue tasks and peacekeeping tasks under the Petersberg declaration.  At Birmingham, the Western European Union member states also explicitly recognised the traditionally active role played by the observer countries including Ireland, in the field of UN peacekeeping and the contribution that the observers could bring to Western European Union operations in the Petersberg framework.  These are welcome developments.  They are very much in line with the Government's position as set out in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on <Col N="728" /> Foreign Policy also sets out the reasons Ireland should consider participating in the co-operative framework of Partnership for Peace which was an initiative of President Clinton and launched in January 1994.  In his question Deputy Clohessy refers to the fact that nearly every state in Europe has joined Partnership for Peace.  The partnership now extends to 43 states: NATO members, Russia, former Soviet Republics, neutral states and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  With its widespread membership and inclusive approach, Partnership for Peace has already assumed an important role in European security co-operation, particularly in such areas as training for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, environmental protection and drugs interdiction &mdash; all areas of major interest to Ireland as a country with a highly respected tradition in peacekeeping and international co-operation.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 17 April, at which a useful discussion of Partnership for Peace took place.  I sense a growing acceptance and understanding of the reality that the partnership imposes no mutual defence commitments; has no implications for our policy of military neutrality and has nothing to do with NATO's policy of nuclear deterrence.  It is concerned rather with increasing co-operation to enhance peacekeeping and humanitarian capability involving virtually every state across the continent of Europe.  Far from marking a major change in our approach to security and defence issues, Partnership for Peace is consistent with Ireland's traditional support and encouragement for such inclusive security co-operation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is my intention that consultations between officials of my Department and NATO will shortly take place to explore further the benefits which Ireland could derive from Partnership for Peace.  As the White Paper makes clear, the Government decided that a decision on participation in the partnership will only be taken by <Col N="729" /> the Government in the light of consultations, including with the relevant committees of the Oireachtas, and such a decision will be subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The humanitarian and peacekeeping roles of the Western European Union are already examined on a case by case basis through our honourable tradition of humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management work with and at the request of the UN. The belief that this work and those tasks should continue represents common ground in this House although we disagree about the role of the Western European Union.</P>
      <P>The Petersberg tasks and their implementation involve the use of Western European Union member forces &mdash; not observer forces.  Will the Minister make clear his view in relation to the Western European Union and our position within it?  Will he confirm that we will remain as observers only and give us his view on the role of the Western European Union and the European Union and their amalgamation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke seems to have a particular problem with Western European Union or the Partnership for Peace.  I confirm that our position in relation to the Western European Union is consistent with that taken by the Fianna Fáil party in Government when it accepted observer status, without prior consultation with Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent statement by Deputy Ahern in Oxford on 10 May when he specifically welcomed the conclusions on possible participation by observers in the Petersberg tasks, as adopted in Birmingham.  He said that his party has no problem about Ireland's full involvement on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with the practical work of peacekeeping in Europe, co-ordinated by the Western European Union.  He said that Fianna <Col N="730" /> Fáil is anxious to participate fully in such tasks and to make its contribution. I welcome the clarity of that statement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is well aware that the Intergovernmental Conference will further consider the European Union's common foreign and security policy provisions as well as how best they can be developed to enhance the European Union's contribution to European and global peace and security, including through the EU-WEU relationship and the handling of the Petersberg task.  I have to make it clear that the decisions taken in Birmingham do not prejudice the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in so far as the EU-WEU relationship is concerned.  Those decisions are helpful in the Intergovernmental Conference context.  They leave open the possibility of the five EU non members of the Western European Union participating in the Petersberg tasks on a case by case basis.  As far as I am concerned, that is something that can be accepted by all parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said there is common ground between us in relation to the carrying out of peacekeeping and humanitatian tasks.  This is outlined not just in the Oxford speech, which was an update of our position following the Birmingham declaration, but also in the Fianna Fáil policy document on foreign affairs published last November.  We made it clear that examination and participation in humanitarian tasks would be on a case by case basis.  We strongly object to full membership and full involvement in the Western European Union.</P>
      <P>Does the approach to the Partnership for Peace and discussions with NATO represent Government policy?  It has implications for our neutrality, regardless of what the Tánaiste tries to tell this House.  Is the approach to the Partnership for Peace agreed Government policy and does it represent the policy of the three parties in Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Partnership for Peace has been established and is an important pan-European framework for inclusive co-operation on training for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.  The White Paper has set out clearly the reasons we should consider joining the Partnership for Peace and we have stated that a decision will be taken after consultations, which I have just elaborated to the Deputy.  The Deputy should reflect on the Partnership for Peace.  It is a co-operative security framework which does not entail membership of NATO and it is fully compatible with our policy of military neutrality.  Austria, Sweden, Finland and Malta have already joined as countries that remain outside military alliances.  Each state participating in the Partnership for Peace decides on the scope of its participation. It is a matter for us to decide what relationship we want to have. There are 43 countries, all members of the OSCE, participating in the Partnership for Peace.  European states not participating for obvious reasons include the former states of Yugoslavia, Cyprus which has a complication because of the <Col N="732" /> division of the island, and the war-torn former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. Ireland and Switzerland are also not participating.</P>
      <P>Recent media reports have suggested that Switzerland, which is not a member of either the UN or the EU, is considering joining.  Consideration of this is right and timely and the Dáil will be fully consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that statements from his colleagues in Government, Democratic Left, seem to question its affection for this policy to which he seems so closely aligned.  I wish to make it clear so far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned that joining the Partnership for Peace is not a matter for decision by this House but by the Irish people.  The people will make that decision if we are in Government. I suggest for geographical reasons, leaving aside all other reasons, that there will be no benefit to this country from joining the Partnership for Peace as distinct from the Finns and the Austrians. It is not an isolationist policy.  We want to participate in peacekeeping exercises and humanitarian aid exercises as we have done and as is our tradition, but there will be no benefit for the people by joining the Partnership for Peace or a second class membership of NATO who were struggling to find a role for themselves in the new world order.</P>

Deputy Burke is wavering between isolationism and insularity.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 12, 16, 23, 33, 41, 42, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that in my estimation the Duncan case has no implications whatever for the peace process or for wider Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
      <P>As regards the prospective talks, the Ground Rules for Substantive All-Party Negotiations, which were published by the Irish and British Governments on 16 April following consultation with the political parties, set out the best judgment of the two Governments on the most suitable and broadly acceptable ground rules for the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of the negotiations.  While they establish the basic parameters of the negotiations, and set out some fundamental principles which must be respected, the details of a number of important matters remain to be resolved, as is signalled in the Ground Rules themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the opening plenary session a comprehensive agenda for the negotiations will have to be agreed by the participants and other procedural questions resolved.  The manner and format in <Col N="736" /> which the International Body's proposals on decommissioning can be taken forward &mdash;&ldquo;without blocking the negotiations&rdquo;, as the British Prime Minister put it &mdash; has also to be agreed.  It is self-evident that the decommissioning question does not fit within any of the strands.  This alone would suggest that special arrangements should be put in place to deal with it.  How precisely this is to be done is a matter which remains under intensive consideration.  In addition, the chairing of the various elements of the negotiations, where an independent chairperson will be required, has to be decided.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have been working intensively together on these outstanding questions, with a view to preparing the ground for early decisions on them either before the negotiations or during the opening plenary session, as appropriate.  Following a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 22 May, the Secretary of State and I met informally in Dublin on 28 May and we plan to meet again on Tuesday next, 4 June, in London.  I hope Deputies will accept that it would not be appropriate for me to disclose at this stage the detail of our discussions, but I can assure the House that every effort is being made to ensure that all of the preparations necessary to promote comprehensive, inclusive and meaningful negotiations will have been completed by the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>While it is for the two Governments to offer co-ordinated leadership, the success of the negotiations will also depend on the determination of the parties to take part in the negotiations constructively and in good faith.  Discussions, consultations and contact with the parties on the negotiations in fact began last year, immediately after the issue of the November communiqué. These continue, at ministerial or official level, as convenient and appropriate.  In this process we have had meetings with all of the leading parties, with the exception of the Democratic Unionist Party. Most recently, the Government last <Col N="737" /> week had useful meetings with the SDLP and the Alliance Party.</P>
    <P>The Ground Rules state that the negotiations will involve the participation, in the appropriate strands, of representatives of both Governments and all those political parties operating in Northern Ireland which achieve representation through an elective process and which, as set out in the communiqué of 28 February 1996, establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Following the elections which are taking place in Northern Ireland today, the Secretary of State, after consultations with the Government, will formally invite all parties which meet the foregoing criteria to nominate their teams for the negotiations.  It seems probable that ten parties will secure representation through the elections.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to Sinn Féin was set out in the February 28 communiqué, repeated in the Ground Rules paper, and has been reiterated by the Taoiseach and myself, in this House and elsewhere, on numerous occasions. Both Governments hope that all political parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations.  Both Governments are also agreed that the resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that Sinn Féin has its own electoral mandate, which will presumably be confirmed in today's elections. It is also essential, both as a matter of principle and as a practical requirement for success in the negotiating process, that all the participants should show a common commitment to the purely peaceful and democratic resolution of the issue.  A continued IRA campaign of violence would inevitably undermine the credibility of any Sinn Féin commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge that it is for the IRA to decide whether to restore its ceasefire.  I very much hope they will do <Col N="738" /> so, and enable Sinn Féin to participate in the negotiations.  If the IRA fails to take the decision to restore the ceasefire and to allow Sinn Féin to participate in the negotiations, it will mean that the republican viewpoint will not be represented in the comprehensive round-table negotiations for which Sinn Féin have been calling since August 1994. This would plainly contradict the logic of Sinn Féin's own political analysis.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations, the Government's approach will be based on the Framework Document.  While it is intended as an aid to negotiations and not as a rigid blueprint to be imposed, both Governments have stated that it sets out a realistic, balanced and achievable framework for agreement.</P>
    <P>I share the view that it is essential that an ultimate agreement arising out of the negotiations is not dominated by one side or another.  I have said frequently that a solution will never be found in terms of victory or defeat.  Clearly, all of the institutional arrangements to be negotiated will require careful balance and appropriate safeguards.  The negotiations will operate on the basis of consensus, and will proceed on the principle that nothing will be finally agreed in any strand until everything is agreed in the negotiations as a whole.  Perhaps most important of all, the outcome of the negotiations will be submitted for public approval by referendums, North and South, before being submitted to the Oireachtas and the Houses of Parliament for ratification and the earliest possible implementation.  Therefore majorities in both parts of the island will have to support the settlement which has been negotiated.</P>
    <P>No timeframe has been set for the negotiations, although the British elections legislation provides that the forum will cease to sit at the end of May 1997, with the possibility of an extension until not later than May 1998.  As the Taoiseach indicated in the House on 21 May, &ldquo;it might be useful if all the participants could agree a tighter timeframe on an <Col N="739" /> indicative basis&rdquo;.  Following the conclusion of the negotiations, the referendum to be held in this jurisdiction would be organised as quickly as the legislative and practical requirements would permit.</P>
    <P>The Government is prepared to make arrangements for the regular confidential briefing of the Opposition parties during the negotiations and I would invite the relevant spokespersons to discuss the matter in detail with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his final remarks and I will follow up the matter with him.  In the context of the Taoiseach's reply to my party leader on Tuesday, it is important he envisages that, with a renewed IRA ceasefire, the forum will continue its work, providing an opportunity for formal and informal talks between parties and with parties from the Northern forum.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the peace process and, in particular, Anglo-Irish relations have not been damaged by the Government Press Secretary's briefing the weekend after the collapse of the Duncan extradition case which implied that the fault lay on the British rather than the Irish side?  Despite the fact that the matter was discussed in the House of Lords on 2 May and received wide publicity on Sky television and in British print media, this impression was allowed continue for six weeks.  Does the Minister expect us to believe the mishandling of the Duncan extradition case did not damage Anglo-Irish relations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke can believe what he wishes and form his opinions on the basis of information available to him.  I can only inform him of my experiences in recent weeks.  I attended a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, co-chaired by the Secretary of State, and had an opportunity to meet him in my Department last Tuesday. The matter was not referred to at either meeting in that context.  I am sure <Col N="740" /> Deputy Burke is aware from his experience in the Department of Justice that 99 per cent of extradition cases are not debated in the public arena and there were difficulties about an extradition case when he was on this side of the House.  The current case has been well aired and replied to in detail by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice. As I stated in my reply, this case has not damaged Anglo-Irish relations and will not deter either Government in their pursuit of what we want to achieve in the all-party talks commencing on 10 June.</P>

      <P>Did the Department of Foreign Affairs arrange for personnel from the Irish Embassy in London or elsewhere to attend the House of Lords debate on this issue in Westminster?  Was that Department briefed immediately or did it inquire in Dublin as to the state of affairs of this controversy?  While I acknowledge the Minister said the Secretary of State did not mention this case to him at the two meetings, did his Department receive representations at any stage from the <Col N="741" /> British side on the matter?  Did his Department seek an explanation or briefing from the Garda, the Department of Justice or the Attorney General's office about the true position or are we expected to believe that personnel in Iveagh House, like in all other Departments, simply saw no evil, heard no evil and kept their heads down for the six week period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have details of who attended the debate in the House of Lords but, if the Deputy wishes, I will furnish them to him.  When debates on Irish matters are discussed in the House of Lords or House of Commons it is normal practice for representatives of the Irish Embassy to attend.  Deputy McDowell does not have experience of Government.  He was not a Member of the House when his party was in partnership with Fianna Fáil in Government. If he had that experience he would know that Ministers have line responsibilities and it is important that they are allowed carry out their functions. That is the way Government should operate.</P>

      <P>I had intended to reply to that aspect of Deputy McDowell's three -pronged question.  To the best of my knowledge, representations were not received on the matter.

      <P>The Minister's lack of curiosity on this extradition case beggars belief.  Be that as it may, I accept what he told the House but, again, it is a case of failure to act.  His line responsibility lies with Anglo-Irish relations. There would have been a person from the Irish Embassy in the House of Lords during that debate and the matter would have been followed up by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Department of Justice to know what was going on.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the ground rules document was published in April, following the original statement of 28 February, and I accept that discussions are ongoing at present.  It would have been much better for all concerned if the questions of venue, agenda, chairman of the various strands and so on were handled well in advance of the commencement of the election process rather than afterwards.  The talks are due to commence in ten days, but a venue has not been arranged for the forum on which people are voting today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The venue for the forum is a matter for the British Government and I am sure they will provide one.  As the Deputy was involved in the 1991-92 talks, he will realise that crucial issues are invariably settled towards the end of negotiations.  The elections are taking place today.  The process is well in hand and in a state of preparedness for 10 June.</P>

      <P>Senator Mitchell's knowledge and acceptability on this matter are well known.  Will the Minister assure the House that Senator Mitchell and the American administration will play a major role in the talks process on 10 June?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mitchell will not represent the American administration, but he will play an important role.  On <Col N="743" /> many occasions I have been loud in my praise of Senator Mitchell and his colleagues in preparing the decommissioning report, which will play a central part in the negotiations that will start on Monday week.  Senator Mitchell will play a very important role in that regard and I have absolute confidence that he will carry out that role as he has done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind it will be two years tomorrow since the Minister assured me that nobody could participate in the forum in Dublin Castle unless they had disarmed completely, even allowing that he will be slightly more flexible in reply to this question, does the Government consider it adequate that the participants merely commit themselves to consider the issue of disarmament in the context of all-party talks, or is it the Government's position that, in addition to considering the issue they must also, at some stage during the process, engage in some level of disarmament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell must accept that when I answered questions almost two years ago nobody would have believed a ceasefire was possible in Northern Ireland &mdash; the Deputy certainly would not have believed it &mdash; but that did happen through a great deal of hard work.  The Taoiseach dealt in detail with the question of decommissioning on Tuesday last and we are <i>ad idem</i> on that issue.  Differences have existed between the Governments and the various parties in regard to decommissioning, which is a central question. We have made it very clear from the start that we want weapons out of Irish politics, North and South, but people have missed the fact that decommissioning must take place on the Loyalist as well as the Republican side.  If we adhere to and strictly follow the Mitchell report, we will find a solution. Nobody has said that the Mitchell report is not the solution. <Col N="744" /> The key to the solution is to set up a fourth strand or a sub-committee on decommissioning to consider it while the substantive political negotiations are taking place.  At the end of the day it is quite simple: on the one hand substantial political progress would be made in meaningful negotiations, on the other there would be a commitment to the Mitchell principles and the sub-committee on decommissioning would get down to the nitty-gritty of decommissioning, the modalities, verification and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House fully supports that approach.  As a party we accepted the Mitchell report in advance of its publication because we believed it was important that Mitchell be given support in preparing the report and that all sides should sign up for it. The tragedy is that all sides, including the British Government, did not sign up for it at an early stage, but better late than never.  I trust that the aim of everybody in this House is to ensure that the bomb and the bullet is taken out of Irish politics for good, and the Mitchell report has a key role in that regard,</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Government considers the Framework Document as central to the solution while recognising that domination should play no part in the solution and that there must be safeguards. There is no question of domination in the Framework Document and it provides for many safeguards.  Will the Minister confirm that both Governments will submit the Framework Document to the agenda of the talks on the first day?</P>

      <P>The Framework Document has been agreed between the Governments.  In regard to the plenary session of the talks, we have to agree the agenda.

      <P>It is important that the Government brings forward the Framework Document, which is central to a solution.  The British Government and the Taoiseach do not seem to have the same commitment to this matter as the Minister.  We take it the Framework Document will be on the agenda on the first day.  In regard to the three strands, I welcome the commitment that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. That was the basis of the talks in 1991 when I was involved in them.  Is it still the view of the British Government and the participants in the talks that nothing can be agreed until everything is agreed, in other words, that an internal solution will not be acceptable?</P>

      <P>Given the interwoven and complex nature of the Northern Ireland problems that must be addressed in the three strands and the sub-committee on decommissioning, if that is agreed, it would be virtually impossible &mdash; I think no party would accept it &mdash; to have a formulation other than nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  To the best of my knowledge &mdash; I am slow to speak for the various parties who will participate in the negotiations; they will have to speak for themselves during the plenary session &mdash; all parties accept the reality of that statement.  It is the only way to proceed in the negotiations and I am sure it will be adhered to by all.</P>

      <P>The question of a timeframe was referred to by the Minister. Will he elaborate on his thinking in that regard?  Does he envisage a timeframe of six months or nine months?  The crucial questions that must be dealt with are cross-Border relationships, relationships between Nationalists and Unionists within the North, the executive powers and the contents of the Framework Document.  There are two principal questions to be dealt with and if there is agreement in principle on those the rest will fall into place very quickly.</P>

      <P>I would be slow to put a limited time frame on the negotiations. The Deputy will be aware from experience of the 1991-92 negotiations that they were open-ended.  One would have a much clearer picture within, perhaps, two months of opening negotiations as to the amount of work that can be undertaken and how fast it can be accomplished.  It will take a considerable period of time to establish trust between the parties on the basis that there will be meaningful negotiations and that all parties want to find a solution. The various parties can then consider a timeframe.  I would like to see the work done at the earliest possible time.  All the research has been done and the facts established.  We need now to get the parties to sit across the table to overcome the distrust and bitterness that have existed in Northern Ireland politics for many years and see if we can work together.</P>

      <P>It is my party's wish that there will be a large turnout in the Northern elections, that the results will reflect the views of the people and that strong teams with proper mandates will be elected.  We also hope that between now and 10 June the ceasefire will be restored so that Sinn Féin can take its place at the negotiating table.  As the <Col N="747" /> Taoiseach says, if it is part of the problem then it must be part of the solution. The same applies to the loyalist parties. We hope the all-party talks will provide a solution so that all people can live in peace on this island and there will be peace between the two islands.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's remarks which probably reflect the views of all sensible people.  We want inclusive all-party talks and we have made it very clear that for Sinn Féin to be at the talks the ceasefire must be restored.  Without the restoration of the ceasefire it is unlikely that other parties will engage in the difficult question of the decommissioning of arms.  It is very important for Sinn Féin to be at the talks on 10 June.  We want to have comprehensive all-party negotiations in which all strands of opinion from the Nationalist-republican and Unionist-loyalist sides are represented at the table.  I hope anyone who can influence those decisions between now and 10 June will do so in order that we can set about solving this crucial problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can deal only with the realities as they confront us.  If a ceasefire is declared within the next few days I sincerely hope there will be no other action which would undermine what we are trying to achieve.  I think Deputy McDaid shares that view.  The position of both Governments on how parties qualify for inclusion in the talks has been made very clear.  We want all parties to be at the table.  Regardless of the debate taking place within Sinn Féin or the IRA, it is in everyone's interest that no spectacular incident takes place between now and 10 June, so that <Col N="748" /> people can come to the table.  Already people who have been involved in violence on both sides have difficulty in coming to the table and we must overcome that without any further difficulties.</P>

Some of the other questions deal with separate issues and I would like the Minister to give me straight answers to them.  The Minister said there must be a restoration of the ceasefire if Sinn Féin is to participate in the all-party talks.  He did not give me an answer to my Question No. 16 which asks him if he holds Sinn Féin responsible for the actions of the IRA.  Will he give me straight answers to Questions Nos. 41 and 47 which ask him if the IRA is ultimately responsible for its actions and to Question No. 50 which asks him the parties with whom he has had consultation or dialogue in order to do preparatory work for the all-party talks?

      <P>On the question about Sinn Féin and the IRA, I will outline the position of this Government and previous Governments which included Deputy Callely's party.  Successive Governments have operated on the practical assumption that Sinn Féin and the IRA are closely interrelated in terms of ideology, strategy and, to some extent, personnel.  The opening of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin and its inclusion in the forum came as a consequence of the 1994 ceasefire.  While there are distinctions to be made, it is realistic to regard them as broadly part of the same movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from his reply the Minister holds Sinn Féin responsible for IRA actions.  Last week in reply to a question from me the Taoiseach clearly indicated the IRA is solely and ultimately responsible for its actions.  The Minister referred to previous Governments. In fairness to them, previous Governments achieved much, for example, the cessation of violence in August 1994 and the signing of the joint declaration.  I do not want to borrow the phrase &ldquo;not worth a penny candle&rdquo; but everyone is aware of the importance of having Sinn Féin at the all-party talks, If the negotiations are to be conclusive in terms of developing the peace process it is important that all parties are at the table.  The Minister and Taoiseach are singing from the same hymn sheet in terms of the importance of having Sinn Féin at the all-party talks but it does not add up if the Minister holds Sinn Féin responsible for the actions of another group and the Taoiseach believes the IRA is ultimately responsible for its actions.  I would like the Minister to clarify the matter for me.  Maybe I am missing something.</P>

      <QRef>[9623/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 40 together.  I also refer <Col N="751" /> to my reply on 25 April 1995 to Question No. 28 from Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>Since I gave that reply there have been a number of further constructive contributions to the debate on the parades issue which I welcome.  The proposal made by the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Robin Eames, that a body be established to advise on the routing of parades in Northern Ireland deserves serious consideration in the context of this debate and I particularly welcome it.  Similar proposals have also been made by other respected commentators. Clearly these are an important contribution to the dialogue which is essential if the difficulties surrounding the marching season are to be resolved.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated before, the Government's policy is that those who wish to celebrate their identity and heritage by marching should exercise that right with due respect for the principle that parades should not take place in an area or along a route where they are not welcome.  We have also consistently emphasised the need to address the issue of parades in all its dimensions &mdash; political, social, cultural and public order.</P>
      <P>We stand ready to contribute to further discussion of the proposal for an independent tribunal or other body to consider the parades question.  It has been observed many times that the problems created by the marching season are themselves a reflection of the wider political division between the communities in Northern Ireland and have an impact beyond the local area where difficulties occur.  An independent body or some general agreement on the issue would therefore be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is unlikely that an agreed proposal for an independent body could be implemented in time to influence parades scheduled for this year.  I raised our concerns about the current marching season with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 22 May 1996.  On a number of occasions <Col N="752" /> already this year the RUC has given early notice of its decisions on particular march routes.  I welcome this approach, which I believe allows time for mediation and dialogue to develop.  I hope that it will continue to be followed throughout the marching season.</P>
    <P>It is important that the principle which I have outlined should be respected even where large numbers are involved in a proposed march.  I would add that, where a parade is routed through an area where it is not welcome, this in itself deepens community division, even where there is no actual disorder, and postpones a resolution of the fundamental issues surrounding the parades issue.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the conference called on all those involved in the planning of parades this year to exercise compromise and balance in the interests of the community as a whole and encouraged agreements between all concerned.  I note in particular the heavy responsibility bearing on those who are involved in the organisation of parades during the rest of the marching season, particularly at a time when all-party negotiations will be under way.  I hope that Archbishop Eames's recent call on these leaders to show charity, understanding and good example will be heeded in the months ahead, and that they will avoid the predictable confrontations which reflect so poorly on the public image of the organisations involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Tánaiste did not discuss the marching season only at his most recent meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 22 May but that this perennial subject has remained on the agenda of the Anglo Irish Conference since last year and on every agenda at some stage.  Did he specifically put to the Secretary of State the suggestion of Archbishop Eames?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my recollection, the matter of parades has been discussed at every Intergovernmental <Col N="753" /> Conference, certainly in recent years and possibly since 1985.  Within the Intergovernmental Conference we raised specific suggestions.  There are other suggestions in relation to the establishment of a commission or body to advise and direct the relevant authorities in relation to parades, to which we shall revert in our future discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully, since we are about to embark on all-inclusive talks, including representation by Sinn Féin, on 10 June, will the Tánaiste say whether there have been informal contacts between the authorities &mdash; recognising that the timeframe would not permit the establishment of such a body in a formal way &mdash; in an endeavour to defuse the atmosphere in advance of any flashpoint incidents during the talks process?  Does he agree the talks process itself will be sufficiently sensitive without the added burden of a flashpoint incident, similar to that which has occurred every year and the major one we witnessed last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that, with talks in progress, this issue will become more sensitive than it has been and, of its very nature, it is a very sensitive one. From our discussions with the British Government, and others they would have had with their security forces, we know they would want the matter treated in a very sensitive manner.  It is very important that there be forward planning in relation to these parades, where advance notice is given, so that problems can be signalled and mediation can take place between the organisers and the community.  Whenever that has taken place it has been quite successful.  Not all circumstances have been dealt with but, as far as we are concerned, these marches will be dealt with in a sensitive manner.  Since negotiations will be taking place, we hope no difficulties will be encountered in the forthcoming marching season.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is difficult to guarantee this but everything will be <Col N="754" /> done by the RUC, the various organisers and the communities who are disrupted by these parades to ensure peaceful co-operation between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While wholly welcoming and commending Archbishop Eames's suggestion, I might point out that many of these parades go to churches and that the church authorities themselves have a slightly more direct role in many of these matters since they are the hosts in such places.  I asked the Taoiseach some time ago whether he would communicate to the church authorities that if they are engaging in practical Christianity they should take an active role in ensuring that parades which end up in their churches do not exacerbate inter-communal strife en route.  I might add that the great majority of churchmen take on board what I am saying, but regrettably some have exacerbated the atmosphere rather than the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious proposal has been put forward by Archbishop Robin Eames warranting serious consideration. I am sure the spirit in which it was put forward will be acknowledged by churchmen of all persuasions in relation to the marches and the difficulties to which they give rise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that this subject must be dealt with in the course of any talks if we want to revert to normality?  Would he also agree that economic development, funding and so on have reached an impasse?  Funding has been available over some 18 months but there is no evidence of any projects on the ground. Does he agree there is need for somebody to take the issue by the scruff of the neck and demonstrate an intention to make progress?  People must be persuaded to apply themselves to that type of work, with the necessary leadership which has not yet been forthcoming. Following the initial all-inclusive talks, will his Department apply its attention to that matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely important that structures be established to facilitate joint actions, where necessary, but also with regard to parades, the subject with which we are now dealing.  It is well known that many thousands of parades take place in a totally friendly, uneventful way but, unfortunately there are flash points which arise from inter-communal strife.  I take it the Deputy is advocating that there should be structures in place so that negotiations and mediation can take place and that we respect the divergent rights of people who want to march and of others who do not want marches going through their localities.  It is a difficult task but, along the lines advocated by Archbishop Eames, we can take steps in the right direction by establishing a commission or other body to examine all these matters.</P>

      <P>Where else in the world are there applications submitted for 3,000 to 4,000 marches within a three-month period every year?  Can anything be done through the RUC to limit this ridiculous number of marches?  While the vast majority pass off peacefully, many remain antagonistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of conflicting rights.  We are fighting for rights on behalf of the community generally. Where people want the right to march, they should have it but, as I said in my reply, it is important that they also respect the rights of others, of residents and communities, who do not particularly subscribe to the tradition to which the marchers themselves subscribe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste laid great store on the suggestion that there should be no domination in relation to the outcome of the talks process.  Would he not agree that many of these marches &mdash; even those that do not include flash-points &mdash; are a demonstration of domination and accepted as such by those meant to receive the message of the march?  Will the Minister, through the talks process, encourage a reduction of <Col N="756" /> the charade that takes place annually in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Therein lies the problem. I have a better understanding of the symbolism of parades having watched Frank McGuinness's &ldquo;The Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&rdquo;. In calling the parades a charade the Deputy is denigrating the traditions of one side of the community.  That is my view.  We must respect their traditions. We are trying to win mutual respect for the traditions of both communities. There are displays of cultural identity on the Nationalist side to which the Unionists do not subscribe.  We must establish mutual respect across communities in Northern Ireland if we are to achieve the objectives all Members want to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House earlier this week in reply to written Question No. 57 on 28 May 1996, the Government continues to be very concerned at the deplorable human rights situation which has obtained in Burma since the assumption of power by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, in 1988.  The recent Pilger report on Channel 4 and the detention of an estimated 240 of the successful candidates in the democratic elections in 1990 and a number of their supporters in advance of the Congress of the National League for Democracy at the beginning of this week leave no room for any doubt about the repressive nature of the SLORC regime.</P>
      <P>On Monday last I issued a statement, on behalf of the Government, appealing to the SLORC to release all those who had been detained, to allow the democratic opposition to operate without hindrance, and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.  I also emphasised the need for a genuine dialogue to commence without delay between SLORC and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy as being the only possible credible way forward from the present impasse.</P>
      <P>The Government has pursued the matter of the human rights situation in Burma both within the European Union and at the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Developments in Burma are followed very closely within the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU and action taken accordingly.  Since 1988 the EU has suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burma, including the discontinuation or limitation of aid through UN agencies. A policy of international isolation has been applied strictly, blocking even World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank Funds for projects in or loans to Burma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1995, on the occasion of <Col N="758" /> the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok, to which SLORC leaders had been invited, the European Union issued a statement which, while welcoming the release of opposition leader and Nobel Prize Laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, urged SLORC to start a true and meaningful dialogue with the opposition.</P>
    <P>At United Nations level Ireland has taken an active role in co-sponsoring resolutions on the human rights situation in Burma, both at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights, UNCHR.  On 24 April 1996, the UNCHR adopted a resolution, co-sponsored by Ireland, which deplored the continuing serious violations of human rights in Burma and the fact that many political leaders, including leaders and elected representatives of the National League for Democracy, are being deprived of their freedom and their fundamental rights. The resolution also called on the Government of Burma to take all necessary measures to establish a democratic state in full accordance with the will of the people, as expressed in the democratic elections held in 1990.  At the UNCHR, the EU urged the SLORC to release immediately and unconditionally all detained political leaders and political and ethnic groups and the establishment of multi-party democracy.</P>
    <P>Ireland, during its forthcoming EU Presidency will seek to advance the process of democratisation and respect for human rights in Burma, and, to this end, will consider the development of a progressive critical dialogue with this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the most disturbing features concerning the recent publicity about the abuse of human rights in Burma, Myanmar, is the use of slave labour by the SLORC army and the use of children to construct a railway?  In that context, will he use his good offices with the French Government to exercise some influence over the Total oil company, on behalf of which and for whose purposes this railway is being built using <Col N="759" /> child slave labour in the most horrific circumstances?  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, might be able to assist the Minister in getting the message across to France that its company, Total, is having a railway constructed in Burma by children aged eight to 12, many of whom die in the course of its constructing and many of whose parents are shot for failing to work quickly enough on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the revelations on the Channel 4 programme by John Pilger, who has done tremendous work in exposing the type of activity taking place in Burma.  This matter will be raised at the next General Affairs Council meeting.  I would have no hesitation in having discussions with my French colleague, as suggested by Deputy McDowell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the protestations of the EU at the ASEAN Summit meeting and elsewhere would have far greater meaning and credibility if when protesting about human rights incidents, such as the constructions of this railway for the Total oil company, some member states of the EU which compete to sell arms did not proceed to sell them to that regime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the views the Government has and will continue to express with our European Union colleagues on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had any success?  It is not sufficient merely to have good intentions in regard to this matter and to express them in this House.  Can the Minister give examples of occasions he raised these issues at Foreign Affairs Council meetings and where he strongly made those views, concerning the behaviour of fellow member states of the EU, known to them?  In many cases the equivalent of semi-State bodies are selling arms to <Col N="760" /> that regime which is building that railway with child labour.  It is all very well to utter protestations and to express a stated view in the House, but what is being done about this abuse of human rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government makes its views known at General Affairs Council meetings.  Our position on the sale and transfer of arms is very clear and consistent with the position taken by previous Governments and we will continue to hold that position.  The Deputy is seeking examples, but the question of success or failure in this regard is a matter of measurement.  We will continue to put forward our views in terms of the formulation of EU Common Foreign and Security Policy on disarmament, sale of arms and otherwise in the hope that eventually our European Union partners will realise that in the long-term the Union must adopt a common policy which will prohibit the sale of arms, particularly to such countries and regimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister said, it sounded good and I am not saying he is not committed to addressing this issue.  The French are building a railway and the British Embassy is actively helping British businessmen to trade in Burma.  As my colleague Deputy Burke said, well meaning motions are passed at various committees, but the reality is that this issue is not being addressed.  In a recent interview Aung San Suu Kyi said the will of the people and world opinion will bring about democracy in Burma.  Real pressure must be brought to bear on the Burmese Government.  How can real pressure that will have bite be exerted on the regime in Burma?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a new awareness of the situation in Burma following the Pilger documentary and, in fairness, Deputy Harney tabled the first question on this matter for written reply <Col N="761" /> a number of days ago, to which I responded.</P>

All political parties must work together in expressing opinions at various fora on which we have representation, be it at the Council of Europe or the United Nations, and the Government is highlighting the issue through the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste concerned about how ineffective the United Nations has become in the eyes of the world, and about the lack of respect and hope in so many states about the performance of the United Nations in Rwanda, Somalia, etc.?  There is widespread concern about the direction in which the UN is going, given the genocide and atrocities in Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, etc.  We are very proud of the contribution our Defence Forces have made abroad, but there is genuine concern throughout the world that a body such as the United Nations which was always held in such high regard is becoming totally ineffective. Could the Tánaiste indicate whether he has any proposals or has articulated any views at the United Nations or at any other level about arresting this situation so that the hope people had in the United Nations can be re-established as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's frustration about the activities of the United Nations.  On many occasions in this House we have discussed the role of and the success or otherwise of the United Nations.  Little <Col N="762" /> attention is given to its successful missions; we always hear about its failures. The Deputy is probably aware the United Nations is effectively a bankrupt organisation because of the failure of a number of sovereign states to pay their contributions.  I have raised my concern about that at a number of private meetings with the Secretary General of the United Nations.  I have also spoken about it at the General Assembly during the last three years.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is also aware that a major debate is taking place within the United Nations on the reform of the United Nations, the reform of the Security Council, the reform of the General Assembly and the relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council, and we are contributing to that debate.  It is a very serious problem facing the United Nations.  I also believe the UN has been &ldquo;tasked&rdquo; far beyond its capacity from peace-keeping and peace-making, to humanitarian tasks and other roles it is playing in the context of children and refugees. We have seen that in many of the various theatres of the world in the past few years.  As the Deputy has rightly said, we have a very proud record of serving and contributing to the United Nations.  We are one of the countries that always pays its contributions on time every year.  Successive Governments have insisted and ensured that we have done so.  We will continue to do so. I firmly believe in the UN but we must be careful to have an organisation that is capable, that has the capacity and the resources.  That involves both personnel and financial resources to carry out the tasks which we commission.</P>

      <P>Is there any forum within the United Nations that makes decision-makers accountable for their mistakes?  Major mistakes have been made in the past 18 months which I do not have time to go into now.  Here a Garda sergeant was removed from his position because he copied the wrong document or disposed of a document that he should have retained.  Is there <Col N="763" /> any forum within the United Nations where glaring mistakes can be dealt with?  Will the Tánaiste indicate if there is any mechanism whereby these people are accountable to somebody because at the moment it seems they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite happy for the Deputy to supply me with details of the cases to which he is referring.  I am aware the Carlton Group is currently looking at the question of accountability within the United Nations.  It is obviously a huge organisation. Peace-keeping is only one aspect of its work, that with which we are most familiar in Ireland for obvious reasons. Part of the whole question of reform of the organisation is to ensure that there is maximum accountability.  Also, one has to attempt to have some understanding of the scale of the missions and the difficult tasks which have been given to the United Nations and which will continue.  The Deputy mentioned the situations in Rwanda and elsewhere. These involve difficult and complex missions. Traditionally the United Nations was best where it was invited in by various Governments as peace-keeper.  In more recent years it has had other missions. The mandates have not been exactly clear, and in the confusion there have been some difficulties and some failures but, overall, the United Nations has been successful since its foundation.</P>

      <P>The real test of any Minister is whether he knows what to do in a crisis.  Thanks to the MacSharry CAP reform package negotiated by his predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh, which ensured rising income subsidies up until now, and the Structural Fund measures that were part of the National Development Plan, such as REPS, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry would agree that he had an easy run until now.  It was not difficult for <Col N="827" /> him to look good.  He faces a real test now, whether he can steer Irish agriculture, or certainly the beef industry, past potential disaster.  Needless to say the Opposition wants him to succeed in that.</P>
      <P>The country owes a considerable debt of gratitude to former Minister, Senator Michael O'Kennedy, who took the necessary action, and provided Ireland with one of the toughest regimes in Europe to counter BSE.  It is standing to us today.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh, with the help of other Government colleagues, also managed to reopen most of the Middle East beef markets that were closed in the early 1990s because of a previous BSE scare.  Ireland was then placed in a reasonably strong position to face the renewed crisis in the beef industry all over Europe, following disastrously illjudged British ministerial statements in the House of Commons about possible links between BSE and CJD.</P>
      <P>Initially, there was little panic here. Inside Europe, Irish beef was not linked to any ban applied to British beef. Prices were surprisingly well maintained in the markets.  The drop in domestic consumption after the initial shock was not too severe.  I regret that the situation has deteriorated, especially in recent weeks.  We have been calling constantly for a debate on the beef industry and I am glad the Minister has acceeded to the persistent requests of my colleague, Deputy Cowen, but we should not have had to wait all these weeks for this less than a day long debate.  With the number of speakers offering we could have kept the debate going for a week. Instead we have had to share time and allow only a handful to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Yates, made a couple of exceptionally foolish statements which completely undermined market confidence in beef and caused prices to tumble.  He suggested that three million totally healthy cattle in the EU might have to be slaughtered for purely economic reasons, raising memories of the economic war.  A short time <Col N="828" /> later, he suggested that in 20 or 30 years time half of the country would be under trees, something not even the chairman of Coillte is predicting in his long-term forecast.  I was appalled to hear the Minister this morning decribe beef as &ldquo;a devalued product&rdquo;.  As a result of this, and also the failure to win the Libyan cattle deal which went to Australia because of the lack of a hands-on approach by the Minister and the Government, confidence has faltered, and prices of many categories of cattle fell seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have travelled to Libya and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should have gone to Iran.  This Government, unlike its Fianna Fáil predecessors, has not properly cultivated relations with the Middle East and we are paying for it.  The deputy president of the IFA rightly described the lack of solid action by the Government as pathetic.  Even in the dispute involving the renderers, the Minister, after giving some token assistance, became totally defensive about further aid, instead of trying positively to broker a deal.</P>
    <P>We saw the same lack of negotiating skill in relation to reducing EU fines, where the Minister succeeded, like many of his Government colleagues, in annoying the EU Commission, and had to have his irons pulled out of the fire by Commissioner Padraig Flynn.  I read in <i>The Times</i> of 22 May where Spain managed to get a special waiver of a £230 million fine for breaches of the Common Agricultural Policy, as a way of giving drought relief.  Could the Minister not try to negotiate with the EU similar aid for our beef farmers in lieu of fines due to be paid to Brussels?  Our spokesperson.  Deputy Cowen, rightly raised the question of looking again at GATT provisions in the present exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>In Britain the foolish statements of Ministers undermined at a stroke not just confidence in British beef but to a lesser extent in the entire beef market <Col N="829" /> throughout the Union and in third country markets.  I regret that recent defeatist statements by our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had the effect of undermining confidence at home.  It suggested that the problem is getting on top of him, instead of him getting on top of the problem.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time we have faced difficulties in farming.  Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture such as Ray MacSharry, in the wet summer of 1980, took a hands-on approach which went all out to cushion the effects of adverse circumstances.  In the 1987-88 period, after some years of stagnation, Fianna Fáil's active approach to the beef industry on return to Government generated such confidence that cattle prices reached their highest levels ever of 119p to 120p per pound, in the autumn of 1988.  They are down to 88p to 90p today.  We need vigorous ministerial activism, instead of the doleful face and wringing of hands that seems to be the characteristic reaction of all too many Fine Gael Agriculture Ministers whenever they have to tackle real problems.</P>
    <P>The cattle industry is our largest agricultural sector.  It underpins the entire rural economy.  We are talking about a £1 billion export industry.  Extra aid can be channelled through the special beef premium and headage schemes, and that would provide some immediate assistance.  If outstanding unpaid EU fines could be waived, as in the Spanish case, and put towards assisting farmers, that would also help.  We need a much more high-powered marketing campaign to boost domestic beef consumption. It would be the patriotic duty of every family that has been in the habit of eating Irish beef or processed meats made from Irish beef to continue doing so, without fear of any risk to health and I appeal to them to do so.  If we are not willing to protect our own industries, what can we expect?</P>
    <P>We also need to undertake far more intensive efforts to market Irish beef in Britain, in Europe and in third countries. Looked at in the medium to long term there should be positive market <Col N="830" /> opportunities for Irish beef, and we should always be on the look-out for those opportunities.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis has huge political dimensions.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I am sorry to say, has taken absolutely no interest in the plight of Northern Ireland farmers, who have been cut off from their markets.  Northern Ireland farmers are paying a dear price for an approach that subordinates their interests to those of the UK as a whole.  In fact, it would not be too much to say that Northern Ireland farmers are at present being sacrificed on the altar of the Union.  They are not being helped, and no case is being made for special treatment, because allegedly it would not be in the interests of English farmers.  From the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which founded Northern Ireland, down to the Framework Document of 1995, the British Government has always recognised that ideally animal and plant health policy should be conducted on an all-Ireland basis.  It would of course mean that there could be no cattle imports from Britain for the time being.  But there is very little such traffic anyway, I suspect.</P>
    <P>While I do not question the necessity to close off the Border and police it rigorously under present conditions, has the Minister held any discussions with the Northern authorities or with Northern farm organisations to see if we could help establish a joint approach?  It would be very helpful if the Minister could outline this in his reply.  It is surely the case that one possible avenue for alleviating the situation for Britain as a whole would be to break down the UK into regions, so that the export ban would be lifted from those regions that are BSE free such as Northern Ireland and Scotland.</P>
    <P>Surely a differential regional approach might help alleviate the problem for the British authorities, though it would have to rigorously police any cattle movements from affected areas to unaffected areas in that case.  In last week's <i>Independent on Sunday</i> senior <Col N="831" /> Commission officials are quoted as saying that the British should draw up clear, workable, convincing proposals for declaring and certifying parts of the British herd and parts of British beef production to be BSE-free.  It could perfectly well do that.  We have been asking them to do that.  What is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry's attitude to this?</P>
    <P>The Minister was boasting this morning of policing the Border at a cost of £350,000 a week.  That is a heavy drain on the Exchequer, and we would not want it to become a long-term operation. It has given rise to individual hardship cases.  I would like to give the Minister some details of individual hardship cases but time does not permit me to do that and rather than putting individual cases that are in the text of my speech on record I ask the Minister to examine the individual cases.</P>
    <P>The scientific basis for the measures being undertaken needs urgent review. It is clearly essential to achieve a rapid elimination of BSE from herds as a precaution from a human and animal health point of view.  The evidence for a related CJD epidemic, on the other hand, is thin in the extreme.  There should be an effort to ring-fence the problem where it really exists.  The British Government should be encouraged to get its act together with a promise of reciprocal EU support for a credible approach.  It could be a vital responsibility of the Minister to broker a deal which will underpin consumer confidence in Europe and remove the threat to the disruption of the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out the challenges, by all means, but he should stop accepting defeat.  He should insist on solidarity among his Government partners and that they stop their attacks on the beef industry.  Today, Members on the Government side asked what attacks had been made.  On 18 April Deputy Eric Byrne stated in the Dáil: &ldquo;However, our tax system should not be used to further maximise the benefits already derived by large farmers from <Col N="832" /> the plethora of featherbedding schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely schemes which are designed to assist farmers cannot be described as featherbedding.  The Minister owes it to the House to condemn any Member who undermines the agricultural industry. If Members on this side or people outside the House did this, he would condemn them.  Either the Government supports the comments of Deputy Eric Byrne or it rejects them.  The Minister must state which is the position.  If I had time, I could give 20 or 30 such quotes.</P>
    <P>We will wait and see whether the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy De Rossa will show some interest in the problems of agriculture. The Minister is receiving no support from them.  They even refused to give him the Government jet to visit third countries.  The jet has been everywhere. It was probably in Knock last weekend for that airport's tenth anniversary.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for sharing his time.  BSE has caused great concern in the industry and this has been compounded by the lack of immediate and definitive action by the Government.  Before Christmas there was a BSE crisis but not as bad as the one we face at present.  However, we lost markets during the first crisis which have not yet been regained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of consumers to red meat has changed over the past ten years.  This matter must be addressed by intensive marketing of beef to sustain the industry.  The present decrease in consumption because of the BSE scare has compounded this problem and consumer confidence must be restored.  The recovery which began over the past two months has stalled.  Consumers and retailers are looking for trade stability <Col N="833" /> and cleaner product assurances and the beef industry must be able to deliver these.</P>
    <P>To seek recovery in the consumption of beef, we must ensure that measures are taken by Brussels and the Government to restore confidence in beef.  An aggressive promotional campaign is needed in different market-places to restore confidence and promote beef. The European market must be targeted by providing information, reassurance and promotion.  We must face up to the fact that BSE is likely to be a problem for many years rather than a short-term concern.  What extra funding has been allocated to An Bord Bia to help counter this crisis?  Surely such an emergency warrants immediate extra funding so that the board can do a more effective job in promoting the beef industry.  The Government must immediately address this matter and the issues raised by Fianna Fáil today.</P>

      <P>Last October farmers celebrated what was probably their best year.  Cereal farmers were doing well, dairy farmers had an unprecedented good year, the price of pigs was increasing and beef prices were high.  This was because of agreeable climatic conditions and the sound price structures put in place by the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  The present Minister jumped on board this wave of euphoria and claimed credit right left and centre for the good fortune of farmers.  His photograph appeared everywhere except on a wanted poster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His PR machine rolled into town with fanfare and went to every dog fight. However, when the pressure came on, he failed.  He failed to deal with the sheep crisis but the PR machine protected him.  He failed in the case of export refunds and told farmers prices would not fall.  Again the PR was brilliant. He failed in the case of BSE, even though our economy was more badly hit than any other economy, including Britain.  He allowed Britain to take the <Col N="834" /> high ground at EU level.  His PR machine failed on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Farmers and everybody involved in the beef industry, from the fields to the VAC packs, are angry at the Government. The Labour Party has absolutely no interest in agriculture.  Democratic Left is clearly and viciously anti-farmer. Fine Gael has sold out on the farmer to the left to ensure continuing support.  In the struggle of power versus agriculture, the latter has lost.  We are the only party which the Minister can be sure supports him.</P>
    <P>It was with a great deal of anger that I listened to the Minister's pathetic attempts to justify himself and the Government.  I wish to be constructive but we must be concerned about our present position.  In our major markets beef consumption has decreased by between 30 and 40 per cent.  With regard to live exports, our beef markets in third countries are either closed to us or operating at a reduced capacity.  At home our producers are on their knees. Prices per pound fell from 102p in January to 88p this week.  A price of 105p is required to break even.  Intervention has failed to put an adequate floor price in the market due to the Minister failing to deliver on a commitment to set aside the normal market price reporting mechanism in determining the intervention price.  Increased refunds failed because he did not take steps to ensure they were paid to those who needed them.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the most important factor in maintaining prices in the home market is live exports to third countries.  Where is the live trade with third countries?  The Minister went to Russia but this was too little too late.  As said this morning, if this was any other industry Ministers would have flown all over the place.  What happened in this instance?  Agriculture accounts for 40 per cent of all employment and its most important sector is in crisis.  What is the Minister's reaction to this?  It is, without doubt, that of an ostrich; he is burying his head in the sand.</P>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach take no <Col N="835" /> further action than making a phone call?  If, as claimed, that call was most productive, how much more productive would a visit have been?  It is said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the air more often than Richard Branson. Where was he when he should have helped to open up third markets?  I understand he agreed to visit Iran and that the Government there would have received him.  However, he changed his mind.  Why?  Is it because the hotels in Iran are not up to his usual standards?</P>
    <P>There should be full premium compensation for winter beef producers who suffered the most severe losses. There must be long-term premium compensation for any loss of production or price caused by the BSE crisis.  There must be a ministerial and diplomatic offensive to have third markets reopened for Irish beef and live cattle exports.  The Minister and the Government must seek from the EU adequate support to a ensure a reasonable floor price in the market and that decisive action is taken by the EU to ensure the UK takes adequate steps to deal with the BSE problem.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the package is £260 million.  We are talking in terms of £600 million for Britain, even though our economy has been worse affected.  What I have proposed is achievable, if we all work together.  Are all farming organisations invited to tomorrow's meeting and, if not, why?</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The only thing Deputy Cowen did not blame the Minister for was the good weather last summer.  Through their moaning and groaning, Opposition <Col N="836" /> speakers have instilled greater fear in the minds of consumers.  The one exception was their party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who called for co-operation to bring the crisis to an end.  Every other Opposition speaker dealt the industry a devastating blow.  Instead of reassuring people that Irish beef is clear of BSE and the best in the world, they have instilled a greater fear in the minds of consumers.  Wild and reckless contributions will not help the Government and the Minister in their efforts to restore the confidence of consumers in the quality of Irish beef.</P>

      <P>High ranking delegations visited Egypt and Iran while a senior departmental veterinary official travelled to the Gulf states to discuss the specific issues raised by them.  The Taoiseach had several telephone conversations with President Mubarak of Egypt and succeeded in having the Egyptian market reopened for Irish live cattle exports.  Had he received greater co-operation from the Opposition during those dreadful days, instead of having to answer petty questions in the House, he might have had the opportunity to travel abroad.  The image must be portrayed that Ireland is a source of superior quality food.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> The Minister is to be congratulated on his successful trip to Russia this week where he engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign on behalf of our beef industry.  At more than 100,000 tonnes with a market value of more than £350 million, Ireland supplies more than one-third of Russia's beef imports.  This is a remarkable achievement.  The Minister did not come home empty-handed.  He was promised this figure will be increased by at least 10 per cent this year.  This is a major boost to the industry at a time when other markets are still recovering from the impact of the BSE scare.  It underlines the Government's commitment to increasing our exports which are a valuable source of income.  The Minister has played his heart out for the farming community and has no intention of throwing in the towel.</P>

      <P>Our problem was that consumers were unable to differentiate between Irish beef and British beef.  They were led to believe Irish beef was also infected.  As a result, many farmers are in crisis.  The Minister has made superhuman efforts and is continuing to do so.  If the Opposition can point out what he did not do, then perhaps we could believe them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave each Member of the House to judge that.  I will sift through some of the points made and I hope I will be able to address as many as possible.  Deputy Cowen proposed a food quality authority.  The Government has been looking at the role of the advisory board on food safety, as well as the relationships between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Health, and the overlap between the veterinary service, the EHO service and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>Several weeks ago the Secretary of the public service management and development in the Department of Finance, Mr. John Hurley, chaired an inter-departmental committee on that area. The report has now been completed and will be going to Cabinet shortly.  I am satisfied with our own Department's role in EU directives.  However, we need to sort out some areas of overlap between both Departments, and new proposals will emerge from that.  It will deal with all aspects of food safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of where they stand in <Col N="840" /> relation to compensation is of most interest to farmers at this time.  Yesterday, the Commission put forward detailed proposals for initial discussion next week and for agreement, perhaps, at the end of June.  In ballpark terms, we are talking about an increase in existing premia of £10 million to £20 million for suckler cows, a two month special beef premium of the order of £52 million, and £8 million for national flexibility.  It is my intention, subject to the Council agreeing &mdash; and it may also require a European Parliament opinion &mdash; that a sum of the order of £8 million will be payable to those who had cattle slaughtered after 20 March up to the end of the DSP or deseasonalisation premium period.  There is a number of reasons for that.  First, people who sold cattle before 20 March were paid on average about 99p per lb.  There was no BSE crisis then, whatever about the general marketability problems for beef. Second, there is a structure of applications and procedures that we can administer effectively for people who, at the moment, are paid as low as £15 on the DSP.  It would mean quite a substantial individual payment to affected farmers, and it is my broad intention to meet with the requests put forward by all the farm organisations that we have that. The original proposals were for suckler cows and the beef premium, but there was nothing for winter finishers.  If the 22 months had already been drawn on an animal there was nothing for them, so it is my intention to deal with that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the compensation issue generally, since I spoke in the House this morning, I have had a discussion with the British Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Douglas Hogg, about developments in Britain.  A number of ministers will be coming here during the Irish EU Presidency to progress issues, and on every occasion somebody asks me for anything, I will make it clear to them that the total amount of money <Col N="841" /> available for compensation is unsatisfactory. I will be seeking a further major injection of funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is in the generality of horse trading because we are subject to existing budgetary flexibility. However, I am prepared to ensure that at the Florence Summit, or at the Dublin Summit during the Irish Presidency, if these compensation issues have to be addressed at a higher level than the Agricultural Council, then Ireland will be prepared to raise them then.</P>
      <P>The question of market issues has been raised by a number of Deputies. Much unfair criticism was made of the Tánaiste and my other colleagues in Government.  The fact is that I have responsibility for this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <P>Ministers have provided whatever appropriate support is necessary and they will continue to do so.  An interdepartmental structure is in place under the chairmanship of an official from the Taoiseach's Office who is looking at the lasting effects of this, both in budgetary terms, in the context of the 1996-97 period, and diplomatically also.</P>
      <P>In relation to the markets, the Libyan situation is turning.  From a trade perspective it is clear that the contracts signed up, including those by Irish operators for Australian animals, are now unravelling.  The journey up through the Suez Canal and logistical difficulties, including prices, have caused this unravelling which opens up a window of opportunity.</P>
      <P>It is patently clear that the technical authorities in Libya were not prepared to lift the European ban at the time of my scheduled meeting on 15 May.  Their way of saying that was to cancel the meeting.  The current trade pressures to get a source for supply also open up a window of opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I asked Ambassador Joe Small and officials in lveagh House at the <Col N="842" /> Department of Foreign Affairs to redouble their efforts to arrange a meeting. I have a very clear focus on that. The only two markets that are a problem in terms of closure are Iran and Libya.  Members should bear in mind that when Iran closed its market before, it took three years to reopen it.  To get it reopened in three months would be a terrific result because in my view it was never going to be resolved overnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not their view. It was a technical issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriate ministerial visit will take place when the technical issues with Teheran are resolved. They have not yet been resolved in the eyes of the Teheran authorities and, therefore, they are sending a veterinary delegation here.  This is not the first veterinary delegation to visit and we have already brought people up to the Border areas.  That is the singular focus I have for reopening the two markets. There is an ongoing effort in terms of the marketing situation there.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, seriously misrepresented some statements of mine.  As long as I am Minister, whether I am judged to have done a good or a bad job, I will tell it like it is.  If I have detailed market analysis to show that the drop in consumption is such that the market and the European regime will be in serious imbalance, then I must react to the situation when the price of beef cattle drops by 7 or 8 per cent and the price of store cattle goes up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are facing horrendous difficulties in relation to the autumn.  I cannot predict what the price of cattle will be in the autumn, nor can I venture to suggest what my officials in An Bord Bia and trade sources might tell me about beef cattle prices then.  All the forecast prices I have heard are wholly unacceptable.  I am obliged to give leadership so that people are not misled into thinking a windfall can be gained because the UK trade is out of production. I make no apologies for the <Col N="843" /> statements I have made.  If there is one million tonnes of beef, or whatever the figure will be depending on where consumption comes back to, people should have the full level of information.</P>
    <P>I do not take back anything I said about forestry.  I believe that, one day, Irish output from the forestry sector will exceed the current level of the value of the beef sector.  There is one million acres of land that can produce more from forestry than from any type of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was criticised for not doing more about the rendering industry.  At some point, whether it is in six days, six weeks or six months, a taxpayer subsidy would have to be discontinued.  It was a farcical situation because when my senior officials chaired three meetings with the renderers, producers and processors, they all agreed that Minister would have to seek more money from the Department of Finance.  It was weakening our whole involvement.</P>
    <P>To allow a stand-off to develop and to allow the commercial realities to prevail, was the right thing to do.  What happened this week was unavoidable and was a vindication of the stance I took.  I hope the situation improves for renderers but there was no pleasant way of overcoming that difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen is right in saying that the industry must be consumer driven. One of the permanent lessons of this is the need for a quality assurance programme. Something of the order of 12 per cent of Irish beef goes through the Q-mark with a shamrock on it.  Deputy Ellis referred to uniform residue testing. These are matters of which I am very supportive.  I do not want to put in place a large bureaucracy with a big levy structure because that invariably is the road one can go down in such cases.  It is obvious from an examination of the organisation of the dairy sector and, to a limited extent, the sheep sector that a great deal of work has to be done.  We have a story to tell in relation to all those aspects with our grassland based system, in terms of its genuine green <Col N="844" /> image, and I will do anything I can to pioneer that.</P>
    <P>On the question of ministerial visits, I simply make the point that timing is critical.  If I returned empty-handed from these visits, the people who are critical of me for not making them would be the first to say they were a waste of time.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition raised the question of Northern Ireland.  I sympathise with the people in Northern Ireland who are experiencing great difficulties in this matter.  The incidence of BSE in Northern Ireland is 40 times that of the Republic &mdash; it has a <Col N="845" /> different veterinary regime &mdash; but it is a fraction of the incidence in southern England.  I hope a framework will develop under the Irish Presidency, not in terms of lifting the ban on UK beef and beef products but in terms of progressing the view that a regional approach or the itemisation of certain practices in areas of Northern Ireland or Scotland is a real possibility.  I will be available to support our colleagues in Northern Ireland but not at the price of jeopardising in any way the difference between the regimes North and South having regard to our low sporadic levels of BSE.  The door is open but Northern Ireland will have to follow our depopulation policy or come up with some significant initiative which would be acceptable to my colleagues on the Council and to the SVC.</P>
      <P>The Government is totally supportive of the beef industry.  This has been a political point-scoring exercise and I have been long enough in Opposition to know the nature of these debates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years it has been widely recognised that our health services have failed to meet the needs of people with disabilities. Deputies will be familiar with frequent debates in this House on the underfunding of the mental handicap services.  The issue I want to raise relates to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This area is becoming more critical as the Minister for Health continues to delay taking the necessary <Col N="847" /> action to put in place a blueprint for service development.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Services for Persons with Physical and Sensory Disabilities was established in June 1992 by the then Minister for Health.  Drawing its membership from a wide range of relevant bodies, the review group was charged with examining the entire range of health services available to this large group of people with disabilities.  From the time of its appointment the review group undertook a comprehensive consultation and research programme to help it develop its recommendations.  By May 1994 the review group had completed the major body of its work and only required staffing resources to finalise its report.  These resources were in hand in the Department of Health but little attention has been paid to the report for 18 months.</P>
      <P>In November 1995 I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health on this issue.  Since then the review group has produced a draft report which was discussed at a consultative seminar in February of this year.  The current status of the report is that it is languishing in the Department of Health awaiting the attention it requires to make the changes suggested at the seminar.  I have received representations from a number of disability groups who are extremely angry about the ongoing delays and frustrated that all policy development in this area is being put off with the excuse that the review group's report has first to be received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of serious questions must be answered by the Minister and his Department.  Why has this vitally important report been delayed for so long?  It seems clear that it has been allocated few staffing resources by the Minister.  What is the reason for that?  Is it because the Minister is not giving the report the priority it clearly deserves or is there a more fundamental issue involved?  Is the report being deliberately delayed because the Minister does <Col N="848" /> not want to address the issues it will raise, particularly in relation to funding?</P>
    <P>After 18 months the Minister has failed, for whatever reason, to produce a report which was substantially comleted when he took office.  There is little doubt that the allocation of sufficient funds by the Minister would ensure the production of the report within a matter of weeks.  He should take this opportunity to announce that these resources will be allocated and that the report will be published immediately.  There is no excuse for the delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this issue. I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Noonan the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The Minister would like to take this opportunity to reassure the Deputy and interested parties of his commitment to publish the report of the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities.  As he stated recently in reply to a parliamentary question, it is his intention that the review group report should have the same status and impact as the report <i>Needs and Abilities</i> had on services for people with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The review group has a broad remit and is anxious to ensure that its report will provide a blueprint for the more efficient and equitable provision of services in the future and deal with the major issues of concern to service users and their carers.  Indeed the Deputy referred to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a one day seminar with the statutory and non-statutory bodies involved in the provision of services was held earlier this year to review a draft of the final report prior to publication.  Many valuable comments were raised at the seminar by service users and these are taken into account in finalising the report.  The Minister for Health has been informed that the amended report will be circulated to the members of the review <Col N="849" /> group for final approval within the next few weeks, following which it will be published as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the delay in the publication of the report, it should be noted that the last few years have seen significant developments and improvements in the provision of health and personal support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Since 1993 additional funding has been provided each year to develop these services. Some £1.5 million was provided in 1993 and 1994, £2 million was provided in 1995 and £1 million in 1996.  This means that the amount of money available for physical disability services in 1996 is £6 million more than that available prior to 1993.</P>
    <P>The additional funds have been allocated to each health board on the basis of the relative population and apportioned, with particular emphasis being placed on the provision of day and residential care and the development of home care and care attendant schemes, respite care, speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, language disorder units, psychologist services and the provision of technical aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group will make recommendations for the further development of these services.  It will also make recommendations on the future development of the personal assistance service for people with significant disabilities which was the subject last year of a separate report by an advisory group.  Finally, the Minister would like to again confirm his total commitment to the publication of the report of the review group and to the further development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will pass her concerns to my colleague, the Minister for Health, and I appreciate her raising this matter which is urgent for those concerned.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dismissal of Kilmainham Gaol Guide.</Title>
    <Col N="850" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Kilmainham Gaol was run on lease by the trustees for many years and was kept going by voluntary workers, many of them veterans of the War of Independence, and their friends. In 1986 the trustees of Kilmainham Gaol historical museum handed over its control to the Office of Public Works.  It took over full responsibility for the gaol including renovation, maintenance, security, provision of guides and caretakers and so on.  The Government agreed to maintain the gaol in perpetuity for the Irish nation as a historical museum and also agreed that access to the public would be available on as many days of the week as possible.</P>
      <P>Undertakings were given by Deputy John Bruton, then Minister for Finance and the keys were formally handed over to Deputy Doyle who was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works at the time.  Guarantees were also given by the State to provide guides and attendants and that existing voluntary workers would be given first consideration for any such vacancies that became available.  This promise has been kept by all Governments up to now.</P>
      <P>Any jobs which have arisen in these grades have been made available to existing voluntary workers.  However, now with only one pre-1986 voluntary worker left, namely Mr. David Fitzgerald, the Government has broken this agreement.  I understand he was recently asked to apply for the job he had been doing very well for 13 years. In that time he would have conducted tours and shown thousands of people around Kilmainham Gaol.  After interview he was told that he was not up to the job and was sacked.  This happened on the anniversary of the 1916 Rising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a scandalous way to treat this man.  I ask whether, in all justice since he is the only one of the pre-1986 voluntary helpers remaining, that some effort be made to give him a job as a guide or caretaker.  It seems scandalous, considering that the two people who <Col N="851" /> made the original agreement are the Taoiseach and Minister of State, respectively, that the Government is breaking an agreement solemnly given to the trustees of the museum at that time.  Some effort should be made to look after this individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for raising this matter.  I listened carefully to what he had to say.</P>
      <P>A new exhibition building was constructed within the walls of Kilmainham Gaol and opened to the public in April 1996.  There has been a most favourable public reaction to the new exhibition which has allowed various artefacts from the gaol's collection to be put on display for the first time.  We are all agreed on that.</P>
      <P>With the opening of the new exhibition building and extended opening hours, it was necessary to review the operation of the guide service.  A voluntary panel of part-time guides formed part of the service.  This panel was, as the Deputy said, set up when the gaol was handed back to the State in 1986 and arose from a commitment then given that the existing voluntary guides be given first consideration, even if these guides wish to carry out their duties free of charge.  The gaol was then open to the public on Sundays only and at other times by prior arrangement. However, as the members of the voluntary panel were not obliged to attend for duty, situations arose where an adequate number of guides was not always available.  I have to add that, on average, these part-time guides were rostered for duty once every four weeks for about five hours' work and that, in the end, all were paid for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances and to ensure a more co-ordinated and integrated service, it was regrettably necessary to disband the part-time voluntary panel of guides.  The new guide positions which were created as part of the reorganisation were advertised and the part-time panel members were invited to apply for the positions.  I understand that Mr. <Col N="852" /> Fitzgerald did apply and was interviewed but was not successful.  Guide positions are highly competitive and it is acknowledged by all that the standard of service provided is of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the commitment which was given in 1986 has been honoured in full.  It will be noted that the existing guides were to be given first consideration, not first refusal, and the process of selection that was recently followed is that used in respect of all heritage sites.  The overriding consideration is and must be the efficient running and presentation of the gaol as one of our premier national monuments. The new guiding arrangements which have been put in place will ensure that a first class service will be provided for the public.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Deputy and knowing the circumstances of this case, I am willing to ask my staff to see if there is some way in which the voluntary service provided by Mr. Fitzgerald might be accommodated, if circumstances allow.  I can give no guarantees at this stage.  Procedures for the new system were followed in full.  I appreciate, as everybody does, the work of those who gave a voluntary service in the past. I am willing to see if some accommodation can be arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of the AIBP Goodman company in Ravensdale, Dundalk, with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, last January in <Col N="853" /> the context of other job losses in the Dundalk area.  At that time this dispute was in its infancy.  The Minister said he could not comment on what was in effect a trade dispute, that he would not get involved and that there were various procedures by which the employees and the management in this company could get together.</P>
      <P>I am again raising it because of the sense of frustration on the part of the employees about the way in which they have been treated during this débâcle. The company, in breach of long-standing arrangements relating to pay and conditions, tried to introduce lower rates of pay to such an extent that the employees would receive in the region of £60 per week less for a similar week's work.  Obviously this caused difficulties with the employees who threatened strike action.  In effect, the company did not enter into negotiations with the employees or their union.  The problem has continued from last year and we are at a Mexican stand-off.  The reason I raise the matter is that the long-established procedures for the settlement of disputes have come to a halt and this has led to grave dissatisfaction.  In addition the union and the employees regard themselves as being locked out. The company has literally closed the factory and has bought another factory in Clones.  The work formerly done in the Ravensdale, Dundlak, plant is being done in Clones.</P>
      <P>Of all the disputes here during the past number of years the way in which this dispute has been handled by the company is reprehensible. The employees want to know their status, whether they have been laid off, if they will get back to the company or if the company is using the dispute as a reason for closing the factory.  They are on social welfare for months and want to know their status in that regard.  They are frustrated and dissatisfied that the various dispute mechanisms, such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, who have been asked to intervene, are not working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> I am disappointed the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, is not present to hear what I have to say.  This is a case where the dispute settling procedures put in place are not working and have not worked.  The company is doing everything in its power to frustrate the procedures.  I ask the Minister to intervene.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague on this important matter.  This is an issue which, if not resolved, will have far reaching repercussions.  My colleague, as Deputy for that area, has been active on various matters concerning industrial policy in his constituency and regards this matter as extremely serious.</P>
      <P>I speak as spokesperson for enterprise and employment. In difficult times when so many issues fall to be addressed within that sphere, it is not always correct for a Minister to decide to stay out of an issue and allow dispute settling agencies and the forces that guide them to decide an issue.  This is a serious matter on which I wish to join my colleague in strongly requesting ministerial intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  I appreciate the comments of Deputies Ahern and O'Rourke.  I understand this dispute stems from a suspension of production by the company, arising from which a number of production employees have been laid off.  While the union, on behalf of the employees involved, suggests that its members have been &ldquo;locked-out&rdquo;, the company says the plant is not viable, due to lack of modern processing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening that both parties have availed of the services of the Labour Relations Commission in attempting to resolve their differences, but disappointing that, thus far, they have been unable to agree a resolution of the dispute. I understand there was a meeting with the Labour Relations Commission <Col N="855" /> eight to ten weeks ago.  I gather the parties have recently agreed to refer the dispute to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation and that it will be referred to the Labour Court next week.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to urge the parties to continue their efforts to achieve an acceptable resolution of this dispute and, if required to continue to avail of all the services of the dispute settling agencies of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for being present.  I addressed this matter to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, particularly to the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Rabbitte. I know the procedure concerning Adjournment debates and that the Minister present will convey what we say here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the recent BSE scare the Government set up an informal consumer council which met urgently under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  Many people involved in it had experience of consumer matters, for example, Caroline Gill of the consumer association, William Fagan, the Director of Consumer Affairs, and various other experts.  It set up a help line to give information which would allay immediate consumer concerns. I applauded the idea of setting up such a council at the time.  When I spoke here on an agriculture debate I suggested it should remain as a standing committee which could be called upon, <Col N="856" /> if necessary, to enter into the consumer arena again regarding food concerns.</P>
    <P>In that context, the recent scare about baby foods has highlighted the need for an independent consumer and food inspectorate.  There has been an enormous panic this week due to the baby food scare.  Parents did not know where to turn for information about formula milk and about whether they should cease using some products and use others.  As well as being an uneasy time for people this type of confusion is dangerous.  It happens every time there is a food scare.</P>
    <P>When scares occur the pattern is that it takes a couple of days for the full information to be revealed, in the case of the BSE scare it took even longer. Eventually a special task force was established to examine the health and consumer issues associated with the beef scare.  By then people had a deep distrust.  The idea of the task force was a good one but it came late.</P>
    <P>Consumer, producer and scientific interests are represented on that task force.  If we are to avoid panic every time there is a media report about a food product, a full-time independent agency must be established to examine food safety.  Such a permanent agency would be on the same lines as the BSE task force in terms of composition and could become a permanent fixture as a consumer and health watch dog.  An overall task force would police the food industry and provide greater levels of information to the public.  I envisage that while it would be mainly reactive it should also be proactive in disseminating information.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that issues such as this do not register the sense of urgency they should.  I have received calls from many people, mostly mothers, who are worried about what has been reported on radio and television and they genuinely do not know where to turn or what to do.  While I am sure many of the scare stories are unfounded, there is some truth in what is being reported.  Therefore, people must be reassured.  It is difficult enough <Col N="857" /> for parents to rear a young baby, often in difficult financial circumstances, without having the additional concern about what to feed it.  The consumer affairs advisory group, set up by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, should be reconvened to deal with this important matter.  It was established quickly to deal with the BSE scare and its expertise would be valuable in this equally serious matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate the Deputy's comments to my colleague. I thank her for the responsible manner in which she raised this issue and the restraint she exercised in presenting it.  Public concerns could be amplified if it were treated in any other way.</P>
      <P>I cannot over emphasise the need to measure one's words carefully and exercise due diligence and tact in discussing this sensitive matter.  Irresponsible statements on claims for which there is no scientific, health or factual basis will inevitably give rise to a crisis where a problem does not or has not been shown to exist.</P>
      <P>The Minister is informed that certain baby foods contain a chemical substance known as phthalates.  The incorporation of this substance is not confined solely or exclusively to baby foods.  The substance, I understand, is a common constituent of our atmosphere and environment. Until now there has been no suggestion or proof that the existence of this substance is in any way detrimental or represents a threat to one's health or well being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent statements reported in the press refer to the comments by the chairman of the Food Safety Advisory Board to the effect that &ldquo;one would need one hundred times the level of phthalates allegedly found in certain baby foods in the UK before there would be any cause for concern&rdquo;.  The Minister has no advice, information or opinions available to him which would <Col N="858" /> cause him to disagree with this statement. I take it Deputies on all sides would be in the same position.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware statutory responsibility in this matter resides with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  My information is that the Department of Health has already been in contact with the Commission of the European Union within the framework of what is known as the European early alert food system.  It is the Minister's intention to bring the concern expressed by the Deputy to the notice of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is also no doubt aware the Minister for Health has responsibility for the Food Safety Advisory Board, established by Order of the House in 1995, the functions of which are to organise and administer a service for obtaining and assessing information as regards the safety of food: to organise and administer a service for obtaining and assessing information as regards zoonotic diseases; to advise the Minister of developments in domestic and European law relating to food; to advise the Minister on matters relating to food with particular reference to nutrition; to co-ordinate scientific co-operation with other European Union member states in accordance with Council Directive 93/5/EEC, which provides for such co-operation between member states in relation to foods research; if requested by the Minister, to consider and report to him or her on arrangements to be made; to ensure that the control of food processing and handling is compatible with accepted safety standards and for the registration and inspection of premises carrying on a food business; to undertake such other tasks as are consistent with its remit which the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Marine may require, and to consider and report to the Minister on such general matters in regard to food safety and nutrition as he or she may refer to the board for advice.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is also relevant to point out that a high level interdepartmental group is currently reviewing <Col N="859" /> the efficacy of the arrangements in place for the control and supervision of the food production chain with a view to strengthening public confidence in those arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are reassured as soon as possible so that moral panic does not develop out of what might be fairly flimsily based allegations. My colleague, the Minister of <Col N="860" /> State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, does not intend to reconvene the expert advisory group on beef products which he assembled last March.  However, I will convey the spirit and substance of the Deputy's remarks to my colleague.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 June 1996.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the <Col N="764" /> difficulties of the Guarani and of other indigenous people in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.  The situation of indigenous peoples is addressed regularly in discussions between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Government of Brazil is apprised of the EU's concerns regarding the rights of indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>At the recent ministerial meeting in Bolivia between the European Union and the Rio Group of Latin American countries, which I attended, both parties agreed to pay special heed to the fight against inequality and social exclusion, the protection of the rights of indigenous communities and their cultural heritage and their full participation in all aspects of society in the context of the national development of their prospective countries.  These objectives will be pursued, <i>inter alia,</i> through projects in the areas of health, education and housing policies.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I will keep under review the difficulties faced by indigenous people and will avail of appropriate opportunities to raise the case of particular groups of people including the Guarani through the EU, the United Nations and in bilateral contacts with the Governments of the countries concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The member states of the United Nations are currently discussing a wide range of institutional and operational issues as part of an ongoing process of reform within the United Nations system.  The objective of these <Col N="765" /> discussions is to agree on reforms which would make the system more effective in fulfilling its mandate to maintain world peace and promote economic and social development.</P>
      <P>I share the widely held view that important bodies such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council need to review their structures and working methods so that they become more responsive and relevant to the real issues that currently face the world community.  As major decision making organs within the UN system, their debates and decisions need to be more focused on the main problems facing the world community and should result in concrete and practical proposals for common action to adequately address these problems.</P>
      <P>The Security Council, the major decision-making body within the system, also requires reform.  Its membership needs to be enlarged so that it is more representative of the views of the wider community of UN states.  Its deliberations on key issues should be more open and transparent and involve closer consultation with both the General Assembly and the Secretary-General.</P>
      <P>In general, institutional reform should aim at a closer co-operation between the major UN bodies so that the actions and programmes of the UN system have the force of real collective action backed up by the political support of the member states.  This can be done without disturbing the balance of powers and responsibilities given to these bodies under the UN Charter.  What is needed is a more cohesive and better co-ordinated approach by the various institutions to ensure that the United Nations act more effectively in addressing threats to peace and to social and economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking to make the United Nations more effective, we need to review its present programmes and activities, particularly in the field of economic and social development, to make sure that it is making the best use <Col N="766" /> of resources and targeting those problems which are a real priority, especially for the poorer developing countries. There is also a particular need for the various specialised agencies of the UN active in this sector to work more closely together to maximise the overall impact of UN programmes in such areas as poverty alleviation and sustainable development.  A better co-ordination between the various major programmes and agencies can only improve both the quality and scope of United Nations action to assist poorer developing countries.</P>
    <P>Peacekeeping is another area which needs review.  It is clear from recent experience that the United Nations must develop a better planned and properly resourced response to the type of intra-state conflict which is becoming more frequent in the post-Cold War era. I welcome the increased attention on preventive diplomacy and efforts to address the economic and social causes of conflict as well as measures aimed at improving the rapid response capacity of the UN to conflict situations.  In seeking to strengthen the peacekeeping capacity of the United Nations, it is important to remember that to be successful, peacekeeping operations must have the political support of all member states and particularly of the members of the Security Council, who have a special responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Apart from institutional and operational reforms, I would also underline the need for agreement on a secure and long-term financial basis for the UN system and its activities.  The reform process we are engaged in will have little value or impact if the more dynamic UN system which we want to see emerging does not have sufficient and secure financial resources to allow it to plan and implement long-term programmes of economic and social development, as well as fulfilling its peacekeeping role.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with her partners in the European Union, has been playing a positive and constructive role in the reform negotiations under way.  We have supported proposals to make the <Col N="767" /> General Assembly more streamlined and relevant in its working methods, to review the operations of the Economic and Social Council and the various subsidiary organs and specialised agencies dealing with economic and social development.  We have recommended enlargement of the Security Council and more open and transparent decision-making within it.  In the area of peace-keeping we have laid emphasis on the need for a more comprehensive approach to peacekeeping interventions and supported the efforts of the Secretary-General to put in place more effective planning and standby arrangements to improve rapid deployment of personnel and resources.</P>
    <P>We will continue to play a full part, along with our EU partners, in efforts to reach consensus on required reforms within the system.  I am optimistic that with sufficient political will on the part of member states, real and meaningful reform can be achieved.  The Secretary-General has already carried through administrative reforms which will result in substantial budget savings and a reduction in staff numbers in the Secretariat. There is a growing recognition among member states that in addition to administrative reform, greater attention has to be given to setting priorities for the various programmes of the United Nations and channelling available resources to a better and more effective implementation of these.  This is particularly true of the sectors of economic and social development, where the UN system has the greatest potential for making a real and lasting impact on the problems of underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to participate actively in the process of positive and constructive self-appraisal within the UN system.  We all have an interest, and a responsibility, to ensure that the United Nations can renew its capacity to be the unique instrument of collective action, on behalf of the world community, to tackle the challenges and crises to be faced in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 21 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share Deputy McDowell's concern about reports that seven Bosnian men were mistreated in custody after they were handed over to the Bosnian Serb police on 10 May.  The facts of this incident are not yet clear, and are still being investigated by the International Police Task Force (IPTF).  According to the information I have obtained, the seven men came to be in IFOR custody following an apparent shooting incident <Col N="769" /> in which they were involved in the Republica Srpska &mdash; the Bosnian Serb entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The men were armed and wearing military uniforms and, as such, were considered by the IFOR unit to be in breach of the Peace Agreement being as they were on the Serb side of the Inter Entity Boundary Line.  IFOR, under the terms of the Peace Agreement, acted correctly in transferring custody of the men to the local authorities.  The evidence indicates that the men were mistreated while in the custody of the local authorities.  This is a matter of grave concern, as is the fact that the International Police Task Force was initially refused access to the detainees.  The latest information to hand is that the men have been transferred to another area of the Republica Srpska, Bijeljina.  They are reported to be under investigation for a number of serious offences including murder.  The men are now being visited regularly by officers of IPTF and have also received medical attention.  Efforts to clarify the circumstances in which the men were arrested and injured are continuing and I and my officials will continue to monitor developments in this case closely.</P>
    <P>On the issue of voting rights for refugees and displaced persons, the Government fully supports the rules and regulations which have been adopted by the Provisional Election Commission and the OSCE for the holding of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Under these rules, Bosnian citizens are entitled to vote in their 1991 place of domicile, either in person or by absentee vote. The Government, both nationally and as a member of the EU, and later this year as Presidency, will do everything possible to ensure that this right is honoured. With regard to Bosnian citizens living in Ireland, the refugee agency has already been in contact with the OSCE and is making preparations to facilitate voting in Ireland for these refugees.  My Department, and the refugee agency are also maintaining close contact with the <Col N="770" /> Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and will be facilitating any refugees who may wish to return to Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>UNHCR has been given the lead role under the Peace Agreement in relation to ensuring the return of refugees and displaces persons.  In order for that agency to achieve its aims, prime responsibility lies with the parties to the Peace Agreement, particularly the Bosnian Federation authorities and the Republica Srpska authorities, to ensure freedom of movement.  The international community has a role in maintaining pressure on the local authorities to co-operate and the international Implementation Force (IFOR) has a role in ensuring that physical obstructions, such as illegal roadblocks and checkpoints, do not impede refugees and displaced persons from exercising their right to return.  There are other physical aspects which prevent returns in certain cases, including the presence of landmines and the destruction of property.  Through support for the UN de-mining efforts and the international reconstruction effort, the Government and the EU is assisting in these areas.</P>
    <P>Progress in relation to the return of those displaced has been slower than expected.  A meeting to review this activity, at which the Government was represented, was held in Geneva earlier this month.  On that occasion, the High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, identified psychological and political, rather than physical obstacles as the main impediments to greater progress. Fear and a lack of confidence are, in the High Commissioner's opinion, the two major single factors affecting the rate of voluntary return.  The High Representative and EU mediator, Mr. Carl Bildt, is working tirelessly to ensure that local conditions improve in order to enable more displaced persons to return.  Many international agencies active on the ground, including IFOR, the International Police Task Force, the European Community Monitor Mission and the Red Cross are also involved in efforts to this end.  The Government, <Col N="771" /> both now and during our term as EU Presidency, will continue to support these efforts.</P>
    <P>The recent incidents in which violence occurred while displaced persons were attempting to pay return visits to their home areas are a matter of great concern, particularly the incident to which the Deputy refers in which two lives were lost.  Such incidents serve to increase the fear and lack of confidence which has delayed returns.  The blame for this lies with those who orchestrate such incidents in order to consolidate ethnic divisions.  In this regard the Government share the view of Mrs. Ogata and the High Representative that there must be international resolve to insist that the parties show the political will to fully abide by the provisions of the Peace Agreement.  There must be respect for full freedom of movement, including particularly the right of return to refugees and displaced persons.  The Government fully supports the UNHCR plans for organising return visits for refugees, including continued assessment visits to areas where the refugees are in the ethnic minority.</P>
    <P>It is UNHCR's assessment that conditions do not yet exist for the lifting of the temporary protection status under which refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina have been accepted in third countries.  The Government is of the view that these refugees should continue to enjoy protected status in third countries while also having the right to return if they so wish.  Ultimately, it is our aim that conditions should be created in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will enable as many refugees as possible to return voluntarily, free from fear or the threat of intimidation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 13 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned about the need to expedite a return to full democratic rule and full observance of human rights in Nigeria. With our EU partners, we are implementing the restrictive measures taken <i>vis-à-vis</i> Nigeria in the Union's common positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995, details of which I gave in my reply to a question in the House on 7 December last.</P>
      <P>The Government supports measures which will maintain political and economic pressure on the Nigerian regime to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law.  In this context we have been unequivocal in our support for the introduction of such measures as an oil embargo or assets freeze as a catalyst for meaningful reform.  The Government recognises that to be effective additional measures such as an oil embargo will need widespread international support.  We therefore support EU consultation with like-minded states on the adoption of these and other appropriate measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has consistently supported action by the UN Commission on Human Rights to redress the problem of human rights violations in Nigeria.  In accordance with its common position of 4 December, the EU sponsored a draft resolution on Nigeria at <Col N="773" /> the Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last March. The EU resolution included a call, strongly supported by Ireland, for the appointment of a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Nigeria.  In the event, this provision did not attract adequate support outside the EU to be adopted. The resolution which was finally adopted calls on the Government of Nigeria to accede to the requests of the UN <i>Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions</i> and of the <i>Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers,</i> to pay a joint investigative visit to Nigeria.  It also provides for the submission to the next session of the Commission on Human Rights of a joint report by the two Rapporteurs of their findings, along with any observations of other relevant mechanisms, in particular the UN working group on arbitrary detention.  They are also to send an interim report to the 51st Session of the UN General Assembly later this year.  The Resolution adopted by CHR also provides that Nigeria will be on the Agenda of its next session at which stage the appointment of a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Nigeria may be reconsidered in the light of developments.</P>
    <P>An additional UN fact finding mission, which returned from Nigeria in early April, was mandated to examine the procedures of the trial and execution of the late Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-accused in the light of the various international human rights instruments to which Nigeria is a party and relevant Nigerian law.  It also examined the plans of the Nigerian Government to implement its declared commitment to restore democratic rule.  The mission has recently reported to the UN Secretary General on its findings.</P>
    <P>There are some signs that Nigeria may be beginning to respond to the growing international pressure being exerted by the UN, EU, Commonwealth, United States and others.  We understand that in recent days the UN Secretary General has received a letter <Col N="774" /> from General Abacha's legal adviser.  In the letter, the Nigerian authorities undertake to carry out a number of democratic reforms including the exclusion of military personnel from special courts such as the Ogoni Tribunal and to establish an appeals mechanism. The letter also signals the restoration of <i>habeas corpus</i>, which was specifically sought in the EU Common Position of 20 November 1995.  A review of the cases of all persons currently being detained without trial under a government Decree of 1984 is also promised.</P>
    <P>If actually implemented, the reported measures would be an encouraging step towards meaningful reform in Nigeria. The Government will be monitoring these and other developments closely with EU partners to evaluate the real progress being made.  To help ensure the implementation of these and other measures we will be strongly supporting the renewal of the Common Position of 4 December on the expiry of its initial six-month period in early June.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed visit by an Oireachtas delegation, I regret the decision of the Nigerian authorities not to issue the necessary visas.  I feel that such a visit would have served a useful purpose in terms of dialogue with the various interested parties, including with Nigerian Government representatives. I hope it will be possible to reschedule the visit at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Government fully shares the view that it is necessary <Col N="775" /> to prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda and strongly supported the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Bringing to justice those responsible for genocide in Rwanda is also essential for building confidence for the voluntary return of the 1.9 million Rwandan refugees in the Great Lakes Region and to the advancement of national reconciliation and reconstruction in both Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi.</P>
      <P>Investigations by the Tribunal have been focused on approximately 400 identified suspects.  The Tribunal Prosecutor, Justice Richard J. Goldstone, has indicated that trials of those responsible for the genocide will begin in early July.  The first group of accused persons has already been transferred for detention in the Tribunal headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania, where they have been allocated defence lawyers in preparation for preliminary hearings which begin today.  While the Government has been concerned about delays in the commencement of hearings by the Tribunal, we are hopeful that they will now proceed and that this in turn will give renewed impetus to the process of national reconciliation in Rwanda.  The co-operation of the international community will continue to be necessary as the identities and whereabouts of those suspected of genocide become known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking to help deal with the legacy of genocide in the longer term, the Government joined the United States in sponsoring the International Conference on Genocide, Impunity and Accountability organised by the Government of Rwanda in Kigali last November.  The conference was attended by Ministers of the Rwandan Government as well as international experts on large-scale human rights abuses from Chile, Argentina, Germany, Israel and Ethiopia.  We also provided a follow-up grant of £82,000 for the establishment of a small secretariat which is implementing the findings of <Col N="776" /> the conference.  The Government of Rwanda has officially acknowledged the fact that the conference has significantly assisted it in its legislative approach to the organisation of prosecutions for genocide.</P>
    <P>The restoration of a functioning and independent system of justice within Rwanda remains a key aspect of a long-term response to the genocide in Rwanda.  It is also an important means of relieving the appalling and inhumane overcrowding of its prisons.  The UN Secretary General has reported that the implementation of programmes designed to rehabilitate the justice system are under way.  The Government of Rwanda is making efforts to reform the judicial and penal systems with the support of the International Red Cross, UNDP and international donors.  In seeking to improve prison conditions, it has opened additional detention facilities which have resulted in the transfer of 12,000 prisoners from overcrowded prisons.  It is co-operating with the UNDP in the implementation of a joint project to rehabilitate the justice system. The plan provides for the establishment of special courts to deal with genocide cases and for improved remuneration for over 1,000 judicial personnel in order to attract properly qualified staff. The establishment of special courts was one of the recommendations made by the international conference on genocide which we sponsored with the US Government.</P>
    <P>In all, the Government has disbursed over £8.15 million for emergency relief and rehabilitation efforts in the Great Lakes Region since 1994.  In my reply to the House on 7 March, I gave details of spending on the justice sector and in support of human rights initiatives in Rwanda which have been key sectors for Government support.  This funding has been allocated to a broad range of entities, which have central responsibilities for ensuring that those responsible for the genocide are brought to trial and that mechanisms exist to ensure full accountability for human rights violations.  Since March, a further <Col N="777" /> grant of £125,000 has been disbursed to the international committee of the Red Cross to improve prison conditions and a grant of £130,000 has been given to Concern for a programme which is assisting prisoners and their families by setting up income generation projects. This brings to over £1.77 million the amount spent by the Government on justice and human rights initiatives since 1995.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to focus on the issues of justice, human rights and accountability for genocide in its approach to the problems of national reconciliation and reconstruction in Rwanda.</P>

      <P>Article D of the Treaty on European Union states:</P>
      <P>The European Council shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof.</P>
      <P>The European Council is required to meet at least twice each year under the Chair of the Head of State or Government of the State which holds the Presidency of the Council, thus ensuring adequate opportunity to review the Union's agenda.  On occasion, additional meetings of the European Council are held such as the Special European Council in Turin last March which launched the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council does not take formal legally binding decisions. Instead, it defines the general political guidelines of the Union through the detailed Conclusions reached at each of <Col N="778" /> its meetings.  These <i>Conclusions</i> play a central role in shaping the Union's agenda for the subsequent six months and beyond and are an essential element in guiding the work of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Adequate follow-up to meetings of the European Council is ensured in the first instance through regular meetings of the Council of Ministers.  The General Affairs Council considers the outcome of a European Council at its first and subsequent meeting in order to ensure the necessary follow-up.  Furthermore the General Affairs Council reviews the preparations for a European Council meeting.</P>
    <P>We shall be doing this in Luxembourg next month in advance of the Florence meeting.  In addition as Foreign Ministers assist the members of the European Council and as Finance Ministers attend for monetary matters, there is a direct link between work at the Summit level and at the Ministerial Councils. The Presidency of the European Union plays an important role in this respect. Other institutions of the European Union also ensure adequate follow-up &mdash; in particular the European Commission whose President is a member of the European Council.</P>
    <P>The President of the European Council reports to the European Parliament after each of its meetings and a written report is published by the Council annually on the progress achieved by the Union.</P>
    <P>Taking all these arrangements into account, I am satisfied that there is adequate follow-up to meetings of the European Council and that the necessary mechanisms are in place to ensure this follow-up.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that Irish workers are being discriminated against in the construction or any other employment sector in Germany.  I will investigate any particular case of alleged discrimination if the Deputy gives me details.</P>
      <P>Foreign, including Irish, construction workers in Germany are sometimes employed through agencies based outside Germany.  There have been a few instances in recent years of disputes about the terms and conditions of employment of workers recruited in that way which have resulted in some Irish workers not getting paid.</P>
      <P>A new law, the Law on Obligatory Working Conditions for International Labour, in force in Germany since 1 March 1996, requires all employers to register the foreign workers they employ with the local employment office.  The law also applies to agencies supplying labour to contractors, whether or not the agencies are based in Germany.  Agreements on pay and conditions applicable to the construction industry are now as binding in respect of foreign workers as they are in respect of Germany workers.  The new law does not differentiate between employers or workers on the basis of nationality.</P>
      <P>The Embassy in Bonn is monitoring how the new law affects Irish workers in the building industry and is not aware of any difficulty.  Should any develop, they will advise and assist the worker or workers concerned in every way they can.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 18 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>So far in 1996 there have been two meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The first took place on 1 February and was adjourned until 7 February, when it concluded. The second meeting was on 22 May.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have had eight informal meetings: on 15 and 17 January, on 4, 8, 14 and 20 March, on 3 April and on 28 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contact at non-political level between the two Governments is organised in a variety of ways as the occasion warrants. The most frequently used channel of communication is the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, and the embassies in Dublin and London are of course also in regular and frequent contact with the respective Governments.  Meetings in other formats, including those of the so-called Liaison Group, are arranged on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis when required.  There is no fixed representation from the Irish side at these meetings, although as a rule it would include officials from my Department and from those of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice.  The Irish delegation at any such meeting is determined by the Government according to the matters under discussion.  All members of such delegations are fully bound by the Official Secrets Act.  I do <Col N="781" /> not propose to comment on the composition of British delegations, except to say that on that side also the participation is on a variable and flexible basis, according to the practical needs at any given time.</P>
    <P>It is a well established practice, agreed between the two Governments, that the details of such official level meetings, including their timing, are not publicly disclosed and I do not propose to depart from that precedent.</P>

      <P>It is the Government's policy to promote cross-Border economic and social co-operation in all fields.  The Deputy can be assured therefore that all Departments, State agencies and local authorities are supportive of developing cross-Border co-operation and linkages.</P>
      <P>While I have no direct responsibility for local authorities, I understand that there is a considerable level of co-operative between local authorities, North and South, at different levels across a range of activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the best examples of this co-operation is the existence of the three regional cross-Border groups, viz. the north-west region cross-Border group, the central Border region cross-Border group and the east Border region committee. These regional groups comprise representatives from the local authorities in the six Border counties and the relevant borough and district councils in Northern Ireland.  The groups which are funded through the INTERREG programme meet regularly to discuss issues of relevance to the Border region.  Two of the groups have already produced integrated plans for <Col N="782" /> their regions on which they are now in discussion with the relevant Government Departments and State agencies, North and South.</P>
    <P>In addition to contacts via the regional structures, there are extensive ongoing contacts on the full range of issues of mutual interest between local authorities here and their counterparts in the North.  The development of these contacts has been, and continues to be, greatly facilitated by the special funding mechanisms for the Border region which include the EU INTERREG and the EU programme for peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The joint Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme for the period 1994-1999 is a multi-sectoral one with the two major objectives of creating and developing networks for cross-Border co-operation and economic regeneration of the Border region.  The EU support programme for peace and reconciliation, which is designed to support the peace process, will help to further develop cross-Border links.  At least 15 per cent of the total funds available is earmarked for projects involving cross-Border co-operation.  The International Fund for Ireland has since its establishment in 1986 dedicated itself to promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between the two communities in Northern Ireland and between both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>The foregoing programmes have benefited from the advice and co-operation of the local authorities.  Any enhancement of co-operation between local authorities will serve to increase the cross-Border dimension of these programmes.</P>

      <P>It was announced by the White House on 15 March 1996, during a visit to Washington by the Taoiseach, that the US Commerce Department would host a conference in Philadelphia in the autumn to promote trade and investment, focusing on Northern Ireland and the Border counties. Such a follow-up conference was envisaged at the conclusion of the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland which took place in Washington in May 1995.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Ireland earlier this month, a senior official from the US Department of Commerce confirmed that his Department is currently finalising the planning of the conference.  It is hoped that the exact dates for the conference will be announced in the near future.</P>
      <P>The holding of this conference is further proof of the commitment of President Clinton and the US Administration to underpin the peace process and to build and expand the growing commercial links between the United States and the island of Ireland.  The US authorities have been assured of the readiness of our State agencies and Government Departments to co-operate fully with them in planning the conference.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to hear that follow-up activity to the Washington Conference is ongoing in a number of areas.  A business development mission, comprising some 13 information technology companies, will visit Northern Ireland and the Border counties from 10-14 June 1996.  This event will build on a previous mission to the region last October and an outward mission to the US last November which was led by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>

      <P>As was made clear to the Deputy in a reply to his question on the same matter on 25 April, Irish embassies abroad have, since the outset of the current crisis, given the highest priority to defending the reputation of Irish beef.  I can assure the Deputy that this continues to be the case and that embassies, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, An Bord Bia and other State agencies, are working to ensure continued access to markets and to provide reassurance to consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the activities of my Department and embassies have helped to secure the reopening of a number of markets.  With regard to those countries which have not yet lifted restrictions on our products, the focus of our efforts is to encourage decision making on the basis of the internationally recognised disease-free status of the Irish herd.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been discussed within the United Nations system for almost 50 years.  The debate has been marked by occasional bouts of urgency interspersed with long periods of inactivity.</P>
      <P>The establishment by the Security Council of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals to deal with the appalling violations of human rights in former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda had the effect of reviving the idea of establishing a permanent independent international criminal court.  It also galvanised the international legal community into undertaking serious work towards its inception.</P>
      <P>I have sought to maintain this impetus at the political and diplomatic level and I have raised the question of the establishment of a permanent international criminal court on the last three occasions upon which I have addressed the United Nations General Assembly. Indeed, last year at the historic 50th General Assembly, I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a growing acceptance that violations of humanitarian law are a threat to international peace and security.  The case for the establishment of a Permanent International Criminal Court is therefore more obvious than ever.  It is only through such a body that the international <Col N="790" /> community can effectively demonstrate that massive human rights violations will never go unpunished.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the seriousness of its purpose, the 50th General Assembly established a preparatory committee to meet for two sessions during 1996.  The preparatory committee is widely seen as the penultimate step on the road to the adoption of a convention establishing a permanent international criminal court. Ireland participated actively in the first session of the preparatory committee from 25 March-12 April 1996.</P>
    <P>Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union both at the second session of the preparatory committee in August 1996 and later that autumn at the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly.  Ireland will therefore be responsible for co-ordinating the European Union's position on the court.  All 15 members states of the European Union have indicated their support for the court.  Although partners occasionally lay stress on different priorities in relation to the court, they share a broad common purpose.  The Deputy may therefore rest assured that the Irish Presidency will see to it that the question of the establishment of a permanent international criminal court is fully debated in all appropriate fora.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1994 a Special Conference of States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, BTWC, decided to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> group to strengthen the convention by proposing a verification regime for consideration at the Fourth Revenue Conference or later at a special conference.  To date, the <i>ad hoc</i> group has had one procedural and two substantive sessions.  It will have two further two-week sessions, in July and September, in advance of the Fourth Review Conference which will take place in Geneva from 25 November to 6 December 1996.  While it is not anticipated that a draft verification Protocol will be ready for adoption this year, the review conference will give political and diplomatic impetus to the process of strengthening the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will have a vice-Presidency post at the review conference.  We will seek to strengthen compliance with the international system of non-proliferation of biological and toxin weapons by promoting universal adherence to the BTWC and a successful conclusion to the negotiations aimed at reinforcing the convention with a legally binding and effective verification regime.  To this <Col N="792" /> end, it is important that the review conference should decide to intensify the work with a view to adoption of a BTWC Protocol no later than mid-1998. This implies a substantial increase in the time allocated to BTWC work in 1997 and 1998, irrespective of other priorities on the international disarmament agenda.</P>
    <P>I hope that the European Union, which will have an important role at the review conference, will shortly adopt a common position reflecting these objectives. As Presidency, Ireland will lead a series of EU Troika démarches with a view to encouraging more states parties to become engaged in the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> group and at enlisting their support for the technical proposals the EU will be advancing in that forum and at the review conference.  For the purpose of promoting the universality of the convention, we will also lead Troika démarches to states which have yet to become party to the convention.  Ireland will deliver a statement on behalf of the EU at the beginning of the review conference.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the period of the Irish Presidency could be crucial to the final outcome of efforts to strengthen the BTWC.  We will do all we can during our term of office to give impetus to the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan resumed its activities on 12 January 1996 when the Head of the Mission, Mr. Mahmoud Mestiri, arrived in the region with a renewed mandate from the UN General Assembly.  At the 50th Session of the UN General Assembly in September 1995, the European Union pledged its full support for the efforts of the UN Special Mission with the aim of achieving a negotiated and comprehensive solution to the Afghan conflict.</P>
      <P>In accordance with that mandate, Mr. Mestiri continued his efforts to facilitate national reconciliation and reconstruction in Afghanistan, in particular by ensuring the transfer of power through the urgent establishment of a fully representative and broad-based &ldquo;authoritative council&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, together with our partners in the EU, has monitored closely and supported the efforts of the <Col N="794" /> UN Special Mission to Afghanistan.  On 14 March 1996 the European Union issued a declaration which reaffirmed its full support for the Special Mission to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in close co-operation with all parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>So far this year, while most parts of Afghanistan have remained calm, there has been an increase in tension in and around the capital city of Kabul, with indiscriminate exchange of rocket and missile fire and an intensification of air attacks which have been reported almost daily.  The Head of the UN Special Mission has made frequent appeals to the warring parties for the immediate cessation of hostilities and for unconditional recourse to a peaceful dialogue.  These appeals have been reiterated by the UN Secretary General and the UN Security Council as, indeed, by the EU.  In its declaration of 14 March 1996, the EU expressed concern at the continuing fighting in Afghanistan, especially the shelling and air attacks around Kabul and urged all the parties involved to end the hostilities immediately and to allow the free passage and distribution of humanitarian aid to the civil population.</P>
    <P>Continuing hostilities have meant that millions in Afghanistan are struggling to survive.  Efforts by the UN and NGOs have been directed towards strengthening stability by implementing plans and initiatives for rehabilitation and reconstruction at the district level without waiting for a permanent political solution.</P>
    <P>In March 1996, in response to the worsening humanitarian situation in Kabul, the Irish Government disbursed a grant of £90,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for emergency relief programmes.  The Government is also supporting the relief programmes of the only Irish NGO operating in Afghanistan, &ldquo;Support for Afghan Further Education&rdquo; SAFE.  In 1994 a grant of £50,000 was allocated to SAFE for a sanitation and emergency waste clearance project in Jalabad city, the second largest city in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> In July 1995 the Government allocated a second grant of £70,000 for an emergency sanitation programme in Kabul in association with the World Food Programme and UN agencies.  The Government is considering actively the provision of further support for this programme in 1996.</P>

      <P>The Government is very aware of the need for openness and public debate in relation to the Intergovernmental conference which opened in Turin on 29 March.  For the Intergovernmental conference to be a success, it must be transparent in its conduct and comprehensible in its outcome. We have sought since last year, including through the preparation and <Col N="796" /> publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy, which was the subject of extensive public consultation, to encourage informed public debate about the issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental conference and their implications for Ireland and Europe.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas has been kept fully informed in relation to the Intergovernmental conference including through statements and the detailed replies which the Taoiseach, myself and the Minister of State for European Affairs have given in reply to parliamentary questions.  Prior to the opening of the conference itself, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on several occasions as well as Seanad Éireann on the work of the Intergovernmental conference Reflection Group on which he was Ireland's representative.  Copies of the Reflection Group report were given to all Members of the Oireachtas and a copy was lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>More recently, subsequent to the opening of the Intergovernmental conference, the White Paper has been the subject of debate in both the Dáil and Seanad.  Moreover, I addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on the White Paper.  We will continue to keep the Oireachtas including the relevant Oireachtas committees fully briefed on developments.  I and other members of the Government have also sought in various speeches and otherwise to stimulate public debate more generally about the Intergovernmental conference. We will continue to do so throughout the Intergovernmental conference process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parallel with greater openness, the Government believes that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference should both be comprehensible to the public and also tackle the most direct concerns of citizens.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply dismayed by the continuing conflict in Liberia.  Together with our EU partners we have condemned the ongoing violence and looting.  We have stressed to the faction leaders that they must resume the implementation of the terms of last August's Abuja Agreement which set out a framework for settling the long-standing conflict in the country.  We are deeply concerned also about the plight of the refugees who have fled the country and the thousands of displaced persons within Liberia itself.  With like-minded countries we are actively exploring ways of promoting peace and stability in the country so that the necessary process of rehabilitation and reconstruction can begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the export of produce to raise funds for arms expenditure, it is clear that such activity is illegal, because the produce in question has been stolen <Col N="798" /> locally and sold off to international buyers clandestinely and because the purchase of arms is in breach of the UN arms embargo.  I understand that the UN is actively examining the whole issue at present including the possibility of an embargo on such exports, but that there are serious technical difficulties about such a course of action.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggest also that the European Union is the destination of such trade.  It is difficult to get precise information on the issue, given the illicit and clandestine nature of the trade involved.  However, I would be gravely concerned, as no doubt would our EU partners, if it were established that traders within the Union were engaging in such activity.  I hope that, in the context of the UN's activity, and also as part of the wider efforts to bring an end to the conflict, this aspect can ultimately be successfully addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuing crisis in Burundi is a source of the gravest concern to the international community and to the people of the region. There is particular dismay at the recent deterioration in the situation there, after it had appeared in the early months of this year that the beginning of a process of dialogue was discernible. Once again, we are hearing reports of terrible atrocities on both sides and an apparent renewed hardening of positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community, under the leadership of the United Nations and with the active support of, <i>inter alia</i> the European Union and the Organisation of African Unity, the OAU, has sought to address the many issues involved in the Burundi conflict.  There has been widespread agreement among those seeking to assist that the conflict can only be resolved by peaceful means. The OAU and individual African facilitators have been particularly prominent in the search for a solution.  The current lead-initiative is that of Julius Nyerere, the former President of Tanzania.  Mr. Nyerere, with the support and endorsement of the UN, the EU, the OAU and the international community generally, has been engaged for some months in a <Col N="801" /> mission aimed at bringing the main protagonists around the negotiating table. Clearly, Mr. Nyerere is the figure in the region best placed &mdash; in terms of status and standing among the major protagonists &mdash; to broker a process of dialogue. Although, so far, Mr. Nyerere's efforts have not met with full success and the fighting has continued, he intends, nonetheless to persevere and we fully support his efforts.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a specific point in regard to the role of the UN.  The UN has been actively and urgently engaged in Burundi at many levels from the outset. Several UN agencies have been involved in the major task of addressing the humanitarian plight of the thousands of Burundians caught up in the conflict, including large numbers of refugees who have fled both to and from the country.  The Security Council has been seized of the issue from the outset and has been following events closely.  Its most recent Resolution &mdash; 1049 of 1996 &mdash; outlined a comprehensive list of measures aimed at addressing the many problems facing the country. The Secretary General has made personal representations to the protagonists on a regular basis through his Special Representatives in Burundi.  The latter works closely with the OAU and the EU Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, Aldo Ajello.  In particular, he maintains close contact with Julius Nyerere, to whose mission the Secretary General has given full support and endorsement.  Indeed, UN support was one of the pre-conditions of Mr Nyerere's acceptance of the mission and he regards it as critical to the success of his own efforts.</P>
    <P>To underline the UN's concern about the deteroriation in the situation over the past few months, the Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, Marrack Goulding, visited Bujumbura recently and met with leading figures on both sides.  He stressed again the urgency of a peaceful settlement.  Meanwhile, in accordance with the terms of Resolution 1049, the Secretary General <Col N="802" /> has been continuing contingency planning for a rapid humanitarian response in the event of widespread violence or a serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Burundi.  Concern has been expressed in some quarters &mdash; including on the African side &mdash; about the wisdom of this initiative.  But the Secretary General believes that the planning, at least, for such a mission should proceed to ensure readiness at short notice in the event that it is required.  In addition, the UNDP has been working actively on a programme of rehabilitation and reconstruction &mdash; although work on this has been hampered by the continuing difficulties in regard to security.</P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions to the situation in Burundi.  It is grounded in deep-seated, ancient fears, mutual mistrust and the abiding memory of past atrocities on both sides.  In that atmosphere, convincing people that dialogue and compromise offer the only solution is not easily done.  In these delicate and difficult circumstances, it seems to me that the balance which the UN and its Secretary General have sought to strike between encouraging people to the negotiating table while making contingency plans for a humanitarian intervention is the correct one.  I know that that is also the view of the EU Special Envoy, Ambassador Ajello, whom I met in Dublin recently.  I look forward to working with him, Mr Nyerere, the UN, the OAU and other interested parties during our forthcoming Presidency, in support of their efforts towards the comprehensive and peaceful settlement of the problems of Burundi that we all seek.</P>

      <P>In Madrid in December 1995, the European Council agreed a reference scenario, or timetable, for the transition to the single currency, the Euro.  Briefly, in early 1998, the European Council will decide which member states qualify to participate in the third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) on the basis of their performance in 1997; the third stage will commence on 1 January 1999, when the Euro will come into being and the exchange rates of the currencies of participating member states will be locked irrevocably against it and against each other; Euro notes and coins will be introduced into circulation by January 2002 at the latest; and the national currencies of participating member states will cease to be legal tender by 1 July 2002 at the latest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union defines the activities of the member states and the European Community as including the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates leading to the introduction of a single currency and contains the provisions relating to European Monetary Union.  However, Protocols to the Treaty make special provision for the United Kingdom and Denmark.  The <Col N="804" /> UK Government indicated some time ago that the UK would not participate in the third stage of European Monetary Union if it commenced in 1997.  The UK Government has not ruled out UK participation in the third stage from 1 January 1999, but has indicated that a decision about it will be made closer to that date.  I understand that a referendum will be required in Denmark if it is to proceed to the third stage of European Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, entry to the Civil Service must, with a few exceptions of limited application, be by way of open competition.  One of those exceptions provides for the reinstatement to their former positions of women who resigned from the Civil Service for marriage-related reasons and who fulfil specific criteria.  However, the reinstatement scheme has been found by the Labour Court to be contrary to the Equal Treatment Directive &mdash; which prohibits discrimination on grounds of gender or marital status &mdash; and the Court has recommended that the relevant statutory provisions be repealed. I have also received legal advice to the same effect.  The necessary legislation to repeal the scheme is before the Houses of the Oireachtas at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of repealing the reinstatement scheme, it is intended that the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions will include special sub-panels which will be composed solely of former civil servants but will not differentiate on grounds of gender or marital status.  It is hoped that this initiative will go some way towards <Col N="805" /> facilitating the re-entry to the Civil Service of women, such as the person concerned, who resigned on marriage.  As the Deputy is aware, competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service are run by the Civil Service Commissioners and are advertised in the daily papers from time to time.  In recent years the upper age limit for open competitions has been raised to 50 years of age.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of methadone maintenance in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There are currently almost 1,400 on the central methadone treatment list which is held by the Eastern Health Board and the drug treatment centre. By the end of 1996 it is the aim through a variety of initiatives to increase numbers on the treatment list to 2,500 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; A series of local initiatives in consultation with community interests in a number of community care areas.  This will represent a development of services in areas not previously covered by such a service.</P>
      <P>&mdash; The expansion of methadone disbursing services in existing community drug centres to a seven day service.  This will allow for greater access for those in need.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Initiatives in the north and south inner city to provide early intervention for problem drug users with a variety of detoxification procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; a methadone maintenance pilot project involving GPs.  This involves a selected number of <Col N="806" /> patients who have been stabilised in drug treatment centres and who are being referred to general practitioners for continuation of methadone maintenance treatment and overall medical care. The elements which are included in this pilot programme are: drug misusers, who are referred to general practitioners, will have been previously stabilised in a health board treatment clinic; each patient is provided with a personalised treatment card; a facilitator, appointed by the Eastern Health Board, is providing liaison between treatment centres, general practitioners and pharmacies; and any drug misuser who becomes destabilised while under general practitioner care will be referred back to a treatment centre for attention and further treatment. </P>
    <P>At present, there are 25 doctors prescribing to 40 patients with treatment cards who are being dispensed methadone from 20 pharmacists.  It is expected that following the successful evaluation of this programme a number of other GPs will become involved in prescribing.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are over 680 patients being prescribed methadone by 25 general practitioners in the community. The board is endeavouring to expand treatment services to drug misusers who are on waiting lists for such treatment.  The number of additional persons for whom treatment will be provided will depend on the success of the Eastern Health Board in establishing further community drug centres in local areas and also on the number of additional general practitioners and pharmacists who are prepared to prescribe and dispense methadone respectively to stabilised drug misusers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided on 28 March 1995 to defer a decision on the location of a visitor centre for the Wicklow Mountains National Park until a management plan for the park had been completed.  Arising from this decision a steering committee was established by me to oversee the preparation of the plan.  Environmental consultants were commissioned to prepare a draft management plan in the context of a draft strategy for conservation in the Wicklow mountains.  The consultants have been asked to address the future of the <Col N="811" /> Luggala site in their report which I expect will be completed and published in about two months.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the draft plan, I propose to allow a period of three months for all interested parties to comment on the contents of the draft and the consultants will, in turn, be given an opportunity to respond.  At the end of that process, I will consider all of the issues involved and, if necessary, I will submit proposals to Government regarding visitor facilities for the Wicklow Mountains National Park.</P>
      <P>With regard to the former visitor centre site at Luggala, it is enclosed by a fence and the gates into it are locked. The site is a building site and it is not open to the public.  I understand that part of the fence and the locks on the gate were vandalised recently in an attempt by trespassers to gain unauthorised access but the damage caused has since been repaired.</P>

    <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to contact the target schools and invite applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  The process of contacting these schools is now under way.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of the upward trend in the number of students participating in the scheme since its inception, <Col N="819" /> priority this year is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students who have no other means of support, to participate.  The main focus of the scheme this year therefore is to provide places for third level students who are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned will complete a course of studies at the Regional Technical College, Tralee, this month, he is entitled to claim unemployment assistance if he cannot find work during the summer period.

      <P>As I mentioned in the House on several occasions over recent months, my Department received a communication from the EU Commission in Brussels confirming that the Commission has approved grant aid, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, amounting to ECU 376,806 for 194 workers made redundant in 1994-95.  A number of aspects of the commission's decision, and the conditions attached to the decision, have to be clarified by my Department before any payment can be made by the EU Commission.  My Department has been in touch with the Commission but it will be some more months before all matters are clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers to 205 workers being involved.  My Department initially applied for readaptation aid in respect of 205 workers in Irish Steel Ltd. as a result of the 1994 rationalisation plan. <Col N="820" /> This figure was revised to 194 to take account of workers who did not actually receive redundancy payments such as apprentices, workers who terminated their employment but were not made redundant, workers scheduled for redundancy but subsequently retained and a small number of additional redundancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is committed to the establishment of an independent European nuclear energy inspection force which would cover all aspects of safety related nuclear plants. Previous efforts to establish a European nuclear safety inspectorate did not succeed, primarily because a considerable number of member states were opposed to the idea.  Some nuclear member states insist that an independent inspection force to inspect the safety of plants on their territory is an unacceptable undermining of national sover-eignty.</P>
      <P>Nuclear countries have their own nuclear authorising and regulatory bodies. While safety conscious nuclear operators should have nothing to fear from an independent inspection of their operations, unfortunately, there is nothing to indicate that a fresh attempt to establish an inspectorate would be any more successful than the previous attempt.</P>
      <P>Recent progress has been made under the auspices of the International Energy Agency's Nuclear Safety Convention. Under Article 20 of the convention there is provision for peer review. Under this process, each state will be able to review the legislative and regulatory framework that governs the safety of nuclear installations of other contracting parties, which includes all member states of the EU.  It also provides for a review of the operational and safety procedures for nuclear installations and emergency preparedness. Because of the positive advance which peer review represents, I am exploring the possibility of seeking the incorporation of similar arrangements under the terms of the Euratom Treaty.</P>

    <P>The PESCA initiative is an EU-funded programme which aims to assist fishermen and those dependent on fisheries to respond to the structural changes in the fisheries sector by offering opportunities for diversification into other areas of economic activity.  Aid is available for a range of measures, such as marine tourism, stock enhancenment and management programmes and so on.  Over its duration, 1994-1999, about £5.5 million in EU funds and £1 million in national grants will be made available <Col N="825" /> to support total investment of around £10 million, which will directly benefit coastal communities dependent on fisheries.</P>
