      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance well at the European Council at the weekend.  There have been difficulties with other countries but in fairness our Ministers have worked hard at the Irish Presidency and everybody would feel proud of the commitment they have put in.  In particular I wish the Taoiseach well during the European Council and I look forward to debating the issues next week. I hope those who attempt to disrupt European Councils do not get their way and that the Taoiseach will have a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>An issue we discussed when talking about priorities for the Presidency was child pornography on the Internet.  A suggestion I made at that time, which I think found favour with the Taoiseach, was that we should set up a working group to deal with the censorship laws generally rather than try to deal with one particular issue.  Has any progress been made on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his exceptionally kind remarks which I appreciate at a personal level and I am sure that it true of all my colleagues.  The Deputy did suggest the setting up of a working group and that is being acted upon.  I cannot tell him the exact position, without notice, but significant progress has been made.  I will communicate in writing with the Deputy within the next 48 hours to let him know where it stands.  In regard to the general question of the use of the Internet for criminal purposes, I expect to be able to agree, when I go to Washington on Monday for the summit with President Clinton, on joint European United States action on that whole area of crime through the Internet or what is now generally known as cyber crime.  This will include child pornography and related offences as well as other forms of crime using the most modern electronic techniques.</P>

      <P>I join the leader of Fianna Fáil in wishing the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, well this weekend.  I have been very critical of the Government in regard to domestic <Col N="1607" /> matters, but it has performed exceptionally well in presiding over the affairs of Europe during the past six months.  Although we are a very small country, we can be rightly proud that the Government and the public service has done the job efficiently and well &mdash; I am aware of that from speaking to diplomats in recent months.  The country has performed exceptionally well and we can all be proud of that.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Harney's comments.  I hope the compliments are deserved and, if so, it shows that a small country can conduct a Presidency well.  Frequently it is easier for a small country holding the Presidency to get bigger countries to agree to matters which they might not be willing to agree in the Presidency of a big country.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam an coinbhinsiún seo a thabhairt faoi bhráid na Dála.  I mí Mheán Fómhair seo caite, mar fhreagra ar Cheist Pharlaiminte ón Teachta Eoin Ryan, dúirt mé go raibh mé tar éis údarás a fháil ón Rialtas rún a chur os comhair na Dála ag glacadh le téarmaí an choinbhinsiúin.  Dúirt mé freisin go mbeadh an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha ag déanamh ullmhúcháin, chun an Coinbhinsiún a cheangail, faoi réir aontú na Dála, don rún a bheadh á mholadh agamsa.  Tá rún den chineál sin á mholadh agam anois agus táim ag tnúth le tacaíocht a fháil dó ó Chomhaltaí an Tí seo.</P>
      <P>The convention, known as the Granada Convention, is one of the results of work on the co-ordination of policies on the protection of the architectural heritage which has been under way in the Council of Europe since the first European conference of Ministers responsible for the architectural heritage in 1968.  It was opened for signature in Granada, Spain, on 3 October 1985, when it was signed by Ireland, and as of 1 December 1996 has been signed by 29 of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe.  Of these, 23 have ratified the convention.  In addition, one non-member state, Bosnia-Herzegovina, has acceded to the convention.  The convention entered into force on 1 December 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions over the past year, we have discussed in this House the importance of conserving our architectural heritage for the present as well as for future generations.  It has <Col N="1609" /> been agreed on all sides that our built environment is a cultural resource developing over time and we achieve much of the understanding of our predecessors from the buildings we inherit.  Similarly, future generations will see the values of our society reflected in what we conserve from the past and which we build today.</P>
    <P>The ratification of the Granada Convention at this time is an important statement of our continuing commitment to the protection of the architectural heritage.  The convention provides member states with a means of proclaiming common principles for the protection of the architectural heritage of Europe.  It seeks to lay down European standards for the protection of the heritage and to set out a range of obligations which signatories undertake to implement.  These obligations relate to the identification of properties to be protected, the implementation of statutory protection procedures and the acceptance of responsibilities in a European context for the co-ordination of conservation policies.  The formal purpose of today's debate is to comply with Article 29 of the Constitution which requires Dáil approval to international conventions which involve a charge on public funds.</P>
    <P>The main undertakings to be given by states ratifying or acceding to the convention are: to ensure that the architectural heritage, which is defined as monuments, groups of buildings and sites, is given adequate statutory protection and that inventories are maintained; to implement appropriate supervision and authorisation procedures as required by the legal protection of the properties in question; to prevent the disfigurement, dilapidation or demolition of protected properties and, if they have not already done so, introduce legislation (a) requiring the submission to a competent authority of schemes for the demolition or alternation of protected monuments or buildings, the erection of new buildings or alterations impairing the character of sites, (b) permitting public authorities to require the owner of a protected property to carry out work or to carry out such work themselves if the owner fails to do so &mdash; as provided for under the convention, it is proposed to enter a reservation in respect of this provision &mdash; I will be returning to this matter later in my speech, and (c) allowing the compulsory purchase of protected properties; to prohibit the removal of protected monuments, except where the safeguarding of the monument makes its removal imperative; to provide financial support for maintaining and restoring the architectural heritage within the limits of the budgets available and use fiscal measures to facilitate the conservation of the architectural heritage; to ensure that infringements of the law protecting the architectural heritage are met with a relevant and adequate response by the competent authority; to adopt integrated conservation policies which (a) include the protection of the architectural heritage as an <Col N="1610" /> essential part of the planning process, (b) promote programmes for the restoration and maintenance of the architectural heritage, to make conservation, promotion and enhancement of the architectural heritage a major feature of cultural, environmental and planning policies; to facilitate, when possible, in the planning process the conservation of buildings whose intrinsic importance would not warrant protection but which are of interest because of their setting; to foster the application and development of traditional skills and materials; to foster the use of protected properties to meet contemporary needs &mdash; the re-use of properties with tradition and spirit &mdash; and the adaptation where appropriate of old buildings for new uses; to ensure that the consequences of permitting public access to protected properties, especially any structural development, do not adversely affect the architectural and historical character of such properties and their surroundings; to facilitate the implementation of conservation policies and foster effective co-operation between conservation, cultural, environmental and planning activities; to establish in the decision-making process machinery for the supply of information, consultation and co-operation between the State, local authorities, cultural institutions, associations and, most importantly, the public, and foster the development of sponsorship and non profit-making associations; to develop public awareness of the value of conserving the architectural heritage, which may be its best protection; to promote training in architectural heritage conservation skills; to exchange information on their conservation policies, when necessary, to afford mutual technical assistance in the form of exchanges of experience and experts; and to encourage exchanges of specialists in architectural heritage conservation, including those responsible for training.</P>
    <P>The convention also provides that a committee of experts will monitor the application of the convention and report periodically to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, and that the EU, or any state not a member of the Council of Europe, may be invited to accede to the convention.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, subject to a reservation being entered in respect of Article 4.2c, existing legislation and practice is adequate to give full effect to all of the obligations the convention will impose on the State on ratification.</P>
    <P>Article 4.2c obliges parties to the convention to introduce, if they have not already done so, legislation permitting public authorities to require the owner of a protected property to work on such a property or to do such work themselves if the owner fails to do so.  However, Article 25 of the convention permits any state, when signing, ratifying or acceding to the convention, to declare that it reserves the right not to comply with the provisions of Article 4.2c.  As of 1 December 1996 two states, the Netherlands and the United <Col N="1611" /> Kingdom, have entered such a reservation when ratifying the convention.  It is proposed to enter a reservation in respect of Article 4.2c, as public authorities do not currently have such powers, and the legal and financial implications of introducing powers enabling public authorities to require the owner of a protected property to work on the property, or to do such work themselves if the owner fails to do so, will require careful consideration.  In this regard it should be noted, and it is relevant, that this matter has been examined by an interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage, which has recommended in its report, to which I will refer further later, that such powers be introduced.  The Minister for the Environment and I are considering the report of the working group with a view to bringing forward to Government a package of proposals based on the report's recommendations and taking account of any observations received on those recommendations.  I hope to be in a position in the future to withdraw the Article 4.2c reservation.  As an indication of our commitment to the protection of our architectural heritage it is important that, subject to entering a reservation in respect of Article 4.2c, Ireland ratifies the convention without delay.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement for Government entitled <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a number of commitments in the heritage area.  Many of these have already been achieved during the past year and a half, most notably the establishment of the Heritage Council on a statutory basis in 1995 and the completion of the transfer of the heritage services to my Department this year.</P>
    <P>Another commitment is to improve the legislative system for the preservation of the architectural heritage and to put in place a system of related financial support.  In this regard I welcome the report of the interdepartmental working group entitled <i>Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage,</i> to which I referred earlier and which I laid before this House on 25 September.  The 64 recommendations in this report span a wide range of issues.  Acknowledging the existing listing system as part of the planning process, the working group recommends that this be built upon by addressing legislative and administrative weaknesses which currently exist.  The report proposes that &ldquo;listing&rdquo; should remain a responsibility of planning authorities but that it should become a mandatory statutory function supported by a centralised co-ordinating and advisory service.  There is a range of recommendations relating to the process of listing and the future control of development in relation to listed buildings.</P>
    <P>Both my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and I, are considering this report with a view to bringing forward to Government a package of proposals based on its recommendations and taking account of any <Col N="1612" /> observations received on those recommendations. Improving the protection of the architectural heritage is an ongoing process and such a package of proposals would be entirely in keeping with the spirit of the convention.  I recognise that the implementation of such proposals will have considerable resource implications.  However, the commitment of resources is desirable both on the grounds of the improved protection which will be afforded to the architectural heritage and the resulting tourism and employment benefits which will accrue to the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the financial support for the conservation of the built environment allocated under the sub-programme for urban and village renewal of the EU co-funded Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, administered by the Department of the Environment.  In particular I welcome the recent publication by the Department of the Environment of a comprehensive set of guidelines on building conservation which were launched by my colleague, Deputy McManus, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for housing and urban renewal.  The production of these guidelines was co-ordinated by the Irish Georgian Society and overseen by the Conservation Advisory Panel established to advise on the architectural conservation aspects of the operational programme.  It is encouraging to see the broad consensus which has developed in the protection of our architectural heritage and which, I am delighted to say, is reflected in this House.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, agus ag tagairt arís don rún atá é phlé anois, ba mhaith liom a dhearbhú arís go bhfuil an rún ag teacht os comhair an Tí seo de bharr riachtanais Airteagal 29, fo-Airteagal 5.2, den Bhunreacht, a deireann nach mbeidh chonradh idirnáisiúnta a chuirfeadh costas ar an gciste poiblí ina cheangal ar an Stát mura dtoileoidh Dáil Éireann le téarmaí an chonartha sin.

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of this convention is echoed in the recent Government report <i>Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage</i>.  That report was welcomed in a flurry of publicity by the Minister but, as he has admitted this morning in his contribution, the Government has not yet committed itself to accepting or implementing the report's recommendations.  The Minister stated also that he is still in discussion with the Minister for the Environment and he hopes at some stage in the future to be in a position to take on board some of the report's recommendations and observations.  That should be done soon to ensure that action is taken immediately.  The Minister will appreciate that much damage has been done, and continues to be done, to our heritage, particularly our architecture.  The sooner this issue is addressed will we ensure that further protections can be put in place and that our heritage is less under threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> The implementation of the report's recommendations would go a long way towards meeting the requirements of the convention.  It seems we are taking action approximately 12 years after signing the convention.  The definition of monuments specifically includes fixtures and fitting of buildings.  This makes it clear it is not merely the facade of buildings which is to be protected but also their interior, together with custom made furnishings.  It is not clear that existing legislation extends to interiors.  Fianna Fáil is sponsoring a Bill to provide that planning procedures will extend to interiors.</P>
    <P>Article 1 recognises that buildings cannot be judged in isolation &mdash; it may be a group of buildings rather than a single building or a landscape which includes buildings which is the relevant entity for protection.  The Government report to which I referred, by recommending that legislative action for conserving architectural heritage should be placed within the ambit of the planning laws, does not adopt this concept. Instead it bases protection firmly upon a &ldquo;building by building&rdquo; basis.  The idea of a conservation area, as outlined by Deputy Eoin Ryan in this North Great George's Street speech or by Deputy Bertie Ahern in his policy statement in the summer, does not appear in the Government work party report.  The relevance of that is that it is evidently ridiculous to list individual buildings in Merrion Square or in North Great George's Street.  It is the entire street or square that is the relevant entity for protection.</P>
    <P>The Government might feel the National inventory of architecture, which is ongoing, and the work party recommendation that listing of buildings be mandatory meets the requirements set out in Article 2 for an inventory of buildings and sites to be protected.  The timescale for the inventory of architecture is so long as to mean it cannot be relied on to represent compliance with Article 2.  Mandatory listing by local authorities is clearly essential.  In the meantime the State is the largest owner of heritage buildings in the country. It could, with little difficulty, produce an interim list of heritage buildings, based solely on buildings in its ownership and occupation. Deputy Eoin Ryan posed questions to Ministers during the past year asking them to identify buildings of architectural or historical interest occupied by them.  What it revealed was that for the most part, relevant Government Departments did not know whether they occupied any such buildings.</P>
    <P>At Parnell Street, we had the most recent instance of the Dangerous Buildings Section of Dublin Corporation directing that a building be demolished while it was the policy of the corporation to preserve that building.  If the work party report is acted upon that situation should not arise again.  It should be possible, however, to take immediate administrative action to ensure that the Dangerous Buildings Section of Dublin <Col N="1614" /> Corporation or of any local authority, does not serve a notice on a pre-1845 building without consultation with the relevant planning authorities and bodies such as the Irish Georgian Society and An Taisce.  That is a measure that could be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>Article 4.2 proposes compulsory purchase of a protected property in extreme situations.  The Government work party report exempted buildings occupied as a dwelling or as a Church from these provisions.  It seems there are no grounds for exempting a religious building which has been allowed to fall into decay, and a dwelling should not be exempted if alternative accommodation is provided to the owner.</P>
    <P>The tax reliefs available in Ireland hardly meet the requirements of Article 6 to provided financial support for maintaining architectural heritage. There is no provision for allowing relief for maintenance expenditure where it exceeds the income of the owner in the year in which it is incurred by carrying the excess forward or backward to other years; nor is relief permitted against capital gains tax as opposed to income tax.  The public opening conditions to which the income tax and capital acquisitions tax reliefs are subject are so onerous as to effectively deny the reliefs to many people.</P>
    <P>Article 10.4 is particularly relevant in Ireland. The quality of 19th century architecture in our small towns, particularly shop fronts, pub fronts and interiors, is only now beginning to be appreciated.  In Munster particularly there is wonderful plasterwork on the front of many 19th century commercial buildings in small towns, and the colour patterns in use are extraordinarily vivid.</P>
    <P>Article 12 raises a vital issue in Ireland.  If important Irish buildings are to benefit from tax relief, they must be open to the public.  They are being targeted by thieves and there has been serious loss of contents as a result.  The targeting of these houses now appears to be quite systematic, and to be related to public access. Despite this, the Government continues to refuse to confirm that income tax relief would be available for the installation of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other precautions.  The historical character of such properties is bound to be affected if their more valuable contents are stolen.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in that measures for the conservation of important buildings, where they are based on the taxation code, do not work well on a cross-Border basis.  If a UK-resident individual owns an important Irish house, the Irish income tax relief for the maintenance costs is of no value to him, since there is no similar relief available in Britain.  The only results of Ireland granting a tax relief in such a situation is to leave his total tax burden unchanged but to ensure that a greater proportion of it than would otherwise be the case would be payable in Britain where there is no similar relief.  The same problem arises in relation to an Irish resident who <Col N="1615" /> has substantial taxable income in other member states of the EU.  The availability of the relief at home will not lower the foreign tax burden. There is a need for all the member states of the EU to grant mutual recognition to the tax reliefs which each state grants in relation to its national heritage.  If an Irish person dies owning a French building which is exempt from inheritance taxes in France by reason of its importance, Ireland should likewise exempt it from Irish inheritance tax.  That is not the case at present.  This is something which can only be tackled on an EU-wide basis.  It is unfortunate that our Presidency was not used to push through something sensible in this area.  It would have been non-controversial and very useful in the overall approach to our heritage.</P>
    <P>The fundamental proposition of the Government work party report that the protection of the architectural heritage should be based on planning laws is flawed.  Planning laws can only prevent future abuses of the heritage. They cannot correct past abuses which have slipped through the net.  They cannot compel the cessation of activities, for example, car repairs being carried on in a mews, which have been carried on for a long time.  Neither can they deal with matters such as traffic pollution or inappropriate street signs and furniture.  The planning laws are negative in character.  A more proactive approach is needed in addition to the planning laws.  The more important areas, such as the central Georgian areas of Dublin, require positive management, not merely negative protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little stomach for this debate. The Minister's presentation struck me as being full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  As we sign up to this convention we have no proper modern conservation law.  We could have because, not more than nine months ago, I put before the House conservation legislation that was adjudged by all the experts to meet all their requirements and give proper protection to our architectural heritage.  To our shame and discredit it was voted down by the Minister and the members of his Government.</P>
      <P>Our public utterances sound very good but there is a big gap between what we say and what we do.  It is small consolation to be told there is a comprehensive report if we always seem to be one report away from action.  It is highly ironic that a shameful decision was made yesterday to give permission to destroy two listed buildings on College Green, which is the historic home of Grattan's Parliament.</P>

    <P>Under the conservation legislation I prepared, College Green would have been designated a conservation area and each building there, listed or not, would have been required by law to conform to the overall historic importance and architectural merit of the area.  However, our dereliction as legislators in not having proper <Col N="1616" /> conservation law in place has allowed permission to be given to a development in College Green which will fundamentally and irretrievably alter its historic and architectural character.  It was allowed to happen because we have no legislation to give proper protection in law to areas of major historic importance.</P>
    <P>On RTE's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning I heard a Dublin City councillor who is a member of my party say that this is a Dublin issue.  It is not; it is a national issue.  College Green's rich historical symbolism and importance and its rich architectural legacy is as much my inheritance as a Cork person as is it that of a Dublin person.  I am particularly upset at what happened.</P>
    <P>The Hilton hotel group is, of course, pleased to locate its hotel on College Green.  We would all be delighted to have such a prestigious commercial address and would pay a lot for it. The issue was presented in a stark way on radio this morning, being portrayed as a choice between a hotel or an office building.  Such a presentation is testament to the dereliction of our thinking.</P>
    <P>Delay is the deadliest form of neglect and we have delayed for too long in putting in place proper conservation legislation.  I cannot foresee such legislation on the Statute Book in the lifetime of the Government.  However, even if it is, sufficient destruction will have been done between the time the Progressive Democrats Bill was rejected by this House and the time the new legislation is enacted to disgrace us as legislators.</P>
    <P>There is little point in listing buildings if the listing has no statutory backing.  What has happened in respect of the development in College Green has made a mockery of the system of listing.  Past experience teaches us that listing must be mandatory.  Every local authority must be obliged to list buildings of artistic, historic or architectural importance.</P>
    <P>Within the last six months a building of prime historic importance in Cork city was demolished because there was no law to protect it.  There was no system of incentives to assist a new owner and developer to redevelop the building and preserve its essential historical features.  The house to which I refer is that in which Tomás MacCurtain, Lord Mayor of Cork, was murdered in March 1920.  That building was an essential part of the country's history.  As a concerned citizen with a sense of history I wanted it preserved for this and future generations.  However, it was demolished. Once again it is the result of our failure to put in place legislation to protect it.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with those who acquired the building in bad structural condition but did not have the resources to restore it in a fitting manner.  There is a proper system of incentives for such cases in Northern Ireland, where about £10 million a year is available in incentives for developers to preserve and develop buildings in accordance with proper preservation principles. This is not always an easy task.  If buildings are not refurbished or redeveloped with a proactive <Col N="1617" /> investment incentive approach they will drift into dereliction.  We do not have such a system.</P>
    <P>I am not enthusiastic about agreeing to this convention.  It will do nothing to preserve Cologne Cathedral, for example.  Germany and the other modern civilised democracies do not need me to tell them how to preserve their architectural heritage because they have done so in the past and are good at it.  We are bad at doing so and many of our cities have been allowed to drift into dereliction through official neglect or have been developed in accordance with the worst possible planning, development and conservation principles.</P>
    <P>I could list many buildings in Dublin that ought to have been preserved which have gone in the last seven or eight months.  My party agrees with this convention and to our conforming to its principles.  However, I appeal to the Minister to finish the consultation process speedily and present conservation legislation to the House early next year.  He will receive the co-operation he needs from the Progressive Democrats in processing it.  Any further delay would be a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this convention.  It is important that an effort is made to conserve buildings of architectural and other merit.  The list of conditions attached to the convention is such that there would be a wide range of buildings in this country suitable for preservation or conservation, not just for their architectural value but also for historical reasons.  One of these is the cottage which Deputy de Valera's grandfather built in Bruree, County Limerick, which is of no architectural value but is of great historical importance.  The same applies to Tomás MacCurtain's house in Blackpool in Cork which, as Deputy Quill said, was knocked down in recent months.  There was a plaque on the wall for 75 years which was seen by all the members of Cork Corporation and the public in Cork.  As we all allowed the building to fall into poor condition, we cannot pass the buck to anybody else.  With McSweeney House, it should have been preserved.</P>
      <P>In my youth I remember an architecturally equally important house being knocked down to make way for an extremely ugly development.  It was known as The Doll's House on Lavitt's Quay, the setting for &ldquo;The Saint and Mary Kate&rdquo; by Frank O'Connor, and was worth preserving. There were no laws or conventions to prevent it being razed to the ground, except public opinion, which failed.  Many buildings, which may in their time have been architecturally important, were knocked down to make way for the magnificent Georgian buildings which surround the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of what is worth preserving is in private hands, owned by people who do not have the funds or the interest to preserve it or do not appreciate the value of the properties they have on their hands.  As the Deputies who know me are aware, I am very much against increasing <Col N="1618" /> public expenditure but I ask the Minister to consider tweaking the urban renewal scheme to give tax incentives to encourage people to preserve their buildings rather than forcing local authorities to take them over if they fail to do so. Tax incentives are already provided to encourage people to invest in the film industry and the arts. There should be similar incentives to encourage people to invest in the preservation of buildings of architectural importance.</P>
    <P>We pay much attention &mdash; this is pretentious but true &mdash; to the elimination of poverty in a material sense.  We should also pay much attention to the elimination of poverty of the mind.  If we do not educate as well as feed our people, the children who will be reared in this society in a generation or two will be extremely deprived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>People will have to be educated about our stately homes.  In Westport House, Westport has one of our finest stately homes. Lord Altamont has sought funds from the State for many years to preserve this beautiful building which is visited by many thousands of people throughout the year.  I agree with Deputy Barry that the State should assist the owners of stately homes of which there are about nine remaining in Connacht.  At one time there were many hundreds dotted throughout the country.  If we continue present policy, there will be none left. Our stately homes have much to offer to visitors and remind us of our past.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister or an official of his Department discuss with Jeremy Browne how Westport House can be preserved and become an asset to the State?  I see nothing wrong with the State assisting private individuals.  Turlough House, near Castlebar, has been purchased by Mayo County Council with the aid of grants from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Jeremy Browne and Lord Altamont should be assisted also.  I agree with Deputy Barry that tax incentives should be given.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will respond positively to my request.  Lord Altamont has written to every Government Department.  He has informed me that for the first ten years he was told about budgetary problems whereas now the Departments refer to criteria.  He has made every effort to keep his beautiful stately home intact and is fed up receiving letters from officials.  What he wants is action.</P>

      <P>This convention was available for signature since 1985.  Everyone would agree that eleven years was a long time to wait.  I do not want to rake over the past but for most of those eleven years I was not the responsible Minister.</P>

      <P>There is now consensus on these issues on all sides of the House.  It is a great pity that, when the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Molloy, was Minister for Local Government, when people talked about physical planning, there was not the same degree of consciousness of the need for conservation, or of the status of buildings about which we have heard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry made a valuable point, Cork is not the only place where elected members and the public went sailing by a house with a plaque on the wall without counting the nettles which had appeared.  I will not accept responsibility for the comprehensive neglect and philistinism of those who have gone before me.  I will co-operate with anybody trying to do something about it, that is the purpose of the study.  There is no point in doing anything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and I intend to bring forward a package of proposals aimed at strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage for consideration by the Government early next year.  Implementation of these proposals will require the Commitment of substantial resources.  I consider this to be desirable because of the improved protection which will be afforded to the architectural heritage and the resulting tourism and employment benefits.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving the support of the Deputies opposite and their parties in seeking an exception from restraint on public expenditure in the areas for which I have responsibility, arts, culture and the Gaeltacht.  I am sure they are willing to say that they will forget about financial rigour because of the importance of these areas.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Quill for her interest in preparing legislation. Everything will be taken into account, which is the right way to do it.  I inherited a wasteland of sorts which we must now fill with the best legislation while taking account of all the views that have been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with what Deputy Quill said concerning the planning decision of yesterday.  I am not making a narrow point about that, but it is important to remember that the statutory planning authority handed down the decision which seems to fly in the face of concerns expressed by a number of people and groups interested in conservation.  Protection of <Col N="1621" /> architectural heritage is clearly needed and I hope issues like that will be addressed in the proposals we will bring forward.  I know they will receive the support of colleagues in Government and, subsequently, the support of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera raised the point of a timetable and I hope to be able to bring forward those proposals early next year to address most if not all of her concerns, including the administrative, legislative and financial requirements.  I also listened with great care to some of her other proposals.  While the State has a role, it is worth examining how tax, as opposed to expenditure, that is foregone can be dealt with in terms of tax incentives.  I am sympathetic to that and I will have it examined.  They are practical proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I also agree that the definition in relation to conservation and preservation should not be overly physical in terms of architecture.  There are buildings whose intimate connection with historical events, periods and individuals gives them a status which has to be respected.  I am sympathetic to that point also. Deputy Peter Barry mentioned that and I agree with him.  There is another side to the argument. Having been on two local authorities for a long period, I remember that in Galway city the list on the back of the plan was provided by An Taisce. It is appropriate to pay tribute to that body for doing this voluntarily when the statutory requirement was not there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The package of proposals will include a number of mandatory provisions as well as other suggestions which might address the territory between private ownership and public responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am not making a political point because several Governments have held office since the 1960s but it would be hard for me not to conclude, from looking at some of the crises and issues that are thrown up, that one part of local administration is at times in contention with another.  For example, elected members give speeches at meetings in favour of conservation and preservation while at the same time other sections of local government bureaucracy evaluate buildings in terms of their safety and insurance.  There is not always a clear consistency between the two.  It is also perfectly clear that the whole atmosphere of preservation and conservation, including streetscapes, has suffered from the fact that a kind of physical, linear and engineering preoccupation has informed planning separately from the wider aesthetic, social and communal criteria which are carried in architecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention one more contentious point.  According to the best information <Col N="1622" /> available to me, there are only two architects in senior positions in local authorities.  That position is not acceptable and it indicates how the physical, functional and linear aspects got a grip on the compositional elements of planning.  The architectural eye desperately needs to be widened to include the social definitions that Deputies spoke about.  I will bear all these considerations in mind in bringing forward the proposals next year.  I thank Deputies for their interest, what they have said and their support for the ratification motion.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House represents a major building block in the establishment of an appropriate legislative structure to facilitate the development of our cultural heritage.  It has been my objective since I became the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to move the areas within my remit from their current low level of development and provide them with a proper framework for legislative, financial and staffing development into the future.  I am pleased, therefore, to bring forward this Bill which provides a new legal framework for the operations of the National Museum and the National Library as well as a range of other measures to facilitate the development of cultural institutions and the protection of Ireland's moveable heritage.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of autonomous boards to manage and care for the collections in the National Museum and the National Library; it proposes measures to enhance the development of the Genealogical Office and of heraldry matters both within the framework of, and as a branch of, the National Library; it makes further provision in respect of the National Gallery; it proposes an indemnity scheme to permit exhibitions of international calibre to be seen on a regular basis; it proposes to extend indemnity to cultural objects of central importance; and it proposes to provide increased protection for all objects of cultural importance wherever they are situated within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also proposed are other ways and means through application of legislative actions by which the National Museum and National Library may be enabled to develop their collections, not least through providing extension <Col N="1623" /> of deposit copyright arrangements.  By means of such changes we hope to create structures through which, on a systematic basis, the living memory and achievements of all facets of society may be collected, to facilitate the study of anyone who wishes to understand what has moulded the Ireland of today.</P>

Ach diaidh ar ndiaidh, ligeadh chun báin na hinstitiúidí maorga seo &mdash; níor tugadh go leor aird ar na riachtanais reachtúla, struchtúrtha agus acmhainne a mbíonn ag teastáil le haghaidh na bunstruchtúir a chruthú a dhéanfaidh doiciméadú agus caomhnú ar stair na ndaoine.  An leor é le rá go raibh an Stát i gcónaí gafa le héilimh níos práinní?

    <P>Seans gur féidir teacht ar fhreagraí nó ar mhíniú ar an neamh-aire seo i measc cúiseanna éagsúla cosúil le córas riaracháin lochtach.  Nó b'fhéidir gur féidir milleán a chur ar an dearcadh sean-fhaiseanta nach raibh i musaem ach spás stórála, nár bhain éinne úsáid as ach aicmí áirithe agus nach raibh aon úsáid oiliúna ag baint leis.</P>
    <P>Certainly there was nothing less than insufficient appreciation of the importance of past records in the task of understanding the present.  An understanding of the past illuminates and explains the present.  We understand our place in the world, within our country and our local community, only when we can identify from where we came, and locate where we belong. What is the evidence?  The evidence is (1)  a school register showing a gradual increase or decline in numbers, (2) a victriolic comment by a great writer made in a private letter, (3) plaster casts by different designers for a civic monument, or a case put in a representation to a public representative by a constituent.  An awareness of the need to collect the data, the will to collect it and the capacity to retrieve it are all necessary prerequisites, but are still not sufficient.  The general public must feel that it shares in the common ownership of its heritage; that the moveable heritage is something to be seen, appreciated and used.  There must be structures to permit ready involvement by the general <Col N="1624" /> public.  Access to one's heritage is a basic human right of every citizen, and the principle encompasses not just a right, theoretically understood &mdash; or understood in practice by a few &mdash; but a right embedded in the minds of every citizen.  In this wide sense, the whole ethos of the Bill has, therefore, been infused with the philosophy of access.</P>
    <P>I reflect that view when I provide that the Minister of the day, who is accountable to Dáil Éireann in representing the public, will be responsible for appointing all the members of the boards for the museum and library and that such persons will serve in their personal capacities. While another approach might have been automatic appointment of nominees of cultural bodies, this would not have been as direct or as openly democratic as a structure where any citizen, regardless of educational background and attainment, may legitimately aspire to give service on one or both of these boards.  It is my conviction that the person in the best position to make the choice of appointment is the Minister of the day taking into account the various factors, one of which might be a person's service in a particular relevant cultural organisation.  This is the furthest possible position from a policy of exclusion, a philosophical approach underlining that elitism does not and will not inform any part of the thinking behind this Bill.  I do not know whether it is appropriate to do so but I must state that I value the contributions made by Senators, particularly Senator Mooney, during the debate on this Bill in the Upper House.</P>
    <P>Coming to grips with the subject of access in its various facets also means tackling other difficult issues head-on, one of which is the questions of general entry charges.  Therefore, what I am creating in statute is a pragmatic procedural arrangement, established securely within a democratic framework &mdash; without predetermining the outcome &mdash; which permits, as warranted, at an appropriate stage in future years, real debate on the substantive issue. Currently there is no specified procedure setting out a framework for debate.  As of now, and without such a legislative provision, I would be quite entitled on behalf of the National Museum and National Library, to introduce general entry charges; and the National Gallery could so act without seeking my consent.  This measure recognises that a policy issue is involved in which it is appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have a role.  This can only happen, as proposed in the Bill, when an order is moved through the Houses of the Oireachtas to which they assent.  Divisions arose in the Seanad with regard to whether we should not be required to introduce further legislation or whether the assent of both Houses would be required if the matter were discussed.</P>
    <P>The national cultural institutions of the National Museum and National Library are built on the achievements of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.  It was in 1877, <Col N="1625" /> through the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, that the institutions came into being. However, the Act did not create institutions; the substance of the Act deals rather with conveyances of land and transfer of collections. To find the institutions one must look further behind the workings of that Act, to a formal agreement entered into in 1881 by the then Department of Science and Art within the Royal Dublin Society.  This agreement established a board of visitors for the National Museum and the Botanic Gardens, and a council of trustees for the National Library.  Another agreement made in 1890 with the Royal Irish Academy transferring subject to safeguards, its collections to the care of the State, completed the original structures for the museum and library.</P>
    <P>The institutions of the museum and library, although commonly perceived as independent entities, are fully integrated into the central State apparatus, the staff being civil servants and both institutions being part of my Department.  Under the basic legal structure, the State holds the executive managerial duties relating to the museum.  The duties of the board of visitors for the National Museum, which includes Government, Royal Dublin Society and Royal Irish Academy appointees, are confined to an advisory role.  The administration of the National Library has also been a function of the State.  The council of trustees, appointed by me and by the RDS, has only a supervisory role.  Another constituent part of the National Library is the Genealogical Office, recognised in 1943, but with antecedents in the specialist field of heraldry dating back to the 16th century.</P>

    <P>Despite the durability of the structures there has been a long recognised need to formally delegate decision-making to the museum and library, particularly on issues relating to care and management of the collections.  Every commissioned report on the museum &mdash; these were carried out in 1927, 1947, 1949, 1985 and 1995 &mdash; has concluded that the departmental structure has been a poor basis for managing and developing the museum.  Successive reports of boards of visitors have pointed out, in ever more urgent terms, the multiplicity of curatorial problems, ranging in all areas of work, including storage, conservation and exhibition.  The reports have pointed to the urgent need for the appointment of an autonomous board. Administrative reports in relation to the Library have also indicated strongly that its underlying <Col N="1626" /> formal basis and structures need to be defined and set out in statute.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that the establishment of autonomous boards for the museum and library is proposed.  Autonomy provided by means of statutorily established boards will give these institutions greater discretion over the handling of budgets, some flexibility over personnel resources, stronger powers to develop policies on acquisitions, the holding of exhibitions and integrating the institutions into the national culture; all within a broad compass of guiding principles set by the Oireachtas, not least on the important subjects of loans and disposal of cultural objects.</P>
    <P>The Genealogical Office is a valuable cultural resource.  So also is the long-standing practice of confirming and granting coats of arms by an official of the National Library known as the &ldquo;Chief Herald&rdquo;.  The title of &ldquo;Chief Herald&rdquo; has its origins in what was the &ldquo;Ulster Office of Arms&rdquo;, more commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Office of the Chief Herald&rdquo;, and has been in existence since 1552 when the title of &ldquo;Chief Herald&rdquo; was passed in the form of a personal patent from person to person by the British monarch of the day.  This practice continued up to 1919 when the last chief herald was appointed in accordance with long established practice.  He continued to be paid by the British authorities up until his death in 1940, with the rest of the office staff being paid by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The Genealogical Office is regarded as having been established by virtue of the Allocation of Administration (Genealogical Office) Order made in 1943 which gave responsibility for this office to the Minister for Education.  I wish to respond to a letter in a newspaper which reported on the controversy.  The office was not formed late in 1943 as a result of a public outcry.  The Cabinet papers for the period show that the then Government took a decision in regard to the office of the chief herald early in 1943.  That Government was very interested in this complicated problem and rightly spent much time on it.  Since 1943 the Genealogical Office has existed as a distinct entity within the framework of the National Library, as well as being linked administratively to it.  Staffing and budgeting have always been treated in the context of the library's functioning.  A separate Government decision in 1943 provided that the function of granting arms should continue and be performed by the chief genealogical officer or his deputy.  The staff working in the Genealogical Office were appointed as staff of the library.</P>
    <P>The National Library, including the Genealogical Office, are part of the overall responsibility of the relevant Minister of the day, a responsibility which currently falls within the remit of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It has been my objective to enhance the potential of the cultural resources represented by genealogy and heraldry, both of which are closely connected to history, records <Col N="1627" /> and librarianship.  There is need for a clear governance structure which would give us administrative accountability.  Even though the Genealogical Office has always been linked administratively to the National Library, the absence of such a structure has been a source of considerable difficulty in the past and I was anxious to remedy this problem.  In the light of representations from those with a close interest in these subjects, I have striven to achieve the objective without upsetting or undermining deeply held beliefs about the Genealogical Office or, as it is also called, the Office of the Chief Herald.</P>
    <P>The current status of the Genealogical Office is being recognised in primary statute.  The executive function of granting and confirming of coats of arms by the Chief Herald of Ireland is to be recognised for the first time in primary statute and will also be underwritten by the will of the people through an Act of the Oireachtas.  I am satisfied that these and the other legislative initiatives taken in the Bill amount to a substantial strengthening of the case of genealogy and heraldry and take an historic step in enabling these important cultural resources to reach their full potential, in the process helping to consolidate a commonality of feeling among the diaspora that constitutes the Irish people, all of whom have a natural and legitimate interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>In seeking to create autonomous boards the Government could not but consider carefully the respective roles of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society which were set out in the agreements of 1881 and 1890.  Their work during the 19th century in establishing the core of the collections of the museum and library and their watchful eye over the past 100 years demand a response from the State which is founded on the principle of some continuation of these roles. As the legislation will give the new boards functions which could have been perceived as altering the rights of these bodies, discussions were necessary in advance of proposing the Bill. I am pleased to say that the extensive discussions which took place with these bodies resulted in the signing of new agreements which build on those of 1881 and 1890 and which seek to remove possible sources of difficulty that might otherwise have had to be tackled by legislative action if a new agreement had not been negotiated.</P>
    <P>As a central part of the agreements, the Oireachtas is being asked, through this Bill, to approve that the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society be given the right to make a list of nominations to the new boards, from which the Minister of the day will choose a number to serve in a personal capacity, in accordance with my basic philosophical approach in relation to what I regard as best democratic practice.  It is important to stress the contingent nature of these agreements in so far as the Oireachtas must first approve what is provided <Col N="1628" /> for in the Bill before they can come into force.  I am satisfied that what has been agreed is appropriate and necessary to ensure the optimum working of the new boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the change of status of the staff of the museum and library following the establishment of the autonomous boards.  I will deal with these changes in greater detail when outlining the provisions of the Bill.  I assure the Dáil that I and my Department have discussed, and will continue to discuss, the implementation of the Bill with the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions in regard to indemnity measures.  These are designed to facilitate the holding of exhibitions and thereby heighten the public consciousness and appreciation of all types of cultural objects.  At present a certain level of indemnity is provided by the Government on a case by case basis.  A special <i>aide-mémoire</i> has to be prepared for the Government on every occasion and the Bill will enable this matter to be dealt with in a more generic way.  A clear need exists for a comprehensive, statutory based scheme.  While such cover is provided only for exhibition areas which meet the highest standards, it has to be recognised that regardless of how well a building is secured there will always be an element of risk. It is this risk which the proposed indemnity system covers.  An upper monetary limit of £150 million outstanding by them is provided for, with a minimum value of £1 million per indemnity.</P>
    <P>While indemnities are mainly required for visiting exhibitions, there are rare instances where it is either necessary or highly desirable to offer long-term indemnities to encourage certain heritage objects to be brought into the care of the State, subject to an overall total liability of £20 million outstanding at any time.  Providing cover to the full value of the artefact and, by its nature for an indefinite period, would be an unacceptable and inappropriate burden on the State.  A strictly limited form of indemnity only in this area is being proposed in the Bill.  Indemnity against loss or damage is capped at 10 per cent of the value or £1 million, whichever is the lower.</P>
    <P>The establishment of boards for the National Museum and National Library and providing a system of indemnity cover will be of considerable assistance in deepening an awareness of heritage objects as a constituent part of culture.  However, it is essential also to provide ways and means whereby heritage items may appropriately be protected from being lost to the country.  At present only archaeological objects are afforded full protection under the law, and this includes the right of the Minister of the day to refuse a licence for export.  A more effective and general degree of protection which takes into account a broader range of cultural objects is required.  As a first step in the process of putting in place reasonable levels of protection, I propose to establish a register of certain heritage cultural items whose export would be a serious loss to the heritage of the country.  In drawing up a register <Col N="1629" /> it is not being implied that other objects are not of equal heritage importance.  We do not want to discourage the inflow of cultural items by private collectors &mdash; the discouragement being the knowledge of existence of an export prohibition &mdash; since such collectors may later decide to place such items in the care of a public body.  The degree of protection to be afforded must depend on various circumstances, balancing the interests involved.  The Bill will apply the strongest regulatory controls only to registered heritage objects already in public care.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions which will facilitate lending between the main collecting institutions and deal with any conflict arising from an overlap of collection policy.  Lending provisions are designed to encourage lending by the museum to local museums while safeguarding the care of the objects.  A procedure is also being introduced to resolve disputes between local public museums and the National Museum as to which institution is the appropriate place in which archaeological objects owned by the State should be held.  These arbitration procedures are intended to be a last resort only and it is not anticipated that they will be needed, not to speak of being used on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Since 1945, by virtue of the Documents and Pictures Act, 1945, passed in that year, there has been an export licence requirement in respect of documents over 100 years old and paintings regardless of age and value.  Licences are issued by the Minister of the day, a responsibility currently falling to me. The licence must, in all cases, be granted upon request.  I am seeking in the first instance to reenact what is already in place but I envisage too that the current export licence provisions concerning paintings will be more targeted than has been the case since 1945.  The definition of paintings has been restricted to paintings of at least 25 years old that originated in Ireland or which have been retained in the State for 25 years.  Documents over 100 years old already need a licence before being exported, and a reduction in the limit to at least 70 years is seen as necessary from the archival perspective.  That is what is proposed in the Bill.  An option for the Minister of the day to change age stipulations is also being provided &mdash; the Minister can do so by order &mdash; and options to set monetary values under which various licence requirements would not apply.</P>
    <P>A new export licence category is proposed in relation to the decorative arts.  The decorative arts are Irish manufactured objects, like antique glass, furniture and Belleek pottery, all of which constitute an important and integral part of the National Museum's collection in the sphere of art and industry.  It is timely, therefore, that the decorative arts should be recognised in this way.</P>
    <P>The possibility of other categories of cultural objects needing protection from being lost to the country in the future cannot be excluded.  The Bill includes the power to permit the Minister of the <Col N="1630" /> day to extend the categories for which there is a licence requirement.  A fine is being introduced for non-compliance with the requirement to obtain the necessary export licence.  In the interests of consolidation, all the relevant export licensing requirements are to be grouped together.  This consolidation process will permit the repeal of the Documents and Pictures Act, 1945, in its entirety, as well as separate export controls on archaeological objects contained in the National Monuments Acts.</P>
    <P>There are many valuable cultural objects in the long-term care of public authorities but not in the outright ownership of the State.  As a result of instances that have arisen occasionally in the past, there is always the possibility that a private owner may seek to reclaim from a public authority an important heritage item in its care for many years, with a view to its export and sale on the international market, and where the public authority, or the person's successors who may not be of the same mind as the original donor, would be virtually powerless to avoid the loss.  There is potential for controversy unless provisions are put in place now that attempt to balance the rights of the owner and the interests of the common good.  To deal with such potentially fraught situations, procedures are set out in the Bill within which the State may acquire registered cultural objects in public care, compulsory if necessary.</P>
    <P>While the National Gallery's legislative structure has served it well over the decades, some of the new provisions for the National Museum and the National Library would be useful and appropriate if they were to be applied to the National Gallery.  Such provisions would include a power for the National Gallery to draw up by-laws on the same basis as the National Museum and the National Library and provisions in relation to annual reports and accounts and borrowing powers.  The opportunity afforded by the Bill is being taken to provide for these.</P>
    <P>At present, the National Library can purchase library material that is not subject to the book deposit requirements of the Copyright Act, 1963. With the development of new technologies, the range and volume of such material has expanded substantially.  However, the scope for extending collections through purchase in the ordinary course is limited to what can be afforded by way of the annual grant allocation.  A lack of sufficient resources over a long period has led to fragmented private sector activities in various archival fields, for example, in the subjects of theatre, film, music and architecture.  To bring greater cohesion to the function of collecting items representative of our past, the remit of the National Library needs to be strengthened to respond adequately to the broad range of interests and in ways that do not impose too onerous a cost on the collecting institution. Accordingly, the Bill will now allow the National Library, on a planned and phased basis as storage and retrieval resources permit, to gradually <Col N="1631" /> expand its collection of books where the subject matter relates substantially to Ireland and to take into account the development of new technologies since 1963.</P>
    <P>The rating position of this country's cultural institutions continues to be founded on the Scientific Societies Act, 1843, which provides that &ldquo;scientific and fine arts societies&rdquo; are to be exempted from rating.  This provision is founded on the premise of what constituted the arts in the middle of the 19th century.  It is not yet established if the National Museum and the National Library or the Heritage Council would automatically be adjudged &ldquo;scientific societies&rdquo; for rates exemption purposes.  In addition, while a centrally important cultural institution, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, has managed to attain rates exemption in respect of its activities, the Abbey Theatre, also centrally important, has been refused rates exemption.  This Bill ensures, therefore, that certain listed cultural institutions, including the National Museum and the National Library, engaged exclusively in the fields of the arts or heritage shall be exempt from rates.</P>
    <P>Other provisions enhancing the independence of cultural institutions include a facility permitting the issue of intoxicating liquor licences for certain of the key collecting institutions.  I watched with wry despair as the media concentrated for two weeks on this one aspect of a long and detailed Bill.  Only those bodies with important collections and under the aegis of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be included.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for desirable changes which, in their own, might not justify separate legislative action or which arise from the establishment of the National Museum and the National Library as autonomous boards.  These provisions include the repealing of redundant legislation relating to theatres; requiring the main collecting institutions to provide assistance to the Heritage Council, widening the basis of membership of Marsh's Library at the request of its board of governors and guardians, making some adjustments to specific provisions in the National Monuments Acts in relation to archaeological objects owned by the State, and affirming that the maintenance of the premises of the National Museum and the National Library will remain the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessarily focused on the many structures and mechanisms needed to aid the development of our national cultural institutions and to help them reach their full potential. Nonetheless, legislative action, while essential, cannot be relied on to be the only building block in the process of regeneration.  To seek to enact procedural changes without putting in place the resources to develop these institutions would be tantamount to frustrating the intent behind the legislative measures.  I accept it will be a battle for whoever is the Minister to adequately <Col N="1632" /> resource the new regime the Bill will bring into existence.  The optimal development of the National Museum and the National Library requires the development of their financial and staff resources in a sustained manner.  While developments must take place within the framework of relevant Government policies, I am fully committed to making the maximum progress possible in these areas.</P>
    <P>Ba phointe siombalach tábhachtach i bhforbairt síceach mhuintir na hÉireann é búnú an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta i 1993.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is welcome that the Minister has at last brought substantial legislation to this House.  In his four years in office he has graced this House with few Bills, in contrast to what was promised by him and by the Government when it took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on previous occasions that there have been few Ministers who have been dealt such a good hand.  Before he took office and became a national cultural institution in his own right, the Minister had received the go ahead for Téilifís na Gaeilge via the Fianna Fáil Labour document,<i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>.  He also had a ready-made plan for the film industry, a newly established Heritage Council and a strong legacy left by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who had given tax breaks to artists, established Aosdána, founded the Museum of Modern Art, saved Temple Bar and created a thriving cultural quarter there, removed VAT from books and developed Government Buildings.  For any successor the bulk of the work was already done and there was plenty of scope for legislative endeavour.  This, however, has not been the case.  With just four months to an <Col N="1633" /> election, the Minister still has four bills on the list of promised legislation and the long list of promises still to be attended to look set to disappear into the mists of his constituency.</P>
    <P>Unusually, the Minister seems keen to get this Bill through the House quickly and wants Second Stage over quickly.  Is it because he wants to appoint the new boards for the National Library and the National Museum before he leaves office?  The Bill offers him considerable opportunities for political patronage and he is never shy to avail of them.  His proposals in the Bill on appointments disenfranchise groups that, for many years, were the only friends of the National Museum and the National Library.  No longer will the RDS or the Royal Irish Academy have a say in appointments.  While they can send the Minister a list, they have no say over whom he appoints.  Had the RDS or the Royal Irish Academy retained power of appointment over one or two places, it would have made virtually no difference because the Minister's direct appointments would still dominate the board. The other bodies' appointments would have been symbolic, but the Minister abandoned that with scant regard.</P>
    <P>He has recently made new appointments to the Irish Film Board.  If my reading of the film legislation is correct, this will ensure the Minister's appointment to the chair will continue long after he has gone to new political pastures. While I have nothing against any of the individuals involved with the Irish Film Board &mdash; they are all fine people &mdash; it would have been better if the Minister had made interim appointments until the outgoing board's term was up.  I understand the chairperson's term runs to April, when a new chair and board will be appointed.  This could possibly be under a new Minister, but the Minister decided to make new appointments immediately.  He could have appointed an acting chairman until the current board's term was up, but he decided to fill the vacancies now.</P>
    <P>While I accept there is a need for updating the structures associated with our national institutions, enacting procedural changes without putting resources in place is a con.  Fancy board structures will not disguise the lack of resources from which the National Library, in particular, suffers.  The library is at breaking point.  Even though a strategic plan was prepared in 1992 it has been left on the shelf by the Minister.  The library is so short of resources it has to close two mornings a week to enable night openings. It is ironic that on the day the Minister went to brief the library about the Bill, it had to shut down as it could not afford a skeleton staff.  Our National Library has the shortest opening hours in western Europe.  Its manuscript room is closed at lunch time and tea time and its resources for acquiring manuscript collections are practically non-existent.</P>
    <P>The most recent loss is the collection of James Connolly's letters.  As the inheritor of his left <Col N="1634" /> wing legacy, it is sad that a Labour Minister is presiding over the library's demise.  Even if the library had acquired the collection, it would probably be unavailable because there is no staff to catalogue it.  Our National Library is the poor relation of European national libraries.  It has one quarter the staff of the national libraries in Scotland and Wales, which deal with similar populations.  Our library has a budget of just over £2 million compared to £9 million for its equivalent in Scotland and £6 million in Wales.</P>
    <P>The latest Book of Estimates will not address the library's problems.  An increase in funding in line with inflation has been granted to the library and the museum, but it will not make a difference.  With the cost of the new structures proposed in this legislation, the institutions will probably be in deficit.  If the Government spent less than the proposed £16 million on spindoctors and public relations, our cultural institutions might get a look in.  With so many spindoctors employed by the rainbow coalition we will soon register as the world centre for the spinning industry.  If the National Library had resources it would be a vibrant organisation and would not need a board to tell it how to operate.  It would have the autonomy to develop its operations. Autonomy without resources is a cruel fate.</P>
    <P>One issue in the legislation about which I am very concerned is the plan for the Genealogical Office and the office of the Chief Herald.  These important offices have a long and illustrious heritage, dating back hundreds of years.  In one fell swoop the Minister planned to abolish them under this legislation.  He wants to make them back offices in the cultural structure.  Fortunately, the Minister was rumbled in this regard in the Seanad.  I pay tribute to my Fianna Fáil colleagues, particularly Senator Mooney, for their vigilance in this regard.</P>
    <P>Even more upsetting for the Labour Party was the letter campaign in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The in-house bible of the Labour Party seems to be the only thing that moves the party's hierarchy.  An inch long column of criticism or, God forbid, an editorial giving out about the party's leader is enough to send Labour advisers into orbit. Fuelled by this concern the Minister did his usual verbal pirouetting in the Seanad and claimed that of course the word &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; in the legislation did not mean that.  He claimed it meant something positive, emotional and warm for the Genealogical Office and the office of the Chief Herald.  Nobody in the Seanad was fooled and the Minister had to accept a significant number of amendments and introduce one himself to get over this embarrassing proposal in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has moved some way and I will push him a little further.  He has again passed the buck on the final fate of the Genealogical Office by asking the Heritage Council to produce a report on it in one year's time.  In the interim it appears matters will remain as they are.  Has the Minister thought about showing a little flourish and considered making the Genealogical Office a <Col N="1635" /> stand alone office on a trial basis while the Heritage Council is deliberating?  This would give the Heritage Council an opportunity to include this experiment in its work.  Whatever is decided about the Genealogical Office and the Office of the Chief Herald, the potential of those bodies for the advancement of cultural tourism must be realised.  The Minister should include the Minister for Tourism and Trade in his consideration of those offices.  Those bodies have the potential to help tourists realise the emotional experience of the new Bord Fáilte logo and marketing strategy. We should consider making those bodies centre stage and giving them prominence, marketing and high street outlets to realise their potential.</P>
    <P>Another issue that must be considered in the context of this Bill is the necessity for the National Museum and the National Library to tap into the information age.  If there are to be new boards, putting the institutions on the information super highway must be a priority. The National Museum must link up with local museums and there must be synergy between the National Library and other libraries in the city, including the library in Trinity College and Marsh's Library.  We must also consider how the great cultural institutions can form links with the private sector.  Strategic alliances on specific projects, with revenue potential for the library and museum, are possible.</P>
    <P>An issue that has constantly featured in the soundings I have taken on this Bill is the lack of consultation by the Minister prior to its publication.  As far as I can see, he has spent his time since publication trying to defuse controversies.  First, there was the Genealogical Office, then there were the local museums and now the Irish Antique Dealers' Association.  The Minister has been playing catch-up all the way along the line.  He has only in recent days commenced deliberations with the antique dealers.  I would say it is rather late in the day to be engaging in consultation.  Of even more concern is that it is just a semblance of consultation so that he cannot be accused of not speaking to groups.  This is rather cynical but unfortunately that is nothing new during the Minister's term of office.</P>
    <P>One great national institution that features very little in this Bill is the National Archives. While it does get some mention, it should, have received more attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is covered by separate legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year the former Taoiseach, whom Minister Higgins regarded as suitable for appointment to the RTE Authority, said the archives were close to collapse.  The Minister has ignored this warning.  Resources remain dangerously stretched at the archives and the accommodation needs for records are now at crisis point.  The archives are not eligible for EU <Col N="1636" /> funds because there is no cultural fund in the Structural Fund.  It also does not qualify as a tourism institution, so it finds itself neglected on all fronts.</P>
      <P>The National Archives Act is ten years old and it is time for a review to see how that legislation is working.  In the context of this Bill, provision should have been made for the archives to hold exhibitions and to borrow other archives' material.  The indemnity provisions should have extended as far as the archives.</P>
      <P>There are some progressive features in this Bill. I accept that we can only build our future if we cherish and care for our past.  One particularly welcome inclusion is that of the decorative arts. However, there are considerable concerns about the notification of export of such arts.  Exports up to £35,000 need not be notified.  We recently saw that many items of furniture from Headfort House were expected to be sold for £12,000 or £13,000.  We got those items back from the jaws of auction but how many other lost heritage items will there be?</P>
      <P>Some days before that sale I attempted to put down a Private Notice Question in this House. This was refused, I understand, by the Minister on the basis that it did not come under his responsibility.</P>

      <P>I will not accept that from the Minister.  I wished to raise this matter by way of Private Notice Question and I was advised that this did not seem to come under the Minister's responsibility.  In fact, if the Minister believed that was not so, I am sure he could have allowed that Private Notice Question to come before the House.  I believe it was an embarrassment to him and he did not wish to have it taken.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Heritage Council and the Minister's Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht were able to supply moneys to ensure that furniture was saved, but that was only due to the kind of pressure which was brought to bear by the those who took the trouble to write to politicians and make their views known in <i>The Irish Times</i>, even if they found that difficult to do in the sense that it only came to light within days of that auction.</P>
      <P>The museums section of this Bill gives rise to concern for local museums.  Many are concerned that the Bill means there is no place for them. Rather than devolving more power to local museums in relation to retaining artefacts, they believe the Bill is taking from their autonomy.</P>
      <P>The development of a country museum structure has been one of the most exciting processes for heritage in recent years.  Much credit must be given to the dedicated individuals, local groups and local authorities who have devoted much time and scarce resources to the development of these key facilities.  Fianna Fáil believes these local and regional museums are crucial in terms of heritage policy and management and that these facilities can be powerhouses of memory, energy and pride for local communities.  It is recognised that museums are key components in tourism strategy and that the perception of museums as boring, stuffy and elitist institutions no longer holds sway.  It is crucial that these institutions be allowed to tap into the advances in display and visitor-related technology so that they can sit easily side by side with other visitor facilities.</P>
      <P>It has become clear that there is need for an overall strategy for the development and management of a museums service.  There are needs in relation to training and conservation, for example, which cannot be left to any national or other institution.  We must plan for the future for our museums structure and ensure that the national institutions and local museums become flagship endeavours of national and local pride, memory and education.  No provision is made for this in the Bill.  There is to be no study to consider the development of a museums council and museums service which would look after the needs and the planning of the museum system well into the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Labour Party Minister with responsibility for arts, culture and heritage, one would imagine that the Minister more than most must be conscious of staff concerns about this Bill. However, their concerns do not appear to have been taken on board.  Staff at both institutions point out that for years the National Library and the National Museum have suffered from inadequate management and staffing structures and resources.  They are concerned at the explanatory memorandum which claims no specific staffing implications arise from the Bill. <Col N="1638" /> Under this Bill the institutions must now take on new duties of financial administration and human resource management.  These will now become functions of the National Library and National Museum and will require more staff and resources.  The compilation of a register of cultural objects and the administration of licences will burden an already numerically deficient staff.</P>
    <P>There will also be major cost changes if, as semi-State bodies, the National Library and National Museum are charged for advice for a range of Government services, such as those provided by the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The cost implications of losing these services must be assessed.</P>
    <P>There is also concern among the staff which has not been alleviated by the Labour Party in relation to their terms and conditions under the new Bill.  Will there be a replacement for the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, guaranteeing equally favourable conditions?  How will the transfer of the superannuation scheme to the new board operate and what will this mean?  How will PRSI be administered?  Will staff have representation on the management boards?  What about collective bargaining procedures and so on?</P>
    <P>The staff are concerned at interference with the institutions and the creation of an extra tier of bureaucracy.  They see many of the proposals as tinkering around with the bodies rather than setting a real course for change with planned resources.  They have asked the Minister to give them a detailed outline of the various stages by which the Bill, if enacted, will be implemented.  I ask the Minister to give us that schedule today. They are concerned that, without resources, what is proposed will just become a recipe for neglect.</P>
    <P>There have also been staff concerns about the rights of nomination to the boards.  Will there be worker directors?  Is that not a Labour principle? Where is it provided for in the Bill?  What about the nomination rights for bodies such as the universities, the Library Association of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy and the Irish Management Institute?</P>
    <P>There inevitably has been much staff concern at the awkward way in which the original proposals for the Genealogical Office and the Office of the Chief Herald were framed.  One of the great concerns of staff at the National Library is that, rather than empowering the National Library, this Bill in fact narrows its focus in relation to the type of material that will be held. They are concerned that there is no longer an emphasis on international non-Irish literature, more a narrow focus on Ireland, and that there is no longer mention of the promotion of arts, science and literature as is contained in the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877.  They also noticed an omission as to the National Library having any role in co-ordinating general public access to research resources in other institutions in the State.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern about the issue <Col N="1639" /> of charges for access to the library and the museum.  The changes made by the Minister in the Seanad in this regard have not alleviated concerns.  There is much concern that the power of the new boards to make by-laws will be used to introduce charges for access to the national collections.  I would like the Minister to outline his policy position on charges and to tighten up this area of legislation.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate I would like the Minister to outline the premises to which indemnities will apply.  Certain buildings on Kildare Street do not appear to be covered in the Second Schedule.  I would also like him to outline the progress made with antique dealers on sections 48 and 49.  Only recently has the Minister bothered to consult those people who have a strong concern about the application of a rule that any painting more than 25 years old will require a licence before export.  They claim it will have a disastrous effect on their business because it will deter people from buying as the ruling applies to paintings of any monetary value from 1p upwards.  People from abroad who make an instant decision to buy a painting may have to wait up to a year to get a licence under the legislation.  The dealers claim this will deter buyers.  They have proposed that the length of waiting time for a licence should be not more than six months for articles of major historical importance.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on this issue.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline if he plans anything similar in relation to printed matters?  Should documents, say, more than 50 years old be subject to an export licence?  There are certain rare printed items and collections which should be preserved.  The antique dealers have also called for the legislation to be the same as the EU regulations on cultural exports.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the wider ranging issues.  I, with my colleagues, look forward to hearing the Minister's reply and to Committee Stage when we can table further amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Having been extensively debated and amended in the Seanad, this Bill as it comes to the House is by far a better one than that initially drafted and presented.  I pay tribute to Members of the other House for the work of Senators who tabled amendments, the Minister who accepted them and the range of discussion that took place there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has much to commend it and there are a number of good features in it, but it is a minimalist measure and represents an opportunity lost to the Minister and the Government.  Despite its distinct title of National Cultural Institutions Bill, 1996, very little that is new is proposed in it.  It does not propose any new museums or galleries.  As we approach the end of the 20th century, we would do well to reflect what aspects of the legacy of the 20th century should be part of new and developing <Col N="1640" /> museum collections.  We do not have a substantial industrial museum outlining our industrial history of the past century.  We do not have a transport museum even though the 20th century was the age of the explosion in the development of transport.  We do not have a fashion museum even though we currently hold a high position in fashion design and fabric on the world stage. There are a number of other variations of museums we should attempt to put in place as we approach the threshold of the 21st century.  I would have thought that at least in the context of the Bill the Minister would have outlined his vision for the future development of museums here, a type of blueprint to unleash the potential and energy that is there, but that has not happened and I regret it.  That is why I describe this Bill as a minimalist measure.</P>
    <P>There are many good features which I welcome and support, in particular, the decision to give the National Library and the National Museum operational autonomy as independent agencies.  It is only right that the directors of those two institutions should be given the freedom to manage their institutions and that they should be liberated from the dead hand of the Minister's Department.  I also welcome that both institutions will be required to publish annual reports giving details of their financial position and their overall performance.  I hope the new structures will enable those two institutions to improve their service to the general public, but I do not see anything in the Bill to convince me they will thrive as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill in the Seanad the Minister said it was his intention to establish modern major cultural institutions that would be enabled to thrive.  &ldquo;Thrive&rdquo; is a strong word, to which I could give my wholehearted support, but there is nothing in the Bill to convince me that as a result of its enactment those two institutions will thrive.  The opposite may very well be the case.  Under the Bill those two institutions will be given additional duties and responsibilities without being given any additional resources.  I cannot see how they can continue to thrive.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the staffing levels in the National Museum are currently at a critical level because of staff shortages.  There are a number of important items that ought to be catalogued and exhibited, but that cannot be done.  It is not because of an absence of will.  I know of no better, more patriotic-minded people than the staffs of our libraries and museums.  Such work has not been done not because of an absence of will but because of an absence of staff, time and resources.  We do not have enough staff to maintain services under the existing legislation and now the existing staff are being asked to take on a raft of new duties without putting or promising to put in place any additional resources for those two institutions.  For that reason the Minister stands condemned.  It is not as if the country is not enjoying an era of affluence, which was unheard of when I was a child.  There is <Col N="1641" /> money for everything in certain sections of the community.  Fifteen years ago when public money was by no means as plentiful as today the National Library was open to readers 63 hours per week, today it is open just 42 hours per week. That level of public accessibility compares very unfavourably with similar institutions in every other member state.  Because of a shortage of staff, the opening hours of the National Library are a national scandal.  I would like the Minister to address that issue before he attempts to bring in this legislation.  Before he attempts to enact it he must put in place a proper staffing structure for the National Museum with a sufficiency of staff to enable it to fulfil the required functions and to give to the public the service it deserves in any self-respecting modern democracy.  They are two preconditions to the introduction of any new legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not present but he will say that my party is always attempting to cut back on public spending.  There are huge areas of public spending on which my party would like to cut back and huge areas of wasteful public spending my party would like to cut out, many of which relate to the manner in which he runs his Department and the additional expenditure &mdash; paid by taxpayers &mdash; in the top heavy administration of that Department.  Given the choice, taxpayers would much prefer to put their money into improving and developing services at the National Museum and the National Library. That is where the Progressive Democrats would like the Government, on their behalf, to put their money.  They are the democratic choices that have to be made by any self-respecting democracy.  We would cut out much of the waste in this top heavy administration which is a feature of the rainbow Government.  In office we would provide resources to enable the National Gallery and the National Museum to fulfil their respective functions.  I put that upfront as a key argument.</P>
    <P>The Bill does little to acknowledge the great vitality, energy and store of expertise in terms of museum, library and heritage items scattered around the country.  I pay tribute to the many voluntary bodies who, down the years in the face of official neglect since the foundation of the State, acted as the collectors and custodians of our archaeological inheritance, museum type inheritance and printed matter.  I refer to the Royal Irish Academy, the RDS, museums and curators at local authority level and specifically large numbers of local historical and archaeological societies who, in the face of official neglect, kept alive and passed on to succeeding generations, items of archaeological importance. More than any single thing I would like the Minister and the Government to put in place a national framework which would tie in local authority museums and all the well designed local effort with the national institutions and ensure that heritage items would flourish in the locality in which they originated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> It is part of the old colonial mentality that everything must find its way to and be housed in the capital city.  Subjects from Cork, Kerry, Galway and Sligo must make their visit to the capital city.  I hope we are getting away from that kind of attitude in respect of our inheritance, that we will seek to enable items of archaeological and heritage importance to be displayed in their own areas, to be accessible to the people and as part of the folk memory that they remain in the areas in which they originated.  The effect of that would be a strong vibrant community that appreciates and protects its inheritance.  That is the way to create a citizenry that values these items.</P>
    <P>I regret that in this Bill &mdash; I will be addressing this matter vigorously on Committee Stage &mdash; there apperas to be a downgrading of the role of local authority museums and curators.  I ask the Minister to address that items in his reply but if it is not I will table amendments on Committee Stage.  I fear that matters which I thought were decided in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act are somehow being negatived. The Minister is shaking his head but if he can convince me in his reply I will accept it.  As I read this Bill I fear that may well be the case.</P>
    <P>Let us take a high profile item &mdash; the Derrynaflan chalice &mdash; which was discovered in Tipperary.  In accordance with the thinking that informs all our actions here it was automatically assumed it would be housed in the National Museum, that a conservation process would take place and that it would reside there forever. Would it not have been good, creative and new thinking to have housed that item in Cahir Castle, for example, or somewhere in the region of the Rock of Cashel or any suitable site in County Tipperary?  Would not that one gesture have revitalised and rekindled interest in heritage items in that county?  I use that as an example of where I believe we should be taking future policy. This has been the subject of many questions I have put to the Minister at Question Time.  It saddens me that items of that nature have to be rushed to and housed in Dublin when many items are not on display because there is not sufficient staff &mdash; or space &mdash; to catalogue them.  I expect the space issue has been addressed well in the provision of Collins Barracks but items should have been displayed in their local area.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I will address on Committee Stage as it is my intention to vigorously amend this Bill.  I am concerned about the staffing level and I have no doubt what I said will be brought to the Minister's notice.  I am equally concerned about a matter that featured prominently in the Seanad debates, entry charges to our museums and galleries.  It is incontrovertible that those institutions have been starved of funding down the years.  If they are to attain their full potential they must be given a much higher level of funding.  I spoke already about funding for additional staff.  Acquisition funding is needed, particularly for the National Gallery, National Library and National Museum. <Col N="1643" /> Such funding is at a minimal, if not non-existent level.  It is not unreasonable that institutions should charge an entry fee, provided it is done properly.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that we have a generation of people who have money for everything offered to a consumer society, but have very little for matters of central civic importance.  I sometimes wonder what kind of generation of young people are we raising that they have money for coke, jeans, everything that is foisted on them by clever advertising in an age of media and rampant commercialism, but sometimes they have no money for books.  They do not have the equivalent of half a crown to visit museums and libraries.  Young people have a false sense of values.  As we reach the end of the 20th century I wonder whether we have bred a nation of consumers or of citizens.  There is a vast difference between the outlook and attitude of a citizen and that of a consumer, and I believe in the primacy of the citizen over the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the one hand there are people such as Sir Denis McMahon who said that he will make available to the National Gallery part of his private collection because he admires the way we run our National Gallery and that it is made accessible to the public without charge.  On the other hand, however, our citizenry believe that everything else is worth paying for.  People put a value on what they pay for but do not always put a value on what they get for nothing and that concerns me.  There is no easy solution to this problem, but as a group of mature politicians we should discuss it logically and fully and have the courage to arrive at the correct decision.  Funding must be provided, whether through Exchequer funding or by subscription from people who can afford it.  There is more affluence now than at any time since the foundation of the State and if we do not require people of affluence to make a contribution to our cultural institutions they will not thrive.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me is the manner of appointments to boards.  I utterly reject the proposals in that regard.  They are wrong in principle and in law.  They sideline bodies which, in the face of cultural neglect, have been crucial to the protection and preservation of cultural items down the years.  I paid tribute to the RDS, the Royal Irish Academy, the local authority curators groups, local historical and archaeological groups and groups of bodies, formal and otherwise, which, even at times predating the foundation of the State, have kept alive our cultural collections and their custodianship.</P>
    <P>Those groups should not be sidelined by the Minister.  It is patronising to suggest that they nominate persons and the Minister may, at his discretion, select some of those people to be members of the new boards.  That is not good enough.  It is poor recognition of those people's expertise, vocational training, understanding and <Col N="1644" /> enthusiasm for the items we seek to protect and to pass on to the next generation.  It is poor recognition of the expertise which members of those groups can bring to bear on the further development of the institutions in question. Unless there is a significant and substantial change by the Minister, I will propose a very strong amendment in respect of membership of the boards and will ask the House to vote down that section.  It is wrong to blatantly extend the naked arm of a Minister of any party to a business that can be better done by people with greater expertise and more time to exercise their expertise, people who have proven track records in these matters.  The Minister should ensure that proper statutory provision is made for the appointment of staff members to the boards.  That is a matter I will seek to amend on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about sections 48 and 49 dealing with the issue of export licences, particularly relating to items of cultural value.  I sympathise with what the Minister is attempting to do in the Bill.  Items of major historical, artistic and archaeological importance have haemorrhaged out of the State and continue to so do.  I pay tribute &mdash; I take this as an example but I could take a thousand such examples &mdash; to Gerald Goldberg who, as Lord Mayor of Cork, on a visit to institutions in London saw some of the finest pieces of Cork silver that ought to be part of the civic collection, modest as it is, and with his own money bought them, brought them back and put them on display in the City Hall or the city museum.  That was a great gesture on the part of a private citizen.  Many important items have been taken out of the State.  I understand, therefore, what the Minister is attempting to do, but he is using a steamroller to kill a fly, albeit a big, fat fly.</P>
    <P>Sections 48 and 49 are unjust, unworkable and totally impractical and must be substantially amended.  It is unacceptable to apply the 25 year rule to a painting, whether it is worth £10 or £10,000, because it will cripple a legitimate trade.  That provision must be amended.  The licensing system as it applies is so bogged down with bureaucracy that at least a year will elapse between the time an applicant applies for a licence and the granting of such licence.  We are dealing with a mobile market where people with money buy when they see something they like.  They will not defer it. We are no longer living in that era.  When I was growing up I would save my money for a year to buy a book at Christmas.  That era is as dead as a dodo and when people with money see something they want, they buy it.  It is totally out of tune with the times in which we live to expect anybody to trade under those circumstances.  This area must be amended and if the Minister does not do it, I will table an amendment.</P>
    <P>We should seek to bring our laws into line with legislation on the export of cultural goods controlled by EU Regulation 3912 of 1992.  That <Col N="1645" /> is the correct framework in which to give protection to important items and to enable trade to take place.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Genealogical Office has been given the proper protection it needs to develop and to dispense a service for which there will be a growing demand in the years ahead, but I am prepared to listen to the Minister in that regard and to frame an amendment if one is deemed necessary.  I am concerned also about the downgrading of local museums and museum curators and I will be tabling an amendment to that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the staff of the National Library, in particular Dr. Donlon, who continue to provide an excellent service under the most difficult circumstances.  I also pay tribute to the staff of the National Museum.  One year and seven months later I recall with a great deal of affection John Teehan, a great Kerry man, who made a major contribution to the development of the National Museum and Collins Barracks. Unfortunately, he did not live to see the fruits of his labour.  I look forward to revisiting the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I have heard it said that the last year of a Dáil is one in which there is a little good work done.  The theory is that politicians are thinking of the election ahead and civil servants use this time to cherry-pick the legislation they wish to see enacted.  If there is any truth to that theory, it certainly does not apply to this Government.  The Bill is extremely important legislation which will complete the Minister's overhaul of the archaic legislation governing the heritage area.</P>
      <P>When I last spoke in the House we were discussing labour legislation which will replace and codify 60 years of existing legislation. Yesterday, the Registration of Births Bill was debated, a Bill that will put paid to our archaic, 19th century birth certificate.  That Bill emanated from the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The impact of this small Department since it was established in 1993 has been phenomenal and, in light of recent events, it is difficult to believe responsibility for law reform previously lay with the Department of Justice, whose core responsibility already places punishing demands on it as a Department.  The establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform has paid huge dividends.  Without it, it is difficult to understand how a Bill such as the Registration of Births Bill could have come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Here too a new Department has invigorated its field.  The Minister, Deputy Higgins, has succeeded in doing more for the arts in his tenure in office than any previous Minister in the area.  He is to be commended for that.  As I prepared for this debate I read extracts from the Official Report <Col N="1646" /> of the Seanad dealing with this Bill, which was initiated in that House.  The debate was vigorous and I am sure that will also be the case here.  I was particularly struck by the contribution of Senator Lee, a man whose profession makes his views on this subject of considerable importance.  He was critical of some aspects of the legislation but he stated that what he found most striking about Minister Higgins's presentation to that House was the case he put for the care of our heritage in the most general sense of the word.  I also those sentiments.  Even if Minister Higgins left office without having passed any legislation, which is not the case, he would have left his mark on the cultural life of the nation.</P>
    <P>We should never forget the importance of such advocacy.  In the hurly-burly of modern day living it is easy to forget the significance of our culture and our heritage, but without it we would not understand our place in the modern world.  Our heritage defines us and makes us what we are.</P>
    <P>My own interest in the area of culture and history was recently awakened when I discovered that papers relating to James Connolly, his newspaper <i>The Workers' Republic</i> and other relevant material were to come under the hammer in Dublin.  Included in the archive were more than 200 pages of contributions written in various hands, almost three-quarters of which were in Connolly's own handwriting.  The material included editorials, obituaries, advertisements and other items relating to the publication of a newspaper.  The collection included material not only from Connolly but from Francis Sheehy Skeffington, Cathal O'Shannon, William Partridge and others.  It is most fortunate that this material survived the decades since it was first written in the months and weeks before the 1916 Rising.</P>
    <P>I press the case for State purchase of these invaluable documents.  While it is unfortunate that did not come to pass, I am satisfied that the State, through the auspices of the National Library, made a valiant attempt to acquire these papers.  Unfortunately, the asking price far surpassed that expected and I am advised the archive was purchased by a private collector based in the Dublin area who has chosen to remain anonymous.  Hopefully, in due course this person might agree to hand over, lend or sell the material to the National Library so that the public will have access to it.  I am concerned that the archive could be purchased by a non-national and taken out of the State.  I am pleased to note that the legislation will allow the State to intervene to ensure that such an archive will not be allowed to leave the country in future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the importance of the Registration of Births Bill in updating and modernising our practices in the birth certificate area.  The existing certificate dates back to the 1860s and I understand the governing structure of the National Library and the National Museum has similar origins.  This Bill proposes to modernise those structures by providing for the <Col N="1647" /> establishment of autonomous boards to govern our major cultural institutions, the National Library, the National Museum and the National Art Gallery.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes an indemnity scheme which would enable our cultural institutions to facilitate more international exhibitions of cultural importance.  I understand our current capacity to do this is severely limited by insurance difficulties which require a separate order by Government each time indemnity is required. Clearly a scheme is required in this instance.  The case for the establishment of these boards is overwhelming and was broadly welcomed in the Seanad debate.  In the case of the National Museum, at least five reports, while they do not actually take this view, find that the current administrative structure of governance by Government Departments is clearly unsatisfactory.  The Government recently had reason to propose the establishment of a separate prison board to ensure the management of our prisons is given the concerted attention it deserves.  I see no reason for not applying the same logic here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated on the extensive consultation he has engaged in prior to and since the publication of this Bill.  Some concern has been expressed about the staffing of these institutions.  My understanding is that these concerns have been largely ironed out.  I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the important role played by two private bodies, the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society, in securing the existence of both the National Museum and the National Library.  The Minister's agreement with these two societies regarding appointments to the boards of the new bodies is generous and appropriate.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, much of the debate in the Seanad on this legislation was concerned with the exact status of the Genealogical Office and the office of the Chief Herald.  I do not pretend to understand the complexity of the issues under debate, although it is notable that the primary Opposition spokesperson in the Seanad accepted that the Minister's actions in this area were compelled by the confusion arising over the status of the offices under a statutory instrument dating back to 1943.  It seems that this debate and the intensity with which it has been argued over the summer is in itself a genealogical argument.  For my part, knowing the Minister as I do, I have no doubt that the Genealogical Office and the Chief Herald are safe in his care.</P>
    <P>The only other argument appears to be whether such an office should exist within the National Library or be an office of itself.  I must confess to being neutral on the issue, but the key point at issue here is surely the quality of the service provided to people who wish to avail of it, many of whom come from beyond our shores.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed about statements made by the Director of the National <Col N="1648" /> Library in a journal article about the future development of genealogical offices and service. Perhaps the provision of more clarity here might allay concern.</P>
    <P>It is important to touch on the issue of funding. Despite the so-called interest shown in arts and culture by a former Taoiseach, there seems to be general acceptance that our primary cultural institutions have suffered considerable neglect almost since their inception.  The problem is only now beginning to be addressed, and the presence of a separate Minister, presiding over his own Department at Cabinet, is no doubt extremely important.  However, it is clear that this improvement needs to be continued.  Obviously such a commitment cannot be contained within this Bill, given our budgetary process.  However, given the clamour in the House which surrounds the spending of public money, one would have to be concerned about the future of these institutions if the Opposition opposes this type of funding.  As a public representative I have no difficulty with private funding or funding derived from, say, the sale of alcohol by cultural institutions which is provided for in the Bill, but it is unrealistic to think it will ever replace public moneys as a guarantor of our heritage.

      <P>The agreements that are at the basis of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society are dated 1881 and 1890.  In addition, the history of the museum and of the library is one of under provision of resources and staffing.  If one were to operate according to Deputy Quill's logic, that all the resources and staffing should be in place before changing the legislation, the legislation would never be changed.  From the beginning I have said that there is a need for a change in legislation, a need for a change in institutional structure and administration, in respect of these institutions for which I have inherited responsibility.  There is a need also to beef up the level of resources, to a point which they will be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> I make no apology for the amount of time and work that have gone into the preparation of this legislation.  Had I rushed the legislation I would be accused of lack of consultation.  Because we spent a great deal of time in consultation, we are able to reach an agreement.  For example, those sections which refer to the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society have been agreed by them in agreements that replace the agreements of 1881 and 1890.  It was right and proper to put the effort into reaching those agreements.  Those who now want to argue behind those agreements are not taking into account that these consultations took place over a period and reached a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>It is a pity Deputy Quill spoke about the naked hand of any politician.  There is no need to describe it like that.  There is an issue to be decided.  If we want accountability, the Minister appoints.  If, at the same time, we want to honour the agreements entered into, he appoints from a list supplied by both institutions.  If we do it another way, we narrow accountability at the expense of something else.  These are decisions that have to be made, and I hope that when we come to deal with Committee Stage we will have a less personalised approach.  I do not want to waste time dealing with whether I got a great inheritance or squandered opportunities, etc. Teilifís na Gaeilge was mentioned.  The decisions on that were taken on my proposal in the spring of 1993 and in the spring of 1995.  There was no Government decision before that first Government of which I had the privilege to be a member, a Labour-Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to reply to these points.  The first Government of which I was a member gave great assistance to the film industry through the initiatives I brought forward.  However, I inherited a situation in which the Irish Film Board had been abolished and I re-established it. The Estimates published this week will show that funding for the Arts Council will have doubled from the level of £10.1 million when I became <Col N="1650" /> Minister.  The only time the Arts Council suffered a cut in funding was in the interim period between this Government and the previous one. This cut was proposed by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Bertie Ahern, as was a cut in the funds for Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to allow such statements to go uncorrected.  I will state the facts.</P>
      <P>The Bill has benefited significantly from the debate in the Seanad and I pay tribute to Senator Mooney's contributions.  Legislation such as this should be debated in detail.  I brought forward amendments to address matters raised on Second Stage in the Seanad and I accepted amendments made since then.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of resources, if one was to wait for all the resources and staff to be in place before legislating there would not have been legislation.  It is important to have the legislation in place and to acknowledge the battle for resources.  The arts plan was a three year plan which it was decided to implement in five years. If one wanted to avoid placing obligations on oneself for the future such a document would not be published.  However, in laying out such plans one knows the level of funding required to bring them to fruition.  When this legislation is passed there will be a need for additional staff resources. It is also important that the structures would be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several past Governments are responsible for the low levels of funding in this sector.  For example, when I took office in 1993 there were 76 staff in the National Museum.  It now has 91 staff.  However significant such an increase might be it is not nearly at a desirable level.  There will be an additional 28 staff approved for the Collins Barracks project.  Even including those staff members, the level is still short of that required. Given such significant increases and staff are still short of the desirable level, one must ask what were the previous attitudes to the National Museum.  Not even a person who wanted to <Col N="1651" /> radically alter the facts could say it was in a healthy condition.  It will take a lot of resources to bring these cultural institutions to a healthy point at which they can thrive.  Legislation should not be seen as an attempt on my part to substitute for shortfalls in staff or other resources.</P>
    <P>The 1996 grant in aid to the National Library will show an increase of 78 per cent over the Department's allocation in 1993.  However, this is because the baseline figure for 1993 was so low. Even increasing the level of funds by 78 per cent does not come near the level of resources necessary.  I am responsible for the period from 1993 onwards but I am not responsible for the low baselines.  They are the responsibility of previous Governments.  However, they must be addressed and one of the difficulties we face is whether we can make special cases.</P>
    <P>In the period 1993-96 the National Museum's grant in aid funding showed an increase of 300 per cent which reflected a need to facilitate planning for the Collins Barracks development. That decision was taken by the first Government of which I was a member.  I have committed £33 million on the capital side for developments at Collins Barracks and at a regional location near Castlebar.  Major capital projects for the National Library recently completed, under way or planned include the establishment of a new photographic archive located in Temple Bar, the development of new conservation facilities in the Racket Hall and a major development in the College of Art building.</P>
    <P>Recently introduced tax breaks and special capital grants have allowed the museum and library, among others, to acquire significant cultural treasures.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I have made representations on it because it could be expanded.  It has allowed the recent acquisition of the Jack B. Yeats archive, the de Vesci papers, the Norah McGuinness archive and the original architectural drawings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These are significant acquisitions although that is not to say I am happy with the level of resources.  The National Library's acquisitions budget was 60 per cent higher in 1995 than in 1992.  Once again the baseline was very low and had it been higher at that point the percentage increases since then would have yielded a better result.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Genealogical Office, I contest Deputy de Valera's interpretation of the amendment of the Bill as introduced.  It was always my intention to place the Genealogical Office under the new board of the National Library to recognise the <i>status quo</i> since 1943. The amendment merely provides an alternative approach in drafting terms rather than a change in intent.  I am grateful for the input of the Seanad in this regard.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of genealogy for tourism.  The use of Structural Funds under my control for the development of the NCAD <Col N="1652" /> building beside Leinster House for the National Library will provide for a significant improvement in public facilities for genealogical research.  The first reference in legislation to the office of Chief Herald is in the Bill.  There is a clear recognition of the role of genealogy in the library.  The issue of contention is whether the Genealogical Office should be separate from the library and function as a stand-alone institution with staff and resources.  It was always within the library but there were those in office who felt uncomfortable accepting the structure of the library.  The people in favour of the Genealogical Office being a separate institution would cut if off from librarianship and from the library as a resource.  Have they thought about this?  Why are they doing it and from where did the demand come?  This is worthy of consideration.  There are two views one being that this legislation will enable the Genealogical Office to be set up as a separate institution in the future.</P>
    <P>I must correct another point.  The Heritage Council will not look at the Genealogical Office's functions within the National Library.  In pursuit of a genealogical project people have to go to several locations and it is the role of the Heritage Council to examine this issue.  It will look at whether resources can be combined.  That is what is intended.  The point was made in the Seanad that in carrying out research one has to go to five locations &mdash; the History Museum, the National Library, the National Archive, local genealogy centres and the Land Registry &mdash; and that it would be useful if the Heritage Council looked at the issue.  I accepted this idea.</P>
    <P>The extremist view is that the Genealogical Office has to be split, that the Chief Herald and staff of the office must be isolated from the National Library.  It is worth reflecting between now and Committee Stage on the reasons this idea was put forward and the background to it. The relationship of staff working within the National Library with its authority structure, as designed must also be questioned.  There will be no problem debating this issue on Committee Stage as the net point is whether the Genealogical Office should have autonomy or receive recognition within the National Library structure. It has not been downgraded, it already forms part of the National Library but it was not recognised that the director of the library had an appropriate role and this made life difficult for him or her. It is, therefore, a good story which is worthy of research between now and Committee Stage to ensure all the facts come out.</P>
    <P>I have not rejected the idea of a separate Genealogical Office forever.  My primary role was to straighten out the position in relation to the board of the National Library.  There is also an issue of resources.  It may well be the case that the Genealogical Office will become so important within a few years that one could justify granting it autonomy but let us get the structure right first. I have almost been provoked into saying we could not stand over a situation where there was <Col N="1653" /> imprecision and lack of definite knowledge in relation to the structures of authority as this would make life impossible or difficult for the director of the National Library.  That did happen and it is not edifying.</P>
    <P>There is another issue to be considered. Multifaceted skills are needed to service the Genealogical Office supported by records which can be drawn from a wide-ranging institution rather than a more narrow one.  These are considerations in examining the merits of autonomy.</P>
    <P>I made files and information available to the Opposition spokesperson in the Seanad, Senator Mooney, outlining the history of this issue.  It was never the intention to damage genealogy or the reputation of heraldry.  As Senator Mooney said in the other House, the only people who damaged the reputation of heraldry internationally were those who wrote irresponsible letters to the newspapers about that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill made a good point about local museums.  The setting of a legislative framework for local museums, a separate museums council and a system for specialist museums and transport is an important issue.  I have never suggested these activities could be dealt with in this Bill.  They merit a separate Bill.  A return to the archives legislation is, perhaps, also merited to see if certain provisions need to be updated because of developments in technology.  I have already been accused of trying to deal with five or six related matters in this Bill.  I cannot deal with everything at the one time.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to encourage the establishment of a network of local and regional museums to complement the National Museum.  It is my policy to disburse moneys at my disposal for capital projects.  This policy has led to the development of the Hunt Museum in Limerick which is nearing completion and, through the cultural development incentive schemes, the development of a museum in Cork and a new county museum in Tipperary, to be situated in Clonmel.  The securitorial and exhibition capacity of these institutions will be developed to an acceptable level.  That is the way to proceed.  I hope these initiatives will allow our national treasures and those of international calibre to be appropriately and safely exhibited in regional museums throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On the relationship with the National Museum, my officials have had detailed discussions on the heads of the Bill with the Irish Museums Association.  I will be happy to discuss this issue in detail with Deputies Quill and de Valera on Committee Stage to resolve any outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>It appears there may be a misunderstanding between the RIA and the RDS.  The arrangements are the outcome of agreements entered into with them.</P>
    <P>I have agreed there should be staff representatives on the board to be selected from its nominees.  I cite the model used for appointing <Col N="1654" /> a staff representative to the RTE Authority as an example.  That is the kind of mechanism we have in mind in relation to the two institutions involved.  There is also a staff representative on the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  This can be accommodated without a specific legislative procedure.</P>
    <P>On the more general issue of board appointments, I have made my position clear. The principle of nomination by Ministers who represent the people who fund the boards is an important one.  There is no perfect strategy but the Minister is responsible for answering questions on the expenditure of significant amounts of public funds.  If it was left to an institution to make nominations, there would be a direct connection with the nominating body but no accountability.  I have attempted to strike a balance.  Under a voluntary agreement, the institutions will supply names from which the Minister will make appointments.</P>
    <P>On export licences, the current legal position is that a licence is required before any painting, whatever its value, can be exported, although there is a provision which allows a limit to be imposed.  This strikes an adequate balance between protection of the heritage and the needs of the trade.  I will be happy to discuss this matter in detail with Deputy Quill on Committee Stage. I listened with great care to what Deputy Quill said about the 25 year period and it is not an easy issue.  What would her attitude be, for example, to a Louis le Brocquy painting?  I could also think of a number of other painters of the last 25 years who will not be painting significantly in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not, but the Deputy will have to make up her own mind which side to come down on in terms of the balance.  I do not mind discussing this on Committee Stage.  There is another side to accepting the European figure. The harmonised figure one would get at EU level would be reflective of economies and societies like Germany, France or Italy where the average figure would be high.  You could get an item of cultural significance with a lower figure coming from Ireland.  The legislation, as completed in the Seanad, has the capacity for the Minister to make orders, in other words to be flexible.  There was a reference to the Headfort furniture.  One could have a small object, the value of which in terms of period and class would not be important yet whose significance would not be its place in that period and class of objects.  We have catered for that by being able to make an order that would vary.  While we can discuss this again on Committee Stage, I believe the right balance has been struck.  Deputies may look forward to legislation on wildlife and broadcasting in the new year.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

    <Title>Shaping our Future: A Strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This report was prepared by Forfás and presented to the Government earlier this year.  In his opening statement to the House in July, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment said the report sets out a strategy for the development of enterprise over the next 15 years.  It shows what we as a society can achieve in terms of living standards, employment and quality of life in that period.  The report is laudable and clearly sets down the directions in which we can go.  I want, however, to raise issues concerning the west, the region I represent. County Roscommon has been worst affected by a lack of enterprise born of the ravages of emigration.  The most recent census report last April gives us head counts for each county's population and takes account of the changes between 1991 and 1996.  There we find that the population of County Roscommon and of the west generally has stabilised.  It had grown significantly in urban areas where there is much enterprise and the highest levels of employment.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Census is the one of which we have the best analysis.  It takes the 1986 to 1991 period into account during which there was a massive haemorrhage of people from the region.  It was a time of structural adjustment with severe cutbacks in public funding that affected the weaker regions to a far greater extent than more prosperous ones.  Levels of development in more prosperous regions were more sustained and self-sustaining, thus employment there was held at levels which did not allow the major haemorrhage that took place in the western region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that the Government will be involved in shaping our future over the next 15 <Col N="1657" /> years in terms of creating enterprise, employment and social structures, we must be careful to positively favour disadvantaged regions with resources to help enterprise.  We must iron out disparities that have developed in the economy and in society also.</P>
    <P>Part of the principles of Europe after the Maastricht Treaty was that positive action would be taken to address economic disparities in what are called peripheral, declining regions.  We have one of the few regions in the European Union where there is a declining population.  Scotland and Ireland are quite similar in terms of topography, etc., but the populations of the Orkney Islands and the Western Islands have remained stable or increased during the past 25 years.  However, islands off the Irish coast that were inhabited up to 25 years ago are no longer inhabited.  The Aran Islands are almost trampled to death by tourists during the summer months but their indigenous population is in decline.</P>
    <P>In the light of social justice, successive Governments must consider the effect of that trend on this country.  We must provide resources to assist the areas in question.  Ireland was very fortunate to qualify for objective 1 status in terms of European Union funding under the Regional and Cohesion funds introduced in 1993 and under the previous arrangement that operated between 1989 and 1993.  The National Development Plans prepared in respect of applications under both sets of Structural Funds clearly illustrated that if all regions enjoyed the same level of prosperity Ireland could not have qualified for objective 1 status, which attracts the maximum level of grant assistance towards infrastructural development.  If we are to encourage enterprise, we must first tackle our infrastructural deficiencies.</P>
    <P>The average income in Ireland was dragged down to a sufficiently low level for qualification for objective 1 status in 1989 and 1993 because the average income in the west was far below that which obtained throughout the European Union. This amounted to 60 per cent of the average European income and 70 per cent of the average national income.  Were it not that Ireland had such a large area affected by economic disadvantage and low income, the country would not have qualified for objective 1 status.  That status attracted billions of pounds for structural developments &mdash; which in turn lead to economic developments &mdash; namely, road construction, major water and sewerage projects, environmental and railway restructuring projects, etc.</P>
    <P>Ireland was given objective 1 status but the vast share of the money was spent in the eastern region, particularly in respect of road infrastructure.  Ten years ago the road approaches to Dublin were probably the most efficient of any developed capital city in the world.  Ten to 15 years ago there were few motorway approaches to the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly all of the major radial roads that enter the city have now been improved to motorway or dual carriageway standard.  It is difficult to argue against the need to spend billions of pounds in this regard.  However, on behalf of the people I represent I must state that we provided the reason for the granting of objective 1 status but we did not gain any benefits from it.  It was stated that macro economic considerations indicated that traffic flows in the west did not justify major investments on infrastructural development.  These considerations were used to justify such spending in respect of Dublin.  As a result, the western region did not undergo the required level of development.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan prepared in 1989 considered the state of the country in detail and sectoral breakdowns were provided of the level of income and prosperity throughout the five regions and sub-regions.  It was clearly shown that the level of income in the south eastern and eastern regions was at 95 per cent of that obtaining in the European Union.  However, it was discovered that average incomes in the south western and, in particular, the western and north western regions were only at 60 per cent of that of the Union average.  When the position emerged relating to people earning low incomes, such as small farmers those incomes measured at only 40 per cent of the European Union average.</P>
      <P>I raise these points in light of the fact that this document considers the next 15 years of enterprise development in Ireland.  I want to see a more even distribution of enterprise and I do not want to witness the death of the region I represent.  The life of any area is measured by its population and, in that context, the region in which I live is dying.  It has entered a state of lingering coma in the sense that the population recently stabilised.  However, the population base has been greatly attenuated by past events. Population profiles for the region I represent show that 70 per cent of the people in some parishes are more than 60 years of age.  What will happen such areas?</P>
      <P>The Government is obviously aware of this issue because last May the Taoiseach launched the Western Development Plan at Athenry.  That plan will come on stream this year and will establish a special development fund for the west which will be allocated £100 million in equity funding during the next five years.  This is a significant sum and it will have an impact, but it is far from what is required.  There is also no doubt that there are people living in the western region who have extraordinary entrepreneurial skills and willingness to take action and go above and beyond what people in other regions must do to achieve something.  This is evident despite the attenuation of the population by the ravages of emigration, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The western region requires a budget of approximately £1 billion, which is a modest estimate, which might be funded by resources <Col N="1659" /> from the European Union, the Exchequer or the private sector.  Under the Western Development Plan, at least 25 per cent of the equity funding for development of projects in the west will be provided by the private sector.  Will the Minister of State note that the £100 million allocation is not adequate to meet the needs of the region?</P>
    <P>The IDA yesterday announced the siting of a new IBM project at Mulhuddart.  I am delighted about this because it will create between 2,500 to 4,000 new jobs in that area.  I am glad the colleagues now in the House all represent Dublin constituencies.</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty in this regard, however, because, in recent years, only 7 per cent of major IDA projects were awarded to the western region.  The remainder have gone elsewhere, particularly to the eastern region.  I am aware that companies such as IBM wish to locate close to the capital city's good infrastructure and markets.</P>
      <P>There should be Government intervention in arranging enterprise strategies for the entire country.  It must ensure that a much higher percentage of that investment is directed towards regions which are in decline.  There are many well educated and properly trained people with the right kind of work ethic in my region and they are only too willing to participate in these projects.</P>
      <P>We readily accept foreign companies but never tell them about our regional policy on directing some of the investment towards areas outside the major growth centres.  We should make it a cornerstone of our policy to ask foreign companies such as IBM and others which locate here whether they can do anything to create employment in areas outside the major growth centres which badly require it.  This may not be appropriate in the case of the large multinationals but it may be appropriate in the case of the many small foreign investors, to whom no reference is made in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will take note of my points.  I represent an area in decline which for too long has not received its fair share of either public or private investment.  Nobody can argue this point as the evidence is there for all to see.  Deputy Costello represents a Dublin constituency but he originally comes from Geevagh, County Sligo.  I am sure he will agree this area is as good an example of rural and regional decline as one will find anywhere in the country.  During the period 1986-91 the population of north Roscommon declined by 10 per cent.  We cannot allow this to continue.  This decline was caused by a number of factors, for example, the downturn in the economy and <Col N="1660" /> Government policies of stringent cutbacks and squeezing as much as possible out of public spending.  When the squeeze came the weakest regions suffered most and there was a mass exodus of young people to the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I hope changes will be introduced so that my area will not continue to decline.  The Forfás report will inform Government policy in this area in the future.  I want to see a greater allocation of resources towards areas which are in decline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Forfás report.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts some months ago I was rather critical of the present structure of Forfás, Forbairt and the IDA.  My colleagues and I queried the continuing role of Forfás given the distinctive role played by Forbairt, under Mr. Flinter, in relation to domestic industry and the important role played by the IDA, under Mr. McGowan, in attracting foreign industry to set up here.  Following that meeting Forfás sent me a number of reports, including this one.</P>
      <P>This report rightly highlights the unique challenges facing the country in the economic and social spheres.  We are entering the period of greatest affluence in our history.  In this respect, I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  The report refers to the critical importance of putting in place long-term planning measures across the range of issues affecting the economy to ensure our economy remains buoyant during the first, second and third decades of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The economic pointers are truly remarkable and the Government deserves much credit for this.  According to <i>The Economist,</i> Ireland is poised to overtake Britain in terms of <i>per capita</i> income by the end of next year.  After we broke ties with the world's greatest economic superpower in 1922 we went through very difficult periods right up to the 1950s.  It is remarkable that we are now poised to overtake our old colonial power in terms of <i>per capita</i> income.  It is important to pay tribute to workers, entrepreneurs and successive Governments for bringing this about.  This is the background against which we must look at the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that the debt-GDP ratio is very important in terms of economic development.  Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies could not be bothered to attend this important debate.  However, a few days ago some of them made ludicrous comments on public spending next year.  The Government has kept the parameters of European Monetary Union foremost in its mind and we are on target to join European Monetary Union.  The route to the introduction of the euro in Ireland will be difficult because of the number of food-based domestic industries.  However, most people accept that this is an inevitable economic development, and the Government deserves great credit in this respect.  It is heartening to read <Col N="1661" /> reports that the debt-GDP ratio will be as low as 25-30 per cent in a few years.</P>
    <P>The report rightly stresses the absolute necessity for the economy to maintain its competitive edge.  We have one of the most open economies in the world, with imports and exports accounting for approximately 70 per cent of GDP.  This is better than the position in some of the larger exporting countries such as Japan where the figure is as low as 20 per cent.  If we do not trade our economy will die.  The maintenance by the economy of its competitive edge is related to the performance of the punt as we move towards European Monetary Union.  The report recommends the setting up of a council to constantly review the performance of the economy.</P>
    <P>We have been joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is responsible for research and scientific development.  I congratulate him on his outstanding work since taking office.  He has been involved in publishing the White Paper, he introduced a plan to strengthen the scientific base of our economy and to improve research and development facilities.  It is frightening to learn in this report that we spend only 0.8 per cent of GDP on research and development.  Our economy benefits from the electronics and computer industries.  The Minister's recent speeches to industry and the educational institutions must be carefully considered if we want to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>The report also states the importance of our green image to the economy.  That is more relevant now in light of the recent problems in the food industry.  Part of the growth in our economy is due to the increasing number of chemical companies located here.  Industrial estates in my constituency were planned for electronics and computer companies, but chemical plants are now located there and we welcome the extra jobs they create.  However, it is important that the stringent licensing measures introduced by the Environmental Protection Agency in County Wexford are adhered to by the chemical companies in north and west Dublin and in Cork city as it would be a disaster if our products lost the environmental seal of approval.</P>
    <P>The report makes some interesting comments about the telecommunications industry, even going so far as to suggest selling Cablelink.  This area of the economy is moving at breakneck speed and it is difficult for people in the industry to remain <i>au fait</i> with developments in the European markets, particularly in relation to deregulation.  We heard recently that a third mobile phone licence may be issued.  We must be aware of the increasing competition in this area. One has only to read the newspapers to realise the impact that developments in personal communications and in the computer industry have on people and the services and manufacturing sectors.</P>
    <P>The report also looks in detail at labour market management and provides useful suggestions to <Col N="1662" /> reduce long-term unemployment.  The solution seems to lie in education.  Teachers must accept some of the credit for our economic performance. Their contribution to ensuring that young people remain in school to leaving certificate level and then continue to third level education has been fundamental to the improvement of our economy.  In many urban areas, particularly those in west, north and south Dublin, there is still a low number of students doing the leaving certificate and then going to third level colleges. Dublin north-east has the second lowest level of third level access in this country.  I welcome the Government's energetic attempts through the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, to make universities increasingly accessible.  The new schemes for Dublin City University and Trinity College will help to improve relations between them and the deprived areas in their vicinity.  Education has been and will continue to be the key.  The resources we devote to it, particularly to maintain our outstanding teacher workforce, are well spent.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Costello, will deal with the local employment service.  When the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, was in Opposition he complained about the range of agencies we had set up, such as county enterprise boards, partnership boards, etc.  Perhaps there should be rationalisation in this area.  I would like all local representatives to be members of county enterprise boards, etc.  For the first time, Dublin Corporation has included a significant development budget in its 1997 Estimates, which will be funded through borrowing.  These agencies could be integrated with the local authorities to become district or community councils.</P>
    <P>The report refers to employers' and employees' PRSI.  We must keep this matter under close review.  Approximately one year ago the Minister for Social Welfare said we were better than other countries at meeting our commitments in relation to pensions.  The social insurance fund has played a fundamental role in providing significant funding for the more deprived sections of our community.  We would be foolish to unravel something which has stood the State in good stead over the years.  We should not join the extreme right wing slash and burn economists of the Progressive Democrats and the Small Business Association who have no remit and do not care about providing essential services, particularly for pensioners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report's recommendations on taxation, which will be part of an ongoing debate over the next month or six weeks.  I hope we can look forward to tax cuts in the 1997 budget which would be a start in implementing the good proposals in this report.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important report.  I thank the Government for its efforts in implementing some of its valuable recommendations and we must continue to keep proposals with which we do not agree under review.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the report, <i>Shaping our Future: A Strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century</i>.  It is extraordinary there is not one Member on the Opposition benches.  We are forever being lectured by the Progressive Democrats about enterprise, yet not one member of that party bothered to come into the House for this debate. That indicates the level of hypocrisy in that party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor referred to regional development and the relative weakness of regions west of the Shannon.  He referred to the difficulties encountered in establishing a solid infrastructure to maintain the population of County Sligo, which has decreased by 10 per cent in recent years.  I recall a time when Sligo had a strong football team, but it is unable to field a good team nowadays because the young population is not being maintained.  I support Deputy Connor's remarks about ensuring that provincial regions, particularly those west of the Shannon, are not allowed fall into decline.  In the past the IDA initiated a policy of developing rural sites for multinational companies, but the multinational sector now wants to locate in areas where there are substantial training and education facilities, which means most of them locate in large urban settings rather than in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Chapter 7 of the report deals with long-term unemployment.  If a large number of people remain in long-term unemployment, irrespective of a burgeoning economy and low inflation and interest rates, their quality of life will remain unchanged.  The high level of job creation is not percolating to the level we hoped in respect of the long-term unemployed.  However, I recently attended a National Economic and Social Forum seminar where, for the first time, statisticians indicated that the adage &ldquo;a rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo; has validity because of the pro rata increase in the number of the long-term unemployed entering the workforce and the increasing level of job creation.  It is extraordinary that only 1,000 people have signed off the live register even though 52,000 jobs were created last year.  We should examine why that is the case. Approximately 80 per cent of those jobs have been taken up by women.  It would be interesting to ascertain how many were created in the services industry, how many are part-time and so on.</P>

      <P>When dealing with the supplementary estimates for Enterprise and Employment I stated that I was disappointed there was not a greater uptake on the £5 million allocated in this year's budget for local employment services.  A total of £2 million was not used because of tardiness in recruiting and training personnel to operate this service.  Deputy O'Rourke emphasised on many occasions the crucial role the local employment service could play in respect of the long-term unemployed.  We should pressurise the partnership boards to train the mediators and get this service up and running as soon as possible.  That service, rather than individual schemes, was the main proposal put forward by the National Economic and Social Forum for addressing the problem of long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>An interesting development took place recently between the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, the Department of Education and Contact Point Northside Partnership.  Holy Rosary college was left to the vocational education committee and the partnership as a facility for the provision of suitable courses in education and training in the context of the local employment service.  Each partnership should identify a building that could be used to provide the necessary back-up and training services for those who want to get out of the cycle of long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>The service industry is burgeoning.  In general it is not regulated or unionised and the wages are low.  There are an increasing number of strikes in that sector.  As this is the most rapidly expanding sector in our economy it must be examined carefully.  Corporation tax is charged at the highest level, yet there is a presumption that services are not as productive as manufactured goods.  We should examine the possibility of lowering the levels of corporation tax as soon as possible in that sector.</P>
      <P>We must also address the problem of unemployment black spots, where there are major social problems, many of which involve drug-related crime.  Indeed, the Minister, as chairman of the ministerial task force, has been very involved in dealing with the drug problem by establishing a local multi-agency task force structure.  That must be a major part of the approach to both long-term unemployment and the quality of life in the areas which are most often neglected and disadvantaged in society.  We must look at it in terms of housing, health, social economy, community development and an integrated partnership approach.</P>
      <P>Despite all the lip service paid to a partnership approach, we have been particularly bad at implementing it in a meaningful way with the professional agencies and the community.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance sends his apologies.  He is attending an ECOFIN meeting.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index, which is compiled and published by the Central Statistics Office, is the standard measure of Irish inflation.  The purpose of the index is to measure the cost of purchasing a constant representative basket of consumer goods and services.  Identical products are priced in the same retail outlets on the occasion of each price survey, so that changes in the cost of this constant basket reflect only price changes.</P>
      <P>The fixed quantity or weight of each item in the CPI basket is proportional to the average amount purchased by all private households.  The fixed quantities or weights are retained for as long as they are considered representative of current household purchasing patterns.  These weights are determined by large-scale household budget surveys.</P>
      <P>The most recent such survey took place in 1994.  Its results are being incorporated into the new consumer price index series, the base period for which will be November 1996.  To date the CPI weights have been revised every seven years. However, it is intended they will be revised every five years from 1994.</P>
      <P>As the CPI is a price index it does not take into account substitution patterns, income levels, market conditions, income tax or social insurance.</P>
      <P>The current CPI series, which is based from November 1989, prices 495 varieties of consumer purchases.  Four surveys are held each year in the months of February, May, August and November.  Approximately 36,000 prices are collected at each survey from retail outlets in 82 cities and towns around the country by approximately 200 field staff.  In addition, 102 direct or postal surveys are conducted to collect central prices, such as utility charges.  From January 1997, the CPI will be surveyed on a monthly, rather than a quarterly basis, and will be re-based to November 1996.  Under this new series, 560 varieties will be priced, with about 45,000 prices being collected each month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> The Central Statistics Office is an independent statutory body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Its statistics are compiled using best practice as determined by qualified statisticians.  It is considered that the CSO's measurement of the CPI is accurate, and it does not overestimate or underestimate inflation.</P>
    <P>Inflation in 1997 is expected to average a little over 2 per cent.  However, this must remain a provisional assessment pending consideration of the CPI figures for November 1996, issued today by the CSO, and pending also the conclusion of work on drawing up of the macroeconomic forecasts which will be announced at the time of the budget.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory inflation performance in 1997 is required for entry to Economic and Monetary Union.  At present inflation for comparative purposes across the EU is measured, not by the CPI, but by the interim index of consumer prices. The IICP differs from the CPI by excluding certain CPI items, including mortgage interest payments, car insurance, road tax, foreign holidays and most health and education services. The items thus excluded together account for about 15 per cent of the weight of the CPI.</P>
    <P>As its name suggests, the IICP is an interim measure pending full regulatory agreement at EU level in 1997 on a successor index, to be known as the harmonised index of consumer prices.  In practice the HICP is not expected to differ a great deal from the IICP.  It is considered that the continued low inflation which is envisaged for Ireland in 1997 will enable us to meet the economic and monetary union inflation criterion. There can, however, be no room for complacency in this regard and vigilance must be maintained in relation to inflation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Equality and Law Reform for taking the Minister for Finance's questions.  I know he will be a more than able substitute.</P>
      <P>I have a number of supplementary questions arising from his reply.  I thank him for the detail on how the CPI is calculated but one of the purposes of tabling this question was to ascertain when the weighting of the basket of goods was last changed because a recent report from the US proved that the US inflation rate has been calculated inaccurately for at least a decade. According to the report, the main reason for the inaccurate calculation was the official measure did not properly reflect changes in quality when new produce replaced older goods, nor did it take account of changing consumer spending patterns when relative prices changed.  I understand from the Minister's reply this weighting is changed every seven years and the CSO is currently working on the 1989 weightings.  Is it intended that we will not need to wait seven years now to change the weighting given to the basket of goods because it is important that the rate of inflation is calculated accurately?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports from the US to which Deputy McCreevy refers. Measurement of inflation is not a cut and dried matter, but it has given rise to a good deal of debate on methodology for many years past.  I do not propose to go into the detailed statistical issues around which this debate revolves.  These are primarily within the competence of the CSO.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed confidence that the Irish CPI is an accurate measure of Irish inflation. This confidence is grounded on the statistical expertise of the CSO, which is an independent statutory body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It is also relevant to note here that the measurement of inflation in all EU member states for economic and monetary union assessment purposes will be carried out on a methodologically comparable basis across all member states when the HICP is in place next year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the weighting to which Deputy McCreevy referred in his supplementary, that is being improved because from now on it will be revised every five years from 1994 instead of every seven years and that is obviously an appreciable improvement.</P>

      <P>Another part of my question related to the anticipated level of inflation for 1997.  Today's announcement of the year-on-year inflation rate to November shows a somewhat marked increase in inflation of 1.9 per cent. Furthermore, yesterday's winter report of the Central Bank cautions against an expansionary fiscal policy and states that the danger of inflation may be exacerbated and there may also be a danger of an interest rate rise.  Will the Minister agree that the Estimates announced this week, which show a very high increase in the day to day Government spending for 1997, go against the cautions expressed by the Central Bank and give us some cause to worry about the inflation rate for next year?</P>

      <P>The Estimates represent a balanced and prudent response to the challenge of reconciling increased provision for vital social services with real improvements in the income of workers while at the same time preserving the sound state of the public finances.  The Minister for Finance considers that the Estimates do not jeopardise the continuation of low inflation here next year.  Deputy McCreevy, in talking about an increase in the inflation rate, does not have his figures quite right.  The inflation rate for 1994 was 2.4 per cent and 2.5 per cent for 1995.  The trend is towards a reduction rather than an increase, which is the result of sound and prudent Government policies and financing.</P>

The graph is going up.

We must wait and see what the budget will provide because it will be a key factor in determining the rate of inflation.  The year on year inflation rate for 1994 was 2.4 per cent, 2.5 per cent for 1995 and 1.9 per cent for this year. That represents an appreciable reduction and is welcome.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy is to continue to reduce the burden of the national debt on the economy.  To this end we intend to maintain the budgetary prudence followed in recent years.  The combination of this policy, with the strong growth in the Irish economy, has delivered a significant reduction in the debt burden.  The dramatic progress made in cutting the burden of debt can be demonstrated by the possibility that, at current exchange rates, the national debt may show an absolute reduction during the calendar year 1996 for the first time in nearly 40 years.  I stress that this possibility is based on current exchange rates.  This reduction would be the result of a very impressive budgetary performance, which will see the 1996 Exchequer borrowing requirement coming in significantly below target, combined with the impact of favourable exchange rate movements which have reduced the Irish pound value of our foreign debt.  Even though this outcome would result partly from the movement of exchange rates, it is, nonetheless, a strong reflection of the level of fiscal consolidation being achieved.</P>
      <P>This significant progress can be further illustrated by the likely reduction in the general Government debt to GDP ratio, the wider measure of debt relevant for Maastricht purposes. This ratio is expected to have declined from a peak of 117 per cent in 1987 to less than 75 per cent by the end of this year.  With continued fiscal discipline, the welcome downward trend in the debt burden should continue into the future.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm if the national debt, having regard to its projected reduction at the end of 1996, will be less than when the Government came to power, given that its policy has been to reduce the national debt? Given that the stability pact requires our budget to be in balance in good economic times, how does the Government propose to do that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We must await the outcome and provisions of the budget in that regard.  I am sure the Deputy will be pleased that for the first time in 40 years a reduction in absolute terms is a strong possibility in terms of the outturn for 1996. Apart from that, the debt burden ratios have fallen substantially.  The ratio of national debt as a percentage of GNP has fallen from 122.2 per cent in 1986 to a forecast figure of 82 per cent for 1996 and the general Government debt as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 116.8 per cent in 1986 to a forecast figure of 75 per cent for 1996. Leaving aside the aspect of a prospective reduction in absolute terms, they are substantial improvements in the debt ratios.</P>

      <P>I agree we would all like to see a reduction in the national debt, but it is important to remember that although the Government took office when the economy was booming it added £1000 million to the national debt in its first year in office.  What plans has the Government to reduce the Exchequer borrowing rate next year: the target set for this year was £729 million, 2 per cent of GNP?  In view of the Central Bank's warning and given that the economy is doing well, what are the plans to reduce the percentage of GNP in terms of our Exchequer borrowing requirement for next year?</P>

      <P>Indications are that there will be an appreciable undershoot in the EBR outturn for 1996.  The Minister for Finance and the Government will take due cognisance of representations and comments made by the Central Bank and elsewhere on what the appropriate figure ought to be set at in the budget for 1997.  Those representations and all appropriate relevant factors to the economy will also be taken into account by the Minister for Finance and the Government, having regard to social needs, the needs of our health and education services, taxation measures and so on. Those figures will be drawn together at budget time when the appropriate EBR target will be set for 1997 and we must await that outcome to know the figure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the committee's orders of reference as amended by the Dáil on 4 July inserted a proviso that nothing in the orders of reference should prejudice the right of individuals to meet with the Minister for Finance with a view to making pre-budget submissions directly to him in accordance with long-standing practice.</P>

      <P>I presume the Minister did not want to answer Question No. 4 in conjunction with this question.  Therefore I will not trespass on it until he has a chance to deal with this question.  Is it satisfactory that Deputy McCreevy, Deputy O'Hanlon and I should sit in a committee room listening to people who have moving and compelling cases to make for tax expenditure when at the same time a process is going on behind our backs, about which we have no knowledge whatsoever?  A disadvantaged group can come in seeking relief worth £0.5 million and the committee can spend half a day on it and at the end of the day can be told to be fiscally responsible.  Meanwhile in Merrion Street somebody is looking for relief of £20 million and none of us knows of it.  Surely it is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs that we get only a <Col N="1671" /> self-selecting group of people coming to us whereas the real business is being carried out behind closed doors.</P>

      <P>I do not want to comment on whether it is satisfactory beyond saying that is the order of reference of the Dáil.  It was the Dáil which left open the option of the Minister for Finance to receive submissions directly, in accordance with long-standing practice.  That is the rule of the Dáil and perhaps it should be changed and, if so, it would be a matter for you, a Cheann Comhairle, on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I understand the committee advertises for submissions and it is open to any group to respond and make their submission to the committee if that is what they want to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee advertises for submissions because it was given this job and asked to do various things by the Minister.  Are we the patsys who provide the front of house service for those for whom it would be too embarrassing to be seen on the steps of Government Buildings while at the same time the heavy players settle down to obtaining major concessions behind our backs?  What is the point in having politicians dealing with the high profile public issues which could have small implications for the Exchequer while the bureaucrats and the Minister are privately engaged in a different process which could have far more radical consequences for next year's budget?  Why should one aspect of this process be in public and the other in private?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility here rests with the Minister for Finance.  The procedure set up for the committee is relatively new and the parameters were set down by the Dáil.  In the context of the 1997 budget, the Minister for Finance has not as yet held any pre-budget meetings although meetings have been arranged with a number of the social partners.  From the point of view of any person or group who wish to make a submission, it is open to them to respond to the advertisement and come into the committee.  One cannot stop any person or group seeking to make representations to the Minister for Finance and he or his officials may respond in any particular way and may decline it.  The long established procedure until relatively recently was that representations were made to the Minister for Finance alone.  It is a new procedure which no doubt will be reviewed from time to time by the House as the necessity arises.</P>

      <P>I suggest the Minister remember the context in which this change occurred.  Heretofore, private representations were made to the Minister but there was also the alternative route of going to Jury's Hotel and paying £100 for a pre-budget lunch with the <Col N="1672" /> Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  We were told we would tidy up the whole arrangement and everything would be above board, that all the hard cases would be examined by a committee with the aid of experts to tell us the implications of what was going on.  We now find there is a parallel track where the real business is done and that, in large measure, we were going through a PR stunt to keep the heat off the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> In relation to the representations made on behalf of the persons mentioned in the Deputies' questions, my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, has already supplied details of these on 10 December, in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Bertie Ahern.  On that occasion, the Minister stated that representations were received by his Department in February last from the persons mentioned by the Deputies for changes in the taxation legislation dealing with discretionary trusts.  Two changes were proposed in the representations.  One change proposed was the extension of the capital gains tax retirement relief to cover specified categories of disposals of business assets by trustees to specified categories of relatives of the person who set up the trust. The second change proposed was the crediting of discretionary trust tax paid against any capital acquisitions tax liability arising for the recipients of assets distributed from discretionary trusts. Discussions subsequently took place between officials and representatives of the persons concerned in regard to the proposals in view of their complex nature and the issues involved.  It was made clear by officials that they had no mandate for negotiation and what they were doing was exploring the matter.  In the event the proposals put forward by the representatives were not acceptable and this was made clear to the representatives in October.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance sees no conflict with this case and the initiative agreed with the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to invite pre-budget submissions for 1997.  The approaches were made last February and the issues involved were complex and required examination by officials.  The committee's terms of reference as agreed by Order of the Dáil on 4 July 1996 provide that:</P>
    <P>nothing contained herein shall prejudice the right of individuals to meet with the Minister for Finance with a view to making pre-budget submissions directly to him in accordance with longstanding practice.</P>
    <P>As was said earlier, representations from the persons mentioned by the Deputies were made last February in the context of the 1996 Finance Bill.  The advertisements by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs seeking submissions in writing to be sent to them were placed in the newspapers on 28 June with a deadline for receipt of 2 August 1996.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in the reply to a priority question earlier today, the Minister has received, and continues to receive, submissions from persons who chose to write to him directly in relation to pre-budget matters.  All these submissions are, of course, considered in the run up to the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if the proposed changes had a gross fiscal value of about £80 million they would radically affect <Col N="1674" /> the budget arithmetic for 1997?  If that was the subject matter of negotiations between departmental officials and interested parties, the beneficiaries of the trust and their legal and accountancy representatives, the least the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs was entitled to was a hint that while it was grubbing around with £500,000 here and there and considering relief in certain areas, other people were in negotiation for something that would sweep away the basis for making any tax concessions that committee contemplated recommending to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that any variation of £80 million would affect the budgetary arithmetic for 1997.  That is obvious and undeniable.  There were no negotiations in the meeting with officials of the Department of Finance.  They explored the proposals put to them but nothing was done in that regard.  As regards the committee looking at the relevant dates, the events took place in February 1996 whereas the advertisements and arrangements in connection with the committee were not made until June &mdash; the events took place before the committee was up and running.  If any proposal had been contemplated when the committee was in operation, the Minister for Finance would have considered whether it was appropriate to refer it to the committee.  Such circumstances could arise, but in so far as this person is concerned, that was not an issue at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that contact was made in February last, but the decision was not made clear until October of this year.  Is it not reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the matter was under examination and no clear decision was made until the autumn of this year?  Does it not follow that this was a live issue in the Department of Finance at a time when the committee advertised for submissions from the public and conducted inquiries into other budget submissions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot outline the exact progression of dates as between February and October.  In October it was conveyed to the representatives of the people who made the submission that nothing would be done about it and their proposal was not acceptable.  I cannot say when precisely that decision was reached or whether the matter was seriously contemplated. The representation was a non-event.  It was not the Minister for Finance who met the people involved but Department officials, who simply listened to them.  Nothing was done about the matter.  The relevant activity took place before the committee procedure was in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the matter because my experience is that it is difficult to meet officials in the Department of Finance to propose tax changes.  Changes usually result from representations made directly to the Minister and sometimes the secretary but more often than not representations are initially made to the Revenue Commissioners who, in briefing the Minister for Finance, advise him that in the context of the budget he should consider representations made by a certain person or body.  There is nothing wrong with people making representations to the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Finance or the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on tax changes. That is the essence of the democratic process.  I would like clarification on how the representations were made in this case.</P>

I can think of some areas where Ministers for Finance have changed legislation down the years.  Eight times out of ten the initial representation is made by the Revenue Commissioners who would be aware of the matter in the first instance.  In this case, because of its high profile and media coverage of the event, I would like to know how the representations were made and what was the chain of events.</P>

      <P>Were the views of the Revenue Commissioners sought on these proposals?  Although the initial contact was made in February 1996, may I take it that nothing <Col N="1676" /> happened between March and September, or was there ongoing contact on and exploration of the issue?  Will the Minister also indicate in relation to these matters whether the magnitude of the tax changes sought would have required a separate Government decision?  Will he indicate also whether, up to the month of October 1996, any indication was given to the people seeking these tax changes that their proposal was unlikely to be accepted?</P>

      <P>I have no information in the brief as to what exactly was said at any particular meeting.  There meetings were held to explore the proposals, two of which took place in July with the final meeting being held in October, which presumably was when they were told nothing would be done about it.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it follow then that all the meeting took place after the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs had advertised for public representations?  Is it fair to draw an inference from the Minister's reply that the approach was made in February and that officials agreed in July to meet the proponents of this change on two occasions to explore the financial implications of what they were proposing?  What happened between those two meetings in October when a negative decision was imparted to these people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assume that the proposals made, their detail having been explored at the meetings in July, were considered in the Department of Finance to determine whether they warranted advancing or further consideration in any way.  It seems that by October they came to the conclusion they were not.  They were, accordingly, told that and nothing was done about them.</P>

      <P>In case the Minister may inadvertently mislead the House, I doubt that a decision of that magnitude would be made by officials down the line in the Department of Finance.  That is not my experience of the matter, and I realise the Minister is not the Minister concerned.  I imagine decisions such as that would have to be made at a higher level.  I suggest they would at least have to be put to the Secretary of the Department or the Minister who has ultimate responsibility for these matters.  Perhaps in a subsequent Question Time the Minister might inform us further on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday launched a national information programme on economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro.  As part of the national programme, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment launched a business awareness campaign which will be run by Forfás and which is aimed specifically at the business sector.</P>
      <P>The national information programme is designed in phases to provide information to the public about economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro as it proceeds.  It will be co-ordinated with the social partners and relevant trade and representative associations. The programme will in its early stages focus particularly on the information needs of businesses.</P>
      <P>The national programme will consist initially of the leaflets which were launched in the business awareness campaign yesterday: future leaflets will include advice for companies on particular business topics.  There will also be leaflets on further information as it becomes available, for example, on the Dublin European Council Conclusions, what the bank notes and the coins will look like, etc.  The programme will also include a world-wide web site on the Internet containing information on economic and monetary union: this will be continuously updated.  It is also hoped to produce a video about economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme will also provide information to pupils in the education system.  The Minister for Finance has already circulated to secondary schools an extensive presentation on economic and monetary union which he made to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs last March.  It is also intended to circulate copies of the ESRI report &ldquo;The Implications for Ireland of European Monetary Union&rdquo; to the libraries of all <Col N="1678" /> third level institutions so that students can consult it.  As the programme proceeds it will be broadened to include advertising in the media from the second half of 1997 onwards.</P>
    <P>The national information programme will be under the auspices of the Department of Finance. The Department has already established an informal group on economic and monetary union consisting of representatives of the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC), the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Irish Bankers' Federation, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (Ireland) and the Central Bank of Ireland. This group will have a key role to play in relation to the national information programme and will probably form the nucleus of a more formal group, like the Decimal Currency Board set up to oversee the decimalisation of the Irish pound in 1971, to co-ordinate the changeover to the euro as the economic and monetary union process develops.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the business awareness campaign is to raise awareness in the enterprise sector, especially among SMEs, of the implications for businesses of economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro. The initial goals of the campaign include encouraging companies to initiate a planning process; encouraging exchange of information and co-operation by bringing together different groups and organisations; and obtaining feedback on company requirements which will be used to help determine the development of the campaign.</P>
    <P>The business awareness campaign will be directed through business associations, professional bodies, and State agencies that deal directly with enterprises.  These will act as the main channel of communication with the enterprise sector.  They are represented on a consultative committee for the campaign.  By involving all the major participants in the changeover, the campaign will co-ordinate action, encourage co-operation and act as an information exchange.</P>
    <P>A management committee consisting of representatives from Government Departments, the Central Bank, and business people has been established to give strategic direction to the business awareness campaign.  Forfás has produced a series of leaflets in an information folder as the first phase of the campaign and these were presented at yesterday's launch.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the national information programme, including the Forfás economic and monetary union business awareness campaign, will run to the end of 1997 and is estimated to cost £300,000.  The National Programme was drawn up in consultation with the European Commission and the Commission has indicated that it will fund 50 per cent of this cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> Euro Week is being organised on behalf of the Minister for Finance by EAN Ireland, the organisation which sets the standards for article numbering, bar coding, scanning and electronic commerce, and the Licensed Vintners' Association.  EAN Ireland has distributed up to 10,000 posters to groceries, supermarkets, hardware stores, pharmacies and newsagents nationwide.  The posters feature four products priced both in euro and Irish pounds.  The Licensed Vintners' Association has invited some 250 of its members in Dublin city to display prices in Irish pounds and euro for Euro Week.</P>
    <P>In all cases the euro prices use a rate of one euro equal to 80 pence.  This rate is for illustration purposes only and has been chosen because it is easy to calculate with.  The costs of Euro Week are being borne by EAN Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's initiative in conducting this information campaign because recent surveys conducted among business people indicate that the level of awareness of economic and monetary union is very low.  What time during next year will these initiatives commence?  I am aware of the present one-week campaign, but is it intended to set out a coherent programme of information to improve public awareness of economic and monetary union in early 1997?  It is important, from everybody's point of view, that greater priority be given to this matter than heretofore.  It is not the fault of the Government or politicians.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has given this matter considerable attention, but only sketchy reports appeared about the concept in the national newspapers, although one paper was better than the other.  In general this has not caught the public imagination.  I urge the Government to press forward with an aggressive campaign early in 1997 in the run-up to D-day on 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that information dissemination on these questions be progressed in 1997 and 1998 with increasing emphasis as time goes on.  A major start has been made with this programme.  I have had a brief look at it and it looks quite impressive.  Arrangements are being made to circulate a copy of the Forfás Business Awareness Campaign Folder which was launched yesterday to all Oireachtas Members.  A major campaign is proceeding and this will have to be speeded up the closer we get to the critical phases in 1999 and 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether, as part of the process, a standard symbol has been decided upon for the euro, or will we all have to buy new keyboards?  Is there any proposal to continue using existing currency denominations?  Will there be a symbol for the <Col N="1680" /> euro which will be available to people without having to engage in unnecessary expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information on whether there will be a symbol.  My understanding is that both currencies will operate in tandem for a period before the domestic currency is withdrawn and we are left with the euro alone.  I can make inquiries about the symbol.  There will possibly be various symbols in use to highlight various aspects of the changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether the dissemination of information about economic and monetary union is being paralleled in all the European states?  If not, what states are engaging in the process along with Ireland?  Are both primary and secondary schools involved in disseminating information on economic and monetary union and the euro?  I agree with Deputy McCreevy that there is a lack of awareness and a need for a public campaign on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether the euro week programme mirrors exactly what may be going on in other countries in Europe.  No doubt they have their own campaigns under way and are as concerned as we are about ensuring the necessary dissemination of information on economic and monetary union, to business people initially, and also to everybody else.  I am sure they are doing that efficiently and we are determined to do the same.  The changeover to decimalisation was traumatic enough.  This is something that has to be undertaken and the Government is determined to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place.  All the relevant organisations and experts on this subject have been drawn together into an informal group on economic and monetary union.  I read out the list and Deputies will be satisfied that it is broad-ranging and comprehensive.  All levels of expertise that we have in this area will be drawn together to ensure that a worthwhile and effective public campaign is undertaken.  We have made a start and I am sure that, when Deputies see the material that has been circulated, they will be impressed by it.  It is only a start, and the Government recognises that.  The campaign will hot up in 1997 and particularly in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the changeover to decimalisation, which was supervised by a decimalisation board, was traumatic enough.  I distinctly remember that there was a massive abuse of the changeover by a number of retailers and manufacturers taking advantage of people's ignorance to massively increase their prices.  The price of a box of matches in particular shot up.  Is there any proposal to introduce a price stabilisation mechanism?  I am against price controls generally, but there should be some way of preventing unscrupulous people profiting from an inevitable <Col N="1681" /> degree of public confusion and ignorance by ripping people off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell. His recollections of some of the events that followed decimalisation accord with my own. Quite a bit of unacceptable activity went on at that time.  With the benefit of that experience I am sure steps will be taken at the appropriate time to ensure that that does not happen.  I will certainly bring Deputy McDowell's comments to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Before I move on to answer Question No. 8, I have been given a note about Question No. 4 to the effect that representations were made in writing to the Minister and to the Department on the same date and also that the Revenue Commissioners were consulted.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to abolish the residential property tax; and the plans, if any, he has to reduce the levels of tax relief which will be made available to the PAYE taxpayer for the forthcoming tax year in respect of the residential property tax.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's programme of renewal indicated that the future of residential property tax would be considered in the context of a professional study of local government financing undertaken by the Minister for the Environment.  As part of the study process a report, The Financing of Local Government in Ireland, was published by that Minister on 27 June of this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has recently indicated that he will publish a strategy statement on local government before the end of this year.  The question of residential property tax will also be considered in the context of this strategy statement.  Any taxation proposals in relation to the PAYE sector will be announced in the budget.  I do not plan to outline these at this stage.  The burden of tax on this sector has been reduced in the last two budgets and it is hoped to continue this reform in 1997.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could bring back to his colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for the Environment, the suggestion that he stop testing the public water by various leaks as to how this should be paid for. About two weeks ago a kite was flown regarding road tax.  That was quickly shot out of the sky. Another kite is now being flown about stamp duty and increasing the price of petrol.  Will the Minister bring his well known attribute of commonsense to bear on some of his colleagues in Government and ask them to make up their minds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy is sufficiently experienced to cast a cold eye on all such <Col N="1682" /> speculation in the newspapers.  All matters affecting budgetary considerations, the PAYE and other sectors will be given extensive and careful consideration by the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues.  They will direct the structure of the budget and its taxation aspects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's view of the suggestion that the abolition of residential property tax and service charges should be financed by increasing the price of petrol and stamp duty on certain houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be cautious about assessing newspaper speculation in a vacuum.  Budgetary considerations must be looked at as a whole.  All aspects of taxation must be considered together and that will be done carefully.  The Deputy may be assured that all aspects will be taken into account and the correct decisions will be made. However, we must await their announcement in the usual manner on budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether there is division at Cabinet on the future of the residential property tax?  The Minister did not address the present media speculation about other means of recouping revenue that might be forgone with the abolition of residential property tax or water charges.  Is there a consensus emerging on the matter at Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I restrain myself from engaging in speculation about media comments based on little or no substance.  I assure the Deputy the Government is solid on its taxation policies.  It will produce the next budget as it produced the last, with unanimity, great care and concern for the economy.  For the first time in 40 years there may be a reduction in the national debt in real terms, apart from ongoing reductions in the ratio base.  It is a remarkable achievement which is testament to the Government's economic, employment and taxation policies.  They will be followed through in the same vein in the 1997 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to speculation in a vacuum.  Are we to assume there is no proposal until the strategy document is published by the Minister for the Environment? Are we to assume from what the Minister said about the matter being addressed in the 1997 budget that the strategy document will be followed by implementation in the budget?  Will the Minister indicate whether, in those circumstances, it is fair to suggest that the idea floated about giving local authorities discretion with regard to motor tax was entirely speculative and did not come from the Minister for the Environment or his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell has sufficient experience to know what weight to place on the ongoing media reports.  The Deputy would be better engaged looking at the <Col N="1683" /> economy's performance than at media speculation from reporters trying to make names for themselves.  The issue of taxation will be dealt with carefully and prudently in the budget.  I know Deputies are anxious to glean information as to what may be in the budget but, as is usual, they will have to be patient.  The good news will come in the fullness of time.  The improvements in taxation will be continued in the budget and will be to the satisfaction of Deputies.  The economy is doing well, indeed, it has never been better.  The trends are excellent and the Government aims to continue on that course in a prudent manner.  Let us forget speculation and look at the facts which speak for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello should note that despite the first ever reductions in this tax he claimed were made in last year's budget, the amount of the yield from the tax has increased.  Will the Minister comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello's comments speak for themselves.  This tax has been in operation for some years, during the lifetimes of Governments involving all parties in the House.  It will be considered carefully by the Minister for Finance and the Government in the context of the 1997 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent does the yield of £14.6 million exceed the budget estimate? Will he explain the reason for the increase given that, according to Deputy Costello, there was a reduction in the number of households involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the yield has shot up to £14 million, it is just as well the Minister did not increase the tax in the budget.  If he had done so, the yield would probably be £30 million to £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello said there are fewer houses involved.  Other considerations apply.  As Deputy McDowell knows, household income, house valuations and so on are taken into account in assessing liability for residential property tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the number of households involved has reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information but it could be the subject of a very good second question.  I invite the Deputy to table it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard residential property tax as fair and equitable? Does he have information which suggests it is biased against residents in Dublin?  If he does not regard it as being unfair, what features suggest to him it is fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the same reply I gave to Deputy McDowell.  If the tax was so unfair, the Deputy's party, Fianna Fáil, would have abolished it in all the years it was in power. Under no circumstances would it support a tax it considered to be unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister about my party, I asked him about his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it ran with it and increased it on occasion.  That is not to say that its terms, like those of every other tax, will not be carefully considered and examined in the context of the 1997 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>By how much did house prices in the Dublin area increase in 1995 and 1996?  Has any thought been given to transferring the tax to private property in the ownership of landlords?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know by how much house prices have increased but I recall reading a report in recent days which suggested that they increased substantially during the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the key to the question raised by Deputy Fitzgerald.  What has made this tax more unfair and grotesque since its introduction by Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald before her appointment as Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It was retained by the Progressive Democrats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is that more and more ordinary family homes in this city are being swept towards it by a tide of high house prices over which individual taxpayers have no control.  Will the Minister agree it is deeply unfair on hard-pressed families struggling to make ends meet in ordinary homes in this city that their bill can be doubled from £300 to £600 out of post-tax income because of buoyancy in the housing market over which they have no control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is waxing lyrical on this subject but it rings rather hollow.  House prices have been increasing year on year for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party continued to operate this tax when in Government.  House prices are not the sole criterion, household income is also taken into account.  Deputy Fitzgerald's party also continued to operate it happily when in Government.  Most people will see it in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider the tax is heavily biased against Dublin residents? Will he face up to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All taxes will be reviewed in the context of the budget.  When the tax was reviewed in previous years, the Deputy's party did nothing about it.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take in the interests of restoring and safeguarding the hitherto strictly apolitical relationship between the Civil Service and the Legislature in view of the public statement of support for the Minister for Justice made by members of the Association of Higher Civil Servants and the subsequent statement repudiating those remarks issued on 15 November 1996 following a meeting of the association's executive committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23057/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 36 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>As he indicated in reply to a question on 3 December last, the Minister for Finance was concerned that comments in the statement issued in the name of the Association of Higher Civil Servants of 8 November 1996 raised issues about the political impartiality of civil servants.  He accordingly directed the Secretary in his Department with responsibility for public service management and development to take the matter up with that association.  He also directed that the issue be placed on the agenda for the November meeting of the General Council, a forum which brings together management and staff interests under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Council unanimously reaffirmed the long-standing position that civil servants should be politically neutral.  The Department of Finance has been in touch with all Departments <Col N="1688" /> to reiterate the rules in this area following that reaffirmation of the traditional position at General Council.  I understand the Secretary of the Department of Justice has spoken to the local branch of the AHCS in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the statement issued by the Association of Higher Civil Servants on 15 November 1996 in which it repudiated the statement made in the association's name on 8 November and apologised to the Government and Opposition parties for the intrusion into the political arena.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that civil servants are obliged under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, to remain aloof from politics and are prohibited from being a member of a political party?  Will he accept that if the statement of the Association of Higher Civil Servants goes unchallenged in the public arena &mdash; I understand contact has been made through the Department of Finance with the secretaries of other Departments, including the Secretary of the Department of Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not withdrawn unambiguously and unequivocally it is only a question of time before the AHCS or some branch of it will issue statements condemning Ministers or grading their performance on a scale of one to ten.  Does the Minister accept that it is not the function of the AHCS to make positive or negative comments about Ministers or to make any political statements on the performance of any Government, past or present?  Does the Minister accept that our civil servants are meant to be independent of the political process and that this is enshrined in legislation?  If the legislation is not adequate, will the Minister accept that amending legislation should be brought forward in relation to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the political impartiality of the Civil Service is absolutely essential.  At a recent meeting of the general council, which brings together both management and union interests, there was a unanimous reassertion of the long-standing position that civil servants should and must be politically impartial. The AHCS was represented at that meeting by its general secretary.  The Minister for Finance is reassured by the united support the concept of a politically impartial Civil Service received at that forum.  I remind Deputy Fitzgerald that the AHCS issued a strong statement on that question repudiating the statement put out by the branch in the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one problem with the Minister's reply.  Does the Minister accept the Government was a little bit tardy and that it was coy in responding in an authoritative way to what happened?  It took some time before a definitive <Col N="1689" /> response was issued.  Despite the positive moves by the Department of Finance, there is still a certain element of equivocation about such an unprecedented breach of all that was sacrosanct in the relationship that existed between Government and Administration.  It should have been roundly, unequivocally and unambiguously condemned forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there was any equivocation on the Government's part.  The position has been made clear and has been strongly reiterated.  The AHCS itself issued a definitive statement, which states:</P>
      <P>The AHCS executive committee, at its meeting on 14 November 1996, repudiated the statement issued in the name of the association on 8 November 1996.  The statement did not have the approval of the executive committee and does not represent AHCS policy.  The executive committee reaffirms that the association is apolitical and as a matter of policy neither forms nor expresses views on the merits of any Minister.  The executive committee expresses its apologies to the Government and Opposition parties for the intrusion into the political arena.  The executive committee expresses its full confidence in the general secretary and the officials of the association.</P>
      <P>It could not have been clearer than that.  Any further action that may be appropriate would, of course, be a matter for the Department of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief statement on this important report and the consequences it will have in the Border region.  I want to make a strong plea to the Minister to ensure that Structural Funds as currently applied will remain in place after 1999. There is a danger of such funds not remaining in place because of the great strides that have been made in the country as a whole, more especially in the east, south-east and greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The residential property tax was referred to earlier but we do not have that problem in the Border region.  That fact shows the disparity between the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country.  It also reflects the growth that has taken place in Dublin and the south-east.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the marvellous announcements he has made in recent weeks concerning job creation.  These are positive jobs for the future of our young people and, while many of the jobs are to be located in Dublin, I have no objection to that.  I understand the reasons companies locate in the Dublin area, including proximity to Dublin Airport and sea ports, because computer companies, in particular, must compete on world markets.  While that area is quite a technical one, our young people are adept at working in such high technology industries.  Thousands of skilled young people from all over the country, including Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Leitrim, are taking up places in these industries.  In effect, this process moves young people from other areas to the east and south-east.  The success these industries brings ensures that other industries will also establish enterprises here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking to the future, however, the Border region must get a fair crack of the whip.  Because of the substantial rise in incomes we will probably move out of objective 1 as we will have passed the income benchmark laid down by the European authorities relating to qualification.  That will mean reduced funding from Structural Funds at a time when the whole country has not made the same advances as the east or south-east.  There is a strong and genuine case to be made for regionalising the country between the Border region and the west.  Deputies from the west will make their own case well, as Deputy Connor did earlier, but I am making a case for the Border region.  If the whole country is to be designated as moving out of objective 1, the Minister should ensure the country is regionalised so that the Border region will remain in objective 1 for a further five to ten years.  It can then rise to the <Col N="1691" /> same level of development that has taken place in the east and south-east.</P>
    <P>The case can be based on the fact that for the last 25 years the six Border counties, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, have suffered as a result of violence in the North.  This often goes unnoticed because full attention is not drawn to the fact that economic development in that region has not matched development elsewhere.  That is because industrialists were reluctant to locate in the Border region due to the spillover of violence.  The tourism industry suffered badly because people were afraid to visit the Border region.  The constituency I represent, Cavan-Monaghan, has much to offer in respect of tourism projects.  However, tourism projects require the provision of Structural Funding during the next five to ten years to ensure maximum development.  That is not an unrealistic or unfair case to make.</P>
    <P>It has been noted that roads in my area are the worst in the country.  However, we are taking action in that regard and facing up to the task that confronts us.  In that context, I welcome the provision of Government assistance through the medium of Structural Funds but there is a long way to go.  Cavan-Monaghan does not have access to the type of motorway recently opened in Dublin by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  That motorway is a welcome development which helps the northern part of the country in so far as traffic travelling to Dublin city or Dublin Airport will reach its destination more rapidly.</P>
    <P>Aghalane Bridge, situated on a national primary road in my constituency, is the only major Border crossing to remain unopened in the six counties bordering Northern Ireland.  Many people in authority are not aware of this fact.  We are working towards building a proper roadway to the bridge which was blown up by the British Army as a precaution against what it identified as a danger or threat to County Fermanagh and the towns of Enniskillen and Lisnaskea.  This action has greatly affected the towns of Belturbet, Ballyconnell and Cavan in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Northern Ireland authorities are engaged in rebuilding the bridge and, with its reconstruction, a proper road structure will be in place within the next two to three years. However, in the interim, we remain cut off as the end of the present Structural Funds agreement in 1999 approaches.  A case for a further extension of funds can be made on that basis.  This will only be achieved if those in power decide in fairness to the Border and western regions, to regionalise the country.  Those regions, because of their problems and the low incomes which prevailed, helped to maintain the country's objective 1 status when the last review took place in 1993.  It would be wrong and unjust were we to be removed from the maximum payment section of objective 1 status.  The eastern and south eastern <Col N="1692" /> regions have moved far ahead and in the absence of regionalisation this will ensure the entire country loses objective 1 status, despite the fact that the Border region has not benefited from the developments that occurred.  As already stated, I welcome developments which are beneficial to the country as a whole, and the Government is to be complimented on its excellent management of the economy.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the bedrock of the economy in the Border region but milk quotas there are the lowest per farm.  Co-operatives and those involved in agriculture, North and South, make the case that, because of the troubles, farmers were prevented from developing their farms to the same extent as their counterparts elsewhere. Milk quotas in the Border region are less than the national average.  They range between 10,000 to 15,000 gallons, which is not viable.  An application is to be sent to Brussels to increase milk quotas in the Border region and the six counties of Northern Ireland to the realistic level of 30,000 gallons per farm.  This will create a sustainable income for family farms.  It will mean that an additional 30 million gallons will be divided between farmers in the six counties north of the Border and their six Southern counterparts.  This application will take the form of a peace initiative in the region and will not cost European taxpayers anything.</P>
    <P>Farmers in Northern Ireland, some of whom were close neighbours of mine, suffered greatly and tragically lost their lives caring for cattle at night.  A number of them walked on booby traps and were blown to pieces.  This created concern among other farmers and did not help the development of the region because people lived in fear of their lives for 20 to 25 years.  Thankfully, things have improved during the past two years but we cannot just forget the troubles and state that that period of history is over.  We owe it to those who died to do something and we have an opportunity to do so.  A case has been made by farmers and farm co-operatives in Border areas for the division of 30 million gallons between farmers living in the six counties on either side of the Border.  This proposal is currently before the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and others for consideration.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the issue of milk quotas does not come under the remit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment but it would be in good hands were the Minister there to take responsibility for it.  I am interested to hear his comments on regionalisation of the country to ensure that the Border region will continue to receive Structural Funds for the next five to ten years.  This would enable it to reach the stage of development which has been achieved by other regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first deal with the points raised by Deputy Boylan who, as always, highlighted a very cogent policy issue.  There is no doubt that <Col N="1693" /> the challenge of regional policy is very important to my Department.  The Deputy is correct to recognise that IDA development changed in recent years and increasing emphasis is now placed on large instead of small projects and on projects concentrated in the electronics sector rather than spread across a range of manufacturing sectors.  Those projects are increasingly attracted to centres with high population and well developed infrastructures. Educational infrastructures are a very important attraction for overseas investment.</P>
      <P>There has been a shift in the regional division of job approvals.  Deputy Boylan is correct in recognising that the Border region has not thrived as well, in that environment, as other regions.  It will be difficult to reverse that trend because companies locating certain types of operation in Ireland will want to base their concerns in areas where their needs will be met. The Deputy recognised that fact.</P>
      <P>The challenge, in respect of regional policy, is to consider how we can develop the regions more effectively.  I see that development being built upon other activities in the industrial sector, particularly the construction of linkage initiatives. It is significant that the new national programme for developing links was launched successfully in the west.  A good structure of sub-supply companies has developed in that region and these are capable of winning substantial business from larger FDI concerns that have established in Ireland.  We must look more at analysing regional strengths rather than chasing the hope, which might be difficult to realise, that large electronic firms might be shifted throughout the regions. This will not be easy to achieve and we must look carefully at the strengths of each region and how they can be exploited.  The regions have significant strengths in the areas of links and sub-supply and the development of the services industry with foreign and domestic investment. The services sector has become the most dynamic element of IDA and Forbairt investment in recent years.  Almost half the jobs created by the IDA come from service oriented companies, which are more regionally mobile than manufacturing companies.  It is now possible to develop effective tele-based activities in more remote areas as technology opens up more possibilities.  It is significant that Killorglin, which is not regarded as a highly developed urban area, has a very successful business which supplies tele-based services worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the development of enterprise strategy in the coming years, we must look more closely at the regional dimension to see how, for example, Border areas can establish strengths to attract industries.  The remarkable feature of counties Cavan and Monaghan is the very large number of indigenous companies which have been steadily expanding their businesses over a long period. Even though they do not have the traditional inflow of foreign direct investment, the enterprise culture is particularly strong in counties Cavan <Col N="1694" /> and Monaghan.  The Deputy rightly referred to the new thinking required in this area and I hope we will be able to devote our attention to this.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to EU Structural Funds and asked if certain regions in the west or along the Border should be given Objective One status.  This is not necessarily a wise approach as Ireland is still very much in a developmental phase as regards the EU and the objective of European social and economic cohesion is to achieve a balance between the regions.  Ireland's picture is distorted by a number of factors, one of which is the very unusual relationship between gross domestic product and gross national product which is caused by the very substantial overseas element of our business.  The domestic product is bloated by profits which are transferred abroad and other overseas transfers. If one looks at gross national product, real disposable income, one will see that we still have a considerable way to go in this area.  Equally, if one looks at infrastructural development one will see that roads and other infrastructure need further development.  Ireland and Greece are the only countries in the EU which do not have a land link to other member states and this creates particular pressures in respect of economic and social cohesion.  I do not wholeheartedly support the points made by the Deputy as this issue must be very carefully considered.  Ireland is still very much in a developmental phase and the effective use of EU transfers should not suggest they can be quickly cut off.  Rather we are in a process of development which must be sustained.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the case made for the west which is supposed to have done very badly. This issue deserves careful scrutiny as the employment performance in the west last year was second to none.  The 22,000 extra jobs created in counties Mayo and Galway last year indicate that the sectors in the west are thriving and strong.  The idea of breaking down the country into small sub-regions may not get us that far.  We must develop the different strengths of the regions and not draw artificial lines which do not have a great economic basis.  This is not to say I do not recognise clearly the particular needs of the Border region.  At the suggestion of the Deputy and his colleagues, I have been very attentive to these needs in recent times.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Forfás on bringing forward this report.  It is the first time we have taken a 15 year view of the economy and tried to identify the forces which will break upon Ireland during this period and how we can prepare for them.  These changes will be dramatic and forceful and will gather pace as the years go on.  The trend towards globalisation is accelerating and companies like IBM, which have made a very significant investment in Ireland, are world players.  They make their investments on the basis of how they will compete on the world market.  This lesson underlines the need for a country like Ireland to be extremely competitive, flexible and adaptable and to put strong emphasis on the development <Col N="1695" /> of the strengths of our people.  We have a superb educational system which we must continue to develop.  We must also develop the concept of learning within business so that education and learning are not confined to the educational system but are at the very heart of business.  The successful businesses of the future are those which learn from their environment and are in a position to respond effectively to the challenges facing them.</P>
    <P>In the coming years the information society will be further opened up and will affect every business and walk of life.  If we do not move quickly to seize the opportunities thrown up by this development we will miss a golden opportunity.  There will also be a dramatic shift to services as a source of employment.  Forfás predicts that within the next 15 years 85 per cent of employment growth will be in the services sector rather than in the manufacturing sector. We need to address the policy changes which have to be made if we are to respond to this.</P>
    <P>The main point of the strategy put forward by Forfás and the many people who contributed to the report is that if we are to remain competitive into the 21st century we must look not only at the traditional tools of business &mdash; markets, finances and labour costs &mdash; but also at the educational system, the infrastructure in place and the development of transport and logistics.  Industrial development will be a matter for every element of Government work and not one Department. The report states that an effective and efficient public service is as important to our long-term competitiveness as some of the traditional tools measured in world competitiveness reports.  If we are to develop an effective economy we must have strategic management in every walk in life, including the public service.  This is what makes the SMI process being undertaken within Government so important in the long-term; our public policy thinking and administration must be in tune with the challenges facing us.</P>
    <P>The report is extremely valuable in that it takes a longer term perspective and sets out real challenges for us.  We must take an early lead in the area of technology and look at our language strengths and how we can develop our skills and technology to secure overseas investment.  We must look at the way our people are trained and educated, particularly in relation to business.  We must start to reposition our businesses within indigenous industry so that we are not exposed to global competition from cheaper cost countries which would challenge Irish business.  We must develop our traditional sectors in areas where they can command good margins, with better added value and positioning in the marketplace. That is a huge challenge.  It will be an integrated framework which will challenge medium-term policy across a whole range of Government activities.</P>
    <P>This is a useful report which challenges us to make policy changes over the coming decades.  It <Col N="1696" /> also indicates what the rewards will be for meeting those challenges.  It mentions the possibility of bringing unemployment down to 5 per cent of the labour force, reducing long-term unemployment to 50,000 and creating over 300,000 jobs in the next 15 years.  I am gratified that the past two years have shown that the economy is capable of meeting and exceeding those challenges, provided we continue to manage our resources effectively.  The past two years have been outstanding in terms of employment.  We have achieved more in two years than has been achieved since independence. There has been a tremendous transformation in economic performance in recent years and we should build on this rather than become complacent about it.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their participation in the debate and I hope we will be able to act on the points raised in the coming years.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Vegetable Industry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise the future of the vegetable industry.  The decline of the horticultural industry, particularly over the past ten years, has badly affected the growers not only in Rush and Lusk in my constituency but also throughout the country.  In the mid 1970s, for example, there were approximately 2,000 vegetable producers.  Today there are only 600. In 1994 we imported over £87 million worth of vegetables.  In this context, it is hardly surprising that Irish producers have cut back on the amount they produce.  Producers have had a difficult time with little or no price increases, increased production costs and competition from imports. Is it any wonder that producers are becoming disillusioned?  Producers, wholesalers and retailers must ensure they have a future in this business.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the market for fresh vegetables was worth £150 million; we cannot afford to neglect it.  What is required to ensure that the market for Irish vegetables is maintained and, perhaps, extended to the UK?  There must be opportunities that we, as a country with a good environmental record, can exploit.  We talk a lot about our green image.  It is time to put it to good use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must convince consumers that Irish vegetables are of the highest quality, meet strict hygiene standards and are produced in a clean and environmentally friendly way.  An Bord Glas and Teagasc have a major role to play in this regard.  A co-ordinated plan is needed to identify the market requirements throughout the year, especially those of the supermarkets which comprise almost 60 per cent of the market. Investment is urgently required to improve our marketing strategy and to enable us to avail of modern multimedia advertising techniques.  The message must be conveyed that there is no need <Col N="1697" /> to purchase imported vegetables and that for most of the year home grown vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, swede turnips and cauliflowers are available.</P>
    <P>We should compliment Teagasc on its achievements in research and development which have been of great benefit to the industry. However, more research staff are urgently required to supplement the efforts of the existing researcher who is no longer working on a full-time basis in the vegetable industry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister at a time of economic boom to make further investment in the horticultural industry which, unlike the wider agricultural industry, cannot avail of intervention or support mechanisms.  I compliment the Minister on his commitment to the industry.  If he can secure the Government's approval for additional funding, he will contribute to the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs in rural communities.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Deputy on his comprehensive treatment of the horticultural industry.  Our membership of the EU and of the Single Market and the operation of the common organisation of the market in vegetables have resulted in increased competition in the Irish market for vegetables from the perspectives of both price and range of products. The best response that producers can make is to continually strive to improve efficiency and quality.  The Government continues to provide funding to Teagasc to enable it to continue its research and advisory programme on, <i>inter alia</i>, vegetable production.</P>
      <P>The Bord Glas development plan is a five-year plan aimed at developing the potential of the horticultural industry, including the vegetable sector.  The main emphasis within the sector will be on maintaining and increasing domestic market share which now stands at 75 per cent to 80 per cent for the principal lines.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I established the Horticultural Industry Forum, comprising representatives of producers, wholesalers, retailers and State bodies with a view to creating closer co-operation between the various strands of the industry.  In its programme for 1997 An Bord Glas, in co-operation with producers, wholesalers and retailers, is placing heavy emphasis on increased market co-ordination.  Both the IFA and growers in north County Dublin are appreciative of the role An Bord Glas is playing in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its 1997 programme, in co-operation with producers, wholesalers and retailers, An Bord Glas will place heavy emphasis on increased market co-ordination.  The IFA and growers in north county Dublin appreciate the role An Bord Glas plays in this regard.  A number of EU assisted grant aid schemes are available to producers, including the farm improvement <Col N="1698" /> programme, the scheme of grant aid for investment in commercial horticulture and FEOGA processing and the marketing grant aid scheme.  They provide valuable assistance towards the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>In early 1997 I intend to summon all the agencies that play a role in the horticulture sector to establish how we can avoid fragmentation and duplication.  We want to get the best value possible from the funding available to that sector. I am glad the Deputy raised this matter as it enabled me to outline what the Government is doing for the horticulture sector.  It will receive every attention possible in 1997.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is overwhelming evidence that the work of the International War Crimes Tribunal is in serious crisis because of the non-enforcement of its orders by State authorities to arrest indicted war criminals.  The tribunal's president, Cassese, and the former Judge Goldstone warned that if those indicted for war crimes are not arrested they could not do the job they were appointed to do.  If they cannot do the job they have been appointed to do, what is the point in the tribunal continuing?</P>
      <P>It is obscene that the war criminals are still free.  It is devastating for the victims of these appalling crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda to see those who committed them walk free.  It is depressing and dangerous.  The international community is being challenged to take effective action and we must continue to raise our voice in this regard.  Members of the UN Security Council and France, Britain and America, must take decisive action and not let commercial arms or other interests make the tribunals ineffective.  This is an appalling precedent to set.</P>
      <P>In the days of instant media coverage, to see war criminals walking with impunity past international police forces and the UN makes a mockery of our efforts to secure international justice.  If the international community does not bring war criminals to justice now &mdash; they may never be in a better position to do so &mdash; we will send out a message that there is no justice and that we are prepared to compromise other human beings, using humanitarian aid to solve our collective conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credibility of the international community is at stake in the way we handle these tribunals. There is a real danger that the victims who have been terribly affected by the appalling crimes will end up seeking vengeance and a new war could erupt.  The crimes committed were horrendous and many thousands of women, as well as men, were affected.  They are victims of a conflict which they neither initiated nor directed.  I hope we can use the end of the Irish Presidency of the EU to press for justice for the women who were raped during the atrocities in Bosnia.  I congratulate the Department of Foreign Affairs <Col N="1699" /> which has shown commitment in a practical way by funding the training of counsellors to set up a centre in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>When the international crime tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was established in response to the enormity of the human rights violations in the region, its stated aim was to put an end to such crimes and to bring to justice the persons responsible.  For the first time rape was to be prosecuted as a war crime.  It is appalling that there has been little or no progress in prosecuting those who raped women in the former Yugoslavia.  There is inadequate protection for women witnesses, we need to set up legal centres for those women.  The anonymity of witnesses is not guaranteed.  Women are fearful for themselves and their families.  I hope we can lead in ensuring the advancement of an awareness and the protection of fundamental human rights for women worldwide.</P>
    <P>During the conflict in Yugoslavia thousands of women were raped by soldiers.  The commission of experts established by the UN Security Council to investigate these allegations found that rape and the detention of women occurred on a massive scale, that it was organised and systematic and used as an instrument of war. Rape camps were established.  After two years, we must ask why so few people have been arrested and tried.  What is preventing those 60 or more indicted war criminals in the former Yugoslavia from being arrested?  The international community is seriously failing in its duty to protect the victims of the conflicts in Rwanda and Yugoslavia and confidence in international human rights is being eroded.</P>
    <P>Surely arresting war criminals is the cornerstone of a successful policy in this area.  We advocated setting up the war crimes tribunal. What can we do now to make sure it is effective? Should economic sanctions be imposed?  Why are France and Belgium harbouring known war criminals?  For many people the tribunals are their only hope of justice and they must be seen to be effective.  Otherwise the atrocities being committed by extremist paramilitary groups will be validated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy is serious.  The sad reality is that fewer than 21 people in Rwanda have been indicted and warrants issued for their arrest.  Requests have been sent to national courts in Belgium, Cameroon and Switzerland to bring indicated persons before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest shortcoming of the UN and the international system has been the failure of the war crimes tribunal process to deliver justice.  It may be delivering law but it has little to do with justice.  In Rwanda the court process has been exceptionally slow.  There have been complaints about the condition of the building, the roof leaking and so on, to deflect the court from <Col N="1700" /> dealing with the matters before it.  There have been approximately 74 indictments in Yugoslavia. Seven people have been arrested, one has been convicted and another man's trial recently concluded.</P>
    <P>We have supported the war crimes tribunal by providing monetary and other supports and we will continue to do this.  However, I question whether this mechanism will deliver the type of mass justice that major disasters such as the genocide in Rwanda or the killing in the former Yugoslavia require.  While we will continue to support the tribunals, I am rather cynical about their ability to deliver mass justice.</P>
    <P>The question of local justice versus the international tribunals is a difficult matter.  There are 90,000 people held in severely overcrowded jails in Rwanda who will be tried under its local system.  Unless money is provided for local systems of justice, relatively small numbers of people will be indicted at international tribunal level while hundreds of thousands of other dreadful crimes will go, not only unpunished, but untried.  This is also true in the case of the former Yugoslavia.  When I met the lawyers working with the women in the former Yugoslavia last week I asked them how, in their opinion, women parliamentarians, in particular, could address in a realistic manner the demands for justice by women who have been raped or whose partners or children have been killed.</P>
    <P>One of the ways of doing it is by a permanent international criminal court but another way is by addressing the questions of justice at a local level and perhaps using the forms which have been used in South Africa, such as the truth commission which would encourage people to come forward and confess.  This would not necessarily involve the kind of very detailed system on a mass scale to which the war crimes tribunals give rise at present which inevitably mean that only a tiny fraction of the people who have been involved in war crimes can be tried.</P>
    <P>The other matter which must be addressed by the international community is, unfortunately, that there are people committing war crimes in eastern Zaire and parts of the former Soviet Union.  They can continue to do so with impunity because they have no sense that there is an international or local justice system which will subsequently call them to account in a rapid and effective manner for what they have done.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm seans a fháil le rud éigin a rá i dtaobh an ábhar seo.  We are into the last two weeks of the Irish Presidency of the EU and there are many expectations.  Like many organisations, I feel we have a once-off opportunity to amend the Maastricht Treaty with regard to the rights of children.  There are 120 million children in the EU yet it is difficult to believe that they are excluded from European <Col N="1701" /> social policy and many, if not all, the EU programmes which have developed over years.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, again raise within the Intergovernmental Conference discussions the eight amendments proposed by Focus on Children and the European Children's Network, known as Euronet, who have lobbied the Governments to ensure and clarify the situation with regard to the citizenship right of children?</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the rights of children have been infringed on many occasions and we know that a unanimous decision was made by the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 19 September with regard to the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, child prostitution and the increased threat from the use of the internet by paedophile networks.</P>
      <P>I know that the Government is considering tabling an amendment to address that matter, and I would welcome that.  I believe the Government is looking at age discrimination, and references to paedophilia and abuse being encompassed.</P>
      <P>I also hope there will be an overall focus with regard to the rights of children.  I know that Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, said that the legal advice which was given to him at the time indicated that children's rights were, in fact, encompassed in the Treaty, yet I believe he said he would go back to the legal people who were advising the Council of Ministers on the matter and re-examine whether that legal advice would stand up.  There is a need for clarification on the matter.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to one amendment which has been proposed by Focus on Children and Euronet, the addition of the following new third paragraph to Title II, Part Two Citizenship of the Union, Article 8:3.  Children shall enjoy the rights of other citizens of the Union with the exception of those matters excluded to minors by law.</P>
      <P>I believe there is general national and Union consensus on the intention to cover children and young people within the EU Treaty but when we go beyond intentions, and people, especially legal people, drag through words, sentences and innuendo, there are concerns that perhaps it would not stand up and that there is no clarity in the Treaty.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State in the last two or three weeks of the Irish Presidency to give leadership to ensure this matter is clarified and amendments tabled to the Maastricht Treaty to ensure what we all want but perhaps have not clarified, that children have the same rights as any other citizen within the EU. I ask the Minister of State to consider that, in particular, because children are the future, not only of this nation but of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the awful atrocities which have been perpetrated against children not only in Ireland but in Belgium, in particular, this year, I hope we do not need a crisis to amend the Treaty.  I also hope the Minister will ensure that if amendments are needed, which I believe is the case, they will <Col N="1702" /> be included and that Ireland will take the leadership role to ensure children's rights are encompassed in one of the most important treaties of the EU.</P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has been asked to address three main areas: first, bringing the Union closer to its citizens, secondly, giving the Union a greater capacity for external action, including by strengthening and enlarging the scope of the Union's common foreign and security policy; and, thirdly, ensuring the effective functioning of institutions and the efficiency of the decision-making process, including in the context of further enlargement.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Intergovernmental Conference must not lose sight of the fact that while institutional and other questions are a necessary part of the Intergovernmental Conference's agenda, the people's verdict on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be governed largely by the extent to which it addresses and is seen to address the direct concerns of citizens.  We have made it clear that the overriding objective for our Presidency as a whole, of which the Intergovernmental Conference is one important part, is to contribute to the advancement of Europe in a manner which corresponds to the aspirations of its peoples, relevant to their everyday concerns and responsive to their needs.  Deputy Coughlan's question on the need to protect children concerns an issue which is unquestionably of direct concern to citizens.</P>
      <P>Much is being done on the basis of the present EU Treaty.  The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, for example, to which Deputy Coughlan referred, acted very rapidly at their recent meeting when they adopted four joint actions to enhance co-operation in this area and step up co-operation against organised paedophilia and trafficking in persons.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has been convened specifically to consider amendments to the Treaty, which is in a sense the Constitution of the European Union.  Any progress in that regard would complement progress in the ongoing day-to-day functioning of the Union.</P>
      <P>The draft outline Treaty presented by the Irish Presidency proposes that the Treaty provisions on Justice and Home Affairs are strengthened to develop a Union in which people can live without fear of threats to their personal security.  It is clear that a strengthening of the Treaty provisions in this area will contribute to making the Union more responsive to the needs of all citizens, including our younger citizens.  In this regard we have, as Presidency, proposed very significantly strenghening the objectives of the Union in the fight against international crime including, specifically, trafficking in persons and crimes against children as well as the means at the disposal of the Union in pursuing those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the broad heading of fundamental rights <Col N="1703" /> in the draft outline Treaty the Irish Presidency has put forward a proposal to strengthen the non-discrimination principle in the Treaty.  The Presidency's approach suggests the establishment of a legal basis in the Treaty which would permit the Council to adopt appropriate legislative provisions in respect of discrimination. Discrimination on the grounds of age is one of the aspects specifically covered in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency's document proposes draft texts on several other areas, such as employment, which are designed to address the concerns of all citizens and which have a particular relevance for younger citizens.  The draft outline Treaty is a Presidency document. Delegations are not asked to sign up to it as a text in all its details.  It represents a good basis for further work with a view to seeking final agreement under the Netherlands Presidency at the Amsterdam European Council on a treaty which would equip the Union to address the challenges ahead and to respond to the needs of citizens.  Unanimous agreement will, of course, be required for all Treaty changes.  We are very encouraged by the positive reaction from other member states to our document and to its ambitions for Europe.  The organisations to which Deputy Coughlan referred are among a number that put forward extremely positive proposals that need to be framed in constitutional language. They offer an exciting view of Europe and facilitate explaining in simple language complicated matters that are in the interests of parents and their children.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  My question is relatively simple.  I will dispense with my prepared notes and, if the Minister has a prepared script, I ask him to do likewise.  He is aware I wish to raise the matter of Ard Scoil Rís in Marino.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 the school has sought approval for an extension comprising six classrooms, a library, a general purpose area and a storeroom for construction study purposes to meet the growing needs of the school.  Sanction for the extension was granted in 1993, stage four of the planning process has been reached and all the relevant documentation has been submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 525 pupils and in excess of 34 staff in the school.  The principal and vice-principal are faced with a difficult task every year of refusing children entry to the school because they do not have the capacity to offer enrolment to children in their catchment area.  There is a severe accommodation crisis in the school which is restricting the teaching of the curriculum.  The fact that the PE hall is being used as a classroom will give the Minister of State an insight to conditions in the school which are far from ideal <Col N="1704" /> for educational purposes.  Children are being denied an opportunity to be educated in Ard Scoil Rís.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem is simple.  Proper planning is required, the project must be given the green light and those charged with responsibility for putting the pieces together must ensure the building project goes ahead to meet the needs of the school in 1997.  Will the Minister give a simple yes or no answer to the question of whether funds are available?  Will he sanction the necessary funds to ensure the building works proceed in 1997?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to be generous in his response.  I heard him debate in support of similar projects when he was on this side of the House. He will agree I am not being unrealistic in asking that the school be given an indication of whether it will be able to proceed with the project in 1997.</P>

      <P>In October 1994 the provision of additional accommodation was approved, in principle, by the Department of Education.  This accommodation will be provided in a permanent extension to the school and will cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 525 pupils.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>From information published by the pension fund industry, the pension fund sector had total assets in excess of £16 billion at end of 1995, with over £6 billion or nearly 40 per cent of these funds invested in overseas assets.  Over the past three years, pension funds in Ireland have focused on the establishment of a venture capital fund and on identifying suitable investment opportunities in the domestic economy.  The venture capital initiative launched in 1994 resulted in the pensions sector agreeing to commit some £50 million to venture capital projects over a five year period.  This in turn led to further pledges amounting to £45 million from other sources, bringing the total fund to £95 million.  I am informed that to date the fund has made total investments of £34 million in companies employing more than 4,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The venture capital initiative is a positive step in the right direction.  What is also required within <Col N="1708" /> the pensions sector is a more critical re-appraisal of current investment policies and a concerted effort over time to bring about a greater level of investment by the sector in the economy.  As a first step in this process, a study was carried out recently by consultants on the scope for increasing pension fund investment in the economy.  The study, which was jointly commissioned by the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the Irish Association of Investment Managers and the Minister for Finance, identifies a range of opportunities for achieving greater pension fund investment in various sectors of the economy, including the Irish equity market, the corporate bond market, infrastructural and other projects in the public sector, and commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The consultants' report is an important contribution to the advancement of practical measures to enhance pension fund investment in the State.  The report was published last year.</P>
    <P>There are no instant or quick-fix solutions to this problem.  Indeed, the openness of our economy and the increasing integration of international capital markets makes it inevitable that the pensions sector will continue to hold a significant portion of their funds in overseas assets.  Nevertheless, the Government considers that pension fund managers should endeavour to rebalance their portfolios over time in favour of Irish investment.  The Government for its part will facilitate this process by continuing to pursue sound economic policies and by providing a favourable environment for business activity which investors can feel confident about.  It will also continue to examine the viable options for increasing pension fund investment in the State by a variety of means.</P>

      <Quest>if he has considered the plight of old age pensioners in receipt of modest pensions from previous employment, some of whom also receive a contributory old age pension, who are obliged to pay tax and PRSI on their pension until death, having already made both these contributions all their working lives; whether it is fair and just for the State to continue to impose these two tax penalties on them; and if he will give a commitment to amend our taxation and PRSI legislation in order to exempt all our senior citizens in these financial circumstances.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle income from pensions is, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes.  Occupational and contributory pensions are not subject to PRSI contributions.  Occupational pensions are however liable for the health and employment <Col N="1709" /> and training levies, subject to the usual conditions.</P>
      <P>Pensioners are treated somewhat more favourably under the Irish income tax code than the generality of taxpayers.  The exemption limits for pensioners are significantly higher than those which apply generally.  These currently stand at £4,500 single &mdash; £9,000 married couple for those aged between 65 years and 74 years and £5,100 single &mdash; £10,200 married at 75 years and over as compared with £3,900 single &mdash; £7,800 married for other people.  Alternatively, if taxed under the normal system, a person aged 65 years and over receives a special age allowance of £200 single &mdash; £400 married couple in addition to the normal personal allowances.</P>
      <P>I would draw to the Deputy's attention that when personal allowances and exemption limits generally are increased, as in recent budgets, such increases apply to the elderly as well as to other taxpayers.  In the 1995 budget, in order to provide greater assistance to the elderly, the increase in the exemption limits, for those aged 65 years and over was double that made in the general exemption limits.  Consequently, arising from the last two budgets, the exemption limits for the elderly have increased by £400 in the case of single persons and £800 for a married couple. Personal allowances have been increased by £300 single and £600 married.  Furthermore, some pensioners have also benefited from the widening of the tax bands.</P>
      <P>Exempting all people aged 65 and over from tax would benefit primarily those with significant incomes.  Increasing the exemption limits, rather than the age allowance, has been considered the more appropriate method of giving extra assistance to the elderly through the tax system, as it focuses assistance towards those on lower incomes.  The position of the elderly will, of course, be carefully considered in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The Government considers the development and strengthening of the European Union's cohesion policies to be an integral part of the process of furthering European integration.  It also considers that enlargement must take place within the context of the deepening of European integration and the maintenance of the Union's key policies <Col N="1711" /> including economic and social cohesion which is firmly established in the Treaty on European Union.  The enlargement of the Union to include in particular the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which will bring many benefits in terms of both stability and economic opportunities, should not undermine the application of cohesion policies to existing member states.  The conclusions of the Essen European Council in December 1994 that &ldquo;the Union's capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration and respecting its internal cohesion and fundamental principles' is also an important consideration&rdquo; should continue to underpin all further discussion of enlargement.  In this context, the Government will seek to ensure that the EU budgetary resources are adequate for the needs of enlargement.  The Government will also aim to ensure that the costs of enlargement are borne in an equitable manner between the Union's developed and less-developed regions and in a manner which does not prejudice the operation of the Union's existing policies, including cohesion.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to predict what impact increased competition will have on the Exchequer. However, if it leads to a more cost efficient and better provision of service, it is to be welcomed. The new framework for private health insurance will require all insurers to compete on equal terms.</P>
      <P>As regards the taxation aspect, the opening up of the Irish health insurance market as required by EU law makes it necessary to ensure that a common tax regime applies to all providers of health insurance operating in the Irish market.  As Deputies will be aware, the promotion of private health care through health insurance has been facilitated by various tax reliefs, but principally by income tax relief for premiums paid in respect of VHI-type cover which is now available at the standard rate.  This relief, which currently costs the Exchequer about £48 million a year, is available to all authorised health insurers.  Certain changes in existing corporate tax and stamp duty provisions will be necessary and these are currently being examined with a view to including amendments, as appropriate, in next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The mid-term review of the Community Support Framework and its constituent operational programmes and the Community initiatives is currently under way.  It is intended that the review will be completed around the middle of next year.  Proposals for changes in the programmes will be considered in light of the reports of the external evaluators when these come to hand.  Responsibility for making changes in the operational programmes and the CSF will rest with the monitoring committees, subject to the agreement of the national authorities and the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputies in the first part of the question is set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PAYE allowance, currently £800, is <Col N="1714" /> available to ordinary employees.  It is not available to the self-employed &mdash; including farmers &mdash; proprietary directors, or the spouses of those two groups when employed in the business.  The 1994 Finance Act extended the PAYE allowance to children of the self-employed &mdash; including farmers &mdash; and of proprietary directors who are genuinely employed in their parent's business.</P>
    <P>If the PAYE allowance was to be extended to those groups at present not entitled to the allowance, it could not be confined only to those deemed to be the lower paid, but would have to be extended to all taxpayers within those groups. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer of extending the PAYE allowance to the self-employed and proprietary directors would be between £42 million and £65 million, depending on the likelihood of additional spouses assisting in the family business solely to avail of the PAYE allowance.</P>

    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>1. Taxable income as referred to by the Deputies is taken to mean gross income.</P>
    <P>2. Total deductions include income tax, employee PRSI, health contribution and employment and training levy where appropriate.  It is assumed that both taxpayers are single parents, with one child, and each receives the lone parent's tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>3. The PAYE taxpayer is assumed to be a full rate PRSI contributor.</P>
    <P>4. No account is taken of the social welfare lone parent's allowance.  This allowance is means-tested and the level of payment therefore depends on individual circumstances including, for example, child minding expenses.  It should be noted, however, that a self-employed single parent in receipt of this payment qualifies for the PAYE allowance.  Furthermore, recipients of this Social Welfare payment are exempted from the health contribution and the employment and training levy on all their income.</P>

The framework for this new management structure was set out in Delivering Better Government published in May this year.  This new structure will enhance the management, effectiveness and transparency of operations of Government Departments and offices.  It shall also clarify the responsibility and accountability of civil servants while preserving the discretion of Ministers in relation to their responsibilities to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Government approved heads of a Bill for drafting on a priorty basis.  It is intended to publish the Bill early in the new year.  The implications for the functioning of individual Departments of State, including the Department of Finance, will be set out at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent date for which comprehensive data are available is 1 October 1995.  The proportion of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, the only area of public service for which I have direct responsibility, on that date was 3 per cent.  A tabular statement listing by Department the percentage of staff with a disability employed on 1 October 1995, is available and will be published in the Official Report.  Figures are gathered annually in respect of 1 October each year.  Figures for 1 October 1996 are currently being gathered and will be forwarded directly to the Deputies as soon as they are available.</P>
      <P>Information regarding the grades in which people with disabilities are serving and regarding the nature of individual disabilities is not held centrally.  Even if it were, I would be reluctant to publish details by grade in view of the extreme sensitivity of the data, particularly as, in the case of grades with a small number of staff, the information could result in the personal identification of staff with a disability.</P>
      <P>Each Head of Department is fully aware of the Government policy on the employment of people with disabilities, which was reiterated in the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service, a copy of which is issued to all staff.  The code of practice, drawn up in 1993, calls on all Departments to continue to play their full part in employing people with disabilities.  In addition, since 1993, the Civil Service Commissioners have assigned a member of their staff as liaison officer for the recruitment of people with disabilities into the Civil Service, to liaise with candidates, Departments and relevant specialised organisations.</P>
      <P>The figure of 3 per cent relates to the Civil Service as a whole.  The aim of the Government was to reach a quota of 3 per cent overall in the Civil Service.  However, at present 17 of the 31 Departments and Offices have a proportion of 3 per cent or higher of disabled people on their staff and a further six Departments have a proportion of over 2 per cent.  The Department of Finance continually exhorts individual Departments to achieve a 3 per cent quota. Experience suggests that the approach of seeking a 3 per cent overall Civil Service quota is an effective measure.  However, if in the future it should emerge that this approach is no longer achieving the desired results, the Minister for Finance would consider seriously the possibility of individual quotas.</P>
      <P>While the matter is kept continuously under review, there are no plans at the moment to alter the manner in which the 3 per cent quota operates.  The priority at present is to ensure that the quota is maintained; and the working environment in the Civil Service is such that staff with disabilities can contribute to their full potential.</P>
      <P>The policy on the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is implemented by</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> (a) from time to time holding special competitions, or establishing sub-panels from general competitions, confined to people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability, (b) facilitating people with a disability when competing in open competitions not confined to people with a disability and (c) where possible, retaining staff who become disabled after their recruitment.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis for some time has been on the achievement of the target quota, it is also important to ensure equality of treatment between staff with and without disabilities once in employment.  With this in mind, the code of practice, drawn up in 1993, covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation and equipment and safety and evacuation procedures.  The code of practice was developed in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, the relevant voluntary bodies and in consultation with staff with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the increasing volumes of traffic in our cities and towns.  However, traffic management is not the direct responsibility of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> The number of new cars sold in the year up to the end of November was in the region of 114,000 of which approximately 18,000 were purchased under the terms of the £1,000 car scrappage scheme.  The overall increase in new car sales, particularly in 1996, has been influenced by current interest rates, the level of inflation, increasing income and, indeed, the competitive deals offered by finance companies.  I should point out that the scrappage scheme has not resulted in any net increase in overall car numbers since the new car that is purchased, under the terms of the scheme, only replaces a car ten years or older which has been scrapped.</P>
    <P>The Government recently announced the continuation of the scheme for one final year until 31 December 1997.  The scheme was continued because it helped to remove older more polluting and potentially more dangerous cars from our roads.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently announced the introduction of compulsory car testing from 1998 and the continuation of the car scrappage scheme will also dovetail with this change in the law.</P>
    <P>In relation to VAT, I must advise the Deputy, that under the EU Sixth VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, it is forbidden to introduce new zero rates.  However, car repair and maintenance services have the benefit of the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.  In additon, spare parts supplied in the course of a car repair and maintenance service are taxed at the reduced rate provided the cost of the goods, exclusive of tax, supplied in carrying out the work does not exceed two-thirds of the total charge, exclusive of VAT.</P>

      <P>The provisions of EU Directives 91/680/EEC and 92/12/EEC, agreed as part of the tax measures establishing the EU Single Market, authorise the continuation, until 30 June 1999, of duty free shopping facilities for intra-Community travellers.  This arrangement was agreed to allow the duty free operators time to diversify their activities.  The Commission recently confirmed their opposition to the retention of duty free shopping beyond 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>At the ECOFIN Council on 11 November 1996, I raised the issue but did not receive much support from my ministerial colleagues for a proposal to commission an independent study into the effect of the abolition of the duty free sales post 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to terminate duty free or tax free sales for travellers to non-EU destinations in 1999.  That portion of the duty free business will remain and for certain airports, particularly Shannon Airport, the non-EU traveller is a very important source of revenue. Other state airports also handle traffic to and from non-EU locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently supported initiatives aimed at promoting North-South economic co-operation and consolidating the peace process.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986 with the aim of promoting economic and social advance in Northern Ireland and the Border counties and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between all communities throughout Ireland.  The fund has received contributions from the European Union, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  The Fund has already provided a total of £300 million overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, established by the European Union in 1995, is aimed at Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It involves a total EU expenditure of <Col N="1720" /> approximately £240 million over three years.  At least 20 per cent of this funding will be available for the six Border counties (IR£48 million). Funding over a further two year period will be subject to a review of the situation by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Joint Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme, established under the Structural Funds, has approved EU funding for the Border counties for the six years 1994-99 of approximately IR£72 million.  The allocation to Northern Ireland was STG£53 million.  In addition to the EU funding, the Government is committed to the provision of matching funding. The total amount of public funding available, therefore, to the Border counties under this programme exceeds £100 million.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the EU Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99 includes a commitment to maximise the opportunity for beneficial co-operation with Northern Ireland. The scope for intensifying this co-operation will be addressed in the mid-term review of the CSF which is under way and which is due for completion in the first half of 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, the US Government has supported the peace process through measures to develop trade and investment between the United States and the region.  President Clinton held the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in May 1995.  The US Department of Commerce held a further economic conference in Pittsburgh in October.  Both conferences were successful in helping to encourage business partnerships between US and Irish companies.</P>
    <P>The range of activities I have outlined &mdash; most of which involve substantial EU funding &mdash; indicates that the Government has consistently supported initiatives aimed at actively promoting North-South economic co-operation, consolidating the peace process, and promoting economic regeneration of the Border counties.  I can assure the Deputy that these initiatives will be continued and be vigorously promoted by the Government to ensure that the maximum possible benefit is realised.</P>

I am happy to tell the Deputy that the European Parliament voted today to adopt the 1997 budget, including the provision of 100 million ECU for the peace programme.</P>

It is a matter for the board and management of the company to decide how much to spend on its marketing campaigns in the light of prevailing conditions in the market.  I trust the Deputy will understand that, in line with general commercial practice, it would not be appropriate to disclose the amounts spent on marketing.  I have no plans to impose a cap on the amount that may be spent on marketing along the lines referred to by the Deputy.

      <P>The Deputy appears to have a misconception of the rationale underlying the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  The primary focus of the programme is centred on activities which are intended to increase the social inclusion of marginalised groups and so promote reconciliation.  As has been pointed out repeatedly in this House in relation to similar questions in the past, the special task force set up by the Commission to consult local interests in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland reported back to the effect that the major emphasis should be on measures which supported social inclusion.  This necessarily involves actions dealing with the most marginalised groups.  This emphasis is not served particularly well by major flagship projects.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to learn that the Department of the Environment is investing a total of nearly £7 million under the programme in two projects involving significant upgrading of cross-Border infrastructural linkages which support the emphasis of the programme.  These projects involve restoration of the N3 links serving the Border crossing at Aghalane Bridge and the N16 route connecting Sligo to Enniskillen.  The Minister for Finance, in the Dáil on 5 November 1996, circulated details of project approvals made by the intermediary funding bodies charged with the implementation of various measures of the programme.  Should the Deputy wish to obtain further information in relation to any specific project he should take the matter up with the body concerned.</P>

      <P>Economic and monetary union &mdash; EMU &mdash; will feature prominently on the agenda at the forthcoming European Council.  The European Council will be asked to endorse the report from the Council of Finance Ministers &mdash; ECOFIN &mdash; which will outline the significant progress achieved during Ireland's Presidency of the EU on three major issues.  The first concerns the future monetary relationship between member states in economic and monetary union and member states outside it.  The second concerns ensuring budgetary discipline in economic and monetary union.  This follows from Articles 103 and 104c of the Maastricht Treaty and from proposals made last year by Germany for a stability pact.  The third <Col N="1724" /> area is the legal framework for the use of the euro.</P>
      <P>The European Council will be asked to endorse the ECOFIN report and the actions proposed in it for the next phase of the preparatory work for economic and monetary union.

The outcome of this procedure is already clear, because the European Council decided in Madrid and confirmed in Florence that the third stage of economic and monetary union will commence on 1 January 1999.  The heads of state or government of the member states will also be asked to extend the term of the current President of the European Monetary Institute and to appoint his successor.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently completing the present phase of its information technology plan which covers the period 1995-96.  The main objectives are to meet the exceptional needs imposed by our EU Presidency and to enable my Department to meet its future needs in this area. <Col N="1725" /> This has involved the upgrading of computer and communications systems at headquarters, including the passport offices in Dublin and Cork and our 50 Missions abroad.  It has also involved the installation of information technology-communications systems at Dublin Castle and other venues in connection with EU Presidency needs.  Information technology related training programmes have also been provided.  The cost in 1995 was £1,550,484 while the cost to 30 November 1996 &mdash; the latest date available &mdash; was £1,386,191.  Budgets for 1997 have not yet been finalised but it is anticipated that expenditure in 1997 on computer related activities will amount to £700,000 approximately.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of the case of Mr. Khadar Mubarak, who is in detention in Israel on suspicion of being a member of the Islamic militant movement Hamas and in possession of information which could assist in thwarting imminent terrorist attacks.  The Israeli Supreme Court has rejected Mr. Mubarak's petition to bar the general security service from using physical pressure during his interrogation.  I reiterate the Government's concern at recent decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court that secret service investigators can use physical pressure in the questioning of Palestinian detainees.  With regard to the action that Ireland &mdash; as Presidency of the European Union &mdash; has taken in regard to the treatment of detainees in Israel, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 53 from Deputy Byrne yesterday.  In the context of the European Union's Euromediterranean partnership agreement with Israel, the Government firmly expects that Israel will engage in discussions with the EU on human rights issues and in these contacts the Union will continue to underline to the Israeli Government the importance of the observance of human rights, both in Israel and in areas under Israeli occupation, and the importance of including concrete steps to improve the treatment of prisoners and detainees.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to value added tax.  The position is that many member states of the European Union, including Ireland, are concerned that they may lose significant amounts of VAT revenues in the telecommunications area. This arises primarily because recent technological developments have overtaken the existing EU VAT law in this area.  Calls originating in the EU can now be diverted to telecommunications networks in non-EU countries.  For VAT purposes, this has the effect of shifting the place of taxation from within the EU to outside.  EU consumers of telecommunications services who use this technology enjoy VAT-free supplies.</P>
      <P>In view of this, the European Commission intends to bring forward proposals to amend the sixth VAT Directive.  These proposals are likely to be discussed during 1997.  In the meantime, all member states have requested a derogation under Article 27 of the sixth VAT Directive to deal with this problem in the shortterm.  A draft Council decision which would give effect to these derogation requests is awaited from the Commission.  The solution being proposed would make these services taxable where they are received.  The business user of the services would then have to account for VAT on the cost of any calls made through a non-EU supplier.  In the case of businesses which have deductibility on inputs, the additional VAT will be recoverable. However, VAT exempt businesses such as banks and insurance companies cannot reclaim VAT charged to them and would have to pay the relevant additional tax.  I do not expect that such a solution would have an impact on the telephone bills of the ordinary customer.  Any proposals for changes in the VAT law in this area will be published in the Finance Bill next year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers were thoroughly investigated by an interdepartmental committee which I established last year.  This committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-á-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers. Consequently, the committee felt there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.</P>
      <P>However, the committee made other recommendations, most notably to exempt cross-Border workers from the health and employment and training levies.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I announced such an exemption in this year's budget and this was introduced in this year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>The committee also recommended that cross-Border workers should avail of the direct debit system as a means of paying their Irish tax liability and this now applies for the preliminary tax payment due on 1 November 1996 and on 1 November of subsequent years.  Full details of this system, including an explanatory leaflet, are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>A further recommendation of the committee was that there should be consultation between the Irish and UK tax authorities in order to clarify the scope of Article 18 of the Ireland-UK Double Taxation Agreement.  Negotiations have commenced and are still taking place on this issue.  It is hoped that they can be concluded shortly.  However, it is important to note that the 1976 Ireland-UK Double Taxation Agreement is a bilateral one and, as such, any changes to it must be agreed to by the UK Government.</P>

      <P>Proprietary directors, who are the self-employed in an incorporated form, do not receive the £800 PAYE allowance as they are not regarded from a taxation viewpoint as ordinary employees.

      <P>I have received a number of submissions regarding the VAT treatment of child minding services and income tax relief for parents in respect of the cost of child care.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of VAT, the position in this regard is governed by European VAT law, with which Irish VAT law complies fully.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, education is an exempt service for VAT purposes, but this exemption does not extend to child care services or nurseries.  Such facilities are liable for VAT when they are provided in the course or furtherance of business and if their annual turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed £20,000. However, non-profit making child minding services provided by public bodies or recognised charities are exempt from VAT.  In addition, creches and playschools which follow a clear educational programme may be exempt if they come within the terms of the exemption for children's education.  In the majority of cases, it is the experience of the Revenue Commissioners that child care services rather than education are provided by such crèches and playschools.  In such instances, VAT would be chargeable on the child care element.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether a particular facility is liable for VAT.</P>
      <P>As regards income tax, any proposal in this area will be considered in the context of the 1997 budget and the benefits of any such proposals will be considered in comparison to other possible tax changes.  The costs of child care tax reliefs are, however, substantial and, needless to say, there are other priority uses for such tax resources.</P>

      <P>The setting of a commercial mandate for commercial State bodies is achieved through the corporate planning process.  Corporate plans are drafted and adopted by the bodies concerned after consultation with the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance.  These plans are reviewed and updated by the companies on an annual basis.  Each body's corporate plan takes account of the particular issues and challenges it faces in its own sphere of activity.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prime objective of the concept of a third banking force was to generate greater competition within the retail banking market.  In this respect, much progress has been made over the past few years in opening up this market, reducing barriers and creating greater competition generally.  The strengthening of the Competition Authority in the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, and the creation of a director of competition enforcement were key developments in this regard.  Moreover, the removal of statutory restrictions on the services provided by building societies, which are now emerging as important players in all sectors of the banking market, has resulted in major advances in the availability of services and improved access to those services. The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, has improved the level of transparency in relation to fees and the cost of credit.  The recently published Central Bank Bill will bring the central clearing system, operated under the auspices of the Dublin Bankers Clearing Committee, under the supervision of the Central Bank and will confer powers on the bank in relation to the establishment, supervision, and operation of payments systems in the State.  Finally, a Credit Union Bill, which is currently being drafted, will broaden the range of services which credit unions can offer, thus contributing further to competition in the market.</P>
      <P>The State banking sector has also played a key role in the progress achieved to date.  ACC Bank now provides the full range of services expected of a high street retail bank to all its customers. ICC Bank, which provides corporate financing to small and medium-sized enterprises, has developed a range of new and innovative products which specifically address the needs of its particular customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> As a result of these developments, there have been major changes in the marketplace, and in particular in the customer focus of the retail banks, since the original policy initiative was announced.  Moreover, the situation in the retail banking sector is subject to continuing review to ensure that the provisions which have been put into place are having the desired effect.  These provisions will be modified as and when the need arises to ensure that the objective of a competitive and vibrant banking market, delivering cost-effective services to all our people, is fully realised.</P>
    <P>The dynamic and changing environment in the retail banking market has obviously had a major impact on our consideration of the future of the State banking sector.  There are a number of options available, each of which would have varying impacts on competition, employment and the delivery of cost-effective, customer-based services.  The question of protecting customers' interests and the interests of other stakeholders in State banks are key considerations.  Discussions have taken place with the management and staff interests of all the institutions involved, each of which has raised its particular and legitimate concerns regarding the manner in which the Government might proceed on this issue.</P>
    <P>When examining possible initiatives in relation to the State banks, the Government must take all these considerations into account, along with the unprecedented developments in technology and progress on economic and monetary union.  This is a complex and difficult issue and getting it right is vital.  While I do not have a specific timeframe in mind, I would hope soon to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the Government on it.</P>

The commission's report recommends the development of a wide range of economic and social services for people with disabilities, including health, personal support services and employment for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Government Departments, the social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations, including the health care and employment recommendations which are the responsibility of my Department.  This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department will be represented.  This task force is due to submit its detailed action plan by 30 June 1997.</P>

Further to a report on this matter which I received from Portiuncula Hospital I understand that the service to which the Deputy is referring is an outpatient clinic held in Athlone and staffed by a consultant paediatrician, based in Portiuncula Hospital.  This clinic is provided at the discretion of the hospital authorities in order to facilitate former inpatients from the hospital who live in Athlone.  This clinic is in addition to the paediatric outpatient service currently being provided there by the Midland Health Board.  I am assured that the issue of accommodation for this additional clinic, which is a matter for the agencies involved, is being pursued with the Midland Health Board by the authorities in Portiuncula Hospital.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.  Remedial teachers are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined following the collection and anaylsis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent <Col N="1740" /> to 87 per cent.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of schools in the Carlingford-Omeath area will receive every consideration.</P>

The establishment of the review team was a further strong indication of my commitment to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.

      <P>Commensurate with its responsibilities in this area, the City of Dublin Youth Service Board has submitted proposals for some restructuring of the Ballymun youth service which seek to refocus activities in order to enhance provision, particularly for those young people who are most severely disadvantaged.

      <P>The Department of Education established a schools psychological service in the autumn of 1965 when the late George Colley, was Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>A pilot project to develop a psychological service for primary schools in two designated areas commenced in September 1990 when Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Education. The designated areas were west Tallaght-Clondalkin and south Tipperary.  The project set out to gain experience of the development and provision of such a service prior to consideration of an extension to primary schools in other areas. The project completed its pilot phase in September 1993, and was put on a permanent basis by me in the two areas in early 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appointed a further ten psychologists in 1995 in order to allow for the expansion of the Department of Education's psychological service to primary schools.  These psychologists were assigned, as a matter of priority, to national <Col N="1748" /> schools serving disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  In addition, national schools in the original pilot project in west Tallaght-Condalkin and south Tipperary continue to have access to the psychological service.  In other areas, psychological intervention, if required, is a matter for the regional health boards or with voluntary bodies funded by these boards or by the Department of Health.  At present, the lead responsibility for psychological assessment services for children rests with the health authorities.</P>
    <P>There are currently 36 psychologists employed in my Department.  Of these, 20 are working mainly in second level schools, 13 are in primary schools, and there are three psychologists in a supervisory senior capacity.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education outlines a policy for the expansion of the schools psychological service at both levels.  It is envisaged that the provision and development of psychological services for schools will be a function of the education boards.  This development will take place on a phased basis. Any expansion will take place in the context of Government decisions on public sector numbers.</P>

      <P>No specific study has been carried out into the system of employers' PRSI contributions in labour intensive sectors of the economy. However, an interdepartmental working group reported in December 1993 on the impact of employers' PRSI on the low paid manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The group recommended that: (1) no measure should be introduced which involves different PRSI treatment depending on a general sector or labour intensity basis; (2) the cost of any concessions should be recovered through other changes in employers' PRSI rather than increased general taxation; (3) the then liability on employers of medical card holders to pay the levies in respect of employees who are medical card holders should be discontinued.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a tiered system of employers' PRSI was introduced with effect from 6 April 1994.  The rate of employers' PRSI was reduced from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent in respect of employees whose weekly income was less than £173.  This system was improved in 1995 and again in 1996 so that the low rate is now 8.5 per cent and it applies where incomes are up to £250 per week.</P>
      <P>Employers were relieved of liability for the levies in respect of employees who are medical card holders, with effect from 6 April 1994. These improvements were funded partly by a real increase in the earnings ceiling for employers' PRSI</P>
      <P>In recognition of the important role played by PRSI in Irish life, I have recently launched a discussion document, <i>Social Insurance in Ireland</i>, to stimulate a public debate on all issues relating to this topic.  I will be inviting submissions from the public in relation to all aspects of social insurance, including the question of the relationship between employers' PRSI and employment.</P>

      <P>The jobs initiative is a scheme operated by the Department of Enterprise and Employment which seeks to provide direct employment opportunities to those among the long-term unemployed for whom access to the labour market is currently extremely limited.  The scheme is confined to those on the live register aged 35 years or over who have been in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent's allowance for at least five years.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, participants can qualify for family income supplement in the same way as other workers and may retain entitlement to child dependant allowances for 13 weeks in accordance with the terms of the Social Welfare Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>While these arrangements are generally operating satisfactorily, I understand that some concerns have been expressed as regards the retention of child dependant allowances in cases where participants seek to move from community employment direct to the jobs initiative.  In such circumstances, the relevant legislative provisions require that, in order to qualify for the retention of child dependant allowances, applicants must be in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for not less than one year in the period immediately preceding the retention of the child dependant allowances.  I have asked my Department to give urgent consideration to the question of people moving from community employment to the jobs initiative also qualifying for the retention of child dependant allowances.</P>

    <P>FÁS works actively with the National Rehabilitation Board at local, regional and national level and it is FÁS policy to encourage and promote the integration of people with disabilities into training and employment, wherever practical, through its extensive range of labour market intervention measures. Unemployment eligibility criteria have been waived in a number of programmes for persons referred to FÁS by the NRB.  However, the needs of people with severe disabilities are so wide-ranging, and so clearly dependent on the medical and physical implications of their disabilities, that it appears there would be significant problems in separating their employment support from the <Col N="1753" /> wide range of supports which they require in other aspects of their lives.</P>

      <P>On 26 November 1996 I reported to Government in regard to my role in co-ordinating the work of the various Departments on the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.  The Government approved my intention to revert to it regarding legislation in relation to the recommendations within my own area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>These recommendations concern below-cost selling of newspapers, merger control, regulation of ownership and concentration of media ownership.  I am assessing proposals for legislation specific to newspapers in this regard at present.</P>
      <P>While there are very complex legal and economic issues involved in this work, I am taking appropriate advice.  This work is receiving high priority within my Department.  I expect to revert to Government in the matter as soon as possible with specific proposals for its consideration and decision.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that legislation in relation to mergers and competition by Government will not secure the competitive future of a vibrant indigenous newspaper industry.  Charting a thriving industry for the future is, of course, primarily in the hands of the industry itself.  It has the significant task of adapting newspapers to the change in requirements of the consumer, the needs of the modern marketplace for news and views, and also to the changing lifestyles and habits of our society.  The Commission on the Newspaper Industry identified the task of improving competitiveness as a key one to be addressed by the industry.</P>
      <P>The competitiveness agenda is not just confined to labour costs and numbers, important as these are, but must embrace issues such as work practices, printing, technology, distribution and training.  The Irish newspaper industry must be prepared to confront these problems and the agencies of the State are available to assist it in this as appropriate.</P>

      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage &mdash; 62 per cent &mdash; of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.</P>
      <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with many recommendations.  Following consultation with the farm bodies on the consultants' report, I have made a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years.  These would involve some limits on the overall level of payments, adjustments to a small number of grant rates and a better targeting of payments in order to meet the overall aim of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Discussions on these proposals with the Commission are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to forecast the implications of any elements of the proposals until discussions with the Commission are finalised.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to proposed natural heritage areas (NHAs) under the rural environment protection scheme.</P>
      <P>Considerable assistance has been provided by my Department in recent years for farmers to enable them to upgrade and improve their pollution control facilities.  Under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, a total of £100 million has been spent to date on grant aid for investment in pollution control facilities under the control of farm pollution scheme and the farm improvement programme.  Grant aid under these programmes was allocated to farmers in all areas of the country.  Additional allocations are being made to farmers under these schemes for completed works on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Under supplementary measure 1 of REPS, an additional annual payment of £12 per acre is made to farmers in proposed NHAs.  This is in addition to the basic annual payment of approximately £50 per acre, subject to a maximum of 100 acres.  The objective of these payments is to compensate farmers for changes in farming practices necessary in these areas to comply with the farming conditions agreed between my Department, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the farming organisations, Teagasc, the Agricultural Consultants' Association and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.</P>
      <P>In proposed NHAs it is not necessary to be in REPS to qualify for headage and premia payments.</P>

    <P>The bulk of the capital expenditure in 1995 was on the further enhancement of the local office computerisation programme which began in 1994. This was in line with my commitments under the farmers' charter to improving the delivery of services to the farming community.  This continued in 1996 with the beginning of the computerisation of the farm development service offices.  With the increase in the incidence of BSE new control measures were put in place in DVOs, factories, marts and export ports.  Extra computer facilities costing about £1 million have been put in place to support these measures.  In 1997 extra funding has been provided by the Government for the development of a computerised cattle tracing system and for impoved accounting and audit systems in line with the Department's obligations under EU accreditation.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question relates to the allowances payable to personnel serving in the Border area.  In addition to basic pay, all personnel posted to Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £49.57 per week in the case of officers and £44.47 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates. The allowance is paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.  In addition, a military service allowance is payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,070 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £39.68 per week, £2,070 per annum, with the exception of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.29 per week.  The allowance is paid irrespective of the actual hours worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A subsistence allowance is payable where personnel who are performing duties away from their stations are not provided with meals.  This <Col N="1760" /> does not arise frequently, however, as there is a comprehensive catering system in place in Border units to cope with feeding troops in the field.</P>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, RACO, and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The question of the payment of allowances to personnel involved with the recent BSE-related operations in Border areas is under active discussion with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>
