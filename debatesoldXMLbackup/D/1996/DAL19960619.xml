      <P>There are five questions to put to the House.  First, are the arrangements for Private Members' Business and the late sitting this evening satisfactory and agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal that No. 10 be decided without debate satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 4 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Lastly, is the proposal for dealing with No. 6 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 October, 1991, a report and guidelines for State bodies prepared by Séan Cromien for the then Government contained 23 recommendations summarised in Chapter III.  Chapter II covers remuneration of chief executives of semi-State companies. More important, that report stipulated that chairmen of semi-State companies should report to Ministers annually on any matters outside their remit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assist the Deputy in raising appropriate matters at this time but that to which he is now adverting seems not appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you allow me 30 seconds to make my point, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy can develop it into an appropriate matter, I shall be very pleased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this case will develop itself.  According to that report chairmen of semi-State companies have an obligation to report to relevant Ministers on any matters not within the guidelines laid down by Government.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to lay those reports in respect of Bord na Móna for the years 1992 to 1995, inclusive, in the Oireachtas Library in the course of the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would much prefer that this matter were adverted to in a more appropriate manner at a more appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If those reports were completed, we could very quickly resolve matters at present under dispute. If those reports are not ready, the chairman of the company concerned must answer to this House as to why they were not circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter can be dealt with in many other ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of enormous interest to many people and a major semi-State company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of February last the Taoiseach told the House that the Government hoped to conclude its deliberations on the issue of bail within six weeks.  I am blue in the face asking the Taoiseach about this <Col N="348" /> matter.  Will he say whether the Government has concluded its consideration of this issue and whether legislation will be introduced to provide for the holding of a referendum on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered questions on that matter in the past week when I indicated that the Government had not yet reached a conclusion on the matter. I understand Deputy Harney has a parliamentary question for answer today by the Minister for Justice.  I suggest that would be the most appropriate opportunity for her to pursue her concern in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is in charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is asked about this matter almost every week, but it is relevant to the Order of Business and it should not be left to be addressed until today's parliamentary questions.  Will legislation be introduced on this matter or has the Government decided to long-finger the issue, like the third banking force and several other matters on which the Government cannot reach a conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not decided to long-finger the issue. Conclusions have not been reached. There are finely balanced concerns about the appropriate level of civil liberties and the appropriate level of protection for victims of offences committed by people while on bail.  Those are important issues of civil and criminal law and are currently under intensive examination by the Government with a view to making appropriate decisions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the promised turf development Bill, will the Taoiseach accede to the request of the Leader of Fianna Fáil to place the documents concerning the remuneration of Board na Móna chief executives and other chief executives in the Library? Will he ask the Minister to bring the shameful spectacle in Bord na Móna, <Col N="349" /> which is damaging and humiliating individuals to an end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan is seeking to circumvent the ruling of the Chair by merely adverting to legislation and then raising a separate and distinct matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of that legislation, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to make a statement later today at the end of the company's board meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and lay out the facts in an effort to bring this shameful spectacle in that fine company to an end?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health set up a task force to examine the incidence of suicide in Ireland early this year which was to produce an interim report this summer.  Has the report been received by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question and the Deputy ought to proceed with it by tabling a parliamentary question on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what steps the Government intends to take to prevent the spread of the industrial action which will commence in Nenagh and Castledermot today, throughout the primary schools system? We have tried during Question Time to get specific answers from the Minister in regard to staffing schedule arrangements for the next academic year, but we have not got a response.  She has been very evasive in her replies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when the education Bill will be introduced?  It celebrates the concept of partnership, something that has been lacking for a long time and which we could do with now in the education world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation on bail, I put it to the Taoiseach that the reason the proposals are not before the House is because the Government parties are riven by dissent on this matter.  We have been waiting not six weeks but six months for a decision on this matter and a reasonable person could not draw any other conclusion on the matter other than the one I suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that many matters have been put on the long finger by the Government and it is anxious to ensure greater openness, transparency and accountability to enable members of the public to receive information from Government Departments, will the Taoiseach indicate when it is proposed to introduce the freedom of information Bill?</P>

      <P>If I am out of order on this question, a Cheann Comhairle, perhaps you could tell me how I may raise the issue.  Under section 226 of the guidelines for remuneration of public servants and executives it is stated that chairmen of all State bodies are required to implement Government policy in relation to the remuneration of chief executives, and the arrangements made cover total remuneration.  They are required to give an assurance that the guidelines have been met when they make the annual report as recommended in paragraph 235.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state if these reports were made with regard to Bord na Móna and if the chairman of the day made them?  If he is not prepared to put them in the Library will he at least advise if the Department of Finance found anything that was out of order in the examination of such reports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to move the motion asking the Dáil to note the Explosives (Land Mines) Order 1996. This order places Ireland in the forefront of countries which have translated <Col N="356" /> their position on land mines into domestic law.  Our leading role in advocating a total ban on anti-personnel land mines is already well established.  Ireland does not license the export of land mines. The new legal instrument copperfastens our national policy of not allowing the manufacture, sale, or importation of land mines.  It significantly enhances our international advocacy of a total ban on anti-personnel land mines.</P>
      <P>The manufacture, sale, etc., of land mines is now, because of this order, an offence subject to sanctions.  This criminality attaches not just to the manufacture, etc., of anti-personnel land mines but to all land mines.  This is of particular significance.</P>
      <P>Land mines have been described as multi functional devices filled with explosives with the intention of destroying vehicles and people.  The horrific effects of these devices and the devastating humanitarian consequences &mdash; especially of anti-personnel land mines &mdash; have been well documented. The Secretary General of the United Nations has expressed the view that the impact of these weapons is so appalling that a total ban on all anti-personnel land mines is the only solution.</P>
      <P>The clear, unequivocal and, indeed leading position which Ireland has taken on land mines is internationally well documented.  The Convention of the Prohibition or Restriction on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects was opened for signature on 10 April 1981.  With 33 other states, Ireland signed the convention, subject to ratification, on that date.  Ireland duly lodged its instrument of ratification of the convention on 13 March 1995 and participated as a full state party in the recent Review Conference of the Inhumane Weapons Convention, as it is commonly called.  The Tánaiste reported to the House on 8 May on the outcome of the review conference which adopted an Amended Protocol II on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> The aim of the Inhumane Weapons Convention and its annexed Protocols is to give effect to two basic principles. These are first, that certain conventional weapons should neither inflict excessive injury nor cause unnecessary suffering, and second, that they should be directed only at military forces and not used indiscriminately to harm the civilian population.</P>
    <P>The review conference process afforded Ireland ample opportunity to articulate clearly our stance on the use of land mines.  At the start of that process, as I advised the House previously, Ireland was one of only five countries which called for a total ban on anti-personnel land mines.  When I attended the conference representing this country I felt relatively isolated.  Although the outcome of the conference was disappointing, because of our call for a total ban, the process itself undoubtedly gave a strong impetus to the international campaign to ban land mines, 40 countries are now identified as supporting a total ban and, in many cases, as having taken steps at national level to advance a global ban.</P>
    <P>Significantly, President Clinton has announced that the US will seek a global ban on all land mines by 2001.  I am sorry that the impetus for the US review, especially the strong comments made by the powerful Joint Chiefs of Staff, was the death of three UK soldiers in a horrifying land mine explosion in Bosnia where there are more than one million mines.</P>
    <P>Last week a significant event for humankind occurred when Pol Pot was reported to have died.  Pol Pot died, but his killing fields in Cambodia live on as a memorial and a continuing form of warfare on the innocent civilian population of that country.</P>

      <P>The issue of land mines is serious, and not a matter for joking as the Deputies appear to believe.  The initiative which Canada has taken to convene a meeting of supporters of a total ban in Ottawa in September and October will provide a welcome new focus for action to develop further the international support without which a comprehensive, global prohibition on anti-personnel land mines will not come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of consistency with the strong international stance taken by Ireland on this issue, the Department of Foreign Affairs, in consultation with other Departments, examined the legislative position in Ireland with respect to land mines.  It was established that under the Explosives Act, 1875, the Minister for Justice regulates activities relating to civilian explosives; that, under the Explosives Act, the production, stockpiling and importation of land mines were already subject to licence; that there was no current licence to manufacture land mines; that no such licence had ever been sought; <Col N="359" /> and, indeed, that if any such application were received, the Minister for Justice would refuse it.  Significantly, it was noted that the Minister for Justice also had power under section 43 of the Act to make regulations prohibiting the manufacture, keeping, importation, conveyance and sale of substances which are particularly dangerous.  I should point out at this stage that the Defence Forces are exempt from the provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875.  I will return later to the issue of Ireland's defence policy in practice, especially with regard to anti-personnel land mines.</P>
    <P>Under the Control of Exports Act, 1983, the Minister for Tourism and Trade has made the export of land mines subject to licence.  The Department of Tourism and Trade, as the export licensing authority, upon advice, adheres to a policy of refusing any licence to export land mines.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the comprehensive legislative framework that is already in place and the fact that, in effect, neither the Minister for Justice nor the Minister for Trade and Tourism will issue licences for the import or export of land mines, the Government decided on 8 May 1996 that an order should be made by the Minister for Justice under section 43 of the Explosives Act, 1875, banning the manufacture, keeping, importation and sale of land mines.  The order was signed by the Taoiseach on 12 June 1996 and was operative with effect from 13 June 1996.  The fact that the order was enacted within weeks of the Government decision in the matter highlights the Government's concern on the issue.</P>
    <P>The order provides that no person shall manufacture, keep, import into the State, convey or sell any land mines.  It defines a land mine as any munitions designed to be placed under or near the ground or other surface area and designed to be detonated or exploded by the presence or proximity of, or contact with, a person or vehicle.  The implementation of this order means that it is now an offence to manufacture or <Col N="360" /> in any way deal with land mines in the State.</P>
    <P>While the focus of the international debate has centred on the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel land mines, the Government decided that the order should extend to all mines.  I should like to explain why.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, in international fora, Ireland follows a policy of seeking to promote acceptance of the vital importance of exercising responsibility and restraint in the matter of arms transfers, both exports and imports.  This is a long-term endeavour. As Minister with responsibility for development co-operation, I am acutely aware of the economic and social cost, as well as the destabilising effects, of the excessive accumulation of arms in developing countries.  This applies in particular to small arms and, most devastatingly of all to land mines.  The use of anti-vehicle and anti-tank mines has a price in humanitarian terms too, admittedly a less horrendous one than that which too often attaches to the use of anti-personnel land mines.  Until they are cleared, anti-tank mines impede the delivery of badly needed aid for reconstruction in post-conflict situations.  That fact alone can delay the return of cultivation of agricultural land and hinder the resettlement of refugees.</P>
    <P>Anti-tank and anti-vehicle mines do perhaps serve legitimate military purposes but I am sure the House will agree it does not follow that the commercialisation of these items, their production, import and sale should be permitted in Ireland.  The White Paper on Foreign Policy stated that Ireland is not a producer of armaments and will not become one.  In considering this specific order, therefore, the Government took into account both its wider policy on armaments and the humanitarian considerations which relate also to anti-tank mines.  It concluded that commercialisation of land mines of any kind should not be permitted in Ireland.  This order reflects that position.  Regrettably, the recent Review Conference agreed only minimal new restrictions on the use <Col N="361" /> of anti-tank mines.  There was no agreement even that these munitions would have to be detectable.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated earlier, the leading position which Ireland has taken on land mines in international fora is well established.  Despite this, the question was being posed with increasing insistence as to why our ban position was not reflected in law in light of other countries advocating a total ban.  I want to thank Fianna Fáil who earlier raised the matter in a specific Bill.  The making of this order allows the ban to be extended to all mines, including the anti-tank mine, whereas the Fianna Fáil Bill was more limited in its effect and did not introduce the question of penalities.  It was an advocacy Bill rather a Bill for implementation.</P>
    <P>The making of the Explosives (Land Mines) Order, 1996 is the answer to this challenge.  It will, in addition, strengthen the momentum of the international campaign against anti-personnel land mines and heighten Ireland's profile in the area.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are excluded from the provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875.  Therefore, the terms of this order do not apply to them.  The review of the use of anti-personnel land mines by the Defence Forces which was announced by the Tánaiste is almost complete.  This is with a view to renouncing the operational use of anti-personnel land mines by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to bring this motion before the House in order to put into a legislative structure our very strong and leading position on land mines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the Minister's speech that she has much to say on this subject and has a huge commitment to it.  I appreciate her allowing me to share her time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this order.  It is something that has been raised continually not just by Government parties but also by the Opposition in the recent past and for very good reason.  The horror of land <Col N="362" /> mines can leave nobody unaffected. This order gives domestic effect to our international opposition to the lethal trade in land mines.  Land mines are the perfect killers, indiscriminate and effective weapons which cost a few pence to manufacture, less than £1 to plant and several hundred pounds to deactivate and remove.</P>
    <P>The random planting of land mines in the late 20th century is the equivalent of the scorched earth policy used in the last century.  For years after conflict has ended, agricultural workers and their families must play Russian roulette every time they attempt to sow or harvest a crop.  In many areas of the world they do not have a choice; if they want to feed their families they must farm these minefields.  An adult who steps on a land mine is likely to lose one or both legs.  A child, who is obviously closer to the explosion, may either be killed outright or suffer horrendous internal injuries which will eventually kill him or her.</P>
    <P>There are currently around 100 million land mines scattered in over 60 conflict zones and former conflict zones throughout the world, ranging from Cambodia, to Angola and Mozambique and now Bosnia, and every conflict leaves a new legacy of mines.  Each week more than 500 people are killed or maimed by land mines.  That is a reality we cannot afford to ignore.  Demining is a painfully slow and extremely dangerous task.  The United Nations has estimated that it would take 1,300 years to clear just one fifth of the estimated 10 million land mines planted in Afghanistan.  I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding work done by the UK-based Mines Advisory Group whose volunteers help clear land mines at great risk to themselves.</P>
    <P>Despite the horror of land mines the international community has been remarkably slow to ban this trade &mdash; for economic reasons more than anything else.  The UN agreement reached in April in Geneva is a masterpiece of diplomatic fudging.  A comprehensive and immediate global ban on the production, trade, supply and use of land <Col N="363" /> mines or their component parts seems to be as far away as ever.  In the absence of a world ban it is up to the 40 countries who have so far called for such a ban, including Ireland, to follow up their obvious commitment with effective legal sanctions.  The Minister pointed out that at the outset of this campaign there were only five such countries and Ireland can justifiably be proud that it was one of the five.  However glorious the task of war, no country can justify leaving a legacy of resolved or unresolved conflict which ensures that the rural areas of a country cannot function either economically or socially because of land mines.</P>
    <P>A comment on armaments in general I once heard is that a bomb does not need to explode to inflict economic or social damage on a country, it just needs to be produced because the production of armaments takes from the economic viability of a country.  That is true, especially in the case of land mines which are indiscriminate and are perfect killers.  Documentaries on war torn countries show queues of multilated children seeking treatment at clinics but there is not help for them.  Ireland is one of the few countries that is committed to aiding amputees as part of its foreign aid policy, yet it is not enough.  Vast amounts of money are invested in the development of land mines and armaments. It is beyond comprehension how we can be so cruel and so inhumane to one another.  War is an industry that makes or breaks people and on the whole people usually made fortunes rather than lost them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Order which will send a clear signal to the international community that Ireland is not prepared to tolerate this scourage either internationally or domestically.  I understand from the Minister's replies in the past year or two that Ireland uses land mines only for training purposes.  I understand that one needs to protect the armed forces especially when they are involved in peacekeeping duties.  The Government has taken an extremely strong stand <Col N="364" /> internationally on this issue which reflects the concern of the Irish people. The international stand is now reflected in our domestic regulations.  I hope that by continuously making the argument against land mines &mdash; we have gone from being one of five to one of 40 &mdash; we will win the battle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Just over one month ago I introduced a Fianna Fáil Bill seeking to prohibit the use of anti-personnel land mines in Ireland.  Five weeks ago I stated that 110 million landmines contaminate some 70 countries today, that this weapon of mass destruction kills and maims 500 people every week, 26,000 per year.  The killing and maiming still continues.  One hundred and ten million land mines still contaminate 70 countries.  The killing does not stop, it goes on and on.</P>
      <P>In countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia, men, women and children continue to be blown up while fetching water or tending cattle.  One harsh fact still continues to haunt us, if there was not another mine manufactured or planted, children not yet born would still be killed for years to come by mines already in the ground.  The harsh statistic is that one mine exists for every 50 people on this earth or one for every 20 children and in some countries there is more than one land mine for every citizen. Cambodia has suffered more than most countries from the barbarous nature of this indiscriminate killing weapon. In that country with the population of 9.3 million, it is estimated &mdash; and it is probably an underestimate &mdash; that 10 million or more land mines are hidden in the ground.  One person out of every 236 persons has at least one limb amputated. The country is home to between 35,000-40,000 mine victims and in excess of 300 mines accidents occur every month.  In addition there are 20,000 internationally displaced people in Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a distressing debate on the Fianna Fáil Prohibition of Anti-personnel Landmines Bill, 1996, the <Col N="365" /> Government committed itself to bringing forward an order under which the manufacture of land mines would become a criminal offence.  I welcome the Explosive (Land Mines) Order, 1996 which we are discussing.  We have taken a step forward on the land mines issues, and I give the Government credit for that and we are beginning to demonstrate to the world that Ireland is very serious about this critical issue. However, the way forward is through primary legislation and this order is totally defective as has been highlighted by the amendment tabled by the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, who deplores the ineffectiveness of the order made under section 43 of the Explosive Act, 1875, where in the penalty specified for contravention of such an order is ten shillings or 50p for each pound of explosives. I will be supporting Deputy O'Malley and the Fianna Fáil Party will be supporting his amendment.</P>
    <P>The best way forward on this issue would have been &mdash; I argued this a month ago &mdash; the primary legislation route.  On a major issue such as this it is not right to suggest, as the Government did at the time, that the route of primary legislation would have unduly cluttered the Government's legislative programme, as some Deputies remarked during the debate.  This so-called cluttering of a Government scheduling is a very small price to pay for a sound, concretely constructive measure to counteract the menace of mines.  Land mines savagely ensure that the massacre of the innocent continues decades after peace agreements have been signed.  They have been rightly described as buried terror.</P>
    <P>One example alone can graphically portray the terror of mines buried beneath the ground.  Peter Jesoimir, a soldier served on Bosnia's frontlines of war for more than three years.  He survived the killing, the destruction and the devastation wrought during the conflict. After three years of fighting he was demobilised.  In recent months he was working as part of a road crew on the <Col N="366" /> outskirts of Sarajevo when an anti-personnel mine buried at the roadside blew up under his left foot, as he stumbled another mine shattered his right leg. Having survived tortuous years of conflict what does life hold for this former soldier? Today he lies in a Sarajevo orthopaedic clinic.  He knows that from today until the day he dies he will be a drain on the nation he fought to preserve. Holding the stump of a leg he said, I know I have to live with this now, now I understand war.  Apart from mines that have been planted in recent years, mines that planted during the Second World War are still killing people today and as technology becomes more and more sophisicated, the mines of today can detect body heat, footstep patterns and other signals which can cause them to explode.</P>
    <P>In countless countries landmines have become one of the biggest obstacles to development.</P>
    <P>Mines destroy the fabric and infrastructure of a society.  Economic reconstruction, the return and rehabilitation of refugees, resettlement of internally displaced people and post conflict redevelopment of a society all become an impossible task.  Denying access to land severely affects food production, which causes malnutrition or starvation. Mines maim or kill the workforces upon which rural economies depend to sustain themselves.</P>
    <P>The impact on any of the countries blighted by mines is the same, whether there are 100 mines in a field or more than 1,000.  Once there is a mine accident, the land becomes an object of terror for those who are so dependent on it.  Cambodia, for example, has to import in excess of 200,000 tons of rice because it cannot farm land due to the presence of mines.</P>
    <P>Are many mines still being laid? Figures for 1993 suggest that approximately 10,000 mines were removed at a cost of £70 million.  However, during the same period between two million and five million mines were laid.  Mines laid far exceed those removed.  It appears to be a no gain, no win situation.  To remove <Col N="367" /> the mines already in the ground would cost approximately £33 billion and would take hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>Mines were originally designed with the purposes of killing and maiming ablebodied soldiers.  In reality the main victims are civilians &mdash; totally innocent people.  Peter, the soldier whose case I described earlier, was a civilian when he bore the treacherous brunt of a mine's ferocity.  Land mines are indiscriminate killers which kill not only during conflict but decades after the last shot has been fired.  Technology has improved over the decades and some mines self-detonate after a period.  However, mines which were laid years ago are not smart. They cannot distinguish a soldier's step from that of a civilian, or an adult from a child.  These indiscriminate killers do not discriminate in favour of a particular victim.  All ages, backgrounds and nationalities are vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Until recent years land mines were considered an indispenable weapon for the military.  However, opinions are changing in military circles.  There is a growing understanding and opinion among military personnel that land mines should be banned.  I previously spoke about the actions of General John Shalikashvili, the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who in March of this year ordered a review of the US military's policy with regard to the use of land mines.  The man who led the Americans in the Gulf War, General Norman Schwarzkopf, has solidly expressed a wish to see land mines eliminated from warfare forever.  This desire is based on his personal experience &ldquo;having seen hundreds of my troops killed or maimed by them, as well as being keenly aware of the devastating effects of land mines on civilians&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Opinions with regard to the military use and effectiveness of land mines are certainly falling hard on the side of stating that they carry no usefulness.  The International Committee of the Red Cross launched a paper a few years ago on mines entitled &ldquo;Anti-Personnel Land <Col N="368" /> Mines &mdash; Friend or Foe&rdquo; which examined this issue.  The Red Cross study revealed that out of the 26 conflicts it considered:</P>
    <P>No case was found in which the use of anti-personnel mines played a major role in determining the outcome of the conflict.  At best, these weapons had a marginal tactical value under certain specific but demanding conditions.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society, Miss Una McGurk, has clearly stated:</P>
    <P>Anti-personnel land mines are serial killers, and governments which support mine manufacture in their countries are exporting death. Governments who profit through taxes from this business are handling blood money.</P>
    <P>There was some expectation at the UN review conference in Geneva a few months ago that progress would be made on the mines issue.  However, progress was, as the Red Cross described it, wholly inadequate.  The UN Secretary General, Dr. Boutrous-Ghali, voiced his disapproval after delegates from 55 countries, including Ireland, adopted new rules on the use of land mines but crucially ignored demands for an outright ban.  The total ban sought by 30 governments, together with the UN and various NGOs, will be at least another five years away.  A golden opportunity was missed in Geneva by the delegates, including Ireland, despite the Minister of State's protestations.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there has been a rapid, worldwide development of opinion in favour of an international ban on land mines.  The number of countries calling for a total ban has increased from four in 1994 to approximately 40 countries at present.  Belgium, a former land mine producing country, introduced a unilateral ban on land mines in 1995.</P>
    <P>Non-governmental organisations in Ireland have vigorously promoted a unilateral ban on anti-personnel land mines and have urged the Irish Government to <Col N="369" /> consider this seriously.  The international campaign to ban land mines, representing over 50 organisations in 30 countries, has tirelessly promoted a unilateral ban.  The European Parliment has called upon all members of the European Union to adopt national bans on anti-personnel mines and the Red Cross has urged all national Red Cross societies to work for national bans in their respective countries.  A unilateral ban by Ireland would have a significant impact internationally in achieving the United Nations' stated objective of total elimination of this category of weapons, an objective which mirrors our position precisely.  A ban will make permanent Ireland's refusal to be associated with this abhorrent weapon.</P>
    <P>Internationally, a comprehensive ban can only be achieved if individual countries take courageous steps unilaterally. Ireland, through this order, inadequate as it is, will be a State where no person can manufacture, keep, import into the State, convey or sell any land mine. Being a non mine producing country with a unilateral ban would strengthen our ability to influence the world towards a total ban.  It is not an empty gesture.  Only last week in the Dáil we debated the UN chemical weapons convention. We agreed that Ireland should become a ratifing state of this UN convention. In the same way that nations can prohibit chemical weapons, I believe it is the bounden duty of Ireland to declare land mines illegal.</P>
    <P>While this land mines order is before the House today, we still await a report of the comprehensive policy review by the Department of Defence.  We believe the Army has presented its views to the Department of Defence, but policy proposals have yet to be presented to the Government.  We eagerly await the publication of the policy review without delay.  We already note with interest that the Army has in its submission to the Department of Defence sought an exemption from the order to allow the Army to import land mines for training purposes.  As outlined in the recent Fianna Fáil Bill, we agree the Army <Col N="370" /> should be in a position to use mines in its training exercises, as Irish soldiers will, on occasion, need the relevant expertise to deal effectively and efficiently with land mines when engaged in peacekeeping exercises overseas.  Can the Minister of State inform us at which stage the comprehensive policy review is?</P>
    <P>We have to take a moral stand and we must support the victims of land mines.  We can use our respected world position and utilise our Presidency of the EU to do so.  We in Fianna Fáil believe we must utilise this respected position to demonstrate the path which should be followed by world governments. Ireland must not let the opportunity afforded to us over the next six months to deal effectively with the land mines issues fall from our grasp.</P>
    <P>This order is one step.  It is totally inadequate for the reason listed in the amendment, which is that the penalty is ten shillings or 50 new pence for each pound of explosives.  Further critical steps need to be taken.  I believe the correct way forward is the introduction of primary legislation rather than reverting to an inadequate measure dating from 1875.  However, I acknowledge and welcome the Bill as a step forward, although it is inadquate. Fianna Fáil will be supporting the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dail Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;deplores the ineffectiveness of an Order made under section 43 of the Explosives Act, 1875, wherein the penalty specified for contravention of such an Order is 10 shillings or 50 new pence for each pound of explosives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge the Minister of state when she spoke on the motion made no reference to this <Col N="371" /> amendment, she totally ignored it.  That in itself is some form of commentary.</P>
    <P>The first thing that should be said about the motion is that it is entirely unnecessary.  The House does not have to approve the order which will be valid without its approval.  The House does not have to debate it.  Presumably the motion has been brought forward only for publicity purposes or for the purpose of milking whatever can be milked from it by the Government.  If Dáil Éireann chooses not to take note of the Explosives (Land Mines) Order, 1996, it will still stand.  It is made by the successors to Her Majesty in Council which are defined in a long series of adaptations. She can operate independent of Parliament.</P>
    <P>It seems curious that the motion has been brought forward today even though it is necessary.  On the Order of Business it was decided that the debate on three items of business that are necessary should be guillotined.  Presumably the motion has been brought forward for publicity reasons.  One of the excuses given in the debate on 8 May for not bringing forward primary legislation to deal with the problem of land mines was, as Deputy Burke said, that it would clutter up the Government's legislative programme, but what is this motion doing? This fascinates me and is an indication that the optics are sometimes more important in this game than the realities.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of the order is to prohibit the manufacture, keeping, importation, conveyance or sale of land mines.  It does not, however, prohibit their exportation which is probably our biggest concern.  This can be done under the Control of Exports Act, 1983, but it has not been clear whether an order has been made under that Act, although it was suggested in the debate on 8 May that such an order would be made.  The Minister of State glossed over this point without being specific.  It appears that while it will be illegal to import land mines it is not illegal to export them. That is a joke.</P>

      <P>There are many explosives here and a great many of them were not manufactured in Ireland. By all accounts many of these explosives are exported to Northern Ireland and Britain.  That is regrettable.</P>
      <P>The Explosives Act, 1875, has a curious history.  It is entirely inappropriate to the question of land mines at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.  It was passed in the British Parliament for the control and regulation of industrial explosives in mines and factories in Britain.  It had nothing to do with military type explosives and is a far cry from the use to which it is now being put.</P>
      <P>This House thought that Act inappropriate and unnecessary and repealed it in its entirety in the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  For some curious reason the then and succeeding Ministers for Labour did not make an order bringing the Dangerous Substances Act into effect.  The result is that by a fortuitous mischance the 1875 Act survives on the Statute Book, although it was the considered view of this House that it should be repealed.</P>
      <P>This is described as the &ldquo;perfect answer&rdquo; to our problems in the Minister of State's script, but in delivering it she dropped the word &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.  I do not think it is the answer.  Having looked at the 1875 Act I have to conclude that undoubtedly primary legislation is required in this instance and that this order is of little value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 43 of the 1875 Act the making of explosives entails a penalty of ten shillings for every pound in weight of explosive material.  I do not know a great deal about the technicalities of land mines but I understand they are <Col N="373" /> mainly plastic, have a detonator and fuse and a small quantity of explosive material of great power which causes much damage.</P>
    <P>How is the provision supposed to be enforced so far as land mines are concerned? Somebody will have to scrape out of each land mine the explosive material and weigh it and for each pound there will be a penalty of ten shillings. That is making a joke out of the law, is totally ineffective and rather silly. I cannot see the point in this. It is not a question of weighing land mines because 90 per cent or more of their weight is not accounted for by explosive substances but by other material.  This does not seem to be the appropriate way of going about it. The penalties are derisive.</P>
    <P>There is only one group of people on this island that I can think of which might use land mines, the people who would spring to all our minds, but I do not think they will be deterred, no more than any one abroad, by the penalties specified in the order.  This matter should be thought about again and dealt with in the right way rather than under an Act which this House thought should be repealed and probably believed had been repealed.  It is only by a fortuitous circumstance it is not and that we find ourselves in this curious situation.  I notice that the Minister's script states: &ldquo;The implementation of this order means that it is now a criminal offence to manufacture, sell, etc. landmines&rdquo; but when delivering her speech she left out the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; and I can see why. The question arises as to whether it is actually a criminal offence under section 43 or a customs offence and perhaps that is the reason she left it out.  In any event it is inappropriate to use that section which can be used if an explosive is of so dangerous a character that in the judgment of Her Majesty it is expedient for the public safety to make such order.  If Her Majesty has come to that conclusion and makes an order in council that it is expedient for the public safety, she can only do that if it is for the public safety of the United <Col N="374" /> Kingdom.  That was subsequently adapted to Saorstát Éireann &mdash; now Ireland or the Republic of Ireland.  It had no extra territorial effect.</P>

      <P>I would love to.  It just happens that, unfortunately, the Minister of State is relying very heavily on the judgment of Her Majesty as to what is particularly unsafe.  It is a great pity we have to debate the matter such as this in this context.  I did not bring forward the motion.  The order was made under this antique legislation which this House thought it had repealed in 1972 and now finds apparently it did not.  I did not choose the section or the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land mines, as I and several others pointed out at length on the Private Members' Bill on 8 May, is a matter of enormous concern which should be dealt with by this country in a realistic fashion and not in this optical illusion fashion before us which is of so little value.  Given that the penalties, the offence and so on have been shown to be ludicrous the problem should be dealt with in a real and serious fashion by primary legislation.  On 8 May I was prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the Government in respect of that because I did not have an opportunity to look at the 1875 Act at that time.  I have since had an opportunity to look at it and clearly it is inappropriate as it deals with the question of the regulation of explosives in mines and factories in 19th century Britian.  It does not seem to be appropriate to this, primary legislation is appropriate and it should be brought forward.  Deputy Burke's Bill which was debated here on 8 May certainly had some defects, as I said at the time, particularly that it did not create an offence.  These matters could <Col N="375" /> have been rectified on Committee Stage if it had been accepted but it was voted down by the Government.  That was a pity and this motion has been introduced instead.  The Dáil does not have to pass this order which became operative with effect from 13 June 1996 but introduced unnecessarily.  It is good to have the opportunity to debate it but it is a pity that an order of this nature, under this Act that is so clearly ineffective, was brought forward.  It should be repealed now.  It does not have to be repealed by this House, it can be repealed by the Government and primary legislation should be introduced. It will not clutter up things.  Primary legislation would receive a welcome from all sides, it would pass through the House in perhaps a matter of hours and would not cause any great delay.  That is what should now be done, otherwise Ireland's response to this matter may well be portrayed as a joke when it should not, because the overwhelming majority of the Irish people would like this problem to be dealt with effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper that this motion should be bought before the House because it is an issue of major international concern in which this country is taking a lead.  To say there is something facetious about this debate is nonsense.  I welcome this motion and I am not making a party political point.  The motion is comprehensive and it not only bans all anti-personnel landmines, their manufacture, export and so on from this country it also deals with anti-tank mines which, <i>de facto</i>, are anti-personnel mines because they all have anti-handling devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this motion the Minister was wise to ensure the inclusion of all these devices, which often are not covered by the anti-inhumane weapons conventions, because the manufacturers of these weapons want to exclude certain types of weapons, i.e. anti-tank mines which are laid in a similiar manner to anti-personnel landmines.  The excuse is <Col N="376" /> that because they are anti-tank mines the major pressure of a tank is required to active them and thus cause the explosion.  All these devices have anti-handling devices which make them <i>de facto</i> anti-personnel land mines.  Tens of thousands of those mines are being manufactured, exported and disseminated throughout the world, as stated in our motion.  Nobody on the Opposition benches has made that point or, alternatively, it appears they do not understand it.  I join the condemnation of the manufacture of land mines and compliment the lead taken by the Government. There is another area in which we need the vigliant.  We do not manufacture mines or explosives here but throughout the electronic industry there are many components, not intended for this horrible trade, that can be used in the manufacture of land mines and anti-tank mines.  We need to be vigilant because the export of these sophisticated components can lead to that end. We are safe in relation to the explosives sides and the manufacture of any of these devices but items manufactured here could find their way into the makeup of these mines.</P>
    <P>I did not get an opportunity to speak on the Private Members' Bill on 8 May as I was out of the country and I may be repeating some of what was said then.</P>
    <P>About 110 million land mines have been laid throughout the world and scattered across 69 countries, usually in some of the poorest.</P>
    <P>When I was an election observer in Angola and Mozambique we travelled across Mozambique in jeeps from one polling booth to another.  We were explicitly told to stick to specific routes and that we should not step off the road in certain places because they were so unsafe.  I am a country man and I noticed that thousands of acres of land had huge potential for use for food production. However, the land was abandoned and people were not allowed enter it because it was littered with land mines.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of hectares of land throughout the developing world <Col N="377" /> have been effectively taken out of production by the sowing of land mines. This limits the capacity of the countries to meet their greatest need, to produce food for their people.  This side effect of laying land mines is not often mentioned. Everybody refers to their terrible effects in terms of killing approximately 500 people a week or 26,000 people a year in countries blighted by them, but thousands also starve as an indirect result of them.  It is a pity this issue has not been addressed because it is appalling.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the civil war in Angola has ostensibly stopped, but the laying of land mines continues in certain areas.  No country has suffered more casualties per head of population than Angola during 27 years of an appalling civil war; there was no ceasefire during 17 of those years.  A major weapon in that war and in the conflict in Mozambique &mdash; its sister country in that it is also a former Portuguese colony &mdash; was land mines.  The sad point is that land mines kill relatively few soldiers. The vast majority of people killed are civilians, and the majority of those are children.  Hundreds of thousands of children in African countries are either killed or maimed by land mines.  Many have lost a limb or an eye.  It is a pathetic sight.</P>
    <P>Manufacturers of land mines in the developed world, and particularly EU member states such as Italy, have much for which they must account.  Conventions on inhumane weapons face the major problem of bringing into line countries which admit they have difficulties controlling the manufacture and export of land mines.  However, that is not a good excuse.  Last week there was some sympathy for the Russian Federation because it had real difficulties implementing the chemical weapons convention.  Somehow it could not control the manufacture of chemical weapons or it did not know exactly how many chemical weapons were stockpiled. The same point is made about the Peoples' Republic of China, another <Col N="378" /> major offender in this area.  A sympathetic argument put forward on its behalf is that it too has difficulties knowing how many weapons are stockpiled and in terms of their dissemination and export.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small country and its voice is small in these matters. However, it has taken a moral and practical stance by banning the manufacture of these weapons within its shores.  At international level Ireland has supported a total ban on them.  Only 39 countries &mdash; an increase from 23 last year &mdash; support a comprehensive and total ban on the manufacture, dissemination and export of land mines; Ireland is one of them.  Unfortunately, however, the major exporters have not signed the convention.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to support the order.  I heard nonsense from the other side earlier. The Fianna Fáil Bill was meaningless because it did not mention penalties. Deputy Burke criticised the Government, but the Bill he put forward in the House last May was merely an exhortation.  It was flawed and often nonsensical and his points do not stand up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments.  The White Paper briefly referred to land mines and I wondered if the Government had considered whether legislation was necesary or if an order would suffice. Members are clear in their views about land mines, but Deputy O'Malley outlined the effectiveness, or perhaps ineffectiveness, of an order and he has moved an amendment.  Given his comments about the penalty of the shillings and 50 new pence for each pound of explosives, the order will be ineffective if that is the case.  I hope the Minister of State will reply to the points raised in that regard.  Members agree with her about land mines but the issue of how the matter is addressed, whether by legisation or an order, also arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is not whether we should opt for high technology or low cost land mines.  I do not wish to give the <Col N="379" /> impression that we could be in favour of certain types of land mines because, as Bishop Kirby if Trócaire pointed out, there is no such thing as a humane land mine.  The bishop has travelled through many countries in Africa and visited Cambodia and Vietnam and has seen the horror caused by land mines.  He supports the Government's decision to ratify the inhumane weapons convention and I hope the order before the House will contribute to a total cessation of the manufacture and export of land mines.  I also hope Ireland can use its influence with its EU partners to encourage them to desist from this type of trade in the future.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the group, International Alert, appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and their points about the use of land mines in internal conflicts throughout the world were striking.  They divided the conflicts into those where more than 1,000 people are killed every year and those where fewer are killed.  They said there are more than 32 conflicts where more than 1,000 people are killed.  In foreign affairs the role of conflict prevention is important and the group is involved in that area.</P>
    <P>Trócaire also referred to the low cost involved in planting land mines and the high cost of detecting and destroying them.  Bishop Kirby stated that there are as many land mines as citizens in Cambodia and many people are injured by the mines.  It is difficult to imagine what it would be like if that were the case here.  I welcome the Minister's statement and hope other countries adopt our policy.  Belgium has changed its policy. We are in a good position to call for a change in policy on the use of land mines and we have made great progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill was unfairly criticised and, in spite of what we heard this morning, many Government Members said it provided a welcome debate in the House.  The absence of measures to deal with penalties could have been dealt <Col N="380" /> with on Committee Stage, but we were not given an opportunity to do that. Deputy Burke, our spokesperson on foreign affairs policy, stated in our document, A Place in the World, that he would introduce such legislation and he fulfilled his promise.  The Bill was criticised for not going far enough, but that could have been altered on Committee Stage.  In our policy document Deputy Burke stated that the central objective of Irish foreign policy should be a worldwide ban on the manufacture, sale, export and stockpiling of all types of anti-personnel land mines within three years.  Such a policy deserves the support of all Members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also quoted the estimated figures for the number of land mines in the world and said they are based mainly in developing countries, one of the main obstacles to their development.  I support Deputy Burke's call for the introduction of legislation in this regard, this debate emphasises the need for such legislation.</P>
    <P>We must continue to press for a worldwide ban on all land mines. NGO's such as Pax Christi, Trócaire and Handicap International, members of which attended a meeting of our Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, want land mines banned in internal conflicts and a system put in place to monitor, verify and review all conventions.  I hope the Minister will consider their views and that a ban on the use of land mines will prevent people from being injued and killed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their supportive comments on the Government's call for a worldwide ban on land mines.  I was somewhat surprised at the rather sour and curmudgeonly tone of some of Deputy O'Malley's contribution.  His comments reflect a different viewpoint on military matters generally from mine.  This matter was last debated in the House after we had introduced a White Paper which unequivocally set out at some length <Col N="381" /> Ireland's position in calling for a worldwide ban on the use of land mines.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill followed but that simple instrument was found to be so flawed as to be almost beyond repair.  It offered no measures to deal with penalties or offences.  It was simply an exhortation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to appeal to other Ministers. Deputy O'Malley criticised the Bill on those grounds and, if I recall correctly, suggested that the 1875 Act was an appropriate device to use.  As he was Minister for Justice, he will know the 1875 Act was not suppressed at the time of the passing of the 1972 Act because there was subversive activity here which, unfortunately, remains the position to this day.</P>
      <P>We have a clear statement from the Government and the principal Opposition Party, Fianna Fáil, supporting a worldwide ban on the use of land mines. There was a rather ill-judged attempt to introduce legislation which was not adequate.  Instead we examined the existing legislation and discovered that an order under the explosives Act comprehensively bans anything to do with land mines here.  That is what the international campaign requires and it allows us to restate our position in the context of the international campaign.  We started off as one of five countries and have been joined by more than 35 other countries in calling for a ban on land mines.</P>
      <P>It makes sense to use Dáil time and other mechanisms to seek to ban all land mines in this effective and comprehensive manner and not, as the Fianna Fáil Bill suggested, to seek to ban the use of only anti-personnel land mines. This is a significant step forward in the argument for a ban on all land mines. Given that we do not manufacture land mines and do not intend to have an armaments or explosives industry here, we are not in the same position as countries such as Belgium who manufacture armaments and for whom issues such as this are matters of public practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a major arms manufacturer theoretically offered to create a large number <Col N="382" /> of jobs here manufacturing land mines, our State agencies and authorities would be in a position to say that under this order Ireland does not manufacture, store, transfer or engage in any activity relating to the use of land mines. That will be the net effect of this order. It is unlikely that anyone would seek to use this country as a base for manufacturing land mines, but if they did that would be our answer to them.</P>
    <P>We take up the Presidency of the European Union at the end of this month.  In the course of the last debate it was stated by Deputies on all sides of the House that it would be desirable to have the Irish position clearly stated before the commencement of our Presidency, and that is one of the reasons for arranging the debate this morning.  During our Presidency we will have an opportunity at the Development Council to discuss the question of land mines, particularly in the context of development. I have asked that that question be tabled as one of the issues to be dealt with during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>During our Presidency we will also undertake the first review of the Lomé agreement &mdash; it is in that area we can make the greatest impact.  In discussing the Lomé agreement, that is, the relationship between the European Union and the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific region, we should seek to establish a coherent plan in terms of development aid and the money spent on armaments.  It is unacceptable that many millions of dollars continue to be spent in countries such as Angola while land mines continue to be planted.  Donor countries cannot continue indefinitely to give substantial development funds to countries such as China, the Russian Federation and other armament manufacturing countries while those countries export weapons of death to the ten or 11 countries beset by land mine conflicts, where the most horrific killings and civilian injuries take place on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>This debate is a very small step in the campaign against land mines.  It is a clear national statement of the Irish <Col N="383" /> position.  Deputy O'Malley chose to make little of it, perhaps because he and his party fail to have a sustained or serious interest in land mines, but the question of land mines and armaments in the Third World is as important as the question of affording sufficient food to people in the Third World to provide for their sustenance and well-being.  It is important and effective to have a clear statement of the Irish position at the start of our Presidency.  This order will stand in the very unlikely event that someone would seek to use Ireland as a base for land mines.  That likelihood is extremely remote but it has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is important that we go forward to the various international fora, particularly the European Union, to say what our domestic position is and continue to press for international action, particularly by countries that manufacture and export armaments.  We must have dialogue with those states and argue that in the interests of the people of the developing world there should be no further expenditure on land mines.  That money should be diverted to eliminating land mines already planted so that we get rid of that weapon of war.  Many weapons of war have been eliminated &mdash; there is no talk anymore of crossbows &mdash; because they were so injurious as to be no longer acceptable to mankind.  If we enter that debate with out partners in the European Union and countries that export and use land mines, we will have made a solid achievement during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley argued previously that legislation is a waste of time and stated today that because the Act dealing with this matter is an old one, we should not use the instruments at our disposal.  I am disappointed the Progressive Democrats Party takes such a narrow view of the fight for disarmament and the campaign against land mines.  The views expressed by Deputy O'Malley are so soured by his experience that he is incapable of seeing the benefits of this campaign.  As in the case <Col N="384" /> of apartheid, the campaign against land mines is one that must be undertaken.</P>

That issue did not directly affect us as a country, but it affected a great part of mankind.  Similarly in this case, because the principle is greater than the narrow question of domestic self-interest we have opted to make a statement on the principle.</P>

      <P>I was one of five Ministers attending the review conference and the only Minister from a European Union country who spoke clearly for a total ban on land mines.  Deputy Kitt spoke about Bishop Kirby.  I met Bishop Kirby shortly after my appointment as <Col N="385" /> Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and was pleased to tell him &mdash; he had not been able to get a clear answer up to that time &mdash; that I was more than happy to bring Ireland to the forefront in the campaign against international land mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all the NGOs who have campaigned on this issue.  The campaign does not stop here.  This order is a small punctuation mark which simply marks our position as a country, and whether we are able to persuade others to eliminate land mines will be a test of our diplomatic skills and skills of persuasion. I thank the Fianna Fáil Members who have been very active in <Col N="386" /> supporting the campaign.  I met the leader of the campaign in the European Parliament and the patron of the mine awareness group two weeks ago and it is impressive that the campaign is beginning to gain momentum internationally. I hope Ireland will be in a position during our Presidency to bring forward debate on this issue in a number of modest ways.  We will not be able to end the scourge of land mines on our own, but we have a moral authority to add our voice to the international campaign and thereby help to achieve success in the future.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 9: In page 9, between lines 10 and 11, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) intends to avoid removal from the State in the event of his or her application for asylum being transferred to a convention country pursuant to section 22,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> These amendments are all of a piece and provide for, or follow as a consequence of, the introduction of a review mechanism for Dublin Convention cases.  Deputies will recall that the purpose of the Dublin Convention is to lay down criteria for determining which member states are responsible for examining an asylum application.  In the light of comments made in this House and the Seanad and bearing in mind submissions made to me by the UNHCR and other interested parties I sought the further advice of the Attorney General in the matter of an appeal mechanism for persons who may come within the ambit of the Dublin Convention.  The Attorney General advised me there would be merit in including further enabling provisions in section 22 which would specifically provide for a review mechanism to be set out in an order made under the section. I accepted his advice, and amendments Nos. 10 and 14 provide a mechanism for establishing an appeal process and for the appointment of a person to consider any such appeals.  By introducing this amendment I have met the concerns expressed in this matter.</P>
    <P>The amendment spells out a specific enabling provision which allows for the inclusion in the order of procedures for an appeal against a decision to return a person to another convention country. The Dublin Convention is essentially a set of procedural or technical rules as opposed to a development in the area of asylum philosophy or thinking.  It is, accordingly, proper that the statutory instrument should spell out a procedure to deal with the situation where an applicant whose application is to be transferred under the Dublin Convention can appeal against what he or she considers to be a misapplication of these rules.</P>
    <P>There are two further points in connection with the Dublin Convention that I wish to reiterate.  First, subsection (4) provides that an application cannot be transferred unless the other convention country has agreed to accept responsibility for the examination of the <Col N="390" /> application.  This is a very important safeguard.  Second, section 4 of Article 3 of the Dublin Convention provides that each state may decide to examine a claim for asylum even if that responsibility lies with another state under the terms of the convention.  The order to be made under section 22 (2) (a) of the Bill will provide for this.  In making a decision to return an individual to another convention country the official appointed by the Minister by virtue of the new subsection (4) (a) will take all issues into account before issuing a decision.</P>
    <P>In so far as the person to be appointed to hear the appeal is concerned, amendment No. 14 provides that such a person will have at least seven years experience as a practising lawyer.  While it is probable that the person to be appointed to hear appeals will be the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the new paragraph (c) of subsection (4) is flexible enough to allow for another suitably qualified person to be appointed in the event that the commissioner is unable to deal expeditiously with an appeal because for example, he is out of the country or indisposed.</P>
    <P>On re-reading section 22 in connection with amendments Nos. 10 and 14, it occurred to us that the reference to &ldquo;detention&rdquo; in paragraph (f) was unwarranted.  Amendment No. 11 provides for the deletion of the reference to &ldquo;detention&rdquo; from the current paragraph (f) of section 22 (2).  It is only proper that, where the detention of a person whose application has been accepted by the State is required, such detention should be governed by the general rules already set out in the Bill.  This amendment ensures that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 was introduced in the Seanad as a consequence of the introduction of an appeal mechanism in Dublin Convention cases.  It may happen that some persons who are advised that their applications are to be transferred to another State may lodge an appeal against the decision and then disappear in an effort to frustrate their possible removal.  Such an action would <Col N="391" /> be a complete abuse of the asylum process. I am of the view that where there is a reasonable suspicion that such will be the case, it is proper that such a person be detainable and this should be a ground for detention under section 9.</P>
    <P>This provision limits detention to those cases where it would clearly be needed, rather than having a blanket provision allowing any Dublin Convention appellant to be detained.  The inclusion of the provision in this section avoids the need to provide for detention in the regulations to be made under section 22 and the drafting difficulties of having that subordinate legislation apply the section 9 provisions regarding detention in cases not contemplated by the current section 9 (8).</P>
    <P>By including the detention provisions here, I am ensuring that all detentions are properly seen to be under the direct supervision of our courts.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome these amendments, having felt strongly on Committee and Report Stages that a loophole in relation to the Dublin Convention needed to be closed off.  At that time I explained that my concern related to an individual transferred to another Dublin Convention country who might be transferred from there to another country which might not be a signatory to the convention.  It was just feasible that an individual could end up in the country from which he or she had originally fled persecution.</P>
      <P>These amendments close off that loophole to a certain extent.  I feared that the consequence of not closing off that loophole would result in a genuine applicant not receiving asylum in this or in another country signatory to the Dublin Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to present to the House this Bill which introduces a new era of employee participation in Ireland and marks an important development in the history of Irish industrial relations. It is another landmark in strengthening the consensus approach to industrial relations issues we have developed here since 1987.  It enshrines for the first time in legislation participation, information and consultation arrangements in regard to the private sector.</P>
      <P>The Bill arises from the European Works Council Directive which is a product of the European model of social partnership.  This model recognises that employees, as stakeholders in their companies, should have a right to be informed and consulted about important business developments which will affect their futures.</P>
      <P>The directive, and as a result of legislation, applies to large-scale companies which employ at least 150 in each of two member states and at least 1,000 overall in the Community.  In all, it is estimated that the Bill will apply to some 200 multinational companies with operations in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is in operation, the process which this legislation will set up will bring together representatives of employees from all those countries in the European Union and the European Economic Area in which a company has operations.  Employees of many Irish multinationals will elect representatives to sit at a forum with their opposite numbers from other EU countries, where they and the company can work <Col N="397" /> out shared approaches to future developments. This forum will provide an important place for the company and its employees to jointly discuss the opportunities and problems confronting them, as well as ensuring that employees are fully informed and consulted about important issues for the operation of the company.</P>
    <P>In drawing up this legislation, I consulted widely the representatives of the business community and representatives of employees.  As a part of this process a consultation paper was issued by my Department in July of last year.  My approach to the Bill has been to facilitate a co-operative and positive approach by individual companies and their employees in meeting the objectives of the directive.  This approach, I believe, will result in legislation which recognises, to the extent permitted by the directive, the voluntarist tradition in Irish industrial relations and which will facilitate multinational companies and their employees in establishing effective and efficient transnational information and consultation.</P>
    <P>The objective of the directive, and thus the Bill, can be met in three ways. It can be met by Pre-Directive or Pre-Bill-Agreements, which must be adopted before 22 September 1996 and provide for transnational information and consultation arrangements which cover the entire workforce.  Here, the Bill goes beyond the text of the directive by providing for legal protection for valid agreements and by making the validity of agreements dependent on their being accepted by the majority of the workforce.  Where such agreements are adopted the provisions of the Bill will not apply, other than those provisions which provide for pre-bill-agreements.</P>
    <P>The objective can be met by the provision for agreements under the Bill, which are to be agreed between a representative body of employees &mdash; the Special Negotiating Body or SNB &mdash; and central management.  As stipulated by the directive, the Bill provides a framework for such agreements which <Col N="398" /> may invoke an information and consultation body &mdash; a European Employees' Forum &mdash; or alternatively may establish an information and consultation procedure. The Bill adds to the provisions of the directive by requiring that such agreements include arrangements for informing and consulting Irish-based employees on the matters relevant to the transnational or European information and consultation arrangements and the parties to such agreements, central management and employees' representatives, agree an arbitrator for determining disputes that arise about the interpretation of agreements entered into under the Bill.  Where the parties do not agree an arbitrator, the Bill enables the Labour Court to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators, where requested to so do by either party.</P>
    <P>Where agreement on transnational information and consultation arrangements is not reached, after a period set down in the Bill, the subsidiary or annex requirements will come into play. Under these requirements, companies will be legally obliged to establish a European Works Council or EWC as prescribed in the Bill.  The Bill includes two provisions in respect of the prescribed EWC which are not required by the directive.  Management will be obliged to consult with representatives on the arrangement for the holding of meetings of the EWC.  Also, the minutes of EWC meetings will have to be agreed between management and the EWC.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions in the Bill which reflect Irish employment relations, traditions and concerns.  Overall, I stress the Bill reflects the Irish industrial relations tradition of allowing management and employees to determine the nature of their relationship.  At the same time the Bill provides legal rights for employees and their representatives.  In essence, the Bill seeks to provide a balance between the rights and concerns of employees and the need for information and consultation arrangements which <Col N="399" /> are appropriate to individual companies and their development.</P>
    <P>Those companies whose central management is located in Ireland will be required to comply with the provisions of the Bill as a whole.  There are also provisions in the Bill which apply only to Irish employees of companies covered by the directive, whether their central management is located in Ireland or in another member state.</P>
    <P>The Bill will transpose into Irish Law the provisions of the European Union Directive 94/45 on informing and consulting employees.  The directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 22 September 1994 on the basis of the Protocol on social policy, generally known as the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Agreement, annexed to the EEC Treaty.  The directive must be transposed into national law by 22 September this year.  The directive applies to 17 countries &mdash; the member states of the European Union, excluding the United Kingdom, and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</P>
    <P>A unique feature of this directive is that large-scale multinational companies which fall within its application must comply with the transposition law of the member state in which its central management is located and also, in certain aspects, with the transposition laws of each of the member states in which they have employees.</P>
    <P>Under the Maastricht Agreement, one of the objectives of the Community and the member states is to promote dialogue between management and labour in order that economic activities will develop in a harmonious fashion.  The purpose of the directive is to improve the right to transnational information and consultation of employees in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings.  In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the directive allows some degree of competence to member states to reflect their employment relations and employment concerns in their transposition legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> At the suggestion of Ireland, following the adoption of the directive by the Council of Ministers, an expert working group of representatives from each member state was established.  The objective of the group was to encourage, as far as was practical, a smooth and even transposition of the directive into national laws, bearing in mind the differing industrial relations traditions as between member states.  The conclusions of this working group are not binding on member states, but I am happy to acknowledge the contribution of the deliberations of the group to the formulation of draft transposition legislation across the member states, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline the broad purposes of the Bill, which I hope all sides of the House can find it possible to support.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the title of the Bill, which reflects the objective of the Information and Consultation Directive.</P>
    <P>Section 3 defines terms used in the Bill, drawing on both the text of the directive itself, but it also interprets some terms not defined in the directive, including the meaning of employees and employees' representatives for the purposes of the Bill.  The section does not discriminate between full-time and regular part-time workers and, in determining thresholds under the Bill, part-time workers are included as full units along with full-time workers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is an important section which details the workforce threshold requirements which determine whether an undertaking or group of undertakings is a Community-scale undertaking or a Community-scale group of undertakings and thus covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the manner in which it may be determined if an undertaking is covered by the Bill by virtue of being part of a group.  Together with section 4, this section provides the legal basis for the scope of the application of the Bill in terms of the large-scale companies to which it will apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> Section 6 exempts from the other provisions of the Bill those companies where agreements on transnational information and consultation, which have been accepted by the majority of the workforce, have been adopted prior to 22 September 1996.  I understand it is expected that up to 200 companies across the Community, or about 10 per cent of those covered by the directive, will have adopted such agreements prior to 22 September next.  This section provides greater flexibility for the parties in agreeing the nature and scope of transnational information and consultation arrangements than the provisions in the other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact that such agreements must be agreed by the majority of the workforce is an important provision to guard against mickey mouse agreements. There will not be any question of slipshod agreements which do not meet in full the principles the Bill sets out to undertake because the test of that would be that workers would have to support whatever agreement is negotiated as a Pre-Directive Agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 7 enables the making of such regulations as may be necessary to give full effect to the Bill, in particular, regulations on expenses to be borne by central management and the appointment of arbitrators.  Central management must carry the expenses incurred by workers under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 specify the general obligations and responsibilities of central management with regard to the establishment of information and consultation arrangements.  Section 10 specifies the circumstances where central management is obliged to establish a representative body of employees&mdash; the special negotiating body or SNB&mdash; for the purposes of negotiating agreed information and consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 11 specifies that the function of the special negotiating body shall be to negotiate with central management for an agreement on the establishment of arrangements for the information and consultation of employees; that the <Col N="402" /> body may be assisted by experts of its choice; that central management shall convene a meeting with the special negotiating body with a view to the conclusion of an agreement and that central management shall bear all reasonable expenses for these purposes, including the equivalent cost of one expert.  Those experts may be a trade union official or any other expert nominated by the workers.</P>
    <P>Section 12 imposes on the central management and the special negotiating body an obligation to negotiate in a spirit of co-operation. An agreement for the information and consultation of employees may invoke the establishment of a European employees forum. The parties may also agree to establish one or more information and consultation procedures, instead of a forum. The section also sets out a framework for agreements, while leaving the details to be agreed by the parties in negotiation, and provides for the dissolution of the special negotiating body when it ceases to have the function of negotiating an agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 13 sets out the circumstances in which the subsidiary requirements of the Second Schedule &mdash; the establishment of a prescribed European Works Council &mdash; shall apply, in other words the provision of the annex to the directive. The requirements shall apply if the special negotiating body and central management so agree; where the central management refuses to commence negotiations within six months of a request referred to in section 10, or if after the expiration of three years from the date of such request the parties are unable to conclude an agreement.  This section is fundamental to the objective of the Bill as it ensures that employees can exercise the information and consultation rights provided for in the Bill, if they wish, in the absence of agreement with central management.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the manner in which employees' representatives to the special negotiating body, the ongoing <Col N="403" /> information and consultation arrangements or a European works council are to be selected.  Again, trade union officials are entitled to stand for election to the special negotiating body or may be appointed by the workforce if it agrees.</P>
    <P>Section 15 prohibits members of the special negotiating body, European Employees' Forum or European Works Council or employee's representatives to an information and consultation procedure from disclosing information given to them in confidence.  The section also provides for the circumstances in which central management may withhold information, which it claims, is commercially sensitive.  We have provided for an arbitration procedure in the Bill with regard to commercially sensitive information or if management is seeking to throw a cloak of secrecy over information which it is valid for it to disclose.</P>
    <P>Section 16 obliges central management and employees' representatives to work in the spirit of co-operation with regard to their reciprocal rights and obligations.  Section 17 sets out the protection and the facilities to be provided to employees' representatives.</P>
    <P>Section 18 defines offences under the Bill and is necessary to ensure the effective application of the Bill.  The offences are refusal by central management to disclose data on workforce levels, nonestablishment of a prescribed European Works Council where such is required, and disclosure by employees' representatives of confidential information.</P>
    <P>Section 19 sets out the penalties which may be imposed for breaches of the Bill, which reflects the gravity of the prescribed offences.  Section 20 provides for referral of disputes, between central management and employees, regarding withholding of commercially sensitive information, to an arbitrator to be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 21 stipulates that the parties agree an arbitrator to determine disputes arising from the interpretation of agreements under the Bill.  Where the <Col N="404" /> parties cannot agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, either may apply to the Labour Court, which shall refer the dispute to the arbitration of one or more persons as it thinks fit.  Section 22 states that the Bill shall apply without prejudice to the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, and to the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 (SI No. 306 of 1980).</P>
    <P>The First Schedule provides requirements for the nomination and election of employees' representatives.  The Second Schedule prescribes the nature and form of the European Works Councils to be established where there is no agreement between management and employees on the establishment of information and consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate accurately the costs that will arise for companies from the meeting of the requirements of the Bill.  However, the EU Commission has estimated that an ongoing cost of the order of 10 ECU or £8 per employee per annum may arise. It is a small price to pay for information and consultation arrangements involving workers in running their companies. There will be benefit to companies which should compensate for the costs, especially where information and consultation arrangements are established which assist in the development of more co-operative employement relations.</P>
    <P>I stress four important points.  First, it is particularly important that the transposition date of 22 September 1996 is met as there will be difficulties for management and employees if member states do not meet the deadline.  Second, the Bill is a step in the establishment of general information and consultation arrangments for Irish-based employees. It is an important first step because this is the first time that private sector workers are being given a statutory right to be consulted and informed about the progress of their company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Third, the subject matter of the Bill is transnational information and consultation for employees in large scale multinational companies.  The question of national information and consultation, including works councils at the national level, is a subject for another day.  I am sure this will be pursued by both sides in the context of negotiations to a possible successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>. It is also a subject on the table of the European Council in the context of the European Companies Statute.  The EU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr. Flynn, recently circulated to the Council of Social Affairs Minister a communication on the area of information and consultation.  Those issues are now being referred to a high level working group which will include representatives of both the social partners of employees and management.  It is an issue which is very much alive at the European level.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Bill seeks, as it must, to fully transpose the EU Directive on Information and Consultation of Employees into domestic law.  Many of its provisions have the purpose of establishment of effective and efficient information and consultation procedures that accord with Irish employment and industrial relations concerned.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill I have taken a consultative approach.  I have tried to strike a balanced approach, to be faithful to the directive and to ensure that the right of workers to information with regard to their companies will be a real right and will have genuine force.  The key to this is our three stage procedure. First, where a pre-directive is in place, that agreement must have the backing of the majority of the workforce.  This is the important test to ensure they are genuine agreements and that they do not try to circumvent the spirit of the directive.  The endorsement of the workforce is the key to ensuring that those pre-directive agreements are genuinely negotiated agreements which reflect the concerns of both sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> Second, the structured negotiating procedure through the special negotiating body is there to ensure that workers and managers can agree between themselves the form of information and consultation which they believe best suits their business.  Finally, if management is reluctant to enter negotiations or if they do not prove fruitful, we have the procedure whereby the provisions of the annex to the directive where the prescribed form of information consultation is laid down.</P>
    <P>This is an important day for Irish workers.  The only other legislative provision with regard to participation and consultation relates to the appointment of worker directors in the semi-State sector.  This is the first time we have a statutory right for employees in private sector businesses enshrined in Irish law.</P>
    <P>I have established a unit in my Department to promote partnership in enterprise because it is extremely important that management and workers work together in a co-operative way to ensure that their businesses are in a position to meet the challenge of change.  We know that workers bring not only their hands but their brains, ideas and commitment to work.</P>
    <P>If managements want to ensure the full commitment and acknowledgement of what their workforce can contribute, if they want to proceed with the changes facing all Irish companies in adopting to new markets, new competition and new processes, they need to engage in full information and consultation and to set up participative structures.  We are pursuing this in the Department through working with companies, working through the Irish productivity centre and through the work of the unit for partnership in enterprise.  I want the start we are making today in terms of a framework for information and consultation to be agreed across Irish industry, where workers and managements will take initiatives to put in place arrangements where they can manage change and involve both sides in the shared success of their enterprise which is so <Col N="407" /> important for the workers whose livelihoods depend on the success of the company as well as for managements.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill we have taken an important first step.  However, it is certainly not the end of my Department's work in this area of promoting consultation and partnership.  Only last Monday in Waterford we held a very successful seminar at which workers and management from a number of companies explained how they had set up partnership arrangements, how they were managing change and putting in place structures and procedures which would enable both sides to work together on issues that affect both.  Through that process of demonstrating how partnership works in Irish companies, I hope we will encourage more companies to go down that road.  Today is just the start.  The function of this Bill is to transpose a European directive into Irish law, but the job does not end there.  The Department intends to continue its work of spreading the partnership message so that Irish companies can meet the future competitive challenge in a way that will involve everybody who works for a company in a shared effort, in recognition of what each has to contribute. This partnership approach is already delivering success for those Irish businesses that have gone down that road and will continue to contribute to success, to job security, to the development of new jobs and to the prosperity of Irish business.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have criticised EU Directives in the past, on the grounds of interference and their number.  Business in particular has raised legitimate reservations about directives from Europe. We should keep an eye on the broader picture with regard to directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about here is fundamental to the management of our economy.  My party has viewed the question of co-operation between business and trade unions and of social partnership as being very important.  It is no <Col N="408" /> secret that Fianna Fáil was instrumental in setting up the process of social partnership. I would go so far as to say we invented the process that has driven many successful national agreements. Social partnership is being pushed as a result of the transposition of this directive, on to a transnational, Europe Economic Area plain.  Considerable consultation has taken place with interested parties, including business interests and the trade union movement. I will raise certain matters on Report Stage, but it is important to underline that the principle of social partnership is one we support and we are anxious to get this Bill through as quickly as possible.  The Minister has to meet an end of September deadline. The EU Presidency is also coming up and there are many pressures.  I will, therefore, be as co-operative as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill means that employees of EU based companies and Europe Economic Area countries &mdash; 14 countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein &mdash; which employ at least 1,000 people across the European Union and at least 150 in two of the member states operating the legislation, will now elect representatives to sit at works councils or employee fora which will inform and consult employees on transnational company matters.</P>
    <P>An obvious question arises with regard to the United Kingdom &mdash; the Bill excludes anybody employed in the United Kingdom because of the Social Charter.  What may happen after the next election is not our problem, but it will have implications for business in this country because of the amount of business we do with the United Kingdom.  It is important in implementing this directive that we keep a close eye on developments in the UK.  Our business community and the social partners are rightly conscious of developments in the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom has a company based outside the UK in two of the European economic area countries, it is covered by this legislation.  It is <Col N="409" /> important to recognise that the United Kingdom is involved.</P>
    <P>It is also important to realise that some of the major companies here, for example, Smurfit's, Roadstone, Independent Newspapers and the Clondalkin Group will be very much affected by this.  Many of these companies are already setting up appropriate structures. There are approximately 200 multinational subsidiaries in Ireland which will be affected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of social partnership is important as far as my party is concerned. Commissioner Pádraig Flynn has played a very important role, as the Minister has acknowledged, in achieving agreement on this directive at the Council of Ministers after 25 years of discussions and opposition from European employers.  I acknowledge the role of the former Minister, the Deputy Leader of my Party, Deputy Mary O'Rourke at the Council of Ministers.  Lengthy discussions took place at that level, and Commissioner Pádraig Flynn has done a great service not just for this country but also for Europe, for employees and employment generally.  He deserves to be recognised in any debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Works councils will have to meet at least once a year to brief employee representatives on such issues as employment, investment trends, changes in the organisation, cutbacks, redundancies and other issues which may impact on the company in the years ahead.  We had problems involving the breakdown of trust and confidence among workers &mdash; Packard Electric might not be as relevant in this context as Digital.  It is relevant to mention such examples because clearly if proper structures are in place &mdash; a works council or an employee forum &mdash; there will be good communications, trust can be built and the confidence required will be created to ensure there will not be a dramatic breakdown in communications as happened in Digital.  Lack of communication between management and trade unions has resulted in job losses and the movement of jobs to other parts of the <Col N="410" /> European Union.  The type of transnational and information processes that will result from this legislation will help to ensure against such situations arising in the future.  The structures we are setting up are pivotal in ensuring that.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has, rightly, raised the question of the implications for us.  They have already carved out particular issues in the context of a future national agreement.  They wish to establish a stakeholder agenda inside or outside talks on another national agreement. In the Irish context I would like to see further movement in the promotion of information and consultation rights so that enterprise can take advantage of the benefits that research shows flows from the involvement of workers so that the job satisfaction of workers can be enhanced.  Public sector enterprise and agency employees already have consultation rights &mdash; for example, worker directors in semi-State bodies.  In the ongoing debate in Telecom Éireann on the strategic alliance the issue of share options for workers has been raised.  I met the Communications Workers Union and listened carefully to its case.  Its approach is progressive and it is an example of a trade union that decided to push out the parameters of the agenda.  The union is examining examples of share options for workers in the United States and elsewhere. That is an example of the type of co-operation I wish to see develop in the years ahead.  The new structures we are discussing fall into line with what is happening in many companies, including semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is enacted, the question of information and consultation will be dealt with in semi-State bodies but not in indigenous firms.  This gap needs to be addressed by the social partners and by the Minister.  It makes good business sense in terms of competitiveness to inform and consult all employees on key developments and decisions.  The traditional line of argument that this is anti-competitive is an old-fashioned response to the issue.  In multinationals in Japan, the United States and the <Col N="411" /> Pacific Rim, one will see the involvement of the workforce within structures such as the ones we are discussing today as a very positive development in relation to competition.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are issues that need to be addressed but I will raise them on Committee Stage.  Moving from the UK confrontational type industrial relations to consultation and consensus building is the right approach.  There is a clear parallel between what we are discussing at transnational level and what is happening here at social partnership level. We have seen the benefits of social partnership in the health of our economy.  A number of factors are at play but clearly one central strand that runs through a number of Governments &mdash; and I will go back to the time the Minister of State and I were elected to the Dáil in 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When Charles Haughey was Taoiseach, we pursued the approach of social partnership and strict control of public expenditure.  The clear message from that period is that social partnership has produced the goods.  I sound a note of caution because I am not convinced the Government is pushing out the boat far enough on a new agreement with the social partners. Ireland will assume the Presidency of the European Union shortly.  I recall listening to the Taoiseach on social partnership when he was in opposition and he opposed the concept which he now supports.  I am concerned that the process is slipping.  I am not the only person voicing that concern, the trade union movement has voiced its concerns, SIPTU in particular.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach will be heavily occupied with the EU Presidency but he should ensure that steps are taken now to tie down his commitment and to ensure that contact is maintained between the social partners.  It is quite clear that politicians think about impending elections <Col N="412" /> more than anything else and I am concerned the Government will let this whole area slip and not deal with it as it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I will raise a number of issues on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister ensure part-time workers will be allowed to be involved in the process?  I wonder why the Minister did not set out rules for the chairing of the meeting as allowed for in paragraph 4 of the annex to the directive.  Should meetings always be chaired by management or could the job be shared with an employee representative?</P>
      <P>There is no proper provision for training of employee representatives.  Some provision should be made to assist representatives understand financial and business issues so that they can make the greatest contribution possible to the work councils.  I will raise this point on Committee Stage.  There are concerns across the European Union about the legislation and the tremendous lack of awareness.  The European Council document &ldquo;Learning from Diversity&rdquo; shows that speakers came from the EF, Warwick University and some independent consultants and their finding was that a clear majority of companies across Europe had started to think about responding to the European Works Council directive but they had little or no knowledge of how works council structures operated in practice in other member states.  It talks about the need for companies to monitor how the directive would be introduced into member state law.  Many companies did not appreciate that once their head count triggered the EWC directive they were required to include all their employees on an individual member state basis.  There are serious concerns. That brings me to the point of awareness and the need for the Minister to be pro-actively involved in ensuring there is awareness.</P>
      <P>I will refer to some of the points raised by IBEC.  IBEC has asked that we keep the structures uncomplicated, ensure clarity and avoid confusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office already makes adjustments to the income based measure of GDP to include estimates for the black economy.  Where necessary, data are adjusted to ensure full coverage of incomes.  For example, the basic data on self-employed profits are adjusted upwards to ensure that incomes are attributed to all self-employed persons recorded in the Labour Force Survey.</P>
      <P>Black economy activity is also indirectly captured in other components of the GDP.  For instance, wages are estimated on the basis of statistical surveys grossed to the overall employment totals reported in the LFS.  This method implicitly captures earnings not reported to the tax authorities.  In addition, farm incomes are measured indirectly using the national farm concept and are not dependent on the declarations of individual farmers.</P>
      <P>The CSO is continuing to review its methodology as part of an ongoing EU programme aimed at ensuring the consistency and comparability of the GDP and GNP estimates of member states. However, any changes to the treatment of the black economy are not expected to give rise to significant revisions in the Irish national accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of international discussion of the major upward revision in the statistics <Col N="414" /> of some Mediterranean countries, which has been widely reported in economic magazines.  What effect will this have on us?  I know the OECD report is due to be circulated in the next few days.  More importantly, if the GDP does not reflect the revisions for the black economy, what is the percentage differential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that anxieties arise from the well publicised anomalies in the statistics of some EU countries.  I suspect media attention prompted this question. The Deputy is quite right that there have been major revisions in the GDP figures of various EU member states to incorporate the hidden economy.  For example, the Greek figures were adjusted by plus 20 per cent, according to the <i>Financial Times</i>, and those of Portugal by plus 15 per cent.  Those newspaper articles were somewhat misleading. Some member states have significantly increased GNP levels as a result of improvements made to comply with the requirements of EU Directive 89/130/EC.  However, these revisions incorporate a wide range of methodological changes.</P>
      <P>Our figures are constantly under review.  We have at all stages ensured the accuracy of our statistics.  It is not expected, from the point of view of any revisions which will take place in the Irish national accounts, that there will be any significant increase.  As I explained, we operate on two levels &mdash; direct adjustments and indirect adjustments using labour force surveys and any other data.  On the basis of those figures, we are in a position to give a reasonably accurate gauge.  It is calculated that the direct adjustments made for black economy activities at present amount roughly to 2.5 per cent, or 3 per cent at most, of GDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that, following its examination of this matter, it is the belief of the Central Statistics Office that our black economy accounts for only 2.5 per cent of the overall economy? That is about one tenth of what <Col N="415" /> has been found in other countries of similar size, character and behavioural patterns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the belief of the Central Statistics Office is that the black economy accounts for 2.5 per cent, or at most 3 per cent of GDP.  Other surveys and studies will not agree with that analysis.  However, the Central Statistics Office has been characterised up to now by the precision of its forecasting of the performance of the economy and future projections.  Its methodology is, by and large, well tried and tested.  We do not claim it is infallible, but I imagine it is as good, if not better, than those of other countries, such as Greece and Portugal. I have every confidence that the CSO figure is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great regard for the CSO, having worked closely with it in a number of capacities as a Minister of State and as Minister for Finance. Unfortunately, the record does not show it has been able to get things right and it has had to make major adjustments, the last of which occurred when I was Minister for Finance.  Unfortunately, the figure given here is not correct.</P>
      <P>I am trying to gauge the effect of the black economy on the GDP and how this is reflected in official figures.  This is vitally important as we move towards the next round of Structural Funds.  The movement of our GDP figures in line with the Maastricht criteria will determine whether we will be totally or partially covered for objective one status. That will determine the money we will receive under FEOGA guidance, the CAP reform proposals, regional funds and the ESF.  The figures for other countries reflect quite significant adjustments. Eventually, those will be reflected in the Irish figures.</P>

    <P>I am trying in advance to ensure that the CSO and this House reflect realistically on the position.  One would have to go to the man in the moon to get somebody to believe the black economy <Col N="416" /> accounts for in the order of 2.5 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State in replying to statistical questions cannot make up the figures but before the Commission, the OECD or the IMF do it for us, will he reflect on the true extent of the black economy?  This is happening right across Europe.  I cannot say what the true figure is but there is an air of unreality in the suggestion that the black economy accounts for only 2.5 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>Before others reflect on the figure I ask the Minister of State to engage in a real debate.  Otherwise, the CSO will be forced to make adjustments, as happened before, first in respect of the black hole and later in respect of profits repatriation.  I know the Minister of State cannot change the figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the figure of 2.5 to 3 per cent of GDP I am talking about direct adjustments.  I share the Deputy's anxiety about where this takes us in the next round of negotiations on the Structural Funds.  We are all conscious of the 78 per cent figure.  This is positive on the one hand but negative in terms of what we can expect to draw down based on the criteria used in the last round of negotiations.  The Minister for Finance is engaged in dialogue with the European Commission on the criteria to be applied in the next round.  They are considering whether the economy should be considered globally or regionalised to highlight the regional disparities and what adjustment mechanisms can be put in place to ensure we draw down the maximum amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the methodology used, I know the Deputy as Minister had to acknowledge in the House that there was a major disparity in figures.  This happens from <Col N="417" /> time to time but we are satisfied the figures are reasonably accurate and, on that basis, the forecast we have given is correct.  As the Deputy knows, nobody can gauge accurately the full extent of the black economy.  One uses a range of barometers, surveys and data which are cross checked in trying to arrive at the most accurate figure possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the general opinion is that the black economy is grossly understated? Has he looked at the methodology used in other comparable economies in measuring the size of the black economy?  Perhaps if we used better methodology, we would get a more accurate figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  The CSO constantly reviews the methodology used. We are doing everything possible to ensure there is a high level of synchronisation between what is happening here and in other countries.  As Deputy Ahern said, we are obliged to ensure what we are doing here conforms with the norms in other countries from the point of view of accuracy.</P>

      <P>The second report of the co-ordinating group of secretaries entitled <i>Delivering Better Government &mdash; A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service</i> was launched on 2 May last.  The central focus of the programme is the provision of excellent quality services to all customers of the Civil Service.  This comprehensive report sets out the vision for the Civil Service of the future and provides a clear framework within which consistent and ongoing progress can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Work is already under way on implementing the recommendations of the report.  A new co-ordinating group has been set up to oversee its implementation. The terms of reference of this co-ordinating group are: (i) to oversee the implementation of the Government's programme for change in the Civil Service; (ii) to validate reviews of particular programmes as requested by Government, and, (iii) to report regularly to Government on progress.</P>
      <P>Membership of the co-ordinating group is drawn from both the public and private sectors and the first meeting will be held on 24 June.  It includes representatives of the public service trade unions.</P>
      <P>A number of working groups are also being established to address the following key areas identified in the report: quality customer service; human resource management; financial management; open and transparent service delivery; regulatory reform, and, information technology and systems.  These working groups will encompass management and front-line issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A customer service group has already been set up in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to draft a code of practice for services to <Col N="419" /> the customers of commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>An advisory group on legislation has also been established.  This group which has met many types is examining the reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and will shortly make proposals to Government.  The work is being done in full consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the changes being recommended will maintain the essential requirement of governmental-ministerial accountability under the Constitution to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted progress is being made in this matter because we all subscribe to the notion of a better quality public service.  There is a great deal of confusion about some of the terminology in the documents published to date.  Will the Minister of State clarify what is meant by &ldquo;the outcomes for which Ministers are supposed to be responsible&rdquo; and &ldquo;the outputs for which Department secretaries are supposed to be responsible&rdquo;?  Will she agree that while we all subscribe to the notion of a better quality public service we should not seek to achieve this at the expense of accountability?  Now that it is being proposed that, for legal purposes, the effective head of a Department will be the Department Secretary will she assure us the Government is bearing in mind Ministers' constitutional responsibility to administer their Departments and their constitutional duty to be accountable?</P>

      <P>On the Ministers and Secretaries Act, a Bill, the heads of which are ready, is expected in the autumn. We hope it will go before Government in the next few weeks.  Any changes to the Ministers and Secretaries Act will be in accordance with the recommendations of the Attorney General. His opinion will be essential in ensuring that all constitutional requirements are met and that ultimately individual Ministers are responsible to the <Col N="420" /> Dáil for what happens in their Departments. I do not see any conflict.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked, in raising the question of outcomes versus outputs what the legal head of a Department, more than likely the secretary, will be responsible for <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister. This matter will be dealt with in depth. The legislative group which met many times is ensuring that the final recommendations and any changes to existing legislation will comply fully with constitutional requirements.  All of the Deputy's concerns are being taken on board. If any recommendation is constitutionally questionable we will not go ahead with it.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that as it is one of the essential requirements.  I refer the Deputy to <i>Delivering Better Government</i> page 23, where that point is made. I am acutely conscious of the need to ensure that what we bring back to this House meets the constitutional requirement and in no way dilutes the constitutional requirement of Ministers or the Government to this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The reward system is referred to performance management. Part of the role of performance management is to look at the need to reward good performance but it is not the only part of it.  The whole area of performance management is being dealt with by the human resource management group. It is important to get it right because much of the work done in the Civil and public service is teamwork.  We must be sure if we are to be in a position to reward individuals that we do not <Col N="422" /> demoralise the greater team.  At the same time we must be in a position to recognise good performance and by doing so encourage all others to raise their game to that level.  There is much involved in the human resource management area and there are many different views as to how this is best done.  I am not qualified to give an opinion today as to the final outcome or what the final proposals will be except to say it will be an active part of the agenda of the human resource management working group.</P>

Is the Minister of State saying that the report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 2 June was inaccurate?  Is the Minister of State stating that the garda who handled the extradition warrant on 18 April 1996 was transferred without the knowledge of the Minister for Justice or her Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House but as I have been pushed on this matter I will repeat what the Minister for Justice said on a previous occasion.  She and I stand over what she said on that previous occasion in her statement on 23 May 1996 at Col. 2088 of the Official Report as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... yesterday evening I discussed this matter with the Garda Commissioner with whom I was attending a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in London.  In the course of that conversation I learned that the sergeant who had custody of the warrant in this case had been transferred to other duties.  I sought precise details on this matter and have learned &mdash; about an hour ago &mdash; that the transfer took place on the directions of the Commissioner on 18-19 April... The sergeant was in charge of the unit which deals with extradition matters... He was the officer who had custody of the warrant in this case and the Commissioner has <Col N="425" /> informed me... that he felt it would be inappropriate for this sergeant to have responsibility for the handling of extradition papers until the cricumstances of the present case had been fully cleared up.</P>
    <P>That was the reply which the Minister gave on that occasion and on other occasions.  That is the reality.  Any speculation or comment in newspapers or elsewhere contrary to that explanation by the Minister for Justice is wrong.</P>
    <P>Regarding the position of the Garda sergeant, the Minister indicated, in response to a written parliamentary question from the Deputy on 5 June, that she had been informed by the Garda authorities that the officer in question was transferred to other duties in the crime and security branch at Garda headquarters.  The officer has not been transferred back to the extradition section but he continues to deal with extradition cases in which he previously had an involvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The week we are discussing is the same week the Taoiseach was in contact with the British Prime Minister about the Northern Ireland talks.  In that context it is unbelievable that they would not have discussed the mistake in relation to the original extradition warrant in this case. A report was made by the Garda authorities to the Minister for Justice on 15 April and the Minister was aware of the transfer of the garda on 18 or 19 April. This amounts to nothing short of a massive political cover-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would like the country to believe there was a cover-up in relation to this matter. However, there was not.  The Deputy has been worrying this bone since 22 May and, although I do not wish to mix metaphors, he has also been fishing.  He has not come up with anything and he will not come up with anything contrary to the statement in the House by the <Col N="426" /> Minister for Justice in relation to the events on 22 May.  That is a matter of record.  I am not detracting from or adding to it; that is the truth.</P>

Although it is just past Bloomsday, I will not suggest that there should be an annual commemoration of the event.

However, I have nothing further to add to what was said in the House on many occasions.  The Deputy's point about a slur on the semi-State bodies is a scandalous allegation. There is no truth in it and I hope the Deputy will withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>This tragedy was discussed in an Adjournment debate recently, but the Minister feels it is necessary, in view of the questions, to outline the circumstances again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deceased was committed to Mountjoy Prison at 10.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 May 1996, pursuant to an order issued in the Dublin District Court earlier that day.  She was <Col N="429" /> remanded to appear again at the District Court on 27 May 1996 at 10.30 a.m. The deceased had been before the court previously, but had failed to turn up for her hearing on 16 November 1995.</P>
    <P>The deceased was allowed to make a telephone call to a friend, immediately upon her committal to Mountjoy Prison. She was then escorted from the main gate of the prison to the women's prison by a female prison officer who stated that the deceased was calm and appeared to be in good form during all stages of her committal.  On her arrival in the women's prison, two officers spent some time talking to the deceased and informed her that she could have a visit the following day.  She then changed into prison issue night-wear and appeared to be coping well with her situation.</P>
    <P>During the committal stages, the deceased was asked if she was a drug user and she said she was.  She was then advised she would be requested to give a urine sample the following morning for the purposes of undergoing a detoxification course, if she wished.  This is not an unusual occurrence, but a situation the prison authorities face on a daily basis.  The deceased did not seek any medical treatment-assistance or medication.</P>
    <P>The staff who met and spoke to her did not consider she required any treatment. She was not manifesting any signs of physical or mental stress and was brought to a single cell.  If the deceased had sought medical assistance, or the staff who were dealing with her had considered that she required this, it would have been provided.  A medical orderly was available, a doctor was on call and the services of a hospital across the road could have been availed of, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The officer who was on night duty in the women's prison on the evening in question checked the deceased on a number of occasions during the night and recalls that, during her check at 1.00 a.m. she observed her in her bed reading a magazine.  She asked the deceased, as is the practice when an offender is sitting up at that hour, if she was all <Col N="430" /> right and she said that she was fine. Shortly before 1.30 a.m. the officer again checked the cell and found the deceased hanging from the bars of the cell window.  She immediately alerted a senior officer who unlocked the cell and cut the sheet which was tied around the deceased's neck and secured to the cell bars.  Staff immediately tried to revive her and help was summoned from the main prison.  An ambulance was also summoned.  A medical orderly rushed to the women's prison and immediately commenced cardio pulmonary resuscitation. He failed to get a response but continued his efforts until the arrival of the ambulance.  The deceased was taken to the casualty unit at the Mater Hospital where she was pronounced dead at 2.5 a.m.</P>
    <P>The tragic death of this young woman will be the subject of an inquest in accordance with normal practice.  The circumstances of the death have also been examined by the suicide awareness group in Mountjoy Prison.  The Governor has advised that he has examined the circumstances surrounding the death and is satisfied, as indeed the Minister is, that the staff made every effort they could to help the deceased cope with her first experience of prison. The Minister is also satisfied that nothing more could have been done to prevent this tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>Strenuous efforts are made by the prison authorities to identify offenders who may be at risk and, where such offenders are identified, they are given special attention by prison staff with the specific objective of minimising the risk of self-injury.  Offenders whose behaviour suggests that they have psychiatric problems or that they might make an attempt at committing suicide are referred to consultant psychiatrists who visit the prisons regularly and, if the psychiatrist considers it necessary they are transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, for the necessary treatment.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is satisfied that all concerned are fully aware of the need to be vigilant in this area, it has to be <Col N="431" /> accepted that it will never be possible to identify every possible potential suicide victim or to eliminate every possible avenue or self-injury.  However, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is determined to take his or her life, and not infrequently there is not prior warning of any such intent, the scope for prevention is limited.  The Advisory Group on Prison Deaths acknowledged in chapter 4 of its report, published in August 1991, it has to be accepted that if a person is sufficiently determined to take his or her own life it is virtually impossible to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the Minister has established a national steering group under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor to oversee the local suicide awareness groups in the various institutions.  The group will include in its membership some of the most experienced representatives of prison management and staff and medical practitioners who are now involved in prisons management.</P>
    <P>The group will be assigned the task of reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths published in 1991.  The group will also provide a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and disseminating significant findings or lessons learned throughout the prison system.  Trends in prison suicide in other countries and their prevention will also be monitored. I join the Minister in extending sympathy to the family, relations and friends of the deceased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister of State in expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased who died in the custody of the State.  I thank him for his response which was more comprehensive than that which I received on the Adjournment Debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are procedures in place for identifying and monitoring prisoners at special risk and, as stated by the Minister of State, such offenders are usually <Col N="432" /> placed under special observation.  Is he aware that, according to the report of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths, remand prisoners are statistically a greater suicide risk than sentenced prisoners and the risk increases significantly if they are drug addicts or first time prisoners, as was the case with this person? Was this prisoner identified by the reception process as being at special risk and, if not, why?  She presented with the various criteria associated with special risk prisoners.  Was the elaborate reception procedure for identifying and monitoring special risk prisoners followed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained at some length that none of the prison staff had reason to believe this prisoner was at risk of attempting to take her life.  All the procedures were followed.  The people involved have a great deal of experience in identifying prisoners at risk but there was no indication that this prisoner was at risk.  It was a shock to everyone when she took her life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that, under the recommendations of the prison deaths report, this person would have been in the special risk category because she was on remand, a drug addict and a first time prisoner?  Despite the subjective observations of the prison staff, will the Minister of State accept that under those three objective criteria she ought to have been placed in that category?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State did not answer my question.  Was she identified as a special risk prisoner?  If so, she should have been observed every 15 minutes.  I conclude from his response that she was not monitored every 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that this matter will be the subject of an inquest.  Is he aware that under the Coroners Act an inquest is confined to a determination of when, how and where a person died and does not inquire into the circumstances of the death?  When will the inquest be held?  Is he aware that only one of the prison deaths which took place in 1995 has been the subject of an inquest?  Why is there a delay in holding such inquests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy gives notice of the specific questions she has asked on when the inquest will be held and the reason for delays in inquests either the Minister for Justice or I will be happy to reply to them.  As regards the prison authorities, both the Minister and I are satisfied they did all that was required of them.  Every step necessary was taken but despite that, unfortunately, the prisoner took her life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an elaborate strategy in place for the prevention of suicides in prisons, but unless there is to be a total denial of all personal privacy to all prisoners at all times, the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be precluded, no more than they can be precluded in the wider community. Some 50 of the 57 suicide prevention recommendations made by the advisory group on prison deaths have been implemented or are in the course of implementation.  The ones which remain to be implemented include the provision of a committal assessment centre and a new female prison designed to meet the specific needs of women prisoners, with a level of services appropriate to them. These remaining recommendations are more long-term in nature, a fact acknowledged by the advisory group. The recommendations will be implemented in the context of the overall development of the prison system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Minister for Justice nor I, nor any officials of her Department or persons acting on her behalf, issued any directive or advice to the Garda Síochána concerning the investigation and press statements made by the Garda authorities following the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the shooting of Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan.  There were, of course, the usual contacts between the Department and the Garda authorities for the purpose of obtaining information relating to the attack on the two gardaí and the progress of the ongoing Garda investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that I extend my deepest sympathy on this occasion to the family of the late Detective Garda McCabe, to his relatives, friends and the Garda Síochána. The attack on the gardaí, leading to the murder of one of them, is abhorred by everybody.  It represents an attack on the democratic institutions of the State. I extend my best wishes to Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan for his continued improvement and wish him a very speedy recovery.  In the course of the usual contacts between the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities, was mention made of the fact that they should dilute their earlier view that the Provisional IRA may have been involved in the Adare atrocity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>No mention was made of the word &ldquo;dilute&rdquo;.  The Government has worked tirelessly and in good faith in its efforts to bring about a renewed IRA ceasefire in the interests of ensuring a <Col N="436" /> lasting peace.  Those familiar with the consistent condemnation by members of the Government of the death and destruction perpetrated by the Provisional IRA in the bombings at Canary Wharf and other locations in Britain, including the most recent one, since the ending of the IRA ceasefire on 9 February will be in no doubt as to the readiness of the Taoiseach and Ministers, at the earliest possible time, to put responsibility for the murderous attack on the Garda escort at Adare firmly where it should lie.  The attack was immediately condemned by the Government and there was no equivocation about putting responsibility for it on the shoulders of the Provisional IRA as soon as the Government was in a position to do so.  I remind the Deputy that even before the Government was given a conclusive view that the Provisional IRA was responsible, it was foremost in its criticism of the failure of Sinn Féin to condemn the attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On 7 June 1996 a Garda press conference was held on this matter and it appeared to those present, and subsequently to the general public, that there had been a dilution of the original version in that the gardaí at the press conference were not as forthcoming in laying blame as they had been earlier.  In that context why did the Minister for Health state on 9 June 1996 that the Garda authorities were diluting their original theory about the involvement of the Provisional IRA?  Would these two factors not indicate a view contrary to that which the Minister has outlined to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I must challenge the Deputy in his assertion that the Minister for Health used the word &ldquo;diluting&rdquo;. From where did the Deputy get that information?  That word was used in questions about the incident in Adare and in earlier questions the word &ldquo;cover-up&rdquo; was used.  Is there to be a repetition of these words?  The comments by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, were based on contacts he had with my <Col N="437" /> Department on the evening prior to and the morning of his radio interview.  The information available to the Department at that time from the Garda authorities was that whatever about suspicions, their formal position was that they were keeping an open mind on the issue of responsibility.  The Minister made that very clear in his interview. The Department was also advised by the Garda authorities that inquiries had widened outside the Munster area.</P>
      <P>The Minister wishes to remind Deputies there is an ongoing investigation in this case and it would not be appropriate to provide any further detail on the exact lines of investigation that may be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Minister of State's reply, will he accept that the Minister for Health should not have stated that the Garda was investigating other options since it would appear from his reply that there never was any question of the Garda having informed the Department that it was investigating other options, merely that it was keeping an open mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I recall correctly, the Minister for Health was invited on to the programme to deal with newspaper reports that contact had been made by civil servants, on the instructions of their Departments with Garda Headquarters to play down the IRA involvement.  When the Minister, Deputy Noonan, rejected those allegations, why did he then say the Garda was widening the scope of the investigation and examining other possibilities? What was the basis for making that statement other than to play down the implication of IRA involvement in the murder?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no attempt on the part of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Justice or anyone else involved to play down IRA involvement.  It should be fully understood by Members of this House and by the public that the Government does not have any time for the activities of the IRA and would not be party to playing down its involvement in this murder. The Minister for Justice and the Garda must examine all possibilities.  As I have already said, the interview given by Minister Noonan was balanced.</P>

      <P>Was a telephone call made by officials of the Department of Justice at lunch time on Friday, 7 June 1996 to Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park?  In the course of that telephone call, did an official or officials of the Department of Justice suggest to the Garda Síochána that it should hold back on the line that the Provisional IRA was responsible for the murder? That claim has been widely reported and I would appreciate the Minister of State's comments on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

Perhaps the Deputy would be kind enough to supply me with the details of that alleged telephone call so that I can make further inquiries.  Regardless of any allegations that are made, the Deputy can take it for granted there was no attempt by this Government to dilute &mdash; to use the Deputy's word &mdash; the responsibility of the IRA.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has now disavowed in trenchant terms the interview given by Minister Noonan.  I put it to him, therefore, that it would be entirely inappropriate and incorrect for any member of the Government, any official acting on behalf of the Government or any individual acting at the behest of any individual in the Government, or the Government collectively, to attempt to <Col N="439" /> interfere with the day to day operations of the Garda Síochána.

I have not disavowed the Minister for Health; I defended him and said he gave a balanced interview.  I resent the suggestion that the Department of Justice would attempt to interfere with the responsibilities of the Garda.  On occasions we are urged to do that but the Department of Justice and the Garda have their own responsibilities.  The Garda is responsible for this investigation and the Department of Justice has not interfered with that investigation.  The Garda is aware it has the wholehearted support of the Minister for Justice, the Department and myself in its efforts to apprehend and bring to justice the people responsible for this dastardly act.  I resent any suggestion that the Minister, myself or anyone in the Department of Justice would take action that would detract from those efforts in any way.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has trenchantly denied that Government sources or civil servants made any contact with the Garda to seek to play down IRA involvement in this murder. In the light of that statement, which I accept, how does the Minister of State explain the reason the Garda Commissioner felt it necessary to make a very unusual public statement that the Garda was absolutely certain the IRA was involved in the murder?  Is he saying there was no relationship between that statement and the report that <Col N="440" /> Government sources were trying to play down IRA involvement in the murder?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 38 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, on 19 July 1995 the Government approved a series of measures to improve law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem and related matters.  One of the measures required that a joint review be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda authorities of certain recommendations of the Law <Col N="441" /> Reform Commission as regards co-operation between the two bodies.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference given to the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda &mdash; based on the recommendations contained in the 1991 Law Reform Commission's report on the Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime &mdash; were: (i) &ldquo;That the existing tax laws should be enforced with vigour against drug dealers, handlers of stolen goods, or others obtaining a living from crime. The powers given in various Finance Acts particularly in sections 18 and 19 of the Finance Act, 1983 (which extends Revenue powers to the chargeability of profits or gains arising from unlawful sources or activities) should be employed as extensively as possible&rdquo;, and (ii) &ldquo;There should be greater mutual transfer of information between Revenue and the Garda to assist the Garda in confiscating the proceeds of crime, and to assist Revenue in recovering arrears of tax from the criminals concerned or to penalise them for non-compliance with the Revenue's lawful requirements.</P>
    <P>A report of the review was submitted to Government earlier this month.  The Government has decided, following consideration of the report, that further consultations are to take place between the agencies concerned, their parent Departments and the Office of the Attorney General, and that a supplementary report be submitted to Government next month.  The Deputies will appreciate that I can make no further comment pending the compilation, and the Government's consideration, of that supplementary report.  I am fully aware of the need to ensure that agencies such as An Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and the Customs and Excise Service must work together to target known major criminals.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of a drugs enforcement agency, a special report on drugs law enforcement drawn up by the Department of Justice in 1994 concluded that, given the existence of a <Col N="442" /> national police force and a national customs service in Ireland, the likely effect of introducing a DEA-type agency would be to complicate and fragment the drugs law enforcement response. Furthermore, if a DEA-type agency was established, operating alongside a national police force and customs service, there was a danger that there could be a weakening in the priority given to drugs law enforcement work by the police force in day-to-day policing.  The report concluded that the aim of achieving greater co-operation between the existing law enforcement agencies would be best served by maximising the effectiveness of co-operation and coordination between the agencies concerned. My predecessor accepted this conclusion and I also agree with it.</P>
    <P>With regard to co-operation between the Garda and the Customs and Excise Service &mdash; a part of the office of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; a memorandum of understanding was recently signed by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioner. The memorandum was also endorsed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.  This memorandum, among other things, will help to resolve any difficulties that may have arisen in the past and provides for the establishment &mdash; for specific operations &mdash; of a joint task force comprising representatives of the Garda, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service, as required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the level of public disillusionment about the tackling of drug dealers by the Revenue Commissioners and that at a recent meeting of the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security an official from the Revenue Commissioners was unable to cite even one prosecution against a suspected drug dealer for tax evasion? Will he acknowledge, as a logical consequence of this, that the time has come for a co-ordinated effort by the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, the Naval Service and the Customs and <Col N="443" /> Excise Service with a view to tackling drug dealers?  Will he accept that there is a considerable level of public cynicism about the fact that people with apparently considerable wealth and no ostensible means of income never appear to be investigated or audited by the Revenue Commissioners, whereas ordinary taxpayers are, and that the time has come for suspected drug dealers to be investigated and prosecuted?  The best way of achieving the objectives I have outlined is to establish a national drugs enforcement agency, not in an effort to complicate or fragment the fight against drug dealing but rather to ensure a coherent and united assault on the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used phrases such as &ldquo;public disillusionment&rdquo; and &ldquo;public cynicism&rdquo;.  I have previously drawn attention to his tendency to exaggerate matters, but I accept that there is public concern about the drug problem. The Government shares this concern and it is not satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to deal with the problem. This is why last July the Government announced a large number of measures to deal with the drug problem, including the memorandum of understanding between the Garda and the Customs and Excuse Service; the setting up of the joint task force; the introduction of legislative changes &mdash; for example, the power to detain people for seven days, search warrants etc.; the establishment of the Garda national drugs unit under the command of Chief Superintendent Kevin Carthy; the reconstitution of the national co-ordinating committee and the establishment of two new sub-committees under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Brian O'Shea; the review of dance-pub licences; the treatment of drugs; the review by the Garda and Revenue Commissioners of the Law Reform Commission recommendations regarding co-operation between the two agencies and the granting of additional powers to <Col N="444" /> Naval Service personnel.  The Government is implementing these measures at present.</P>
      <P>We have introduced measures to seize the ill-gotten assets of those involved in drug trafficking.  The Deputy will be aware of the anti money laundering measures contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  The Minister made a commencement order which brought sections 32 and 57 of that Act into operation on 2 May last.  These sections require banks and other financial bodies to carry out identification checks to prevent money laundering and to report to the Garda Síochána in cases where they suspect laundering has taken place in relation to their business. They also supplement other provisions in the 1994 Act, particularly the money laundering offence and the power to confiscate criminal proceeds and to obtain restraint orders to seize and freeze suspected criminal assets.  These provisions came into force on 14 November 1994.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the past 12 months 300 reports of suspect money transactions have been made to the Garda fraud unit by financial institutions and these are being investigated. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind about the Government's determination to do everything possible to confiscate crime related income.  This will be a slow process but the Government is determined that it will be successful in time.</P>

      <P>I wish to remind the Minister of State that legislative provisions, in so far as they exist, on money laundering, the freezing of assets etc. are contained in an Act introduced by Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn when she was Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister of State that, in the fight against the drugs problem here, with the sole exception of the Minister's Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill &mdash; a poorly watered down version of Part I of the Fianna Fáil's Misuse of Drugs Bill &mdash; the <Col N="445" /> Government has presided over a legislative drought since assuming office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>How could I forget Fianna Fáil's involvement in the 1994 Act, about which we were reminded on numerous occasions?  The fact is that it is this Government that is implementing its provisions.  The Deputy correctly asserted, that it is not as if this drugs problem first arose when this Government took office, it had been there and growing.  Yet we see how little the previous Administration did about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister dealt at length with the need for co-operation between the various agencies, Garda, Naval and Customs services, with which I agree.  In that context, and in view of the fact that evidence was given to the Committee of Public Accounts that Customs officials were not made aware of the major drugs operation at Urlingford until after the event, how does that augur for the supposed, much needed co-operation in the case of such operations?  Can he say when the memorandum of understanding was signed, whether before or after Urlingford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the record of the State to date has been one of very evident failure to deal effectively with the drugs problem, that a new strategy is <Col N="446" /> required?  Does he agree that the problem is that each of the agencies to which he referred is very protective of its independence which militates against an effective co-ordinated approach; that what is required is a multi-agency, special unit to target the drugs barons who have remained untouched to date? Does he agree that that is the only effective way in which action can be co-ordinated against the main drugs dealers? Will he respond to the suggested establishment of a special unit comprising the Garda, Revenue Commissioners, officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Customs whose sole task will be to target the drugs barons?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Donnell, I do not intend to revert to the Urlingford incident, which was raised on numerous occasions in this House and explanations furnished.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gregory, that the record is not good enough.  This Government knows that things are not as good as they ought to be, it is not blind to what is happening on the streets or to the problems to which he referred today and on previous occasions.  I have always found it useful to listen to his suggestions.  If he tables a question on his specific proposal, the Minister or I will be only too pleased to reply.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I had been referring to some points raised by IBEC.  Its central message is that this legislation should not place additional requirements on management. It refers to depositing agreements in the Companies Registration Office and claims that was never intended.  Will the Minister comment on IBEC's position on that matter?</P>
      <P>I empathise with IBEC's view on confidentiality. It is concerned that if criteria are laid down on the balance between the value of sharing and the risk of disclosure of information, it would be a dangerous area on which to legislate.  I agree with its view that confidentiality is a crucial commercial consideration and that to add a confusing criterion would show a clear lack of appreciation of the realities of business. Absolute clarity is required.  I support this legislation on the basis of partnership, but we should be vigilant about including any provision which would give rise to confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share IBEC's concern about triggering the mechanisms of the directive. While I was Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs I was conscious that some countries had a poor record in implementing EU directives while others had a good one. At that time there was a good deal of ground to be made up here and that is still the case.  Of the countries in the European economic area we are the 17th to give effect to the EU Directive on Information and Consultation.  I <Col N="560" /> share IBEC's view that at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference the Government should insist that countries failing to comply with the timetable for implementing the directive should be dealt with in the first instance and that its mechanisms should not be triggered in complaint countries until others have transposed it into national law.  I am concerned that some countries, which I will not name, may fall behind.  The Minister of State should make this a central issue at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Irish employee representatives of a company to a forum or works council will report back to Irish employees of that company on its activities.  That provision was not included in the Bill as originally drafted and I welcome its inclusion as clarity is vital.  The provision adds a new dimension to the Bill and is an improvement.</P>
    <P>It is important to take account of the United Kingdom's position.  I hope its companies with a subsidiary in Ireland and in another EU member state will choose Ireland as a headquarters for its works council.  In discussing this legislation, I note from remarks by journalists and commentators that Ireland is considered the most corporate friendly regime.  According to experts, Germany imposes the most severe penalties which illustrates that the Minister of State struck the right balance in introducing this legislation.  What does she intend to do to ensure that as many multinationals as possible locate their works council here?  That would involve 30 to 50 people coming here once a year and would have implications for our economy. Our approach to social partnership, and my party's commitment to it, indicates our view on that approach to industrial relations.  We can make a strong case for attracting multinationals to use this country as the headquarters for their works councils.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about an incident concerning Pepsi Co. multinational which was reported recently in the newspapers and of which the Minister is aware.  The International Food <Col N="561" /> Workers' Association alleged that employee representatives of Pepsi Co. came to Ireland for a meeting at the K Club at which some of them were told their return air tickets would not be released until a document was signed by all 21 representatives.  The meeting was at Special Negotiating Body level and had not reached the level of agreeing a works council.  Employee representatives were allegedly told they would not be able to leave the country until an agreement was signed.  The management of the company denied that, but it is important that the Minister of State should investigate the allegation and, if true, she should make it clear that such a measure is unacceptable.  If the allegations are true, it highlights that clear structures are required on which full agreement must be reached.</P>
    <P>The essence of this debate relates to social partnership.  Through it the trade union movement has committed itself to move from traditional models of industrial relations, similar to the British model followed here in the distant past. Since I was elected to the House in the late 1980s we have moved from conflict to consensus and from confrontation to negotiation, an important development in recent times.  That approach to industrial relations should be extended to EU level.  We have seen that in Germany, Holland and Scandinavian countries and recently here, where at national level we have radically moved forward in terms of openness and partnership in regard to the public sector, including many semi-State companies.  A gap must be bridged in regard to indigenous industry and that can be done by way of dialogue between the social partners.</P>
    <P>It must be underlined that the Irish economic miracle has been based, to a large degree, on consensus at national level and we should not ignore the vital role played by the trade union movement in recent times.  I have concerns about the Government's commitment to a new agreement, particularly that of the Taoiseach, and I hope that reservation will be noted.  We must build broad consensus at EU level and we <Col N="562" /> should not be afraid to build it at enterprise level here.  We should take up that challenge.</P>
    <P>The European Commission and our Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, are involved in preparing further measures which will allow for local consultation in European companies with more than 50 employees.  That is not to be feared or seen as an intrusion.  We have talked across party lines about openness and transparency at parliamentary level. What is wrong with providing for the same degree of openness, transparency, consultation and imparting information at company level?  Are employees to be seen as second class citizens to accommodate some type of right wing economics? That is not the right approach. There is an intelligent and progressive movement, especially in the Irish economy, representing major trade unions. In my short period as Labour Affairs spokesperson I have encountered this movement in many areas.</P>
    <P>Many representatives of the trade union movement have described this as a correct first step, with more work to be done.  This is the right approach and the Government in which the Minister of State and I participated developed this further.  It is questionable if this Government can continue it, but my party and I are committed to the idea of social partnership at all levels in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This directive is the result of 25 years' negotiation and it is time to conclude it. Employers may have concerns with which we will deal on Committee Stage. They should see information and consultation rights as a social investment. This is the most sensible and practical way to consider it, rather than looking at it as an intrusion or something to be afraid of.  They should rise to the challenge and participate in it.  From my involvement as spokesperson on Labour Affairs there is a strong, progressive movement in the trade union sector which sees that the key way forward is involvement and inclusiveness.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for introducing this Bill.  I understand she may <Col N="563" /> wish to take all Stages today and perhaps we can discuss this when everybody has contributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is a product of the social charter produced in 1989 and subsequently enshrined in the social Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.  It will affect 271 multi-national companies in Ireland. Although Ireland has only 0.5 per cent of the labour market in Europe it will be represented on 25 per cent of the works councils because of our high dependency on multi-national companies.</P>
      <P>Anybody who followed the recent dispute at Packard Electric will be sensitive to how employees are informed and consulted on matters relating to their employment.  In this instance employees were informed on the main evening news at 9 o'clock that they would lose their jobs.  If there is any way not to do business and to be sensitive to the concerns of employees it is to make them aware of fundamental decisions with regard to their work through news or media reports.  If this legislation had been in place the only good thing about it would have been that the employees would have been consulted differently, although they would have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to be against the concept of partnership as any successful business or endeavour must work on that basis.  The most successful companies have a highly motivated labour force.  Many American companies are not unionised, yet they have highly motivated labour forces because the managements realise that the key to success is to have workers involved, to consult them and have them motivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competitive factors must be considered with regard to rates of pay. Companies must be profitable if they are to succeed.  There are, however, many other fringe benefits of the social kind which are commonplace in large companies and which employers realise benefit the company.  By helping the <Col N="564" /> employee they are helping the enterprise to grow and succeed.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 we have all fostered the notion of partnership.  The PNR, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the PESP, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and the current programme, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> have all been based on the fundamental premise that we must work in partnership, that the main social employers, the main social partners, employers, trade unions, government or whatever, must work in consultation and partnership with each other.</P>
    <P>My main problem with social partnership is that if it is really to be a social partnership it must be inclusive.  While the partnership in place in this economy has been successful in ensuring industrial peace, we have paid a high price for it and have not succeeded in dealing with the high level of unemployment.  If we are to have a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and genuine social partnership we must widen the ambit of that partnership and ensure that key sectors of the economy are not excluded from participating in it because, if they are, it is not a genuine social partnership.  I am especially concerned that the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed is not represented when social partnership deals are negotiated.</P>
    <P>This measure will apply to 271 companies. It also applies to all companies in Europe with 1,000 employees and who employ at least 150 in two member states.  However, the legislation will not apply to the UK, which obtained an optout from the social charter.  This means that it does not apply in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  The other economy with which we share this island, Northern Ireland, will not have the impediments that are imposed through this legislation.</P>
    <P>Europe has brought enormous benefits to all its member states and citizens, but Europe's biggest failure has been its incapacity to deal with the high level of <Col N="565" /> unemployment in the European economy. Some 17 million people are currently unemployed in Europe, the population equivalent of four smaller member states.  If Europe is to complete on the same basis as many of the other trading blocs such as Japan, the US, many of the Asian Pacific countries, New Zealand or Australia, it must deal with the high level of regulation in the European economy which is acting as a barrier and an impediment to enterprise and job creation.</P>
    <P>In the context of this legislation, it is worth considering the comparative unemployment figures between some European countries and other areas.  In Ireland the official level of unemployment is 13.5 per cent, it is over 13 per cent in Belgium, just 12 per cent in France and 11 per cent in Germany. However, in the US it is 5.5 per cent, 3.1 per cent in Japan, 6 per cent in New Zealand and under 9 per cent in Australia. If Europe is not to continue to be the sick man in terms of trading blocs participating in the global economy, as recently described by my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, it must become less regulated, freer and more competitive if it is to generate the kind of job opportunities for its citizens we all wish to see.</P>
    <P>Good as works councils may be, they will not benefit the unemployed. Although the workers in Packard Electric learnt of the loss of their employment in an insensitive, harsh and cruel way, the existence of workers' councils might have ensured the message was delivered in a more sensitive and reasonable way.  It would not have saved the jobs because that plant had become uncompetitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the plant in Coventry and other parts of Europe.  Of a total pay bill of £15.5 million for the last full year of production in 1994, £5.5 million went to the Government in tax and PRSI, which is 35 per cent.  Every worker taking home £160 cost the employer £232.  There was a gap of £72 between what the worker took home and the cost to the employer, which was <Col N="566" /> made up in taxes and PRSI &mdash; penal and cruel levels of tax.</P>
    <P>If we are to generate additional job opportunities, provide more employment possibilities and end social exclusion, the greatest poverty fighter of all is a job.  People excluded from participation in the economic development of their country and community end up isolated and marginalised.  They lose their dignity and self respect.  Most social conversation begins with work and what one does.  Too many people &mdash; 285,000 &mdash; cannot answer those questions. They are often embarrassed, isolated and made to feel second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>When we approach any legislation on enterprise and employment, we must ensure that we use our critical faculties and examine the effect it will have on this area.  When the IDA's competitors in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Britain go out to attract mobile investment into those countries they will have one advantage over the Republic of Ireland.  This legislation will not be an impediment.</P>
    <P>Many may say it is not a major impediment, but it is often small things that affect key decisions.  Uncertainty is the enemy of investment, and anything that adds an extra layer of bureaucracy or an extra burden becomes a disadvantage and a barrier to employment.  That is one of my concerns about this Bill. It says much about this legislation that many companies are already eagerly trying to establish procedures that will exempt them from having to comply with the statutory obligations that will be imposed under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Companies are worried about what is called the institutionalisation of consultation. It will involve expense.  There will also be difficulties and Deputy Kitt dealt with some of them.  One is the issue of confidentiality.  In the world of business and investment confidentiality is crucial.  Strategic development and planning very much depend on being able to keep one's cards close to one's chest.  If a company is about to merge with another company or to engage in a <Col N="567" /> take-over bid and information about that gets into the wrong hands it can cause major problems for the strategic development of the company.  We are talking here about large companies, transnational corporations.  Investment is mobile.  We saw that in the case of Packard Electric and the very many other decisions that were made.  In a matter of minutes companies can make decisions that affect thousands of workers.  We must ensure that we have procedures in place that protect workers but that mainly protect the enterprise and employment.  That has to be our concern.</P>
    <P>It is not a fact that only companies that are unionised look after their workers well.  Many of the American corporations have located in Ireland. We have 400 American multinational companies in Ireland and this country is the single greatest success story for multinational investment from the United States.  Although we are a small country we have one third of the investment in some key sectors, and the reason we have is mainly because of our very low level of corporation profits tax on manufacturing enterprises.  Last year, for example, the Irish subsidiaries of multinational companies made pre-tax profits of £5 billion.  On that they paid just over £450 million in corporation profits tax.  Had they been paying corporation profits tax at the European norm, which is between 30 per cent and 40 per cent &mdash; in Germany it is more than 40 per cent &mdash; they would have paid an extra £1 billion in corporation profits tax.  That is the key reason for industries investing here.  There are other factors, for example, the skill of our workforce, the fact that we speak English, the quality of life in Ireland. All of these matters affect the decision of so many American multinationals to locate here.  The single biggest factor is the low level of corporation profits tax on manufacturing enterprises.</P>
    <P>I make that point because it shows that where an advantage is provided the <Col N="568" /> economy gains enormously and employment opportunities are created.  Thousands of our citizens work in those enterprises simply because the decision was made to locate the enterprise in this economy, and that decision was made on the basis of the tax regime as it affected corporation profits tax. Equally, many companies may make a decision not to locate in Ireland if barriers are put in their way.  It is not in Ireland's national interest to be at the top of the queue in Europe to rush for more regulation, more legislation, more intervention in the market.  Because of our peripherality and the small size of our market, we have many disadvantages when it comes to attracting investment. We have to maximise the advantages and not to rush to put impediments in the way.  The IDA's competitors in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Britain will be able to tell foreign multinational companies that if they locate in their countries this legislation will not be imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the enormous costs this will involve and which must be carried by the enterprise.  These include the cost of establishing the negotiating team to negotiate the terms on which the works council or forum will be established, the cost of travelling to and establishing meetings &mdash; we are talking about transnational operations, and of providing for employees who will be absent because they have to attend works councils.  Those costs may seem small to us.  We think of multinational companies as being big and rich.  They are big but they operate within very tight margins.  The more barriers we put in their way the less competitive they will become, and the more non-competitive they become the more likely they will be to shy away from countries like Ireland.  I am not suggesting that any company will leave Ireland because we are transposing this legislation into Irish law, but in the context of new investment into Ireland this legislation will go down as a liability on the balance sheet when companies are weighing up whether or not to invest here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The first priority of politicians in this House, of Governments, and of those who are interested in the development of this economy has to be to tackle unemployment.  Everything we do, particularly the way we approach legislation that comes from Europe, will have to be looked at with the blinkered eyes that are often necessary if we are to put in place the kind of radical measures that are necessary to deal with unemployment. We are constantly told that the economy is performing well.  As far as the fundamentals are concerned it is. We have a high level of growth and low interest rates, mainly because the German economy is in such a bad state, leading to low interest rates throughout Europe generally.  We have low inflation.  We have much in our favour, but the one thing we have not managed to do is to translate that growth, that performance in terms of the fundamentals, into new job opportunities for our workforce.  That is a failure on our part and on the part of successive Governments. The reason growth has not been translated into jobs is that it is a jobless growth.  Enterprise, exports and endeavours are growing but with fewer people. That is a reflection on much of our employment legislation.  It is particularly a reflection on our system of high taxation on work.</P>
    <P>When I look at this legislation I wonder whether it is necessary and whether it will do much good.  Where companies are forced, through statutory obligations, to do things, they have a negligible effect.  If an employer does something only because he has to, if an employee is consulted only because there is a statutory obligation on the employer to do so, the consultation is probably not worth while.  Successful companies have good consultation procedures in place for matters that affect the daily lives of their workforce.  Does it really matter to a worker somewhere in Ireland what is happening in the plant in France?  It matters if they are going to lose their jobs to the people in <Col N="570" /> France, but will they be able to stop job losses just because they have been consulted about what is happening in the French plant?  Sometimes I wonder whether we are bringing in legislation for the sake of it without really examining the benefits.  I doubt very much that enormous benefits will flow from this.  It applies to only a tiny number of companies. It probably will not apply where it is needed most.  Neither will it apply to any of the indigenous Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Only some employees in Ireland will have the benefits, if there are benefits, of this legislation.  Many others will not. In the United Kingdom this legislation will not apply.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify how exactly the legislation will work in the context of the UK.  Is it the case that if a subsidiary of a multinational company is located only in the UK this will not apply, but that if there are subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, France, etc., the legislation will apply to all subsidiaries other than the ones based in the United Kingdom?  Will the Minister outline in her reply how this might work?  In 1974 a subcommittee of the employer labour conference recommended the establishment of works councils in all places of work with 25 or more employees.  Although the recommendation was made, the conference did not ratify it.  I wonder why.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has been fundamental to the economy since 1987.  It will continue.  It has been responsible social partnership in the main.  Unemployment is the most serious problem affecting the economy, contributing to a high dependency on drugs, to more pressures on the health service, to increased levels of crime and increased dependency on drugs and other addictive substances such as alcohol and so on.  If as the Forfás report suggests we halve unemployment and get the unemployment rate down to between 6 and 7 per cent, that is perhaps the lowest unemployment level as we can realistically achieve.  I believe we will not <Col N="571" /> achieve this through this Bill but we will do it, as the Forfás report so rightly says, through fewer regulations, less bureaucracy, lower taxes and more competition. We will do it only through ensuring that Ireland becomes a competitive economy in which to locate because it is encouraging of the entrepreneur and does not place impediments on those trying to create employment.</P>
    <P>It is a poor commentary on our performance as an economy that we tend to take the view that everybody else in Europe is doing it, we should be doing it.  It is interesting that when it comes to European Union labour or social legislation, Ireland is always among the first to implement it but when it comes to adhering to environmental directives under which we incur expense we are very good at looking for derogations because we know we cannot afford it. When it is as black or white as that we understand it and are good at negotiating special terms, but when the benefits or effects are less clear or somewhat confused &mdash; one does not see the negative effects of the legislation as one reads it but only when one looks at what happens in the real economy as far as jobs and enterprise are concerned &mdash; we are not so good at being able to see the negatives of European legislation from the Irish economic point of view and we are not so good at looking for a derogation.</P>
    <P>I am neither a Eurosceptic nor a Euro-enthusiast but I like to think I am a Euro-realist.  There are many things that are good about the European Union but there is a great deal wrong about it and it is losing out.  The German economy, traditionally the most successful, is becoming one of the weakest economies.  If one of the wealthiest economies, not only in Europe but in the world, cannot afford much of the social legislation it implemented, can Ireland, one of the poorer member states, afford to be first at the door when it comes to implementing much of this legislation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> I will not call a vote on this because it would be misunderstood and I am not sure it would have any great effect.  I am not certain that this legislation will bring benefits to Irish workers or that it would have done anything to save Packard Electric.  If this was a Bill about reducing tax, reducing the level of bureaucracy or cutting out some of the red tape that frustrates employers trying to operate in a real economy, it would be far more beneficial for workers, the economy and society generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked that we would go through all Stages of the Bill this evening.  Normally I would not be keen to do that because I do not think it is a good way to deal with legislation but there are no other speakers in the Chamber and if the Bill collapses we will be free for the next two and a half hours.  We might as well discuss Committee Stage as sit in our offices wondering what amendments we should table tomorrow or next week.  I will oblige, although reluctantly.</P>
    <P>I put this Bill alongside the Protection of Young People at Work Act which is already causing enormous headaches. Only recently I had a group of 17 year olds who used to work quite happily in public houses to earn pocket money. We have legislated against the opportunity they had and they could not understand it.  Sometimes we feel that unless we legislate and unless there is a statutory obligation, good cannot happen and evil cannot be stopped.  I do not subscribe to that theory.  Bad employers will be bad employers with or without this legislation.  Good employers, with or without this legislation, will motivate their staff and will see why it is so necessary to have a highly motivated workforce. I do not believe that at the end of the day it will be of enormous benefit to the workers, to the unemployed, or to entrepreneurs.  Given that Britain has opted out from this legislation and that it will not be imposed in Northern Ireland, we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage when it comes to investment. I believe we do not have the luxury to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their very constructive contributions on Second Stage.  Deputy Tom Kitt's point was that there will be more pressure for more consultative arrangements in the course of the negotiations on a new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I hope we will have constructive and fruitful negotiations because like Deputy Kitt I believe the social partnership at national level has brought us great benefits.  It has brought us industrial peace and increased investment and an ability to tackle a debt problem which was threatening our economy.  It has brought us moderate wage settlements which have not only helped secure economic growth but a much better improvement in the job intensity of that growth.  I sincerely hope it will be possible to conclude a social partnership agreement at national level.</P>
      <P>This Bill is about partnership at the level of the firm and it breaks new ground.  I hope it will mark a move from confrontation to consensus.  Deputy Kitt raised a number of specific issues.  He asked whether part-time workers would be fully involved.  The answer is yes, they will be fully involved.  Under this Bill the definition of a worker is silent in that regard so there is no discrimination against part-time workers.  The rules for chairing meetings are in the annex to the directive.  Paragraph 3 (a) and (b) of the Second Schedule sets out that management must consult employee representatives in regard to organisation of agreement and there is a requirement for agreed minutes.  If you are agreeing the organisation you are agreeing with what you have agreed and that is taken to include the chairing and secretariat arrangements and so on.  That is covered implicitly if not explicitly, as Deputy Tom Kitt mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt also raised the question of training.  Before we produced the Bill we produced a consultation paper which was widely circulated.  We had briefings last July for IDA client companies which were mainly the companies <Col N="574" /> involved.  We had briefings for IBEC and ICTU earlier this year and full presentations. We know that ICTU and IBEC are advising their constituent organisations and the specialist press has also been involved.  In addition, there will be financial assistance from the social affairs directorate, DGV, for the training of management and employee representatives.  If the Deputy is interested, we can communicate those details to him.  That is an important issue.  It would be prudent for any in house training which is required in relation to companies' procedures, balance sheets and so on to form part of any agreement negotiated by workers' representatives.  That would be a very sensible approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Kitt also raised the question of depositing agreements.  We do not have a requirement to deposit the agreements with the Companies Office or the Labour Court.  We looked at this issue and found the agreements which are concluded will have statutory effect.  It was regarded, on legal advice, that this would be a redundant provision which could add to the bureaucracy about which Deputy Harney is rightly concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about the information provision.  The provision does not specify striking a balance.  It is envisaged, for example, that we will look for an information commissioner to be appointed under the Freedom of Information Bill in relation to arbitrating disputes about confidential information. The information commissioner will do this job in the semi-State companies, which are included under the Bill.  It is desirable to have the same system for all companies rather than applying different rules under two Acts to the area of commercially sensitive information. I hope to bring that legislation through the House in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In regard to timing, our intention is for this Bill to come into effect on 22 September 1996, in accordance with the directive.  Deputy Harney was concerned that if some countries did not meet the requirement they would be left <Col N="575" /> in a limbo, and asked if we would take that issue up at the Intergovernmental Conference.  We understand all the other countries are also on schedule to implement legislation by 22 September. It is very desirable, obviously, for every country to implement its legislation at the same time.  There have been negotiations in the working group in Europe, which is meeting again on 28 June.</P>
    <P>We felt it was very important that there be a requirement to report back to employees.  Deputy Tom Kitt has supported me on that.  There would be no point in a workforce electing representatives who would simply go to Brussels or Hamburg, or wherever the company headquarters are, and would not provide feedback.  This is not meaningful consultation.</P>
    <P>I am anxious for us to maximise the number of companies which choose Ireland as their base.  A number of American companies are interested in choosing Ireland, not only because we have designed good quality legislation which is easy for both sides to operate, but also because we speak English, which makes us a very user friendly place for Americans.  We have had a great deal of discussions with various companies to encourage them to set up here because, as Deputy Tom Kitt said, it is very good business for us.</P>
    <P>The Deputy repeated allegations which I have read in relation to Pepsi Co. I know the union concerned, the Food Workers' Union, is following them up.  If those allegations stand up, they illustrate an extremely serious situation about which we will be most concerned. As a result of my concern to avoid shoddy pre directive agreements, I included the provision that agreements have to be agreed with the workers concerned. We do not want the wool to be pulled over people's eyes or any suggestion that improper pressure is being applied.  That provision was included as a safeguard to ensure genuine agreements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> There is a role for worker representatives in negotiating pre directive agreements. They cannot be behind the door in this regard.  In-house representatives in non-union companies and union representatives have a job to do in ensuring the quality of agreements.  We have provided mechanisms which allow for that element of quality control, which I know has been a concern of Congress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the trade unions are investigating that issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get any more information on it, we will regard it extremely seriously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney rightly pointed out that we agreed to this legislation under the social Protocol.  Sadly, Britain is still outside that agreement, which is a matter of great regret.  I look forward to a day when a future British Government signs up to the social charter and the social Protocol, and we can have a Europe of 15 member states pulling together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney also referred to jobs in Europe.  It is extremely worrying that 80 million people are unemployed.  Last weekend, I attended a tri-partite conference of governments, employers and trade unions from the 15 member states which discussed, among other matters, the Santer pact on employment and what we can do collectively to address the unemployment problem in Europe. One of the issues in the Santer pact, of which Deputy Harney is probably aware, is to simplify legislation.  It is called the Slim initiative.  This is the first European legislation on the issue of regulation.  It will be followed by parental leave legislation.  This is the only legislation being enacted on the basis of something to which only 14 member states have signed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear of the performance of the United States and countries on the Pacific rim which take different approaches to legislation, I feel it is important we do not talk ourselves down.  Our GDP grew more than 9 per <Col N="577" /> cent last year and our employment grew by more than 4 per cent.  That does not sound like an economy strangled by regulation and incapable of growing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Our unemployment also grew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and creating jobs.  Last year we out performed not only our European partners but the United States, the countries of the Pacific rim, the Asian tigers and the growing countries of eastern Europe in terms of our jobs performance.  It is important not to talk ourselves down. We do not have an economy which is sclerotic due to European regulations.</P>
      <P>Our social legislation lays down basic minima which good employers are following anyway to give their workers better conditions.  The purpose of our social legislation is, by and large, to secure protection for unrepresented and unorganised workers whom we have to represent in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  We have a duty to ensure they are not exploited. There are minimum conditions to ensure that workers and managements can work together in a spirit of co-operation, rather than workers feeling put upon, exploited or that their health and safety has been put at risk due to poor labour conditions.  I make no apology for our labour legislation.  Good employers are already doing far more than the legal minimum we laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney is worried about the institutionalisation of consultation.  It is important we ensure there is consultation throughout the economy.  We offer a very flexible framework in this Bill.  Companies have three options. They can negotiate a pre-directive agreement with their workforce or an agreement under agreed structures through a special negotiating body.  It is up to both sides to negotiate and agree the content of that agreement.  It is only in default of such an agreement or in setting up a special negotiating body that the provisions of the annexe which <Col N="578" /> lay down the forms consultation may take will come into play.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that, in developing information and consultation procedures in Irish companies, rather than laying down detailed prescriptive rules which do not necessarily apply in different kinds of companies we should look to the model of the health and safety statement where companies devise something suited to their own needs.  I would like to see workers and managements in Irish companies agreeing the information and consultation arrangements appropriate to their business in terms of its geographical spread, sector, size and so on.  That is the way to make progress and tailor solutions to the situation.  I do not think we are going too far in terms of institutionalisation in this Bill.  We are ensuring that this will happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney highlighted the difficulties in Packard but there are difficulties in other companies also.  Sadly, Packard has closed but fundamental to the problems of adjustment in those companies is a total lack of trust.  It is only by building trust between both sides that companies will be able to manage change.  The one thing of which we can be certain is that there will be change, in products, processes, markets and competition.  The ability to manage change is the key to gaining a competitive edge in the future.  This will not happen if companies lose the trust of their workforce or fail to gain it by drip feeding it with inadequate or inaccurate information or if both sides feel there is a hidden agenda.  This Bill is about building trust on both sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney is worried about breaches of confidentiality.  This will be a criminal offence under the Bill.  On Monday last I attended a seminar organised by the Department in Waterford at which workers and managements in different companies made presentations on the issue of information and consultation.  The representatives of Waterford Glass made an interesting presentation.  This was a company in crisis and one of the keys to <Col N="579" /> building trust was sharing information. When the workers finally realised that nothing was being held back they were prepared to accept the figures put on the table and engage in a process of turning the company around.  Prior to moving to this new phase of structured consultation there was a difficult and bitter dispute which lasted 14 weeks and confidential information was never released.  We can trust workers to respect confidentiality as they know their jobs depend on it.  If information is considered super-sensitive by management, the matter may be referred to an independent arbitrator.</P>
    <P>Many UK and US multinational companies are taking a positive approach to the directive's requirements.  They take the view they can use the directive to improve communication in their business. Although the UK has decided to opt out, many multinational companies with UK employees are availing of the directive's provisions.  Approximately 200 multinational companies are affected by virtue of the employment of employees in other member states apart from the UK.  Most, if not all, conclude that this means they cannot leave out their UK employees.</P>

      <P>Most of the multinational companies concerned are bringing their UK employees into the total picture, not just three-quarters, fourteen-fifteenths or sixteen-seventeenths. Instead of being regarded as restrictive it is interesting that multinational companies regard it as a plus despite the fact that they are under no <Col N="580" /> legal obligation to include their UK employees.  I could reel off lists of multinational companies, including United Biscuits, but most are doing this.</P>
      <P>In referring to 17-year olds Deputy Harney mentioned the Protection of Young Persons Act.  We decided to relax the existing law which had been in place for 18 years to allow 16 and 17-year-olds work up to 11 p.m. when they do not have to attend school the following day.  I make no apology for including a time restriction as we do not want young people falling asleep in the classroom. Deputy Kitt supported me on this point.</P>
      <P>I would have been happy to allow young people to work until midnight but was not in a position to do so because of our ILO obligations under the 1946 convention on night work which we have signed.  I raised this issue with the ILO last week because in modern circumstances the 11 p.m. curfew is too restrictive and perhaps should be extended to midnight, like Cinderella.  I would be concerned however about young girls walking home unsupervised at 1 a.m.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and young people paid to work until 11 p.m. working until 1.30 a.m. clearing up pubs without being paid.  This is exploitation.</P>
      <P>This is good legislation and a step forward. We are providing for consultation mechanisms which I hope will help to build trust in our bigger firms and ensure that Irish employees of the big multinationals operating on the European stage will receive information on what is happening at headquarters which has a bearing on their livelihoods. What happens at a subsidiary in France has a huge bearing on the financial health of the subsidiary in Ireland and whether business is switched from one to the other.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (b), line 8, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to enable the Minister to make regulations concerning the powers and procedures of arbitrators and arbitrations.  After the Bill was published a legal question arose as to whether the arbitration Acts or alternative arrangements would apply. In view of the fact that some of the detail of the arbitration Acts might not be appropriate to arbitration or deciding on issues that might arise under the Bill it has been decided to insert a new paragraph (c).  The amendment to section 21 arises from the same point.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (9), line 33, after &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which has been accepted by a majority of the workforce&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the Pepsi Co incident where a particular company decided to deal with <Col N="583" /> the special negotiating body and to have that meeting in Ireland in the K Club.  I have already referred to what happened. The Minister has assured me that what happened was unacceptable, that the trade union movement is investigating it and that she is monitoring the situation closely.  I would be anxious that the Minister would report back to me on any information she may have on this type of situation.</P>
    <P>I propose the inclusion of the words &ldquo;which has been accepted by a majority of the workforce&rdquo; to ensure that the type of situation which allegedly took place does not arise again.  We are anxious that as many multinational companies as possible will use Ireland as a headquarters for their meetings, whether a special negotiating body meeting or a works council meeting. Because of our legislation that is likely. If media reports of what happened in the case of Pepsi Co are correct, it is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment which would bring the section into line with the provisions of section 6 (7) pertaining to Article 13 agreements &mdash; pre-directive agreements.  I am concerned that in the absence of this amendment special negotiating bodies could be suspended after agreements are made which are unacceptable to the workforce.  It would avoid a repeat of the PepsiCo debacle.</P>

      <P>We in the Department considered the possibility of proposing an amendment on these lines and we obtained legal advice which was to the effect that this is implied already. The amendment seeks to amend subsection (9) which states:</P>
      <P>A Special Negotiating Body shall remain in existence for as long only as it continues to have the function of negotiating for an agreement....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>by adding the words &ldquo;which has been accepted by a majority of the workforce&rdquo;. We have been advised that this is already implied.  If I were to accept Deputy Kitt's amendment we could <Col N="584" /> have a limbo situation.  In the event of failure by the special negotiating body to reach agreement that body would remain in existence, the provisions of the annex and the mandatory agreement would come into play and the special negotiating body would be in limbo.  On the amendment proposed by Deputy Kitt, the advice of the draftsman is that it is already provided for and that a legal limbo could be created.  For those reasons I have not tabled an amendment.</P>
    <P>The functions of the special negotiating body, as provided for in section 11, include the negotiation of a written agreement, which is obviously a safeguard. Under the directive the special negotiating body has the right of acceptance of agreements and it would be <i>ultra vires</i> the directive to undercut that in any way.  Even if the amendment is not accepted, what Deputy Kitt is seeking is already implied.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that written agreements are referred to in section 11. The reason I tabled the amendment was to ensure absolute clarity in regard to the structures and to ensure there is no confusion following this legislation.  I accept the Minister sought legal advice which was to the effect that inclusion of this amendment could cause some degree of confusion.  I accept what she has told me.  There is a reference to &ldquo;a majority of the workforce&rdquo; in section 6 (7).  Will the Minister confirm if the reference to the majority workforce in my amendment is unnecessary in the context to which I referred earlier?</P>

      <P>There was no special negotiating body in Pepsi Co because we were looking at a pre-directive agreement.  Once the directive is in force the special negotiating body or the annex provisions will come into effect. <Col N="585" /> The amendment would not affect or protect pre-directive agreements.  The advice I have received is that the special negotiating body is the protection for agreements under the directive.  If any further clarification is required we can return to it on Report Stage.  That is my understanding of the legal advice.</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (1) <i>(b)</i>, line 21, to delete &ldquo;£10,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind the amendment is that the sum of £10,000 is perhaps excessive.  I mentioned earlier that Ireland is considered corporate friendly in terms of legislation.  It is also seen as a country which is trying to promote partnership.  The general thrust of the Bill is away from repressive elements in the context of Ireland potentially being used as headquarters for meetings and work councils.  Given the comparisons I made earlier between more severe measures which are in place in other countries, such as Germany, perhaps it would be prudent to delete £10,000 and substitute £5,000.  However, I have an open mind on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The offences covered by the subsection are those by a company which refuses to co-operate by letting the workers know how many employees the company has so the ball can start to roll in terms of whether the operation is covered by the Bill and the directive.  Non co-operation by a company of this scale is serious and a £5,000 fine on an operation employing 1,000 people, with 150 people each in up to three member states, is small, although, if the offence continues, the amount will increase.  I do not foresee this provision being used, but it is important it is included in the Bill.  Companies on this scale must be told they do not face Mickey Mouse fines if they do not comply with the law.  This matter involves multinational giants, not corner shops for which £10,000 is a large amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 relates to subsection (3) (b).  This refers to somebody <Col N="587" /> who discloses commercially sensitive information they receive in the course of the consultation process to a third party.  Huge sums of money could be at stake.  In reply to Deputy Harney, I said I am satisfied that it should be a criminal offence and that these procedures are adequate.  It would send the wrong signal if the level of fines was reduced. Neither amendment relates to trivial offences.  The first involves non co-operation in terms of a multinational ignoring the Bill.  Given the type of money such operations have, the penalty must be serious.  Regarding the second amendment, it is a serious offence for a worker to sell secrets to a competitor, given the amount of money which is likely to be at stake.  It would send the wrong signal to reduce the fines.  Having heard my comments, perhaps the Deputy will be disposed to agreeing with me.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important Bill.  I am very disappointed the Government is not prepared to accept Deputy Woods's Bill.  If the Minister thought the Bill needed amendment, her concerns could have been addressed on Committee Stage rather than have a further unnecessary delay.  I commend our party spokesperson, Deputy Woods, for his initiative in drafting and publishing this Bill.  In his contribution he outlined in a very constructive manner the purpose, intent and necessity for this legislation.  He used the very apt phrase, namely, the need to level the playing pitch for Irish charitable lotteries.  That viewpoint has been echoed widely by senior management and spokespersons for various charities.</P>
      <P>No justifiable reason can be put forward for the restrictions that apply to lotteries for charitable purposes. We are all conscious of the outstanding work carried out by voluntary charitable organisations, and the stranglehold on their fundraising capacities should be removed.  With the strength of the Irish and, recently established, British national lotteries, charities have more than enough competition with which to contend.  Deputy Woods outlined in detail his proposals on funding and accountability.  Every facet of the organisation of lotteries for charitable purposes is addressed in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately there is a good partnership between statutory agencies and voluntary organisations.  Voluntary organisations provide many services and such work is undertaken in every parish.  In many cases the work of statutory agencies is supplemented by voluntary <Col N="592" /> organisations and in some cases voluntary organisations are the only bodies providing much needed services.</P>
    <P>The disbursement of the national lottery surplus is far from adequate and unfair.  We all know of voluntary, social, sporting and recreational organisations that provide much-needed facilities for all age groups but receive no State assistance &mdash; their hopes for assistance were raised when the national lottery was established.  I have in mind in particular local groups operating from small community centres or social centres who have been denied the £8,000 or £10,000 grant that would constitute a major financial benefit for them and would be a major source of encouragement in their work.  Such groups consist of people who give generously of their time and effort to others.</P>
    <P>Time permits me to instance only the work of the Rehab National Training and Development Institute.  I compliment the manager of the centre in County Cavan, Mr. John Rooney, and his colleagues on the excellence of the centre there.  In early March this year I had the privilege of attending the annual certificate awards ceremony at which 49 graduates were presented with certificates from CERT, City and Guilds and the Northern Council for Further Education.  The importance of this event to the community was evident by the large attendance of students, parents, employers and representatives of statutory and voluntary organisations.  Those students graduated with the work, skills and achievements which were verified by the independent certification agencies. The activities of the institute constitute a huge industry, with 650 staff, the generation of £15 million revenue in sales and the provision of services to 2,500 people.  The work of the National Training and Development Institute is dependent on the co-operation of employers within its catchment areas. The employers I know who have taken on students of the institute have always <Col N="593" /> been satisfied with their level of competence and commitment.  The placement of students in permanent employment is a tribute to themselves, the management and employers who gave them the opportunity during their apprenticeship and the voluntary workers who give their time, year in, year out in raising substantial funding that is essential for those institutes to continue their valuable and necessary work.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the State, with its legislative powers, restricts in a very serious manner the fundraising abilities of charitable organisations, which in many instances supplement inadequate State services and, in some cases, are the sole providers of services which the public expect the State to provide.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bhille seo agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis cainte agam faoi.  Cuireann sé íontas orm go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille agus gur theip orthu Bille da gcuid féin a chur os comhair an Oireachtais. Is cúis náire dóibh an fhaillí sin.</P>
      <P>It is surprising the archaic legislation of 1956 has survived unamended for so long, particularly in view of the fact that Irish charities have lost approximately £200 million since 1987, a huge amount of money which would have had a major impact on areas in which charitable organisations provide much needed services. I reject the Government argument that comprehensive legislation can be brought forward quickly in this area. The passing of this Bill would in no way impede or undermine that intent.  It would give a financial boost to charities and improve confidence which, in view of their experience, has been seriously undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charities do vitally important work for people in need.  Much of that work is the responsibility of the State but is done probably more cost effectively by voluntary and charitable organisations. Are Government Deputies saying that they do not support the work of the Polio Fellowship, the Irish Cancer <Col N="594" /> Society, the Irish Wheelchair Association and other organisations?  I am sure that is not the case, but in rejecting this straightforward Bill that is the message that will go out from this House, and that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Last Monday night I attended a meeting in Ennis of the Clare Branch of Cerebral Palsy Ireland and as a politician I was embarrassed that the State grant to that organisation is a meagre £5,000. That money goes towards an impressive range of services, which cost infinitely more than the amount allocated.  This Bill would enable Rehab and others to give greater support to the various charitable organisations in each area.  It must be borne in mind that the Aware lottery ceased to operate this year because of competition from the national lottery.  That was a double blow to its members who have been severely affected by the provisions of the health regulations.</P>
    <P>Fundraising by other charities is also under threat, affecting services to their dependants.  There is an onus on politicians to back up words of concern with real action, and this Bill provides such an opportunity.  We are all accustomed to lectures from certain political quarters on the needs of the poor and underprivileged. Rejection of this Bill is further evidence that that is merely posturing and empty rhetoric.  Charities deserve better and we have the opportunity tonight to do something for them. It is difficult to believe that the Government is protecting the national lottery, which had sales of £303 million in 1995. Only 3.4 per cent of the proceeds go to social welfare related charities as opposed to 20 per cent in the UK. Unfortunately, the existing cap which will be removed by this Bill also involves the Garda in unnecessary administration, namely, the checking of one million cards from various charities. Obviously that burden of administration also falls on Rehab and the various lotteries and ties up some of their financial and personnel resources.  That problem must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> To make matters worse, the UK lottery is currently taking approximately £20 million per year out of our economy. The Government says it is addressing that problem in the short-term but there is little evidence of that, which makes the problem even greater.  I call on the Government to support the Bill and to take action in support of national charities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only so much money in the kitty and the recent development whereby the UK lottery is taking £20 million per year out of the funds that could be available to non-profit making charitable organisations here is a problem that must be addressed immediately.</P>
      <P>Irish charities have encountered major difficulties with the advent of the national lottery and the major prizes offered and those difficulties have been exacerbated by the advent of 1,500 outlets which sell UK lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>National charities have received a great deal of kudos for their excellent work in our society, yet that work is not being acknowledged because of impediments that have been put in place.  A £5 million decrease in moneys accruing to charities between 1988 and 1994 is testimony to that fact.  They now have only a 3 per cent share of the overall take from lotteries.</P>
      <P>Discrimination is apparent in the charitable sector.  How can charities hope to compete with a cap of £10,000 against the unlimited prize money offered in the national lottery?  We demand and expect the intervention of these charities to cater for the disadvantaged in our society, yet we are not prepared to provide some form of equality of treatment even though many of the organisations involved in what one might call &ldquo;charitable niche areas&rdquo; are performing functions that ideally should come within the remit of our social services.</P>

    <P>The action, albeit delayed, of the Government in declaring the UK lottery illegal here stands in stark contrast to its <Col N="596" /> lack of action in relation to charitable lotteries.  It leads one to the conclusion that the Government does not care a with for charities and is more concerned with amassing a major slush fund to be administered at the whim of Ministers in their endeavours to ingratiate themselves with the electorate in the run-up to a general election.  Cork is testament to this with its two Ministers of State travelling around with their cheque books in their inside pockets ready to hand out money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods is to be congratulated on introducing the Bill.  He is telling the Government that enough is enough and the existing cap on prizes, as well as the costly administrative procedures, should be removed.  Charities must be allowed to play on an even pitch and carry out the functions urgently needed by the disadvantaged in our society.</P>
      <P>Even if this Bill is passed, charitable organisations will face an uphill struggle to win back some of the market share they have lost.  By and large consumers are creatures of habit and, having moved from buying tickets from charities, it will take meaningful, resourceful and penetrating marketing on the part of charities if they are to regain the lost ground.</P>
      <P>If evidence were needed of the lure of the larger prize money, the UK lottery is the perfect example.  Through the ineptitude of an uncaring but facilitating Government, its prize money was allowed increase to £20 million in a short number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in favour of encouraging <Col N="597" /> self-help and Fianna Fáil has designed this Bill in a way that will allow charities to promote that.  It is disappointing for this side of the House to hear the Government will oppose the Bill on Second Stage rather than allow it proceed to Committee Stage where meaningful amendments could be tabled.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  I compliment Deputy Woods for bringing forward the Bill because the existing legislation is outdated.  The modifications outlined in it are necessary and I am disappointed the Government does not intend to accept it.  That is rejection for rejection's sake.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that the Bill addresses the issues that must be urgently addressed.  The Government accepts there is need for change, particularly in regard to the capping of lotteries at £10,000 per week, so why is it rejecting the Bill?  It says it intends bringing forward its own &ldquo;super&rdquo; Bill which no doubt will have all the hallmarks of advisory bodies, a three way examination of the Costello report and a measure of openness, transparency and accountability for good luck.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we need a system of registration and accounting as well as a registration authority.  Those facets are contained in the Bill yet the Government continues to express its pseudoanxieties while the voluntary charities who run lotteries must play on an uneven pitch.</P>
      <P>Following 18 months of procrastination, the UK Government is finally taking action in regard to its lottery. Where was the legal advice 18 months ago?  The legislation has not changed so what is the reason for all the procrastination? That is the problem facing charitable organisations in this country. They are being forced to play on a very uneven pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must ask whether our voluntary charities will be required to wait another year or two before the Government brings forward its legislation.  The legislation proposed by Deputy Woods <Col N="598" /> is excellent and the Government should accept it.</P>
    <P>We all agree that our voluntary charitable organisations do excellent work.  I am particularly interested in charities who work in the areas of health and disability including the polio association, the various associations dealing with mental handicap and the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  It is all very well praising those charitable organisations but we are restricting them in their ability to gather funds and continue their good work.  As the old adage says, thoughts without deeds are not much good.  These organisations need to be given a chance to raise funding.  In this regard the £10,000 limit on prizes is no longer workable and the cap should be increased.  The necessity for these organisations to inform the Garda every week about £1,000 lotteries should be done away with.  I am disappointed the Government has decided not to accept Deputy Wood's Bill which would have advanced the situation and ensured we got away from procrastination by the Government which has to think twice before it makes a decision.</P>

      <P>My colleagues have graphically depicted the grim plight in which charitable lotteries find themselves and time does not permit me to elaborate on what they have said.  Suffice it to say that the Government knows what they have said is correct, and has acknowledged as much.  Charitable lotteries are being marginalised to the extent that they control only 3 per cent of the lottery market.  The reason for this is obvious: they are hamstrung by legislation passed by this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to describe this situation as an emergency.  Their plight is desperate and urgent and needs immediate remedial action.  Apparently the Government agrees with this proposition, yet it resolutely refuses to take the necessary immediate action to resolve this emergency.  The alibi given to the House for the Government's obduracy is undoubtedly the most transparent thing we will ever get from this <Col N="599" /> so-called Government of openness, transparency and accountability.  This transparent nonsense had a familiar ring to it &mdash;&ldquo;comprehensive legislation is necessary and it will be introduced some time later this year&rdquo;.  This will happen magically seven years after the Costello Commission report.  It is also suggested that Deputy Wood's proposals or a variant of them will be contained in the legislation.  Without wishing to insult the Minister of State, I do not believe those statements.  The comprehensive legislation referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, will be passed on the recommendations of the Costello Commission which are almost seven years old.</P>

      <P>My information from the Department of Justice is that this legislation is still at a very early stage of preparation.  It is no exaggeration to say it will be some time, perhaps years, before it sees the light of day.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, not know that many small charitable lotteries will be driven out of business during this waiting period?  Is she aware of the calamitous consequences this will have for thousands of citizens, particularly the disadvantaged?  I ask these questions as the Government postures as a left leaning one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> There is no inconsistency in agreeing that the general law on charities needs to be updated and also accepting the Bill which is a short-term or stop gap measure specifically designed to save a number of organisations which have made, and continue to make, a priceless and incalculable contribution to Irish life.  Comprehensive legislation is necessary and the provisions in this Bill can be incorporated into it with any necessary amendments.  That procedure is not new &mdash; it was done in the early 1990s to save the Goodman organisation.  Yet the Government is unable to accept this minor measure which would allow several organisations which have done nothing but good for the disadvantaged to survive.</P>
    <P>When the comprehensive legislation finally appears and we come to debate it, surely we will have benefited from the experience of how a level playing pitch works.  No doubt the Government would vehemently deny that its intention is to destroy organisations like the Polio Fellowship, Rehab, the Irish Cancer Society, Hospice Homecare, the Central Remedial Clinic and countless other organisations.  However, if some of them disappear while we wait for legislation this will be a direct consequence of the Government's refusal to accept this Bill.  That will be on its conscience, but the record will show that we at least did all we could.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Woods on having introduced this Bill which allows us focus on issues which are quite serious and need to be debated.  The fact that he has provided a platform for such debate warrants commendation.  However, that is as far as I shall go in commending him.</P>
      <P>Before focusing on the provisions of the Bill, I should like to dwell on the broader scene.  The Bill can be viewed in the context of the old adage that for every complex problem there is a simple solution that does not work.  That is how I can best sum up this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this Bill is that there are unscrupulous operators who have been preying on the generosity of the Irish public, converting for their own use moneys allegedly raised for charitable causes.  The Revenue Commissioners recently estimated that there are over 6,000 charities in this country, many of them no longer active, which between them raise in excess of £330 million annually.  It is very much in the public interest that all moneys donated to charities should go to their intended <Col N="603" /> beneficiaries.  Unfortunately, that does not always happen.</P>
    <P>The legislative framework is hopelessly out of date and inadequate to protect the public who contribute so generously or the many worthy beneficiaries on whose behalf and in whose names huge funds are donated.  Over the years there has been a series of scandals. There was the recent cruel exploitation of terminally ill children, for whom moneys were allegedly being raised for hospice care, which they never received. It is only a matter of time before even greater scandals emerge.  The reputation of all charitable organisations is damaged by the scandals of the few.  It is timely to point out that controls over charities should be maintained at a reasonable level because of the actual abuse which occurred and further potential abuse.</P>
    <P>It is almost six years since the Costello Committee reported on fund-raising activities for charitable and other purposes.  The report proposed over 80 changes in controls and regulations covering such fund-raising and the manner in which proceeds are accounted for and distributed.</P>
    <P>The political scandal is that nothing whatever was done by the last two Fianna Fáil-led Governments to implement the recommendations of the Costello report.  Fortunately, this Government has taken steps to progress the issue.  Earlier this year an advisory group on charities legislation was established. Its membership is drawn from a variety of charitable organisations and its report is expected shortly.  It will then be referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to advise on the necessary legislative provisions which I hope we shall be debating in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Bill introduced by Deputy Woods must be considered.  Naturally, we would all like to support the fund-raising efforts of reputable charities such as those mentioned by Deputy Woods but placing them in open competition with the <Col N="604" /> national lottery would be disastrous. There is room for only one national lottery. The establishment of an open season by enabling every charitable cause in Ireland to establish a national lottery without any limit would do nothing whatever for those charities.  It would almost certainly wipe out the fund-raising efforts of most of them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the overall updating of the charities legislation, several measures are needed.  First is the enforcement of the ban on the sale of tickets here for the United Kingdom lottery by which we have been very badly affected.  We are quite entitled to enforce such a ban.  The precedent is the Schindler case which, in 1983, decided that the United Kingdom could prohibit the sale of German lottery tickets.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to prosecutions earlier this year which were not proceeded with.  There were some evidential problems associated with such prosecutions which have now been overcome.  The Government, quite rightly, has made it abundantly clear that henceforth anybody who engages in the sale of UK lottery tickets here will be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Second, the present limit of £10,000 weekly prize money for charitable lotteries was fixed ten years ago.  When I introduced the National Lottery Bill, 1986 that limit was only £5,000.  At that time I included a provision enabling the Minister for Justice to increase that figure for charitable lotteries.  I consider the figure of £10,000 to be too low and it should be raised to at least £25,000.  I would go even further and suggest that the Minister should engage in discussions with representatives of charitable lotteries.  I accept that charitable lotteries need to be able to compete fairly, particularly in the scratch card market.  The increased prize money to which I refer does not require legislation since I included such an enabling provision in the National Lottery Bill ten years ago.  Once a decision has been taken, all that is necessary is the introduction of a further regulation by the Minister for Justice &mdash; such as the one <Col N="605" /> page regulation introduced in 1987 when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Justice &mdash; under the national lottery prizes regulation.  There is no need for a Bill to increase the prize money.</P>
    <P>There is also a case for making charitable organisations beneficiaries to a great degree from the proceeds of the national lottery.  This year there was approximately £100 million by way of surplus from the national lottery for distribution. Apart from the specific causes mentioned in section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986 for youth, sport, art and so on, there should be a separate category, the establishment of a special charity fund into which a separate proportion of the proceeds of the national lottery should be lodged for allocation to charitable purposes.  That is the way to deal with the problem experienced in regard to Rehab and the other charitable lotteries.  We must find an answer but one that will work.  There is no point in coming up with quick fix solutions such as those mentioned in this Bill which will not work.  The type of approach I have outlined constitutes the answer to the problem I want to see resolved.  The way forward is to implement the Costello report which will deal with the broader issue of charities, which thankfully is now being dealt after many years of neglect and, second, in relation to the urgent problem encountered <i>vis-á-vis</i> charitable lotteries, to introduce the regulation to which I referred.  The proposals introduced by Deputy Woods, while affording us an opportunity to discuss the issue, do not constitute the answer to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Having raised the cap on charities twice in the course of Adjournment debates since becoming a Member of this House, I welcome this opportunity to discuss this matter in a broader sense.  Usually Adjournment debates are very limited in their scope and unless one has a specific interest in a particular issue one will not come into the Chamber to listen.  This makes it all the more important that Members of the Opposition avail of the opportunity <Col N="606" /> afforded them on Private Members' Bills to raise issues like these.  I am a great believer in strong Opposition. Someone once said to me that, having spent a little time there, one might change one's mind but I have not; I continue to believe in strong Opposition.</P>
      <P>This is the type of issue which should be brought to the fore and discussed.  I had a great deal of discussion with Deputy Woods, as Minister for Social Welfare, over a 12-month period and always found him courteous and generous with his time.  While he did not accede to my requests then, I appreciated the time he devoted to matters and the courteous was he dealt with me and my group.</P>
      <P>I cannot but refer to Deputy O'Dea's contribution during which he equated Larry Goodman with charitable organisations. Maybe he considers Larry Goodman fits into the charitable bracket, but he should not have been lumped with those organisations. Deputy O'Dea's reference to the report of the Costello committee published seven years ago was also unfortunate because he was in Government for five of those seven years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate our gaming and lotteries regulations in particular and charity fund-raising in general.  I share Deputy Woods's concern about the current capping system which, effectively, handicaps private charity lotteries.  I welcome the Minister of State's comprehensive statement last night in regard to the proposed charities legislation which is long overdue, not only since the report of the Costello committee but since 1601 with the exception of an interpretation in the 1800s.  The ceiling which currently applies to charity lotteries compounds the problems they face and that was recognised by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charities are trying to compete with the national lottery with one hand tied behind their backs.  They receive very little from lottery proceeds, over 62 per cent of which goes to the State and semi-State sectors.  They must compete with very large jackpots and massive <Col N="607" /> advertising campaigns and, as Deputy Sargent said, the campaign that rankles most concerns the lottery for tickets to board <i>The JFK II</i>.  It no harm to examine how the lotteries operate and to consider the objections raised by some people to their <i>modus operandi</i>.  That is one of the areas I would like revisited because I do not consider the lottery should invest money in that type of campaign irrespective of whether it is provided for in its advertising budget.</P>
    <P>The lottery was established on the clear understanding that the funds raised would be devoted to new projects, mainly the voluntary sector. Instead charities estimate that they have lost a massive £200 million in potential donations since the introduction of the lottery nearly ten years ago.  A certain charity in Cork, one most people do not consider a charity, which had done great work with disabled people since the fifties when the State did not, or were incapable of doing such work, is in serious difficulties today.  To suggest closing down that organisation would be akin to telling somebody in Cork that Shandon had to be demolished, and it would probably be more devastating because it caters for such a wide variety of people with all types of disabilities. Where would they go if that organisation no longer existed?  That is something about which I am very worried.</P>
    <P>Since the lottery was introduced ten years ago we have been forced to watch while the lion's share of its proceeds went to plug gaps in Exchequer spending. That has happened over the past ten year period, not only in the past 18 months or two years.</P>
    <P>I hope when addressing the cap, section 8 of the 1986 Act will also be revisited.  That section provides for unclaimed prize money to be returned to the national lottery fund after 90 days if unclaimed, to top up already extravagant jackpots.  I am not a killjoy and have not said the lottery jackpot should be restricted to £1 million.  When I hear people say they would not like to win £1 million, I am puzzled when they are <Col N="608" /> usually the first in the queue to play the Lotto.  I do not have any problem with the size of the jackpot, but I object to the unclaimed prize money going back into the fund to top up jackpots. Unclaimed prize moneys, currently estimated to be more than £4 million annually, should be diverted into a specific reserve fund from which moneys should be disbursed to charities, for example, in the chronically underfunded area of mental handicap.  If the moneys were disbursed to such charities, I do not believe a single complaint would be made by anyone who plays the lottery regularly.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Woods's initiative in putting forward this Bill.  However, the problems associated with this lottery and with charity fund-raising in general will not be solved by the proposals in it. I am sure Deputy Woods will say that is because I am in Government.  I believe in strong Opposition and we must also have good Government.  If Bills like this bring to the fore issues of concern and elicit replies to the effect that legislation will be introduced in the near future, they are worthy.  I welcome the Government's proposal to introduce a charities Bill, which will regulate the fund-raising operation of charities as a whole.  The so-called third sector is one of the fastest expanding sectors in the economy. Every time a need is identified, a voluntary organisation springs up to address it.  The contribution made by the voluntary sector to society cannot be overestimated. In many cases it is trying to plug gaps in our social services with inadequate and unreliable funding.  Therefore, it is small wonder that one cannot walk through the centre of Cork or Dublin without coming across a charity fund-raiser seeking funds for yet another good cause, and the majority of them are excellent causes.</P>
    <P>In 1989 3,790 charities were registered with the Revenue Commissioners as enjoying tax exemption status.  That figure encompasses small, locally based charities as well as international charities, such as Concern and Trócaire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Despite the huge growth in the charity sector we do not have an up to date legal definition of the term &ldquo;charity&rdquo;. The current definition of the term in Irish law has its roots in the Charitable Uses Act, 1601, which was interpreted in 1891 in the so-called Pemsel case. Members may be interested to know that the 1601 statute is rooted in William Langland's 13th century poem, &ldquo;Piers Ploughman&rdquo; which dealt with the area of alms.</P>
    <P>In effect non-governmental organisations seeking charitable status must find a niche within the index of charitable purposes incorporated in the 1601 statute, which refers to the marriage of poor maidens but not to the rehabilitation of drug users or the needs of people who are less mobile than most people.  I know it will bring a smile to the faces of most men here to recall that charity was associated with marrying off a woman who did not have a dowry.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for legislation governing the definition and management of charities and non-profit organisations as we enter the 21st century.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burton's assurance that the present cap on charitable lotteries will be changed in the context of a new legislative framework and that the regulations governing fund-raising in general will be addressed.  Nobody is in any doubt that the majority of charity fund-raisers are committed people dedicated to the aims of an organisation who tramp the streets in all weathers armed only with a small tin and a huge amount of endurance. They are brought into disrepute by a smaller number of rogue operators and deserve legislative protection.  Charities are in favour of stricter regulations in that regard and would be delighted to have the opportunity to account publicly for their activities.  It would be another opportunity to promote the good work they do in certain areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> The recommendations of the Costello committee form a useful basis for the proposed legislation.  However, some other issues regarding charities need to be addressed in this or in other legislation.  I am especially concerned at the plight of some charities who are unable to fully reclaim their back payments.  I urge the Government to take on board the suggestions made in the report entitled <i>Charitable Organisations and Value Added Tax</i> prepared for the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  The scope for action is limited, given that VAT is a Euro tax.  There is, however, room to establish a system of Exchequer funding which would match pound for pound the VAT incurred by charities in any one year.  This suggestion was first mooted by the Commission on Tax Reform in 1985 and has been endorsed by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> All of us as public representatives and people active in our communities are aware of the great efforts that charities, both local and national, make to fund-raising in order to meet a wide range of needs.  It is useful that we have the opportunity to debate some of the concerns in this area.</P>
      <P>I recognise the spirit in which the Bill has been introduced.  We are all aware of the difficulties which face charitable organisations, such as Rehab, in making prize draws viable with the current cap on prizes.  I accept the point made to me and other Members of the House by Rehab representatives that the existing arrangement initiates against them in two ways.  First, it is difficult for them to compete against the national lottery and, second, significant administrative costs are imposed upon them in complying with the existing regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> I acknowledge the good service that Deputy Woods has performed for charities by holding this debate.  I welcome not only the response by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, last night but also the work she has been doing over the past 18 months in attempting to get this sector regulated while at the same time allowing them compete on a more level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>I also recognise a significant change made to the tax regime by the Minister for Finance last year so that people can make private donations to Third World charities and have the tax equivalent of such donations contributed to them.  It is useful that people can direct part of their tax contribution to a charity of their choice.  This is working successfully in regard to Third World charities and it is now worth looking at the extension of the scheme across the board.</P>
    <P>However, we should not look at this matter simply in terms of competition or potential competition between private charities and the national lottery.  Both can prosper.  For example, Rehab receives substantial State and EU funding. It is not in its long-term interests to undermine the hand that feeds it in some areas of its operations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment given by the Minister of State in the House yesterday that the Government intends to review the existing cap on charitable fund-raising institutions.  The current limit of £10,000 was established ten years ago.  Even in the ordinary course of events it should be reviewed at this stage.  I am not clear as to whether it would be appropriate to lift this cap entirely or merely increase the limit which applies.  As the Minister stated, in reality there is very little difference.  The potential is there to raise the cap limit to such a level that its existence becomes irrelevant.  I am sure that the Government's decision will be arrived at after due consultation with interested parties.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State was able to say last night that she was engaged in extensive consultations with <Col N="612" /> charities about legislation she is preparing. I know this is the case from talking to people involved in a number of charities, especially in Third World charities. I am also pleased she intends to bring proposals for reform to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  We have all sought reform of the committee system.  When it was expanded in 1993 we looked for a greater role for committees in the formulation of legislation before it is presented.  It is appropriate that proposals for legislation should be discussed with this hard working committee. The Minister of State is to be commended for undertaking this initiative.</P>
    <P>The Costello report has been on the desk of the Minister for Justice for a long time.  I recall watching a recent edition of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; on RTE about fraudulent charitable fund-raising.  The problem with this is that highlighting a small number of cases undermines everybody's case.  I am only too aware of the good work undertaken by charities nationwide and the integrity of those involved in fund-raising for them. However, it is important to recognise that the actions of a few, such as those covered on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report, have the potential to do damage to the efforts of the many.</P>
    <P>The public is very wary of the burgeoning number of charities seeking financial help.  It sometimes wonders about the fund-raisers, the methods of fund-raising, where the money is going to and how much, for example, is being taken in administration costs and expenses.  As a result of this burgeoning number of charities, many of the smaller charities, especially the local charities, tend to lose out, however worthy their cause, to the publicly recognised charities with the big advertising budgets and PR campaigns.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Kemmy, has often raised the issue of the number and diversity of charities operating here. As matters stand, there is little or no regulation governing this sector, hence the establishment of the Costello committee. It is hard to believe that there is <Col N="613" /> no register of licensed charities in the State but that is the case.  The only method available to attempt to calculate them is in respect of the tax exemption certificates issued by the Revenue Commissioners. I understand that in 1995, 11,712 applications were made to the Revenue Commissioners for tax exemption of which 7,000 were granted.  This does not mean that there are 7,000 charities as many of the licences issued are temporary.  Even the guidelines under which the Revenue Commissioners make their decisions are archaic.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has promised to bring her proposals to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security prior to finalisation of the Bill.  She has also said that she will include altering the cap for private charitable fund-raising in these proposals.  These legislative proposals will be drawn up when the report of the advisory group, which is looking at the Costello report because it was produced so many years ago, in conjunction with Rehab and the national charities is available.  While I recognise that the organisations may want to move quicker than this, the proposals by the Minister of State are the correct ones.</P>
    <P>The Costello report has raised a number of concerns about the nature of charitable fund-raising in this State. These include a system of registration for charitable and fund-raising purposes, a system of accounting requirements, a registration authority, greater controls of private lotteries and registration and control of private fund-raisers. Of these, the most significant are the need to compile a register of charities and the introduction of a new system of accounting requirements.</P>
    <P>If we wish to raise the amount of prize money which can be given out by private fund-raisers, presumably on the basis that it will help them raise more revenue for their valuable work, we should also ease any public concern that exists about the operation of these charities.  The two proposals go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> A number of the charities here have taken steps over recent months to regulate themselves.  A new institute to promote good practices in fund-raising has been established.  I hope this type of genuine effort at self regulation will be recognised by the Minister of State when she introduces her proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>There is widespread support in the House for the measure proposed in the Bill, but we do not need legislation; it can be done by regulation.  I congratulate the Minister of State on her progress so far.  I believe the proposals she introduces to this House will represent a landmark on how charities operate and are regulated.  This type of fund-raising needs to be regulated.  It needs to be seen to be regulated for its own benefit and for the benefit of society. Whatever regulations are introduced need to be clear and concise.  I am confident that the Minister of State's proposal will comply with these criteria.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes available to me I would like to address some of the central issues raised by the Bill and to comment on how they concern the support of service for people with disabilities.  I congratulate Deputy Woods on his initiative in bringing forward the Bill.  During his time in the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Woods distinguished himself as a reforming Minister.  Without the army of advisers employed at public expense by his successor, he showed what an immense amount could be achieved with political will and commitment.  The only reason the Bill is unlikely to pass is that the Ministers concerned lack political will and commitment to take speedy action on this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> Deputies and the public know that Irish charities are suffering immense financial losses because of the various ways in which the lotteries are controlled. The recent explosion in sales for the British lottery has worsened an already critical situation.  Many charities may have no lottery fund-raising left if immediate action is not taken.</P>
    <P>In discussing lotteries it is easy to forget the practicalities.  The money collected provides vital services for people throughout the country who would otherwise have to go without.  The area with which I am most familiar relates to services for people with disabilities who constitute the most disadvantaged and marginalised group in society.  Voluntary organisations form the mainstay of support for people with disabilities. They are always seeking to extend and improve their services.  The bottom line on fund-raising is that the more this is restricted the fewer services they can offer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods last night outlined at length the need for immediate action. The response of the Government is more than merely disappointing; it is short-sighted and inadequate.  During her contribution, the Minister failed to address the immediacy of the problem, but stated she was pleased to announce that the Government would take action later in the year.  This is not a new promise from the Government.  It has been its consistent response to all questions on charitable fund-raising for the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister also laid bare the recent statement by the Minister for Finance that sales of British lottery tickets would be dealt with.  She stated that files would soon be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, the basic problem is that the failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions to act on a previous referral was the root cause of the dramatic growth of the British game.  The Minister also failed to appreciate that Deputy Woods's Bill would specifically remove only those administrative regulations which the Garda Síochána and <Col N="616" /> the charities accept are unduly costly and unnecessary.  Perhaps the most curious aspect of the Minister's response was the absence of serious comment on the Irish national lottery and its aggressive monopoly.  The Minister's reference to the national lottery was to praise it for providing money to fund schemes for women's groups; it is surely that this scheme is a scheme which was established by Deputy Woods when serving in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to most issues, and in particular to issues raised by way of Private Members' Bills, is unfortunately characterised by delay and inaction.  In spite of its new army of paid political assistants, the Government is consistently slower than its predecessor in the production of legislative reforms.  This Government is generally incapable of giving a serious reply to a Private Members' Bill.  With parliamentary time allocated to the issue and the prospect of a cross-party consensus, it is surely reasonable to expect the Government to make a constructive commitment and a contribution to the debate. The same sort of tactic evident today was employed by the Government when defeating my Bill earlier this year with regard to disabled voters.  On that occasion the Minister for the Environment, while expressing his support for the intentions of the Bill, called for delay and promised to take his own action.  In spite of the fact that that Bill has been to the Committee on Finance and General Affairs and has received unanimous support, the Taoiseach, this week, communicated to my party leader that the Government is unwilling to help in having it passed into law.</P>
    <P>There is a series of legislative and other initiatives concerning people with disabilities and voluntary organisations which have been promised for immediate production on many occasions but which have not been published or provided with funding.  They include the Equal Status Bill, the Employment Equality Bill, the report of the review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the report of <Col N="617" /> the advisory group on personal assistance services and the White Paper and charter on the voluntary sector.  In its so-called budget for the long-term unemployed, the Government did not include a single measure to help people with disabilities, a group which suffers from 80 per cent unemployment. Deputies will also be aware of the cases of people with disabilities who have had their personal assistance services withdrawn because of refusal to continue funding.</P>
    <P>What action will the Government take to ensure that charitable lotteries are not fatally undermined before the Government gets around to introducing legislation?  What justification does the Government have for refusing to immediately remove a specific administrative requirement which the Garda Síochána and the charities believe is not important in maintaining proper oversight? Finally, what is the Government's basis for believing that the referral of a new file on the British lottery would have a different result from the last referral?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Government Deputies who spoke, their approach has been reasonable; they commended Deputy Woods on bringing the Bill forward to discussion.  However, none of them has come up with substantial, principled reasons for opposing it. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's fine contribution basically came down to saying that if the cap was removed the voluntary charitable scene would be eroded. He did not give us the reasoning behind that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend my colleague for bringing the Bill forward.  I accept the need for checks and balances.  However, Knock International Airport, or Horan International Airport, as it is now known, would not be in existence but for the fact that it was supported by the Taoiseach of the day who gave a Government grant that went hand in hand with substantial voluntary fund-raising undertaken by Monsignor Horan throughout the length and breadth of <Col N="618" /> Ireland and overseas.  If all the checks and balances had been available he would not have raised in excess of £2 million in a raffle with a first prize of a farm worth about £50,000.  I am not suggesting there is no need for checks and balances.  However, the Deputies across the Chamber should support the principle of this Bill and let us get down to the hard work of Committee Stage where we can cure any shortcomings with suitable amendments.</P>
    <P>This measure has been sought by the voluntary organisations and Irish charities for over a decade.  During that time their income has been reduced from £15 million to £10 million.  That is a loss greater than 50 per cent when one takes inflation into account.  They have seen a massive curtailment in the services which they can provide to their members in organisations dealing with cancer, polio, asthma, physical and mental handicap, training and vocational services.  All those national organisations have suffered, while the demands on them were much greater in 1996 than in 1988.  The State-supported monopoly, underpinned by legislation which is heavily discriminatory in their favour on many fronts, has seen its income go up in excess of 300 per cent in that period. Strict marketing and a monopoly as regards legal limit of prize fund and a considerably lesser burden on returns to be made have all but eroded the charitable lottery base.  Even acceptance of this Bill would ensure that the national lottery's premier position would be maintained for many years because of the very substantial set-up costs for terminals, etc., and their premier trading locations in towns and villages.  Any of the lotteries referred to in the explanatory memorandum would have a very difficult uphill battle to seriously increase the 3 per cent national funding which they control at present to anything in the region of the 10 per cent which they controlled before the national lottery came into being.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuiochas agus comhghairdeas <Col N="619" /> a ghabháil le mo chomhlachtaí chun an mBille seo a chur ós ar gcór.  If there was equality there would not be a need for charities to raise money in the first place.  That would be real equity.  Unfortunately, the charitable and voluntary organisations have had to spend more time fund-raising than at their work.  We have created an unjust and unfair situation whereby charitable organisations have not been able to compete fairly with the national lottery, a State monopoly. The amount of money that voluntary and charitable organisations can pay out in prize money is capped.  They have also to adhere to archaic restrictions such as returning scratch cards to the Garda Síochána on a weekly basis and this puts them at a disadvantage, losing the edge in the market.</P>
      <P>There is all-party support for addressing this problem and for that reason I cannot understand why the Government will not accept the Bill.  The Government says it wants to implement the entire Costello report.  That is fine but very little action has been taken since the report was published in 1990. This Bill addresses one of the major problems which voluntary organisations face and after its enactment we could then progress to dealing with the other issues.  In my opinion the Government is fobbing us off.  It is easy to say that this is great legislation but the Government will introduce its own Bill.  We on this side of the House will still be waiting for another six or seven months and nothing will have happened.  It is unjustifiable that the Government should not accept this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charitable and voluntary organisations have been the backbone of social policy in this country.  They have been exemplary in looking after those who otherwise would not have been looked after, particularly those with disabilities. They have made a wonderful contribution to women's lives.  Every parish holds fund-raising events so that voluntary and charitable organisations can carry out their work.  I was very involved with the Sligo Hospice and they find <Col N="620" /> that there is unfair competition in trying to raise funds for their very worthy charity.  The needs of the charitable organisations should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The orientation of the national lottery is wrong.  Originally the proceeds from the national lottery were to be used to cater for sport and young people.  The ethos has changed.  The national lottery should revert to its original ethos and the proceeds should be used for sport, facilities for young people and community development.  I agree that a percentage of the proceeds should be made available to charitable and voluntary organisations.  The national lottery was established ten years ago and has been a success.  Everybody should benefit from that success, not just a small segment of society.  I commend this Bill.  I ask the Government to reconsider its position and accept it.  If it wishes to introduce justifiable amendments they can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mary Wallace for sharing her time.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Woods, on introducing this very important Private Members' Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main aim of the Bill is to level the playing pitch by removing the restrictions which have been placed on lotteries for charitable purposes.  The removal of the cap on prize funds for charitable lotteries must be a priority.  It has become a matter of great urgency and a question of survival for Irish charities. In recent months we have seen the rapid spread of the UK lottery, which claims to have 1,500 outlets throughout the country and a turnover in excess of £20 million.  This is adding to the problems already faced by Irish charities.  If charities are to continue to do the tremendous work they have been doing they must be allowed compete on equal terms with the British and Irish national lotteries.  Irish charities are facing a major loss in business and in many cases are being forced out of the market.  The present 40 year old legislation applying to them must be updated.  It is imperative that action is taken right away to <Col N="621" /> enable charities to retain their share in the market.  If prize funds are to be limited that should apply to all lotteries, otherwise the restrictions should be removed from all charitable lotteries to create a level playing field.  The Bill does this by amending section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has achieved its position through more flexible legislation and there is no cap on the prizes. In contrast charitable lotteries are restricted to a legal limit of £10,000 on the total weekly prize fund.  It is clear that Irish charities such as those catering for cancer, polio, the Central Remedial Clinic, the Irish Wheelchair Association, to name but a few, are being discriminated against.  Some, if not all, of these charities have called on the Government to support an immediate change in the law.  Time does not permit me to highlight further the plight of the many charitable organisations which play a vital part in the provision of vital services.</P>
    <P>Irish charitable organisations are recognised worldwide for their outstanding contribution, especially to people with disabilities.  They need a level playing pitch when carrying out fund-raising activities.  This is a must if they are to survive.  This can be achieved by removing the cap on the prize funds and allowing them to continue to prosper in their fund-raising.  They need a greater share of the national lottery funds.  The time is opportune for a full review of the national lottery and the distribution of its funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary and charitable sector plays a very important role in society, as we have heard from many speakers tonight.  Charitable organisations provide a variety of essential services ranging from housing the homeless, training those with disabilities, protecting children at risk and many more.  There are an estimated 4,000 charitable organisations with a total turnover of £300 million.  They may have as many as 50,000 working for them, many on a voluntary basis.  In <Col N="622" /> carrying out their work the charitable organisations greatly reduce the burden that would otherwise fall on the Exchequer, not least because they are often able to deliver services much more efficiently than the State bureaucracy.  It is not only the beneficiaries of the various charities who gain from their activities; the taxpayer gains also.  In all the circumstances one might expect the Government to do everything it could to help the charitable sector to grow and prosper.  Instead we have a bizarre situation where the State has put the charitable sector at a major disadvantage in its ability to raise funds.  We currently have a severe legislative imbalance which penalises charitable organisations in their fund-raising efforts.</P>
      <P>The national lottery is governed by its own Act passed in 1986 and effectively that Act allows the national lottery to offer unlimited prizes.  The high level of participation in the national lottery means that in practice it can offer prizes of up to £3 million at a time and can offer major prizes twice every week. Contrast that with the entirely different legislation that applies to the charitable sector.  Charitable lotteries are governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 which reflects the circumstances obtaining in the Ireland of 40 years ago. That Act sets down a maximum weekly prize limit of £10,000 for charitable lotteries. It was a generous enough prize limit at the time when one considers that one could buy a new car in the mid1950s for a few hundred pounds.  Part of the problem is that the prize limit has not kept pace with inflation.  If it had the limit would be closer to £100,000 than to £10,000.  The real issue is that the prize limit has not kept pace with the major changes that have taken place in the market in the meantime, particularly the introduction of the national lottery and more recently the encroachment of the British national lottery into the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery and charitable lotteries operate in two totally different legal environments.  The legal cap on the <Col N="623" /> charities, coupled with the national lottery's ability to offer unlimited prizes, has given the national lottery all the attributes of a classic monopoly.  It has a powerful retail distribution network, having been in a position to cherry pick the best outlets on day one.  Its guaranteed cash flow has enabled it to invest in technology in a way which would not be affordable for other lottery operators. Its powerful market position is strengthened by a huge advertising and marketing budget, while its ability to create millionaires gives it ready access to the mass media, particularly television.</P>
    <P>It is not just a monopoly but a State monopoly, because every aspect of the national lottery's activities is controlled by the State.  It is operated by a State company and the distribution of funds is controlled by the State.  The introduction of the national lottery has had the net effect, therefore, of increasing the role of the State in society at the expense of one of the most effective and efficient providers of services to the community, the charitable sector.  The dice is weighted so heavily against the charitable sector that it is simply not able to compete.  It is not surprising it has suffered heavily in financial terms since the national lottery was established. The charities estimate they have foregone up to £200 million in revenues since 1987 as a result of the operation.</P>
    <P>Surely, this was not the intention when the original national lottery legislation was passed by the Oireachtas. Clearly, we need new legislation, not just governing the operation of lotteries but of the whole charitable sector. Twelve months ago the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, gave a clear commitment that new legislation would be introduced in this area.  A year later, we are still waiting and all we have are promises.  It seems incredible the Department of Justice, despite having no fewer than three Ministers, is incapable of delivering the relatively straightforward legislation required to solve the problems in the charities area. <Col N="624" /> We saw yesterday how speedily legislation can be put through this House when the Government so wishes. Clearly, despite its importance in society, the charitable sector does not merit a high place in this Government's list of political priorities.</P>
    <P>Given the inactivity of the Minister of State on this front, I am all the more pleased to support the Bill tabled by Deputy Woods.  I congratulate him on putting this Bill forward.  The key requirement in any legislation is to level the playing field between the national lottery and charitable lotteries.  The prize limit on charitable lotteries has to be abolished so as to remove their competitive disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the national lottery.  I appreciate that lotteries may not be subject to European competition law, but it is not an issue of competition law but of basic fairness. We must be prepared to treat charities in an equitable manner.  We cannot use discriminatory legislation to give an unfair advantage to the strongest player in the market.</P>
    <P>We could go a step further.  One of the problems with the administration of lottery funds in Ireland is that there is no explicit recognition of the needs of the charitable sector.  This contrasts with the situation in Britain where 20 per cent of the total distribution is made available to qualifying charities.  It seems grossly unfair that we in Ireland, having brought in legislation which discriminates clearly against the charitable sector, then ignore completely the needs of the sector when it comes to the distribution of lottery funds.  We should look at the possibility of establishing the charitable sector as one of the categories of beneficiary for lottery funds.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there is a need for much greater transparency and accountability in the way in which lottery funds are distributed. At present, there is not even a standard method of applying for lottery funds.  This does little to boost confidence in the system.  One of the big dangers with the national lottery is that the moneys of the poor may be used to subsidise the pleasures of the rich.  A more <Col N="625" /> accountable distribution mechanism, independently managed in line with clearly established criteria, would go a long way towards obviating that possibility.</P>
    <P>New charities legislation needs to do much more than simply level the playing field between the national lottery and the independent charitable lotteries.  At present, we have a totally inadequate legislative and administrative framework governing the operation of all charitable fund-raising.  Two State bodies have responsibility for overseeing different aspects of charitable fund-raising &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners and the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Neither of these bodies has any real policing powers over the sector.  In fact, the whole definition of charitable status is very loose.  In practice, the granting of charitable status is an administrative decision of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The whole sector operates largely on a trust basis.  We have been very fortunate, so far, that to the best of our knowledge there have been no large scale scams or abuses.  However, that is no reason for us not to be vigilant.</P>
    <P>Last week my colleague, Deputy Quill, highlighted a case in Cork which has given rise to considerable public concern, which is the case of the all Ireland national children's hospice, an organisation which has raised over £1 million operating from premises in Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny and Dublin, but whose activities were mainly concentrated in Cork.  This organisation promised to use the funds it raised to build a hospice for sick and dying children. As yet, there is no evidence that any such project has even commenced, let alone been completed.  Despite this, the organisation has continued to receive further collection permits around the country.  In Cork city that charity was issued with no fewer than 58 collection permits in less than a year, an average of one every five days.</P>
    <P>That case gives rise to a number of questions.  Why was the organisation issued with so many permits when there <Col N="626" /> was no evidence to indicate that a hospice was actually being constructed? Why was no one responsible for checking that the collectors represented a bona fide charity?  Are those organising charity collections accountable to anyone for the donations they receive? What has happened to the money raised?  That case shows the need for proper legislation to cover the whole area of charitable fund-raising.  There are many questions being asked in that case about why prosecutions have not ensued.</P>
    <P>The lack of progress in the Department of Justice is all the more surprising given that a blueprint for new legislation already exists in the form of the Costello report.  Many speakers have alluded to this report.  In 1990 Mr. Justice Declan Costello chaired a committee which examined in depth the whole area of fund-raising for charitable purposes. The principal recommendations of that report were that there should be a formal registration process for all charities, that all charities should submit an annual report to a national registration authority, and that the accounts of all charitable organisations should be available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>The Costello committee did not make specific recommendations on the issue of prize limits, as it considered this subject to be outside its terms of reference. However, the committee's report did recognise the irrelevance of the whole 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act in the modern era.  The recommendations of the Costello committee are, by and large, non-contentious and uncontroversial. If they were to be embodied in a new charities Bill I have no doubt that such a Bill would receive wide support in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Yet, it is six years since the report was published and there is no sign of new legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that charities want to see a proper regulatory environment put in place.  The whole sector lives by its reputation, so it is vitally important to maintain public confidence in it.  Most of the larger charities already <Col N="627" /> operate to a high standard of openness and accountability.  Little or no additional effort would be required on their part to satisfy the demands of any new legislation.</P>
    <P>However, to sound a note of warning, in framing legislation we should be careful not to create a new regulatory bureaucracy which would impose major compliance costs on the charitable sector. That would be very damaging to the smaller charities, in particular, many of whom have no full time accounting staff.  Any new regulations need to be flexible, so that the smaller organisations are not unduly penalised.  It should be possible to put in place a system whereby they are required to comply with fairly simple, basic accounting standards and their fund-raising activities are monitored by the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, promised legislation in this area.  She should bring legislation before the House as soon as possible.  The Government has an ideal opportunity this evening to accept this Private Members' Bill.  I abhor the practice of the Government in refusing all Private Members' Bills produced.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to make a small contribution to the debate on this Bill.  Deputy Woods is seven years too late.  He did not think it worth his while during his seven years in Government to change the legislation when he was in a position to do so.  This problem did not happen overnight but has been with us since the national lottery was founded.  I take this opportunity to compliment Deputy Creed for introducing the relevant legislation.  It <Col N="628" /> took many months to steer it through the House because of the shilly-shallying of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>There is a major problem in this area. People are very generous and if the cause is right, they will subscribe to a charity.  The reason this Private Members' Bill is before the House is that the Fianna Fáil Party knows the Government intends to introduce its own Bill later in the year.  In recent weeks it has indicated its support for various projects in my constituency. When in Government for seven years Fianna Fáil failed to support any project in the area, which its leader has visited twice in recent months.  Perhaps he thinks an election is on the horizon but I have news for him.  The Government intends to continue until November or December next year or January the following year.</P>
      <P>I would like to see major changes in the Bill the Government intends to bring forward.  I do not see anything wrong with the introduction of controls. I remember watching a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme a number of weeks ago which dealt with the collection of moneys in Cork to set up a local radio station.  It transpired that the people collecting the moneys were getting more than the charities concerned.  This cannot be tolerated.  I do not mind a small percentage being retained to cover administration costs but I fail to see why 70 to 80 per cent of moneys collected should go into somebody's pocket.</P>
      <P>When I go to Mass on Sunday, shopping on a Friday or Saturday or attend my clinics £1 tickets are shoved in front of me.  This also happens when people go for a drink at weekends.  What sickens me is that nobody knows what happens to the money.  My mother used to say that charity begins at home.  This does not mean that people should bring home the money with them, rather it should be given to the charitable organisations concerned.  I do not see anything wrong with the Government introducing legislation to control the activities of these cowboys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I remember a time when Ministers travelled around the country with national lottery cheques in their back pockets and, in the weeks before leaving office, allocated money for projects which they did not have the power to allocate.  That amounted to abuse. There is a need for proper legislation to assist genuine charities which do a wonderful job.  I fail to see why there should be a cap.  They should have the same freedom as the national lottery.</P>
    <P>What annoys me about the national lottery is that a number of small shop-keepers in the west, including my home town of Westport, are being deprived of the opportunity to become agents.  I do not see anything wrong with shop-keepers selling British national lottery tickets just as we do not see anything wrong with thousands of people from Northern Ireland buying national lottery tickets here.  We should not be hypocritical. It is a bit like Fianna Fáil and this Bill.  I ask it to await the introduction of the Government's Bill which will be well thought out and control the activities of cowboys who for too long have been collecting money under false pretences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the moneys collected for Knock Airport by Monsignor Horan who travelled all over the world and organised lotteries.  I wish to correct one thing he said.  It was Garret FitzGerad, not Fianna Fáil, who provided the money.  He did not receive the credit he deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that, unlike Deputy O'Keeffe and the Minister, Deputy Ring who raised the temperature wants to have the cap removed.  It seems that we have raised some pertinent issues.  It was important to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has become a serious problem because the moneys collected by charitable lotteries have fallen sharply because of the impact of the national lottery on the one hand and the UK lottery on the other.  Because the Government drew back from taking action at <Col N="630" /> the beginning of the year over 1,500 outlets are now selling UK national lottery tickets.  We said this would happen and asked the Minister to introduce regulations. When nothing happened we put this Bill on the table.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have offered their support and welcomed the Bill's main provisions.  Some would like to see much wider legislation but it seems there is a serious difference of opinion about the cap.  Government Members have been offered their sympathy but I do not want it.  I want a level playing pitch to allow charities earn the money they know they can earn, for people with disabilities in particular, and other charitable causes.</P>
    <P>While it agrees with its principles and intent the Government will not support the Bill or take action now, rather it has asked us to wait until the advisory bodies have had an opportunity to discuss the matter.  If it agrees that the removal of the cap of £10,000 and dispensing with the obsolete reporting arrangements should be given priority, why does it not do so immediately?  It could then proceed with its comprehensive review of fund-raising generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister confused, purposely perhaps, fund-raising generally, as dealt with in the Costello report, with the activities of charitable lotteries dealt with in the Bill.  The Government says that this is a complex matter and that it will take time to tease out all the details. Many issues remain to be dealt with but this is a simple Bill which deals with charitable lotteries only and would be effective.</P>
    <P>The voluntary organisations and people with disabilities are bitterly disappointed and feel let down.  I am not surprised by this.  Many people thought that the Government would proceed with these measures because of the urgency of the problem.  Since January the charitable organisations have lost out heavily.  They need the money. There is no point in saying we will have legislation eventually.  In fact they needed the money earlier.  The national <Col N="631" /> lottery reduced them to 3 per cent market share.  The UK lottery took £20 million from the funds available.  It is still taking it today and will do so next week and the week after and probably for a long time because nothing has changed in the legislation.  The Government said it will try once again to effect a prosecution but it has allowed the market to develop, the systems to operate and the couriers to take the money to the North. It is now a business.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about a charitable business &mdash; Deputy Ring will understand that because he understands business &mdash; which is being put out of action by inaction at Government level through its failure to level the playing pitch and give them a chance to survive. Some of the Government backbenchers have pointed to long established charities in very severe difficulties.  We are not talking about the theory or the niceties of better fundraising controls which are important but specifically about the charitable lotteries, the desperate position they are in and the lack of action to deal with it.  Last night the Government asked them to wait another six months or more when it promised to do something.  Let us continue to talk through the summer and into the autumn and examine the complex area of fundraising.  In itself that is admirable but the practical business issue here is to help these charities in their hour of need.  They have outlined their situation very clearly and honestly and this House should be capable of responding to their needs.  Yet, the Government is saying it is not capable of responding.  Although the Government agrees with the principle and intent of this Bill, it is not prepared to take it into committee to make whatever changes it wishes.  That is regression to the bad old days of many years ago and something we hoped we had grown away from in this House.  I ask the Government to make good the financial deficit or give them the means to protect themselves as we had proposed.</P>

Prior to that the Government's programme managers and advisers met &mdash; we all know how numerous they are.  They did not see the urgent need for action or if they did they were not listened to.  The party leaders, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare met and decided they too would turn their backs on the charitable lotteries and the people who work for those charities, whose work is exemplary, whose contribution to society is extraordinary and whose lives are dedicated to serving those most in need.  The party leaders had more important things to do.  They forgot about the vulnerable people who depend on them.  Did even one member of the Government say it should be done now?

      <P>I note the Taoiseach's reply to a question yesterday in which he said there are no plans to introduce any legislation in relation to the national lottery.  That information was also contained in a letter which our party leader received, dated 18 June.  There is no hope of reform.  We want a full review of the national lottery as so many on the Government side of the House.  After the debate last night I was given to understand that the advisory body set up by the Government recommended that the cap be removed.  If that is the body's recommendation, why conceal it from the House; why continue to pursue the line of raising the limits?  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter and not to conceal this relevant fact.  I ask Members on all sides to support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for coming to reply, even though I requested the Minister for Finance to reply to the matter.</P>
      <P>A dispute about grading and other matters has been taking place in the Arts Council for the past seven years.  Following a number of meetings between the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Arts Council and the union representing the employees and a Labour Court hearing, an acceptable compromise was reached on grading and structure levels in the council.  From the documentation available to me it is obvious this was a compromise.  The line Department, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, supports the Labour Court recommendation, the unions have agreed it as a compromise and all concerned are waiting for it to be implemented, but the Department of Finance will not give its approval.  The Labour Court gave its determination last March but the matter has not been finalised because of the Department of Finance's refusal to accept the recommendation.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that people in the private sector are often baffled at the manner in which matters are dealt with in the public sector.  It is extraordinary that one arm of the State, the Labour Court, can make a recommendation which is acceptable to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but another arm of the State, the Department of Finance, can refuse to accept the recommendation.  People in the private sector find it difficult to understand this type of thing.</P>
      <P>In the past few weeks we have been inundated with requests from members of the Government to private sector employers to abide by Labour Court decisions.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, has been vociferous in telling Packard it should implement the Labour Court recommendation for its employees.  Surely the Government's refusal to accept a Labour Court recommendation for its employees brings the industrial relations machinery into disrepute.  This matter is even more absurd because implementation of the recommendation would not necessitate additional funding for the Arts Council and would not place an additional charge on the public purse.  Three conciliation conferences at LRC level and a Labour Court hearing have taken place in an effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having exhausted the industrial relations process, the Department of Finance refused to accept the recommendation. What kind of signal is that to give to private sector employees and employers?  That is the reason I asked the Minister for Finance to come before the House tonight.  The compromise reached by the Labour Court is supported by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I put it to the <Col N="639" /> Minister who has kindly come in to reply that this matter should be resolved now.  Given that the industrial relations process has been exhausted, the Government should be prepared to honour the recommendation of the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware An Chomhairle Ealaíon is an independent autonomous body set up in 1951 to stimulate public interest in and promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts. Operating under the arts Acts of 1951 and 1973, An Chomhairle carries out this work through a wide range of policies and programmes designed to provide financial assistance and other support services for individuals and organisations and generally to create an environment in which the arts can develop and flourish.  Support of the individual arts practitioner is a fundamental part of An Chomhairle's mission and An Chomhairle understands it has a clear responsibility to foster those structures which assist and develop dialogue between artists, the arts and communities from which they emerge.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon also seeks to influence and work with other State agencies, local authorities, private business, schools and colleges in bringing the arts to greater prominence in society, and from time to time is asked to advise the Government and Government Departments on artistic matters.</P>
      <P>The board of An Chomhairle Ealaíon sets policies and takes decisions within the terms of the arts Acts which are then implemented by its dedicated staff headed by a director.  I appreciate the efforts the staff have made for many years, but more particularly in recent times, in advancing and assisting the arts and indeed individual artists and arts organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an excellent level of co-operation between the staff of An Chomhairle Ealaíon and my Department, cooperation that was very much in evidence <Col N="640" /> in the development in recent years of what might loosely be described as a strategic alliance between the two bodies.  This strategic alliance played a crucial part in bringing the arts plan to fruition and its continuation will repreent a key factor in how we can achieve the plan's objectives in a cohesive, structured and effective manner in the period up to 1999.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me in the context of the debate not to pay tribute to the work of the present director of An Chomhairle Ealaíon who has done so much for that organisation in the past 13 years and who has decided to resign and move to the private sector.  I wish him well in his new career.</P>
    <P>While I have been successful in achieving increases in funding for An Chomhairle from a level of £10.161 million in 1992, the year immediately prior to my first appointment as Minister with responsibility for An Chomhairle, to £18.4 million in 1996, I very much doubt that the arts would flourish to the extent they are today without the expertise the staff of An Chomhairle contribute to the process of deciding how this funding can be best spent.  I remain committed to seeking a resolution to the problem described with fairness by Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>My commitment to the arts, and in particular to An Chomhairle Ealaíon, is irrefutable and I am therefore glad of this opportunity to set out the history and the current position in relation to staffing levels in An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  An organisational review of An Chomhairle Ealaíon by the Institute of Public Administration &mdash; IPA &mdash; was commissioned in 1992 when An Chomhairle was under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The main recommendation of that report was the creation of three posts at assistant principal officer level and the consequential suppression of two arts officer &mdash; higher executive officer &mdash; posts and the creation of three new executive assistant posts.  However the IPA report was not accepted by the then parent Department who, with the agreement of An <Col N="641" /> Chomhairle Ealaíon, agreed to seek a second opinion.</P>
    <P>The Management Services Unit &mdash; MSU &mdash; of the Department of Finance was then engaged to examine the current organisation, management and staffing of An Comhairle.  The MSU report subsequently recommended, among other changes, the creation of a new post of assistant director at assistant principal level in place of the three posts at assistant principal level recommended in the IPA report.  The MSU also recommended the creation of six new executive assistant posts.  SIPTU, however, still contended with the management of An Comhairle that there was a need for three additional AP level posts rather than the one recommended by the MSU, and despite discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, agreement was not reached on the matter of the AP level posts.  The case was subsequently referred to the Labour Court which, having heard the views of all concerned parties, recommended that three assistant principal level posts be created and that the other proposals agreed with the Labour Relations Commission be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am now in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to determine how best this recommendation can be implemented having regard to the policy of the Government not to increase overall numbers of staff in the public sector.  Far from blocking a settlement, my Department will do everything possible to help resolve matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  While I very much welcome the presence once again of the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, I cannot let the opportunity pass without expressing my disappointment that the Minister for Education is absent for the second night in a row, leaving another Minister to deal with extremely important issues pertinent to the education system.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter under the shadow of strike action planned for tomorrow in Nenagh and Kildare &mdash; more wide-spread strike action is planned for the autumn.  Primary school teachers are extremely concerned about the Minister's recruitment plans for the coming school year.  The Minister yesterday refused to admit that she will not appoint remedial teachers in the academic year 1996-97.  She is satisfied that she has maintained the pupil-teacher ratio this year, while she should strive to make improvements in this area.  It is unfortunate the Minister has decided to use staffing schedules and the pupil-teacher ratio as blunt instruments with which to restrain the appointment of remedial teachers and curtail the ratification of teaching posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to appoint remedial teachers only in schools in disadvantaged areas.  Even though there are children from disadvantaged backgrounds with special needs in schools in every area, the Minister does not have any proposals to provide assistance to those children.  It is schools outside disadvantaged areas, which number among their students children who need special help, that are targeted by the Minister in her efforts to keep recruitment levels down.  These schools, even if they fall below the quota by one student, will not be allowed appoint new teachers for the coming year.  The Minister is robbing Peter to pay Paul, helping some disadvantaged children at a cost to others. She is more concerned about securing newspaper headlines and lauding her <Col N="643" /> work on behalf of schools in disadvantaged areas than tackling the genuine problems of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister must meet the teachers' unions at the earliest possible date to discuss the pending industrial action and give them a chance to express their genuine concerns so that she might rethink her strategy.  We spoke yesterday about the problem of indiscipline in schools and the need for back-up services for pupils and teachers who experience difficulties, yet there is silence from the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that we are debating a further breakdown in partnership in the education world.  The failure of the Minister for Education to consult the social partners on the 1996-97 school year staffing schedules is inexcusable and unacceptable.  Such an approach runs contrary to the consensus approach developed since 1987 under the Programme for National Recovery, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  This consensus involved the gradual and progressive reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio by using the demographic dividend made available by the falling birth rate.  It is wrong to reverse this trend as it will create further disadvantage in many communities.  The report commissioned by the Combat Poverty Agency, Education Disadvantage in Ireland, questioned the effectiveness of the present scheme for schools designated as disadvantaged, and this is the report the Minister claimed she is responding to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has ignored such advice and has decided to allocate all extra teachers at her disposal to 25 selected schools in urban areas and 25 clusters of schools in rural areas.  Yet there are approximately 3,000 schools in the system. Clearly thousands of children in urban and rural areas will suffer as a result of the Minister's initiative.  There are alternative approaches.  As a basic principle, any scheme for the disadvantaged should focus on the child as <Col N="644" /> opposed to the school as a collective unit.  Such an approach would be more inclusive.  A more balanced approach is required from the Minister.  I understand that if the pupil-teacher ratio was reduced by even one point this year 100 schools would not suffer the loss of a teacher.  This year approximately 300 schools will lose teachers while many others will have enrolments in excess of the maximum guidelines laid down.</P>
    <P>The situation next September will be chaotic and inequitable.  It is within the Minister's power to rectify it.  This is an extremely important issue and parents are united with the teachers in Nenagh and Castledermot who will go on strike tomorrow.  I thank the Minister of State for being present in the House but the Minister should be here to respond to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and I are extremely concerned for pupils who, through no fault of their own, will miss classes because of industrial action taken by teachers.  I understand that the threatened one day strike in two primary schools tomorrow, and further strikes proposed for early in the next school year, are due to disquiet among teachers at the Minister's decision not to change the staffing schedule of primary schools for the 1996-97 school year.  This action, proposed by the INTO, is totally unjustified and unnecessary and the Minister appeals to the INTO to call it off immediately.</P>
      <P>This action by the INTO totally ignores the impressive improvements made by the Minister to the staffing of primary schools since she took office. During this period she has substantially improved the pupil-teacher ratio from 25.2:1 to 22.9:1.  Despite the fact that the staffing schedule remains unchanged, there will be a further modest improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio for the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, during the period in office, the Minister has reduced maximum class sizes by four units.  At present the <Col N="645" /> maximum size for a multi-grade class is 31 pupils, while a single grade class should not exceed 35 pupils.  No class in any school should exceed these maxima and, where it is not possible to organise classes within these guidelines, the school should apply to the Department for an additional teaching post.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the staffing schedule for the 1996-97 school year remains unchanged from the 1995-96 schedule, in the normal course of events this would have resulted in a number of two teacher schools becoming one teacher units.  The Minister recently announced that these schools will remain as two teacher units for the 1996-97 school year.  In total, 16 schools are favourably affected by this decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also introduced a maximum of 29 pupils in all classes in disadvantaged schools.  Furthermore, based on recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, the Minister recently announced new measures to break the cycle of education disadvantage by targeting schools in areas of particular disadvantage, both urban and rural.  A total of 25 urban schools will have a maximum of 15 pupils in infants, first and second classes, while a range of special grants and other supports will be made available to 25 clusters of small rural schools.</P>
      <P>I reject, in the strongest possible terms, any suggestions that in targeting resources towards alleviating the handicap of education disadvantage, the Minister is ignoring those schools which are not classified as disadvantaged.  The Minister's record speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>A total of 980 posts which would otherwise have been surplus due to falling enrolments were retained in the system over the past three school years.  Of that total, 410 posts were used to effect substantial improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio and to reduce maximum class sizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> In addition, 570 new posts were established in the special education-disadvantaged areas in the past three years. These included additional remedial teachers, disadvantaged concessionary posts, home-school liaison teachers, improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio in schools for severely and profoundly handicapped pupils, reduced pupil teacher ratio in special schools, resource teachers and administrative principals in special schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to assure the INTO that officials of the Department are ready to meet with them at any time to discuss their difficulties in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and thank the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Deputy Kenny, for being present.</P>
      <P>I support the legislative initiative taken in the US House of Representatives by the Pathfinders group which comprises members of the Democratic and Republican parties.  This legislation was moved initially on 6 June last.  The concept of establishing a special trade arrangement for companies in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties is an excellent one.  The degree of disadvantage in terms of industrial development in the six counties immediately south of the Border is seriously underestimated.  There is a perception that funds such as the IFI and the peace initiative money levelled the playing field in the area.  However, this perception is false, as illustrated by the difficulty in attracting industrial development to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious infrastructural deficiency in the area from Louth to Donegal.  The Pathfinders group initiative is the equivalent of a Private Members' Bill in this House.  The wording of the Bill is as follows: &ldquo;To authorise the President to enter into a trade agreement concerning Northern Ireland and certain Border counties of the <Col N="647" /> Republic of Ireland and for other purposes&rdquo;. If the legislation is to succeed it is essential that it should have the full support of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>This initiative has the ability to release a significant economic dynamic in Northern Ireland and the six southern Border counties.  I call on the Government to throw its political and diplomatic support behind the Pathfinders group by actively encouraging President Clinton to support the Bill.  A special trade area would make industrial investment in the geographic catchment mentioned much more attractive.  I understand that the Bill will next pass to the Ways and Means Committee, and support from this side of the ocean is essential if it is to pass through that channel and on to the floor of the House of Representatives and, hopefully, into legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time this matter has been raised on the Adjournment in recent weeks.  I thank Deputy Kirk for his continuing interest in Ireland-US trade issues.</P>
      <P>As I indicated during the previous debate on this subject on 1 May, my Department has been monitoring this proposal through our Embassy in Washington. The main proposal in the Bill now before Congress, which has the support of a number of members of the US House of Representatives, is to eliminate or to substantially reduce the duty applied to exports to the United States from Northern Ireland and Border counties.  The Bill is not an initiative of the US Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said in this House on many previous occasions, I very much appreciate the efforts of the many friends of Ireland in US political and business circles to assist us in converting the potential of the peace process into lasting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. This Bill should be seen as further welcome evidence of the goodwill which <Col N="648" /> exists towards Ireland in US political circles.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, that even the Bill's proposers recognise the very real difficulties which may prevent the creation of their proposed free trade zone.  A major stumbling block, in the first instance, would be the need to agree additional preferential arrangements for Irish exports over and above the current GATT.  Ultimately, any special tariff arrangements would also require approval by both the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that in the context of a European Union committed to the Single Market and a level playing field for all member states, the likelihood of securing EU agreement to preferential tariff arrangements for one region of Ireland is, to say the least, remote.  Our European partners would no doubt point to their already very generous recognition of the need for special treatment for Northern Ireland and the Border counties through EU financial support for the International Fund for Ireland and the special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  The Border counties also benefit, of course, from funding provided under wider EU programmes such as INTERREG.</P>
    <P>Even in the unlikely event of approval being forthcoming for preferential tariff arrangements, there are serious practical difficulties which would have to be taken into consideration. The creation of this free-zone would necessitate the introduction of a separate customs territory and customs border within this jurisdiction.  This would be required in order to ensure that goods produced in other parts of this State were excluded from the preferential tariff treatment.  This would not be a desirable development at a time when our emphasis is on dismantling barriers within this island.</P>
    <P>Let me make it very clear that I am conscious that those proposing this idea are motivated by a genuine and sincere desire to contribute to the economic <Col N="649" /> well-being of the Border counties.  Furthermore, the United States is an important economic partner and I support the strengthening and deepening of our economic links.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I recently had the opportunity of meeting with US business people participating in a US Department of Commerce mission to Northern Ireland and the Border counties. The Deputy may be aware that the mission, which focused on the information technology sector, visited his home town of Dundalk for two days and held a series of match-making sessions with representatives from Irish companies in the IT field.</P>
    <P>The mission represented the latest step in a programme of economic cooperation between Ireland and the US which began with the appointment by President Clinton in December 1994 of Senator George Mitchell as his special economic adviser on Ireland.  This was followed by the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in May 1995 which was a major and very welcome demonstration of US engagement with Ireland at the highest level. The conference provided an opportunity for one-to-one networking by Irish and US business people and for exploring avenues for potential co-operation such as joint ventures and other commercial link-ups.  Since the White House conference the State agencies, including An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt, have worked closely with their Northern Ireland and US counterparts in a continuous programme of followup activities such as the recent business development mission I have described.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the US Administration is planning a follow-up to the White House Conference on Trade and Investment to take place in Philadelphia in the autumn.  The aim of this conference will to be develop further the areas of potential economic co-operation identified at last year's conference with a particular focus on Northern Ireland and the Border counties. I assure the Deputy and the House that my Department and the agencies <Col N="650" /> for which I have responsibility, including An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte, will continue to co-operate and work closely with the Department of Commerce in facilitating this important work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the serious unemployment problem that has arisen in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. In the past 18 months there has been a 12 per cent increase in the number of people registered as unemployed in County Monaghan and there has been a 5 per cent increase in County Cavan in that period.</P>
      <P>From November 1994 to November 1995 the numbers unemployed in Monaghan increased by 231, from 3,073 to 3,304.  There was a corresponding increase in the six months from November 1995 to April 1996 of 121, which brought the figure to 3,425.  That resulted in a total increase over an 18 month period of 352.</P>
      <P>The numbers unemployed in Cavan in 1994 increased by 173, from 2,654 to 2,827.  That figure was partly offset between November 1995 and April 1996 when the numbers unemployed reduced by 33, making a total increase of 140 for that 18 month period.</P>
      <P>The increase in the numbers unemployed is alarming when so much emphasis was placed on the benefit of the peace initiative and when the Government is talking in terms of tens of thousands of extra jobs being created. During the period to which I referred, there have not been any major factory closures or labour unrest.  There has never been so much funding available through the county enterprise boards, the Leader programme, the IFI, INTERREG, the peace initiative and the operational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great need for factory space in the Cavan-Monaghan area but Forbairt does not have a budget to cover that.  Six months ago I was told <Col N="651" /> Forbairt did not have a specific remit for the Border region.  It does not have any funding for capital projects or the provision of industrial premises despite the fact that official sources have told me that the administrators of a similar fund in Northern Ireland have allocated £800,000 for an advance factory in Strabane. The Cavan-Monaghan area has a similar entitlement to factory space.</P>
    <P>At a recent seminar in Ballyconnell the chairman of the IFI and the regional director of Forbairt spoke about the success of the partnership programme, an issue akin to the matter to which the Minister replied a short time ago.  That programme was established in 1995 to form strategic alliances between companies in the Border region and companies located in North America.  A total of 15 companies participated in the programme and the claim that it created 200 jobs has been questioned by some people.</P>
    <P>When the IFI chairman and the regional director of Forbairt were asked about the location of those companies they said they were located in the two Border counties of Louth and Donegal with only one or two located in the other four Border counties.</P>
    <P>There is little opportunity for companies in the Border regions to participate in the partnership programme or avail of the benefits of the much vaunted Washington conference, the Matchmaker programme or the forthcoming Philadelphia conference.  I ask the Minister to monitor funding under these initiatives so that Border regions benefit and funding can be transferred from one programme to another if necessary.  Some monitoring system should be devised to ascertain how this funding can best be used and transferred from one programme to another.</P>
    <P>Despite the amount of funding available for advance factories, there is a similar funding provision for the development of tourism, for the improvement of bed and breakfast and self-catering accommodation in that area where there is an enormous <Col N="652" /> demand and huge efforts are being made to develop tourism potential.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland does not allocate grants for bed and breakfast accommodation but for small hotels.  Some funds were allocated for this purpose under the Leader programme but I understand its funding has already expired for the current year. The local County Enterprise Board, of which I am a member, is not in a position to allocate any worthwhile funding for tourism purposes.</P>
    <P>While there is great need for funding of tourism developments in Border areas with enormous potential, none is available.  This leads me to the conclusion that there will have to be greater discretion allowed in transferring available funding.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach informed the House he would appoint the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy Carey, to deal with the various tourism agencies in an effort to co-ordinate their activities. It is time the Minister of State produced a report on that position and Members had an opportunity of discussing it and to ensure that in a number of years, some benefits will be reaped from the moneys available and our unemployment figures will not continue to rise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is away on official business this week, at his request, I agreed to take this Adjournment Debate on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for raising this issue in the House.  I, like the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, am very concerned about unemployment and the Minister, on behalf of the Government, is vigorously pursuing a multi-faceted range of policies to address the problem of unemployment. That Department's mission is to promote and foster employment, and it is tackling this urgent task by encouraging enterprise, ensuring competitiveness, securing an educated and skilled work-force, tackling exclusion from the labour market, promoting a fair and <Col N="653" /> efficient employment regulatory environment and implementing an effective business regulatory system.  On Thursday, 18 April 1996, the Minister launched a Labour Market strategy paper entitled &ldquo;Growing and Sharing our Employment&rdquo;.  This has two clear objectives: (a) to set a policy framework to increase employment and the employment intensity of growth; and (b) to bring back into the mainstream of the labour market those who are currently excluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to publish another three papers on the labour market this year.  The three forthcoming ones are on enterprise, services and human resources development. Together they will form a comprehensive employment policy.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the level of unemployment in the Monaghan-Cavan constituency. Despite the unprecedented job creation performance, with more than 60,000 new jobs created since this Government came into office, the number of people on the live register in the Monaghan-Cavan constituency was 6,217 at the end of April this year. While this is not an acceptable statistic, it is only an increase of 9 on the figure in September 1995 and is 369 less than the figure for September 1993.  Therefore, I cannot agree with the Deputy's comment that there has been an alarming increase in the rate of unemployment in the constituency.</P>
    <P>Employment in overseas-grant-assisted industries in Monaghan and Cavan has increased in the past ten years, up from 1,251 jobs in 1985 to 1,636 jobs in 1995.  In 1995, for example, 41 new jobs were created by overseas companies in County Monaghan, while 79 jobs were created in County Cavan for the same period.  In relation to Forbairt-assisted companies, there has been a net increase in employment of 286 persons in the years 1994-95.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to the work of the County Enterprise Boards which were established to fill a gap identified in the range of support services for local enterprise.  Their function is to develop <Col N="654" /> indigenous small and micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level, primarily through the provision of supports such as grants. The boards, which complement the work of State agencies such as IDA-Ireland, Forbairt and FÁS, have an unequivocal focus on the creation of sustainable businesses and viable jobs.</P>
    <P>From their establishment in late 1993 to the end of 1995, Cavan and Monaghan County Enterprise Boards approved 176 projects worth almost £2 million in grants of which £0.776 million was drawn down by the end of last year. These projects are expected to lead to the creation of more than 330 full-time and 90 part-time jobs of which more than 200 full-time and more than 80 part-time jobs had been created by the end of 1995, according to figures supplied by the boards.  To date in 1996, the two boards have approved 17 projects worth more than £150,000 in grants.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the industrial development agencies, under the aegis of Department of Enterprise and Employment, are active in promoting indigenous and foreign direct investment in the Monaghan-Cavan constituency. I am aware of a number of companies in Monaghan which are giving good employment such as Bose &mdash; 160 employees; CPV &mdash; 155 employees &mdash; which has performed well since the take-over by Powerscreen and Gernard Ltd. &mdash; 93 employees &mdash; which has been in operation since 1970.  In Cavan such companies as Wellman &mdash; 485 employees &mdash; Boxmore &mdash; 173 employees &mdash; and Jobman &mdash; 40 plus employees &mdash; provide positive indicators for the future.  I am confident of future improvement in manufacturing employment in the constituency.  I can assure the House that the agencies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment will continue to strenuously promote the Monaghan-Cavan constituency for future industrial development.  Also FÁS, our national training and employment authority, will continue to work with the employment promotion agencies in <Col N="655" /> placing into employment, unemployed persons in the area.  The ongoing work of FÁS in the area of training is also relevant and important in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the implications of the growth of tourism in this area. Wearing my responsibility for tourism hat, Deputy Leonard will be aware of the varous funds and allocations available for the stimulation of economic investment funds and allocations available for the stimulation of economic investment in tourism by INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland, Peace and Reconciliation and the European Regional Development Fund. <Col N="656" /> Indeed confidence in the tourism industry also adds to the potential for employment in the Monaghan-Cavan constituency.  As Deputy Leonard knows, I will be happy to talk to him about that at any time.</P>

      <P>I might make it clear that prostitution itself is not an offence.  What the law seeks to do in this area is to protect society from the more intrusive aspects of prostitution, such as soliciting in the streets, and to protect prostitutes from exploitation by pimps living on the earnings of a prostitute.  I also emphasise that the full protection of the criminal law is available to prostitutes.  The law is there for the protection of everyone and will be enforced to that end.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a recent article in the press in which prostitutes indicated that the incidence of violent crimes against them is on the increase.  However, from inquiries I have made, I understand from the Garda that they received only two reports of such attacks on prostitutes in Dublin city in 1995 and three to date this year.</P>
      <P>If it is the case that there has been an increase in the incidence of assaults then these have not been reported to the Garda.  I would urge any prostitute who has been assaulted and has not reported the incident to the Garda to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the law in this area was updated by the 1993 Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act. There seems to be a perception that provisions of that Act are placing prostitutes at greater risk of assault.  The argument is that prostitutes, under greater pressure from the Garda, have less time to assess their clients and determine whether they are violent types.  I am <Col N="448" /> afraid I have a difficulty accepting this argument.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable but it seems to be the case that a risk of assault has always been associated with prostitution whether that risk comes from clients, pimps or others.  That is not to say that the risk is in some way acceptable.  I want to make it crystal clear that crimes of violence against prostitutes are a serious concern both to me and to the Garda.  The protection of the criminal law applies to all.  I would again urge any prostitute who is assaulted to immediately report the crime to the Garda.</P>

      <P>The primary recommendation of the First Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission &mdash; Management and Financing of the Courts &mdash; is that an independent and permanent body should be established to manage a unified courts system.  This body would be known as &ldquo;the Courts Service&rdquo; and would be set up by Statute as an agency of the State.  The report recommends that the new service would be managed on a day to day basis by a chief executive officer and that it should have a board chaired by the Chief Justice and consisting of members of the Judiciary and representatives of those using or otherwise involved in the courts.</P>
      <P>The Minister obtained Government approval for acceptance in principle of these recommendations.  The Government in its decision stated that the chief executive of the Courts Service would also be a member of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of appointing an inspector of prisons has been around for some time.  A similar post has been in place in other countries for many years.  In 1985 the Whitaker Committee, which prepared a comprehensive report on the whole penal system, recommended the appointment of an independent inspector of prisons.  It was envisaged that the inspector would report, through the Secretary of the Department of Justice, to the Minister for Justice.  The inspector would have extensive powers to examine all aspects of the work of the prison service, including the treatment of prisoners and conditions in prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the intervening years, the view was taken that there were more pressing issues to be addressed and that the appointment of an inspector was a longer-term issue.  In more recent times, however, the Department of Justice has looked at inspection systems in neighbouring jurisdictions.  In 1994 the Department in its five-year plan for the management of offenders accepted that, notwithstanding the existence of various other existing supervisory and control mechanisms, it was right in principle that an independent person should be appointed as inspector of prisons, with an appropriate level of authority and with the necessary access to institutions, offenders, staff and management alike <Col N="450" /> to perform his or her task as envisaged by the Whitaker Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to address the proposal in the context of the active review of the question of establishing a prison board which is currently under way in the Department of Justice. Deputies will be aware that this review was one of the specific commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Minister for Justice is not responsible for the Attorney General's office or the procedures whereby the Attorney General carries out his functions under the Extradition Acts.  However, the Minister is informed by that Office that the procedures in question did not contribute to or cause the breakdown of the Anthony Duncan case and that there is no need for an amendment of those procedures.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether it is acceptable to have the Attorney General deliberate on an extradition case on foot of copy documents has already been addressed by the Taoiseach in the course of questions in the House on 29 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> Similarly, the functions of the Minister for Justice do not extend to examining documents to establish their originality. As she already outlined to the House in her statement on 23 May, her functions in relation to extradition applications derive from the power vested in her under section 44 of the 1965 Act to direct that a warrant shall not be endorsed in certain circumstances, as for example, where she is of the opinion that the offence for which return is sought is a political offence, revenue offence or so on.  These are functions which can be fully discharged by reference to a copy of the relevant documents.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly acceptable and, indeed, practical for the Attorney General's office and the Department of Justice to deliberate on an extradition case on foot of copy documents.  An alternative procedure, which would involve all the relevant agencies have to work on the basis of the original documents, would slow down the procedure and increase the likelihood of an original being lost or mislaid at some stage.  As the Deputy is aware, the ability to deal with applications of this kind in a speedy fashion, sometimes within a matter of hours, is often crucial if the objective of the application is to succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Problems in the Irish prison system did not arise overnight.  They are the result of a number of difficulties which have been in existence and growing for many years, including, <i>inter alia</i>, rising prisoner committal levels and longer sentences.  I have been doing all in my power in my period in office to address these problems.  I have dealt with some of the important recommendations made by the Mountjoy Visiting Committee by way of replies to separate questions on today's Order Paper including the appointment of an inspector of prisons and separate remand facilities for prisoners.</P>
      <P>Other important recommendations made by the Committee include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" />
      <i>Introduction of a legal ceiling to numbers in Mountjoy Prison.</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is not a feasible recommendation for the main committal prison in the State.  Every effort is made to keep numbers there within bounds but this proposal does not provide a magic wand to dispose of the prisoners who would have to be turned away if the &ldquo;House Full&rdquo; sign were to go up outside Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Immediate commencement of the building of the Female Prison.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I fully intend to achieve early progress on the building work of a new female prison.  Revised plans and costings in regard to this project are being finalised with a view to their early resubmission to Government.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Restructuring the Permanent Suicide Prevention Committee at Mountjoy.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Contrary to the visiting committee's opinion, the committee in question is a permanent one.  It will now have a representative on a new national prison suicide prevention/awareness committee which I recently set up under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor. This new national committee will include in its membership some of the most experienced prison managers and staff and medical practitioners who are very involved in prisons work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Formulation of one coherent medical services policy.</i>
    </P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five year Plan&rdquo;, to which I have already referred, outlines, at chapter 7, the objectives of the prison medical service. The medical policy aims stated there are based on the principle of equivalence with corresponding care in the community in order to provide publicly accepted standards.  As well as outlining, in a policy sense, how medical services to prisoners should be organised and provided, this document sets out the nature of present difficulties and proposes remedies.  Some of the medical concerns raised in the document have <Col N="458" /> been addressed since its publication. Others are in the process of being addressed.  The five year plan was circulated at the time of publication to all existing prison doctors and the Medical Council and comments were sought. None of those concerned dissented from the tenor or thrust of the comments or proposals outlined in it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Introduction of structures of medical accountability and increasing powers of Medical Director of Prison Services.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I and others have received solicitors' letters on behalf of parties who object to the publication of the visiting committee's comments in relation to medical services at Mountjoy.  I am advised that it would be inappropriate to make further comment on this subject at this time.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of Present guidelines for Padded Cells.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Governor of Mountjoy has already pointed out publicly the sheer practical necessity for putting prisoners in a place of safety when they start being disruptive in prison.  The guidelines in place for the use of padded cells require all such placements to be reported to the Department of Justice and the early involvement of the prison doctor where a stay in the padded cell goes on any longer than overnight.  It is simply not practical to call out the doctor every time the padded cell has to be used for short periods.  Indeed on many occasions it is used at the prisoner's request.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Initiation of a survey to establish the real extent of drug abuse within Mountjoy.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a matter of fact such a study had already been commissioned from a criminologist, now in independent practice, who carried out a similar study on behalf of the Department of Justice back in 1986 when he was a staff member of the Department.  This study was commissioned some months back and I have asked for its early completion.  I intend to publish the findings of the <Col N="459" /> study.  There is nothing to hide in so far as the operation of Mountjoy Prison is concerned.  It will be known that I regularly allow media access to the prison to the point where hardly a week now passes without a media visit to the prison.</P>
    <P>Of course, I recognise that there are problems in Mountjoy Prison, not least because of its age but also because of the growing pressures on the criminal justice system generally in which it plays such a significant part.</P>
    <P>Since I took office there have been several positive changes in the operation and infrastructure in the Mountjoy complex.  These have included the provision of new kitchens and services, new surgeries, search rooms, camera surveillance of visitor boxes, a 90-space drug-free unit in the nearby training unit and a drug treatment unit in the prison itself which will open in the coming weeks.  It should be said, in fairness to the visiting committee, that it has acknowledged these positive developments.</P>
    <P>I am determined to press forward with positive measures and initiatives on a daily basis in Mountjoy and elsewhere in the system and I will continue with that approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>In its report entitled Non Fatal Offences Against the Person, published in 1994, the Law Reform Commission made two recommendations which are relevant: it recommended that the maximum penalty under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875 should be increased to five years (at present it is three months); it recommended a new offence of harassment which &ldquo;would capture, for example, the acts of an infatuated psychotic who follows a woman in order to gain her affection&rdquo;.  The recommendation was that &ldquo;a person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, harasses another by persistently following, watching or besetting him or her in any place, by use of the telephone or otherwise, should be guilty of an offence ...when his or her acts seriously interfered the others peace or privacy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I announced in December 1995 the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to amend the law relating to non-fatal offences against the person, which would take account of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  That legislation is being drafted at the moment and I hope to publish a Bill shortly.</P>
      <P>The Bill will implement the recommendation of the Commission to increase the penalty under section 7 of the 1875 Act at (a) above and will also contain a provision as recommended by the Commission to deal with &ldquo;stalkers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing law which might cover this type of offence is the above-mentioned provision in the Conspiracy and <Col N="462" /> Protection of Property Act, 1875, which makes it an offence where a person &ldquo;with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing or to do any act... wrongfully and without legal authority, (1) uses violence to or intimidates such other person or his wife or children, or injuries his property, or (2) persistently follows such other person about from place to place, or (3) watches or besets the house or other place where such person resides or works, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place.</P>
    <P>This coercion provision, which appears to have been aimed at trade disputes, is not confined to such disputes or to disputes between employer and workman and could be used in suitable cases against &ldquo;stalkers&rdquo;.  The DPPs office has no record of a case of stalking having been reported to them.</P>
    <P>Apart from this a victim of stalking, under the civil law can seek an injunction from the High Court or Circuit Court against the stalker to stop the harassment.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at present for changes in the law in relation to any increase in the maximum aggregate term of imprisonment which may be imposed by the District Court.</P>
      <P>Generally the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed by the District Court for any offence is one year.  However, in certain circumstances the District Court may impose consecutive sentences where the aggregate term does not exceed two years.  The limitations on the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court reflect the fact that the court is one of summary jurisdiction and there are constitutional constraints on the extent of the penalties which it may impose.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 44, 77 and 143 together.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides for an increase in the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the courts.  I obtained Government approval for the appointment of 15 additional judges: three Supreme Court Judges; two High Court Judges; seven Circuit Court Judges and three District Court Judges.  Three judges were appointed to the Supreme Court on 15 April 1996 and three judges were appointed to the resulting vacancies in the High Court on the same date.  The remaining additional appointments will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>While the assignment of judges to particular areas of work such as family law is entirely a matter for the president of the relevant court, I am confident that the appointment of these additional judges will provide the courts with the resources necessary to deal effectively with existing delays and arrears, including family law cases, and assist in the prompt disposal of cases in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Long delays in the hearing of cases can lead to injustices and this is why I am taking all possible steps to ensure the courts have the resources they require to address this problem.  With regard to the courts preventing cases proceeding in certain circumstances because of delays, the position is that the conduct of and decision in any particular court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge who is independent in the exercise of his or her judicial functions.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this time to say if further additional judges would be required following the introduction of legislation permitting divorce.  The situation will, however, be kept under review.</P>
    <P>My Department has obtained the sanction of the Department of Finance for the appointment of 45.5 additional court support staff to assist in the workload of the additional Judges.  To date 14.5 of these staff have been appointed and the remainder will be appointed in conjunction with the remaining judicial appointments.</P>

I also refer the Deputy to the press statement issued by the Garda authorities on 22 May which states that the delay in finalising the investigation was due primarily to the unavailability of key personnel, including personnel in the UK who were involved in the case.</P>

As I stated in that reply, the Garda authorities report that the Garda Criminal Records Office already maintains indexed records of all persons convicted of criminal offences, including persons convicted of sexual offences.  These records are confidential Garda records. The information contained in them is disclosed in certain limited circumstances.</P>
      <P>The limited circumstances in question include the provision by the Garda Síochána of information to employers &mdash; including those in children's residential centres &mdash; on the criminal convictions, if any, recorded in respect of applicants for posts which involve substantial access to children.  The release of such information is, having regard to the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988, subject to the prior written consent of each applicant.</P>

      <Quest>whether the copy documents that she received from the Garda Síochána in the recent Anthony Duncan extradition case on the night and morning of 12 and 13 April 1996, were a complete set including a double-sided copy of the warrant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I already indicated in response to questions following my statement to the House on 23 May 1996, the Department of Justice received a full set of documents from the Garda authorities on the night of 12 April 1996.  These documents did not include a double sided copy of the warrant because the documents were faxed to the Department and the resulting fax copies could not be double sided.  This set of faxed documents was complete and included a fax copy of the <Col N="474" /> full text that, in the normal course, appears on the reverse side of a warrant.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to disclose whether proceedings have been initiated for the extradition of a person from a foreign country, or to supply information in relation to possible pending extradition requests to other countries.  Apart from other considerations, disclosure of information of this kind might hinder Garda action.  I do not propose to depart from the established practice in this instance.</P>

      <P>Several members of the prison service are currently qualified nurses.  Some have psychiatric nursing qualifications while others have general nursing qualifications. Some of these occupy medical orderly positions in the prisons.  Negotiations with the relevant staff representatives on the recruitment of qualified nursing staff into various prisons are progressing.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure a small number of qualified nursing staff from within the medical orderly cadre, together with some nursing assistance from outside the prison brought in on a temporary contract basis will be assigned shortly to nursing duties in Mountjoy Prison.  This will enable a 24-hour nursing service to be available there.</P>
      <P>The proposed introduction of a new nursing service into the prison system creates a requirement for negotiation with relevant staff representatives. Genuine staff sensitivities and issues are involved.  Discussions on this matter are ongoing with the staff representative association and the Minister is pleased to record the constructive approach which they have adopted while, of course, at the same time striving to protect their members' interests.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following the Government's agreement to the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries which set out a comprehensive framework for change in the Civil Service, the report entitled Delivering Better Government was launched throughout the Civil Service on 2 May 1996.  My Department reached all staff associated with it, in total approximately 4,800 people.</P>
      <P>The recommendations for change contained in the report represent a comprehensive and integrated framework for the entire Civil Service, therefore the general principles of the recommendations are not directed specifically at any one Department but at each and every Department, reflecting the different requirements, situations and customers of each one.  The report is part of, rather than the conclusion of, a process which will take several years to complete.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's decision in connection with the launch of Delivering Better Government I am committed to publishing my Department's statement of strategy during 1996.  Work is currently under way on the preparation of this, including a process of full consultation with staff on the contents of the document, which I hope to publish during the summer.  The document will provide a focus for discussion and feedback to the Department's evolving strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time prior to the introduction of the current Strategic Management Initiative, my Department was active in strategic thinking.  Particular examples include: the prisons' strategy document <i>The Management of Offenders</i> published in 1994; the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy Police Document, 1993-97; the planned setting up of a refugee board as proposed in the Refugee Bill now before the Oireachtas; in respect of the courts, the Government has accepted, in principle, the primary recommendation contained in the first report of the Working Group on a <Col N="493" /> Courts Commission that an independent and permanent body to be known as the Courts Service should be established to manage a unified Courts system; the planned conversion of the Land Registry to a semi-State basis; in the drugs area, a review of all law enforcement aspects by my Department resulted in the anti-drugs package published last year; in addition to the above, the preparation of a White Paper on crime is at an advanced stage in the Department.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the forthcoming strategy statement will be the drawing together of the threads of the above initiatives in consultation with other elements of the public service, and other clients, into a coherent overall strategy for my Department to contribute to Government action in support of community security.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Department is actively engaged in examining the case for establishing a prisons board in line with the commitment contained in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>In the case of an indictable offence where a plea of not guilty is entered the length of time between the first appearance of an accused person before the District Court and the date of trial in the Circuit Court or in the Central Criminal Court is governed by three main factors.  The first is the length of time taken to prepare the book of evidence; the second is the length of time between serving the book of evidence on the accused and the making of an order by the District Judge returning the accused for trial and the third is the length of time between the date of that order and the date of the trial.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first factor, the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, provides that the book of evidence shall be served on the accused at the earliest opportunity but, save with the leave of the court, shall not be served later than 30 days after the first appearance of the accused before the court.  It would not be possible to calculate the average length of time involved without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time which would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>In general the length of time attributable to the second factor is one week except in a small number of cases where depositions are requested by either the prosecution or the defence.</P>
      <P>As regards the third factor, the position in the Circuit Court is that, in all but six venues, criminal trials are heard at the next available sitting following a return for trial from the District Court. In five venues the length of time between the return for trial from the District Court to the date of trial in the Circuit Court ranges from four to six months and in one venue it is 15 to 18 months.  In the Central Criminal Court the length of time between the return for trial and the commencement of the trial is on average 13 months.</P>

      <P>Machinery for the determination of claims and proposals relating to conditions of service for members of the force up to an including the rank of chief superintendent is provided under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Matters appropriate for discussion by the Garda conciliation council for ranks covered by the scheme include, <i>inter alia</i>, principles governing superannuation. Under the terms of the scheme this is not an arbitrable matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> In 1982 a claim by the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors to have a number of allowances which are paid to members of the force made pensionable resulted in a disagreed report of the Garda conciliation council. Although, as indicated, this was not an arbitrable matter, the terms of the Second National Understanding, then operable, allowed the matter go before the Garda Síochána Arbitration Board. The board produced its report No. 15 in March 1983 which recommended that certain allowances, including rent allowance, be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982.  The recommendations contained in the Garda Síochána Arbitration Board report No. 15 have been fully implemented.  The report specified that a number of allowances &mdash; collectively known as unsocial hours allowances &mdash; should not be made pensionable.</P>
    <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda conciliation council agreement was reached in March 1994 which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force of garda, sergeant and inspector rank who retired after 1 January 1993.  The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause &mdash; clause 3 &mdash; of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  That claim does not allow for retrospection. It should be noted that overtime is not pensionable.</P>

      <P>The community alert and Neighbourhood Watch initiatives provide a very valuable vehicle for community involvement, protection for the elderly and crime prevention and I am committed to doing what I can to advance them.  In fact, I have initiated a special review of them in the context of the recent report of the task force on the security of the elderly approved by Government on 20 March, which recommended that &ldquo;a comprehensive evaluation and assessment be carried out on all the various community based initiatives to ensure that all areas of the country are adequately covered and that the question of the provision of appropriate funding be examined to ensure that these initiatives can be placed on a secure footing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a review of the community alert scheme last year, I decided to provide £50,000 to Muintir na Tíre this year to encourage an expansion and development of their network of schemes. Neighbourhood Watch, on the other hand, is a community based Garda crime prevention programme and a great deal of Garda resources are already involved in it.  I would have no difficulty in seeking additional resources <Col N="507" /> for Neighbourhood Watch if the Garda authorities required them.</P>

      <P>During the period 1 January to 14 June 1996 a total of 1,288 transfers of prisoners from Mountjoy to other prisons and places of detention took place.  In <Col N="508" /> some cases, however, the same prisoner may have been transferred a number of times and the above figure includes those.  The institutions to which they were transferred were, Place of Detention Wheatfield, Cork Prison, Portlaoise Prison, Limerick Prison, Arbour Hill Prison, Fort Michel, St. Patrick's Institution, Shelton Abbey, Loughan House, Shanganagh Castle and the training unit.</P>
      <P>In addition, prisoners who are accommodated in institutions other than Mountjoy Prison are, following remand appearances in the courts, usually recommitted to Mountjoy Prison.  In most cases these prisoners are routinely transferred back to their &ldquo;original&rdquo; institution.</P>
      <P>These transfers took place for various reasons including, in some cases, the movement of prisoners to institutions nearer their homes to facilitate visits.  In other cases offenders who were considered suitable were transferred to one of the &ldquo;open&rdquo; prisons.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of temporary release, a number of the prisoners referred to above have been granted some form of temporary release since their transfer.  Records are not, however, maintained in such a manner as to identify the precise number falling into this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of those offenders close to the end of their sentences, the vast majority of offenders who are granted temporary release are required to return to the institution from which they were released at regular intervals either to return to custody or to have their release renewed for a further period. Exceptions occur only in a small number of cases; for example, where an offender is released to undergo treatment or therapy on a residential basis. Each institution operates a scheme which enables prisoners to avail of public transport to and, if required, from their home address free of charge following release from custody.  While it is not possible to extract the precise costs sought by the Deputy, the total cost of all travel connected with temporary <Col N="509" /> releases, travel in respect of prisoners who were released on expiry of sentence and remand prisoners freed from a prison on bail in 1995 was £101,000.</P>

      <P>Recidivism, or the propensity for habitual or repeat offending, is a recognised phenomenon in all criminal justice systems. It is very much associated with dysfunctional personalities &mdash; substance abusers, homeless persons and persons with a social background which is disordered. Recidivism is also associated, of course, with so-called professional criminals such as bank robbers and fraudsters who commit crime as a way of life and seem quite prepared to accept the associated risks of detection and punishment.</P>
      <P>Measures which are in place to address recidivism include the provision of non-offending options, particularly for potential young offenders through the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  This scheme has been particularly successful, with a quadrupling of the numbers cautioned over the last six years and, more importantly, 89 per cent of these have not reoffended within their two year supervisory period.</P>
      <P>The courts are, in addition, increasingly availing of alternatives to custody such as probation and community service orders.  Both of these options involve a substantial commitment from the probation and welfare service, which operates under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the prison custodial system there is a wide range of services in place aimed at providing offenders, many of whom are repeat offenders, with the means to avoid becoming reinvolved in crime following their return to the community. This principle revolves around self improvement and a consequent increase in confidence and self esteem, <Col N="511" /> leading the individual toward a non-offending lifestyle.  The services provided include work skills, training and education and are matched where possible to individual aptitudes and abilities, often unrecognised or untapped prior to imprisonment.  There is, in addition, a comprehensive package of medical, psychological and other support services available to assist those suffering from particular problems such as drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Most people will, of course, recognise that recidivism is likely to remain a feature of behaviour amongst those inclined towards criminal activity, but I am committed to take whatever action seems likely to prove beneficial in order to minimise its impact both on the individuals concerned and on society as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Children who come into the care of health boards are placed in foster or residential care.  The cost of keeping a child in residential care is considerably greater than the cost of foster care.  The main reason for the difference is the cost of employing professionally trained staff to care for children on a 24 hour basis.  The cost of maintaining children in care varies from case to case depending on a number of factors, including the age and needs of the child, the type of placement, whether he or she needs specialist counselling, medical or psychological care and the level of supervised access between the child and his or her parents.</P>
      <P>The policy of developing foster care as the preferred option in the case of children at-risk is based on the principle of normalisation as recommended in the report of the Task Force on Child Care Services.  Although I am not aware of any studies that have been conducted on the relative effectiveness of foster care and residential care in this country, I will forward the Deputy a list of international research articles on the subject.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): In May 1995 I asked the National Drugs Advisory Board to report to me on the potential human health consequences of the use of organo-phosphate sheep dips.  This work has been completed and the findings made available to the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other relevant bodies.</P>
      <P>The work involved a review of safety in the use of sheep dips and of the potential ways in which these products can affect human health.  It took into account work done in other countries and the current published literature. The findings emphasised the need for precautions in their use and for appropriate training of those selling and using them.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has now developed training aids for users and training courses for those selling the products are being introduced.</P>

      <P>There is no tax relief available specifically for listed buildings but there is provision in section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended by section 18 of the Finance Act, 1994, for full relief from income tax or corporation tax to the owner or occupier of a building of significant historical, architectural or aesthetic interest in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance, or restoration of such a building, subject to the provision of public access to the building.

Consultants were recently appointed to undertake a study to define the organisational structures required to ensure that the director can fully and effectively discharge his/her functions and that the new unit within Dublin corporation will have optimum operational capacity, functional independence, and self-financing capability. This study is expected to be completed within the next three months.

      <P>I am generally satisfied with the progress made under the various social housing measures, including the shared ownership system and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.  Variations between authorities in the level of activity under individual schemes are to be expected; these reflect such factors as variations in housing needs presented to local authorities, the suitability of individual schemes as a response to these particular needs of different areas, the circumstances of housing applicants, and the level of promotion by authorities of different schemes.  I continue to exhort all authorities to promote the various schemes to their full potential in response to the housing needs of their area.</P>
      <P>The policy document, <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead</i>, published last year, contained a detailed review of the social housing schemes, including the shared ownership and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing schemes, and introduced changes in the schemes to make them more effective in meeting needs.  I have no proposals at this stage to further amend the terms of the schemes.</P>

The determination of individual applications under the scheme is a matter for local authorities who administer the scheme in their areas.  In assessing each application, the local authority must satisfy itself that the applicant complies with the terms and conditions of the scheme and can meet the financial commitments and outgoings.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the pupils attending the schools in question currently have access to the services of a shared remedial teacher.  I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already <Col N="531" /> achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question. However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

This question was explored fully in 1985 <Col N="532" /> when a superannuation scheme was being established for secretaries in primary schools.  At the time the age profile of the caretakers employed under the scheme rendered the proposal impractical.  The position regarding the age profile has worsened in the interim due to the embargo on recruitment which applied from 1993.</P>
      <P>The expansion of caretaking services in primary schools is now being funded through a scheme of additional capitation grants.

      <P>Parity of pay, which is incrementally based, exists between the pay of caretakers at primary level, who are employed under a Department of Education scheme set up in 1979, and the pay of caretakers at second level employed within the vocational education committee and community and comprehensive sectors.  Pay rates are determined at both levels by a relativity to the general operative related grade in the relevant local authority area.  All increases payable under the national pay agreements are automatically <Col N="536" /> passed on to caretakers through the aforementioned relationship with the local authority.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary and secondary schools where the Department provides financial assistance towards the provision of caretaking staff under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the position is that caretakers are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between each caretaker and his or her employer.</P>
      <P>I will arrange to forward to the Deputy the revised pay scales effective from 1 June 1996.</P>

      <P>There are two joint schemes currently operated by my Department and the Arts Council.  One is the writers' workshop scheme which has been running since the early 1980's and the other is the artists workshops scheme which commenced in 1987.  Through these schemes artists and writers have run series of workshops in every prison in the country.  The workshops comprise intensive short-term inputs which complement the on-going art education provided for prisoners by teachers from vocational education committees and the National College of Art and Design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These joint projects form an important part of a strong overall arts programme in the prisons.  For example, every prison has at least one art teacher. Also, music, drama, creative writing and photography are significant parts of the overall Prison Education Programme. Such arts programmes are seen to have <Col N="540" /> very beneficial effects for prisoners in terms of personal development, a therapeutic outlet, an acceptable route into wider education and training and readjustment to society after release. The cost of these joint projects is shared on a 50:50 basis by my Department and the Arts Council.  Currently, the annual contribution by each side runs to about £8,000.</P>
    <P>I would be keen to continue, at the very least, this level of co-operation with the Arts Council and I would not be averse to expanding it further if and when this seems appropriate and desirable. At present, the Department's coordinator of education is in the early stages of discussion with the Arts Council regarding the possibility of introducing a similar scheme in relation to drama, perhaps focused initially in Mountjoy prison where several single drama projects have been very successful and where there is need for further constructive activity for prisoners.</P>

There is within the Garda Síochána a special traffic corps with a unit in every Garda division, which has special responsibility in relation to the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.

Although their primary responsibility is accident prevention and traffic control, members of the traffic corps must also deal with any other police duties to which they may be assigned or which come their way.

As I stated at that time, while it is clear that substance abuse is a factor in certain types of crime, there are no figures available quantifying the actual number <Col N="542" /> of offences in which substance abuse is a factor.  It should be borne in mind that it is not always possible to state, with any degree of accuracy, the extent to which substance abuse may be a factor in any particular case.

These include: increased use in the Dublin metropolitan area of the summons as an alternative to the charge procedure, computerised summons application and issuing procedures which allow for court dates to be fixed for a rostered working day of the garda concerned, computerised scheduling of court cases so that cases relevant to a particular garda are listed together for hearing, the vehicle rectification scheme in the Dublin metropolitan area which allows motorists to repair vehicle faults within a specified period as an alternative to prosecution and consequent attendance in court and the number of Garda requests for remands is kept to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I will be making changes on the legislative front to reduce the amount of Garda time spent in court.  A Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation, will make changes in criminal procedure particularly with a view to reducing the amount of time gardaí have to spend in court.  The proposed Bill will streamline arrangements in relation to remands in custody and will provide for the giving of certain Garda evidence by certificate thus <Col N="544" /> reducing the amount of Garda time spent in court.</P>
    <P>I should also refer to the working group which I established towards the end of last year to review the operation of the courts system and to consider the establishment of a courts commission which would act as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy.  This working group, which was chaired by Judge Susan Denham, presented its first report recently.  It is now continuing its work to review the day to day operation of the courts in accordance with its terms of reference and I look forward to receiving further reports in this regard.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the Commissioner has made recommendations to the working group concerning Garda involvement in the courts systems.</P>

However, the Garda Síochána conducted a survey in 1991 to estimate the extent to which vehicles are uninsured.  This survey indicated that the national level of uninsured driving was about 6 per cent.  A similar survey was also carried out recently.  The results are not yet available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Garda strength as of 17 June, 1996, is 10,730 members.  In addition there are 442 students currently in training. Approximately 87 of these trainees are due to be attested to the force tomorrow.  In making comparisons with <Col N="547" /> personnel figures in the mid 1980s I should point out that prior to 1989 all Garda recruits were included in the overall strength figures.  This means that the relevant comparisons are 11,400 in the mid 1980s and 11,172 in 1996.  Since the introduction of the two year training programme for recruits in April 1989, only those members who have completed phase three of training have been included in the overall strength of the force.</P>
      <P>The change in the strength of the force provides no basis for concluding less effective policing.  It can be compensated for by more effective operational deployment, by greater civilianisation and by the introduction of better management tools such as the information technology plan costing £26 million which is about to be implemented. There are now approximately 680 civilian clerical staff within the Garda Síochána as compared with 420 in 1985.</P>
      <P>I recruited 350 gardaí last year, and will recruit the same number this year and next.  Retirements have been higher than normal in recent years for exceptional reasons such as the ending of the temporary extension from 57 to 60 of the retirement age and the added pensionability of unsocial hours payments. Current trends suggest that retirement levels this year will be lower than in recent years.</P>
      <P>The current Garda recruitment competition covers the period 1994 to 1997. I expect to submit my proposals for Garda recruitment for the next three to four year period to Government later this year.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should point out that the allocation of extra police to Border BSE duty is not unique in the sense that there has always been a need, from time to time, to concentrate resources to deal with one emergency situation or another.  The manpower and resources allocated to the Garda Síochána take account of such needs.</P>

      <P>The EU budgetary allocation for the top-up ewe premium to Irish sheep producers in the non-disadvantaged areas, agreed at the December 1995 meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers, has been provided. Payment of the premium, however requires the preparation of specific legislation by the EU Commission.  The Commission has submitted a proposal to the Council for a regulation to implement this agreement but the proposal cannot be adopted until the European Parliament delivers its opinion, which is not now expected until July.  I would hope that the Council will adopt the proposal as soon as possible after the opinion of the European Parliament has been delivered.  Payment will then be made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 155 and 156 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Horses Bill, 1996, is intended to provide for the control of <Col N="552" /> horses and to make provision for the licensing of horses in urban and other areas where they cause a danger to persons or property or nuisance.  It will not deal directly with the breeding of horses.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, which are administered by the Garda Síochána, are adequate to deal with any problems of abuse of horses. As indicated in the House on 29 May, 1996, it is proposed that the penalty provisions of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, be recast to include penalties for conviction on indictment.  Section 45 of the Bill provides that the maximum penalties under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, will be as follows: on summary conviction a fine of £1,500 or six months' imprisonment or both and on conviction on indictment a fine of £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.  This provision seeks to address a limitation of the existing Act in that it contains only minor penalties on summary conviction.  The new provision will be a more stringent deterrent against cruelty to all animals, including horses.</P>
    <P>There is as yet no indication of the number of horses that will remain unclaimed from pounds following the implementation of the Bill.  The question of disposal of such horses must be deferred until the proposed legislation is in place and begins to take effect.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the Communication Workers' Union's enthusiastic and proactive involvement in the preparation of Telecom Éireann to manage globalisation and deregulation in the industry, if he will give Telecom Éireann workers a commitment that a decision will be made in principle to permit the employees to purchase a significant equity stake on the basis of fair value, that immediate access will be given to Communication Workers' Union consultants to all financial and other data to permit a formal bid to be constructed and a decision will be made that the staff of the company will be regarded as a third strategic partner and that no deal will be concluded with either TeleDenmark or KPN/Telia that does not specifically provide for the separate negotiation of corporate governance and shareholders rights for the employee stake; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government fully recognises the contribution that the employees of Telecom <Col N="555" /> Éireann can make to the future development of the company and its mandate for the negotiation of an equity-based strategic alliance stated that, subject to certain conditions, it was willing to consider setting aside up to 5 per cent of the company's share capital for an employee shareholding scheme.</P>
      <P>The alliance process is now entering its final phase.  The potential partners involved in the alliance process have indicated their willingness to accept the concept of an employee shareholding scheme and to explore and clarify the contribution that such a scheme can make to the future development of the company.</P>
      <P>When a strategic alliance is agreed, it will be possible to look forward to sitting down with employees to discuss what may be possible by way of developments in the longer-term in the interest of all parties involved, in particular the scope and nature of employee shareholding.  Arrangements to give effect to this, including access to information, will be made with the unions and its advisers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 to 165, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are acting on an agency basis on behalf of the Department of the Marine in respect of the Loran C project and are paid a management charge in this regard.  The commissioners calculate this charge on the basis of percentages of the salaries of a number of their staff who are involved in work relating to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date no moneys have been paid in respect of fees to solicitors or junior and senior counsel in relation to Loran C court proceedings.  These fees have not been referred to the taxing master. However, legal fees in respect of an earlier planning appeal were submitted to the taxing master who allowed senior counsel and the solicitors their full fees. While the Chief State Solicitor's office has accepted the taxing master's <Col N="557" /> decision in respect of the solicitor's fees, senior counsels' fees are the subject of a Supreme Court appeal.</P>
