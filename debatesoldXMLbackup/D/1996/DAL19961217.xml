      <P>Before dealing with the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Michael Smith.  I did not observe the Deputy <Col N="3" /> earlier but I now propose to call him and put the items outlined by the Minister to the House later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the House suspend Standing Orders of the Dáil to debate an urgent matter, namely, the invasion by the hierarchy of Fine Gael in north Tipperary into the privacy of the ballot box by deliberately orchestrating the removal of the names of potential voters from the voters' register and, in particular, depriving many young people of their fundamental and democratic rights; and the urgent need for the Government to take appropriate action to restore these rights.</P>

      <P>Regarding No. 18, I thank the Minister for his co-operation.  It is a rare achievement for an Opposition spokesperson to have a Bill passed.  This legislation will provide access to voting for people with disabilities.  This is a matter of concern to members of the disabled community who will be entitled to vote in the <Col N="4" /> next general election under the new arrangements.  It is a significant achievement on Deputy Wallace's part that this legislation will be placed on the Statute Book.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The investigation of an individual crime is a matter for the Garda Síochána.

Those measures are clearly taking effect.</P>

      <P>When will promised legislation on school attendance be introduced, given the serious problem regarding the presence of 13 to 15 year old children on our streets?  Perhaps the proposed legislation could be retitled the &ldquo;right to education&rdquo; Bill because this is a growing problem and urgent action is required to cater for the needs of these children.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a period spanning more than 200 years, Dublin's docklands have made an invaluable contribution to the development of Dublin as a port and as a city.  It was the need to reclaim land to accommodate the increasing size of ocean-going vessels which led to the working port moving into the docklands area from further west along the Liffey quays in the 18th century.  The <Col N="9" /> profile of the area rose dramatically on the strength of this trend.</P>
    <P>Ironically, in the case of the docklands, it was the very same forces which had once led to the area's growth that also prompted its decline.  The need for ever deeper berthage to cope with the development of larger ships and the containerisation of cargo saw the port continue to move further eastwards.  The bulk of the working port is now concentrated outside the original docklands area, on the north docks to the east of the East Link Bridge.</P>
    <P>Now that the principal port activities have moved on, the docklands area left behind is mixed in character.  On the one hand, the area has obsolete and undesirable uses and many vacant sites, all with significant adverse visual and amenity implications.  On the other hand, it contains many features of heritage value which bear testimony to the area's heyday as part of the working port of Dublin.  The docklands are also home to a number of strong residential communities and it has significant amenity potential with its network of waterways.  Its location close to the city centre adds considerably both to the importance of the area in terms of the wider city and to the development potential of the area.  The extent of land in the area under the control of public bodies is also of some significance.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government's initiative is to harness the collective energies of all the interests in the area for the purposes of securing the area's regeneration.  The special purpose authority for the area, which this Bill provides for, will act as the engine driving this process.  It has the potential to secure the vital synergies between the actions of the individual players in the area which would otherwise be lost.</P>
    <P>In announcing the docklands regeneration initiative in this year's budget, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, described the large area on both sides of the Liffey which makes up the docklands as an area in transition.  The area is, in effect, at a crossroads.  To ensure that the many diverse interests in the area do not read the signposts at the crossroads in different ways, the Government decided that a master plan should be prepared to which all concerned could subscribe.  Before I get into the detail of the Bill, let me outline what has been done so far to chart the course ahead.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the budget, a Docklands Task Force representative of the key Departments and semi-State organisations involved was established.  Its remit was twofold.  First, it was asked to consider what arrangements should be made to prepare the master plan for the docklands area.  Second, it was to make recommendations on the appropriate mechanism for the master plan's implementation.</P>
    <P>The task force considered these issues separately and speedily, yet thoroughly, and submitted its report to Government in April.  It concluded that the master plan should be <Col N="10" /> prepared by a team of consultants with the diverse range of expertise which would be required if the very many issues facing the area were to be addressed.  It also recommended the establishment of a new authority which would lead the implementation of the master plan and, ultimately, the regeneration of the docklands area.</P>
    <P>In late April the Government considered the report of the task force and accepted these two principal recommendations.  The first recommendation has been implemented through the appointment of a broadly-based team of consultants whose work on the preparation of the docklands master plan is now well under way. The Bill we are debating today fulfils the Government's commitment to the implementation of the task force's second recommendation, that is, the establishment of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, also been other factors which have influenced the development of the docklands regeneration initiative.  One of the most significant of these is the wealth of urban renewal experience which we have gained since the first urban renewal scheme was introduced in 1986.  Ten years ago parts of the heart of our inner urban areas were beginning to suffer the urban equivalent of heart disease.  They were simply not able to continue to fulfil their role as the force driving the blood of the urban economy.  Much of this role had by then been assumed by smaller, leaner satellites in the suburbs.  Although sustainability was not a word much in vogue at that stage, it was clear that the suburbanisation process which had become established was unsustainable.  Ever increasing suburban development compelled us to provide a whole range of infrastructural services which were already available with spare capacity in city and town centres.</P>
    <P>The aim of the urban renewal schemes was to encourage investment back to the hearts of our urban areas.  Under the first scheme introduced in 1986 and its successor which came into operation in 1994, areas designated for urban renewal have seen some £1.9 billion of investment to date.  The schemes have, therefore, recorded remarkable success in achieving their principal aims.  A consultants' study on urban renewal published only last week strongly supports this view.</P>
    <P>However, the past ten years have shown us that the health of the hearts of our urban areas is not dependent only on investment or physical renewal.  There must also be social renewal where local communities have a role in determining the way their area is renewed and benefit from that process.  There is also a much deeper appreciation of the importance of architectural and urban design considerations in shaping our urban centres.</P>
    <P>The consultants' study on the urban renewal <Col N="11" /> schemes makes extensive recommendations on how these issues can be more fully addressed in the future.  These recommendations are currently being considered as part of an overall review of urban renewal policy.  A consultative process has been initiated in relation to the recommendations with a view to developing proposals for future policy on urban renewal to be considered by the Government in the first half of next year.  Even though the review has not yet been concluded, we have learned much from what has so far emerged from it.  Many of the provisions in the Bill reflect that learning process.</P>
    <P>Another important factor which has influenced the docklands regeneration initiative is the experience gained in the Custom House Docks and Temple Bar.  The docklands area includes the Custom House docks, home of the International Financial Services Centre which has now firmly established itself on the global financial services map.  The new Docklands Authority to be established by the Bill will be at a considerable advantage in having this ready-made engine for further growth available to it.  One has only to look at the constantly growing demand for office space in the IFSC from approved companies for evidence of the centre's growth potential in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Much of the success achieved to date in the IFSC is due largely to the tireless efforts of the Custom House Docks Development Authority which, since 1986, has, with the help of the powers given to it under the Urban Renewal Acts, acted as the driving force in turning the Custom House docks area around.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Authority's considerable achievements.  The 3,500 people now employed in IFSC and non-IFSC companies in the area will stand as testimony to the Authority's ten successful years, long after it is subsumed into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to be established under the proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Temple Bar we have seen the importance of an architectural framework plan in facilitating the introduction of imaginative, modern, yet sympathetic, architectural styles.  Both the Temple Bar and Custom House Docks models have also highlighted the success which can be achieved when a specially dedicated organisation is established to lead a regeneration initiative.  At the same time, the size and nature of the docklands show us clearly that the area requires more sophisticated structures than a simple replication of either the Temple Bar or Custom House Docks models could provide.  Bringing together the wide range of interests in the docklands area will be a fundamental requirement for the successful completion of the regeneration voyage we are about to undertake.</P>
    <P>Many influences have been brought to bear in framing this Bill.  The influence of the urban renewal experience gained over the last ten years is clear from the mandate being given to the new <Col N="12" /> Authority.  While recognising the importance of improving the area's physical environment, the Authority's remit will be considerably wider, encompassing the sustainable social and economic regeneration of the area.  The unique structures of the new Authority reflect the need for a more sophisticated model than those employed in the Custom House Docks and Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>The Authority will have two arms.  It will have a council which will be representative of the local authority, State bodies, local development and community interests in the area and will be responsible for the principal policy making functions of the Authority.  The Authority's executive functions will be exercised by an executive board.  In recognition of the importance of the International Financial Services Centre and the Government's commitment to it, the Authority will have a specific statutory duty to promote the further development of financial services activities in the Custom House docks area.  While the Custom House Docks Development Authority has, in effect, been exercising a similar function since the IFSC was established in 1987, it does not have the express statutory duty to promote the centre as the new Authority will have under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the individual provisions of the Bill in more detail.  The 58 sections are split into four Parts and there are three Schedules. Part I of the Bill contains sections 1 to 13.  These include the usual technical provisions in relation to short Title, commencement, interpretation, the power to make orders and regulations, repeal of enactments and expenses of the Minister. Provision is also made in section 11 for the indemnification of certain persons connected with the Authority in relation to the bona fide performance of their functions.  Under section 12, the Authority will not be liable for damages because of a failure to perform any of the functions provided for in the Bill.  Section 13 deals with the prosecution of offences under the Bill and the penalties applying to such offences.</P>
    <P>Part II is the most significant part of the Bill, covering sections 14 to 47.  Section 14 provides for the establishment of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority or, as Gaeilge, Údarás Forbartha Dugthailte Bhaile Átha Cliath, which will consist of a chairperson, a council and an executive board.</P>
    <P>Under section 15, the chairperson of the Authority will be appointed by the Minister for the Environment.  The term of office of the chairperson will usually be five years.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the establishment of the council which will consist of the chairperson and 25 ordinary members.  While the ordinary members are to be formally appointed by the Minister for the Environment, the Bill ensures that they will be drawn from a range of sectors, reflecting the many interests involved in the area. The relevant Government Departments and semi-State bodies will be represented on the <Col N="13" /> council as will Dublin Corporation, at both elective and official level.  There will also be representation for organisations concerned with the social, economic or other development of the area, as well as community-based organisations. The town planning, urban design, architectural, conservation and engineering professions will also be represented on the council, as will individuals with experience in a range of areas which are of relevance to the Authority's functions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the establishment of the executive board which will have eight members. This will include the chairperson and seven ordinary directors appointed by the Minister for the Environment for terms of up to five years. Section 18 sets out the functions of the Authority. Under this section, the Authority will be obliged to secure the sustainable social and economic regeneration of the docklands area, the improvement of the area's physical environment and the continued development of financial services activities in the Custom House Docks area.  The remit of the Authority will be quite broad reflecting the wide range of factors which have a bearing on the regeneration of an area which covers 1,300 acres and is home to over 21,000 people.  The participation and inclusion of local communities in the regeneration of the area will be vital.  As the future of the docklands area will obviously have an important impact on the futures of its people, it is only right that they should have an important role in shaping that future and be in a position to reap its benefits.</P>
    <P>The types of activities in which the new Authority will be able to get involved will be very varied.  For example, it will be able to develop land, carry out environmental improvement works and make provision for infrastructure.  It will also be able to promote the co-ordination of investment in the area and the development of an appropriate mix of housing.  Provision is also made in this section for further functions in relation to the regeneration of the docklands area to be assigned to the Authority.</P>
    <P>Sections 19, 20 and 21 set down the duties and functions of the chairperson, the council and the executive board.  Section 19 provides that the chairperson will be responsible for securing the efficient discharge of the business of the Authority, by virtue of chairing both the council and the executive board.  Section 20 sets out the functions of the Authority which are to be the responsibility of the council.  In line with the report of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force, the council will be responsible for policy matters, including the preparation of the master plan under section 24 and the making of planning schemes under section 25.  Its functions will also include making certain recommendations to the executive board and to Ministers.  The remainder of the functions of the Authority, other than those assigned to the council under section 20, will, under section 21, be the responsibility of the <Col N="14" /> executive board.  Sections 22 and 23 are standard provisions governing the meetings and procedures of the council and the executive board.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the preparation of the master plan for the docklands area.  It will serve as the blueprint for the Authority's fulfilment of the general duty imposed on it by section 18. Provision is made for significant public consultation in the course of the master plan's preparation, reflecting the critical importance of bringing all the interests in the area together in support of it.  Work on the preparation of the master plan, including extensive consultations with all the interests in the area, has been initiated in parallel to the preparation of this Bill. This will ensure the new Authority, once established, will lose no time in getting the docklands initiative formally under way.  It will facilitate the Authority's early consideration of a range of proposals now being developed by the consultants preparing the master plan.</P>
    <P>The consultants' work has benefited from the completion of a number of studies on the docklands area commissioned by the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  These studies cover the area's socio-economic profile, its land-use and building conditions and the important features of its architecture and industrial archaeology, all key factors to be considered in preparing a workable, viable master plan.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the making of planning schemes for certain areas, the effect of which is to exempt development complying with the scheme from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  This power was available to the Custom House Docks Development Authority in respect of the Custom House docks area and schemes were made in 1987 and 1994.  The process of making a planning scheme provides for consultation with Dublin Corporation and requires the Authority to have regard to the corporation's development plan.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Custom House docks area, the new Authority will also be able to exercise the power to make planning schemes in respect of other areas specified by order of the Minister for the Environment under section 25 (1) (a).  It is envisaged that the power to make orders for this purpose would only be used where very special circumstances exist, which would make the planning scheme approach appropriate.  Under section 6 (3), any order made under section 25 (1) (a) would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it could come into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for an environmental impact assessment in connection with certain planning schemes prepared under section 25. While under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, any development to which EIA applies may be included in a planning scheme, section 25 (1) (c) will place a restriction on this.  In future, the types of EIA-type development which may be included <Col N="15" /> in a planning scheme will be limited to industrial estates, urban development projects and seawater marinas.  If any other development to which EIA applies is proposed for an area covered by a planning scheme, it will be subject to the normal requirements of the planning process.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the compulsory acquisition by the Authority of land other than land owned by statutory bodies which, under section 28, may, in certain circumstances, be transferred from such bodies to the new authority.  Similar powers are available to the Custom House Docks Development Authority at present and they are being replicated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 to 33 deal with the financing requirements of the new Authority.  The extent of these requirements can only be considered by the Government once the master plan, which will include costings and funding options, has been completed early next year.  Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the docklands task force, the Bill provides for a range of funding mechanisms to be available to the Authority.  The extent to which each will be used will be determined in light of the financing element of the master plan and the decision by the Government on it.</P>
    <P>The funding mechanisms which are provided for include grants under section 29, borrowings under section 30, some of which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance under section 31, and Exchequer advances under section 33.  The Authority's power to borrow will be subject to a ceiling of £50 million on the amount of borrowings outstanding at any given time.  The maximum amount of this which can be sourced from Exchequer advances will be £25 million.</P>
    <P>Section 34 will enable the Authority to ensure it has an adequate number of employees, subject to appropriate ministerial consents in relation to numbers, gradings and terms of employment. This power is subject to the requirement of section 56, under which the existing employees of the Custom House Docks Development Authority will transfer to the new Authority on its establishment.  Under section 35, the Authority will be able to make provision for the superannuation of its employees.  Section 36 is a standard provision which will enable the Authority to engage consultants and advisers where it considers it necessary to do so to discharge its functions.  Under section 37, it will also be able to accept services provided to it by a statutory body.</P>
    <P>Sections 38 and 39 are standard provisions under which the chairperson, ordinary directors of the executive board and employees of the Authority are prohibited from also being members of Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann, the European Parliament or a local authority.  As some of the ordinary members of the council are to be drawn from the elected members of Dublin Corporation, who may also be Deputies, Senators <Col N="16" /> or MEPs, the prohibitions of sections 38 and 39 will not apply to ordinary membership of the council to be established under section 16.</P>
    <P>Section 40 deals with the disclosure of interests by certain employees, consultants, etc. and is modelled on a corresponding provision in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The section will not apply to the chairperson, ordinary members of the council, ordinary directors of the executive board or certain employees of the Authority, on the basis that the corresponding provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, will be applied to those positions.  Section 41 will regulate the disclosure of confidential information by persons associated with the Authority, while section 42 prohibits the making of improper communications to such persons.</P>
    <P>Under section 43, the Authority will be permitted to accept gifts of money, land or property.  However, it will be precluded from doing so if the conditions governing the acceptance of the gift would conflict with the effective performance of its statutory functions. The Authority will also be required to publish details of all gifts accepted by it in its annual reports.  Section 44 is a standard provision in relation to keeping accounts and carrying out audits.  Section 45 will require the Authority to prepare an annual report on its activities and to provide the Minister for the Environment with such other information relating to the performance of its functions as he or she may request.</P>
    <P>Under section 46, the Minister for the Environment will be empowered to give to the Authority policy directives and directives in relation to financial objectives.  This is a balanced provision which allows the Minister to make directives which would apply generally to the Authority's performance of its functions, while at the same time making clear that it does not confer any power or control in relation to the Authority's exercise of its functions in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Section 47 makes provision for the dissolution of the Authority by way of order made by the Minister for the Environment.  As was made clear in the report of the Dublin docklands area task force, the Authority will not have an infinite life but should aim to fully carry out its duties over a period of ten to 15 years.  Once the Authority has completed its work, section 47 will enable an order to be made to dissolve it and to make the provisions consequential on this.</P>
    <P>Part III covering sections 48 to 57 sets out the transitional provisions which will apply to the subsuming of the Custom House Docks Development Authority into the new Authority. Section 48 provides for the transfer of all land and other property from the Custom House Docks Development Authority to the new Authority, while section 49 makes a similar provision in relation to rights and liabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 50 is necessary to provide for the continuation in force of a range of contractual and other agreements.  This will be done by <Col N="17" /> replacing the reference to the Custom House Docks Development Authority in each such case with a reference to the name of the new Authority established under this Bill.  Sections 51 and 52 make similar provisions in relation to the continuation of pending legal proceedings and the construction of certain references to the Custom House Docks Development Authority respectively.  Section 55 provides for the continued admissibility in evidence of documents of the Custom House Docks Development Authority after its dissolution.</P>
    <P>Section 53, which provides an exemption from stamp duty in respect of the vesting in the new Authority of property or rights transferred under the Bill, is a standard provision where transfers between public bodies are being provided for. Section 54 provides for the preparation of the final accounts of the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  Section 56 provides for the transfer of all the employees of the Custom House Docks Development Authority to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. Under section 57, the Custom House Docks Development Authority will be dissolved on the establishment day.  The establishment day is the day to be specified under section 14 on which the new Authority will be established.  Section 58, the only provision in Part IV of the Bill, provides for a number of technical amendments of sections 4 and 7 of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, in relation to the making of orders and rates remission schemes under that Act.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill describes the Dublin docklands area which corresponds to the area outlined at Appendix 1 of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force report.  Under section 4, the Minister for the Environment may make an order adjusting the area, either by way of adding contiguous areas or excluding areas currently included.  The Second Schedule describes the Custom House Docks Area which corresponds to the area currently defined as such by virtue of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and orders made under the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987.  Section 5 of the Bill makes a similar provision to that in section 2 of the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987, under which the area can be extended eastwards as far as the East Wall road.  The Third Schedule lists the repeals to be made by the Bill.  Part IV of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, which provided for the establishment of the Custom House Docks Development Authority, and the entire Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987, are to be repealed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have gathered, this is an elaborate and comprehensive Bill.  Its comprehensiveness is dictated by the need to establish structures which will provide for the widest possible degree of participation in the Authority's work and to clearly set out the comprehensive mandate which is being assigned to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> I look forward to the master plan for the area taking shape and to seeing its proposals being translated into reality.  The establishment of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority will be the critical factor in that process.  The regeneration of the docklands area is, of course, not only important for the area itself, it is also of immense strategic importance to the city of Dublin and the vibrant development of the economy as a whole.  A city, like any living organism, requires a healthy, beating heart.  As a critical part of the heart of Dublin, the health and vitality of the docklands will be of enormous value to a city which has seen many other parts of its central area regenerated in recent years.  I commend the Bill to the House with great enthusiasm.</P>

      <P>This Bill follows the successful path blazed for urban renewal by Fianna Fáil in Government.  On behalf of my party I welcome the Bill in principle as, in the main, its provisions are satisfactory.  It is the intention of Fianna Fáil to use the limited time available to debate this important legislation to point out what we consider the serious omissions in the Government's proposals, namely the needs of the local community.</P>
      <P>The missing chapter in this Bill is the social chapter.  On the north and south docks two issues predominate: houses and jobs.  Those issues are not addressed in this Bill and until they are this legislation will be incomplete.</P>
      <P>This Bill potentially changes the face and life of the city forever.  The river and port are literally the lifeblood of the city.  The river's edge is a boundary indelibly imprinted on the mind of every Dubliner.  In legend and fiction the river is the living symbol of Dublin.  Fianna Fáil priority is to ensure that the water's edge continues to be a living place for the communities who have lived and worked there for generations.  This Bill does not address the agenda of the local communities. We will not stand idly by and allow the displacement of the indigenous community by default.  The docks must not be turned into a theme park for gawkers.  When we debate many issues on Dublin, people give out about the traffic in and out of the port.  It is of huge concern to many communities but the port was there first and the city grew up around it.  We cannot forget that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local people who have made their life on the docks for generations are already being displaced.  The Dublin Docklands Area master plan that preceded this Bill graphically outlined the decline of the indigenous communities.  I congratulate those involved in the plan as it is an excellent one.  A lot of work went into it and <Col N="19" /> some interesting facts and figures came out of that research.</P>
    <P>There are now 16,700 people remaining in the docklands.  A significant proportion of that population is elderly &mdash; 13.7 per cent, against a city average of 9.6 per cent.  Younger people have not been staying in the area.  The social profile has changed as the number of families has declined.  Flats and bedsits comprise 36 per cent of households against a city average of 18 per cent.  The encroachment of flatland into these areas has also entailed in many instances a degradation of the housing stock.  Correspondingly, the number of households in conventional houses is far lower than the average: 63 per cent against a city average of 85 per cent. The area has a far higher than average incidence of single person households, 34 per cent against a city average of 21 per cent.  The age structure of the area is characterised not only by a higher number of people over 65 but also by a higher than average percentage of households headed by persons under 24 years.  Households headed by people between the ages of 30 and 50 are correspondingly under-represented.  There is a substantially higher percentage of households rented from the local authority in the docklands: 34 per cent against a city average of 14 per cent. In keeping with the age and quality of the housing stock a higher percentage of households depend on solid fuel only or solid fuel with a back boiler.</P>
    <P>These facts translate into an equally depressing employment and education profile.  Of 21,000 jobs in the area covered by this Bill only 8 per cent are held by local people.  The school dropout rate before the leaving certificate is 19 per cent higher than the city average.  At the upper end of the social spectrum only 5.25 per cent of people are in the higher professions.</P>
    <P>When the master plan was published on 20 November I said in a statement on behalf of Fianna Fáil:</P>
    <P>I believe that development in the docks must be spearheaded by an integrated education and jobs plan for the local community.  Education is the key to access.  We must reverse the situation whereby participation in third level is appallingly low.  Local people must be positioned to take advantage of development. Traditional jobs on the docks and in other major industries have disappeared.  I do not want the docks to become a playground for the upwardly mobile.  The unique commercial potential of the area must be harnessed for the local people who have lived and worked in the area for generations.</P>
    <P>Those people are part and parcel of Dublin in Ringsend on the southside and the North Wall on the northside.  People identify them as the heart and soul of Dublin.  It is important they are encouraged to get jobs and stay in the area.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that a Minister for the Environment <Col N="20" /> from the Labour Party, which made its fortune using the jargon of equality and access, should now ignore these principles.  This Bill will likely represent the Minister's only lasting achievement. He has successively avoided all the main issues on his Department's agenda.</P>

      <P>It is not unbelievable.  This Bill, for good or evil, will probably prove the exception.  The very real danger is that it will be for the benefit of everybody except the local community, who most deserve to benefit from it. The failure of this Bill to address the social reality of the docks communities is a huge omission which must be redressed.</P>
      <P>As a representative of people living in the docks area, I want a clear commitment from the Minister that he will meaningfully address on Committee Stage the issues of education, training and housing in the area.  It is ironic that, although the area is surrounded by third level institutions, people from the Inishowen peninsula or the Ring of Kerry have a better chance of access to third level.  Some 35 per cent of the local labour force have primary education only against a city average of 19 per cent.  An additional 23 per cent have only lower second level education.  Only 13 per cent of the local labour force have completed the leaving certificate.  The disparity in educational attainment is matched by a substantial disparity in employment figures.  Some 19 per cent of family unit heads in the docks area are unemployed against a city average of 11 per cent.  The threat posed to local people by this Bill is that development will be for more advantaged outsiders while local housing will be priced out of locals' reach by an influx of professionals.  Local people have only 8 per cent of local jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> The Minister is probably aware that his colleague, myself and a number of others have encouraged a local community housing project in the Ringsend area which is now going into a third phase.  Approximately 50 houses will eventually be built in the local area.  This is an important step in the right direction.  There is a mix of private and local authority housing, affordable housing and housing co-operatives.  This would be a good model on which to provide access to housing for local people in the docklands area.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls for the provision of housing, education and training initatives in the Bill.  The education needs of the local communities must be assessed with the input of local people determining the results.  I want this to be provided for in the Bill.  The Department of Education must give a commitment to set up the necessary structures and the Authority set up by the Bill must also give a commitment to providing resources to operate those structures.  Jobs training with the involvement of the relevant agencies, predicated on local needs as determined by local people, must be an essential element of the operation of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has patented the jargon of access.  No Labour Party Minister needs to be reminded of the new age mantra of words like access, early education, equality, outreach and consultation which they have made part of their credo.  For the people on the north and south docks, these words must ring hollow.  This Bill, the single largest piece of urban planning in the history of the State, is for buildings, not people. If the Minister has his way, the docklands communities will continue to disperse and the waterfront will become the exclusive preserve of the rich.</P>
    <P>Formal mechanisms must be put in place to target jobs and other benefits created by this Bill. This must apply from the construction stage to the establishment of new industries, commercial projects and other ventures.  There is a widespread recognition of the need to match jobs with training.  It is also accepted that many training schemes, at the end of which there are no job opportunities, achieve little for trainees or trainers.  One way to proceed is for the working group established by CHDDA in collaboration with principals and career guidance teachers of local schools and IFSC companies to set up a monitoring scheme.  The aim is to inform local young people about the opportunities presented by the IFSC and to encourage them to stay at school in order to attain entry level qualifications. This type of scheme offers the possibility of young people gaining high level employment in the IFSC.  However, it must not be treated as a pilot project or simply ignored as it is by this Bill. The same approach must be expanded upon and spread throughout the docklands area.</P>
    <P>The importance of training schemes such as those mentioned emphasises the need for early integration of job-related training into the urban renewal process.  Local communities should be <Col N="22" /> actively encouraged to prepare in advance for the arrival of new businesses so that they might possess some of the necessary skills to compete for these jobs once they become available.  FÁS has a central role to play.  Training and education programmes must be designed and implemented in advance of or parallel with development.  As currently organised, FÁS and the vocational education committee do not have the flexibility to respond on demand to training requirements. This reinforces the need for planning and a cross-sectoral approach to urban renewal, something absent from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Housing, education and jobs are key issues facing local communities.  Urban renewal can generate huge investments but these must be carefully channelled.  At the top of the agenda must be the creation of affordable local housing for local people.  Clearly the one ingredient in urban renewal which has not worked to date is social housing.  Temple Bar, which is generally a great success, has failed to generate significant social housing.  However, it is hoped that a new scheme will shortly begin with a considerable amount of social housing.  Co-operatives such as the successful one in Ringsend which I, as a local councillor and Deputy, have been involved with are one option.  More flexible and imaginative use of local authority mortgages and shared ownership schemes must be to the fore in housing planning.  Private housing, where it qualifies for incentives, must be targeted to larger family style units.  Dublin has enough studio flats.  All these considerations, if they are not to be platitudes, must be incorporated in the Bill from the start.</P>
    <P>In the anticipated 20 year life of the legislation, we are unleashing potentially huge market forces. Action later rather than sooner for the local communities will be too little too late.  There is a missing chapter in this proposed legislation, namely the social chapter.  I and my party believe it is not right that those who are likely to benefit enormously from this Bill should have an in-built opt out from addressing the social consequences for the local communities most affected by their developments.  It is extraordinary that this <i>laissezfaire</i> approach should be sponsored by the Labour Party.  The docklands area is characterised in the public mind by physical dereliction and social stagnation.  Unfortunately, this is often the case.  Within the area there are also vibrant communities operating thriving initiatives.  This is a huge area which will need many different approaches.  Many communities need only a little extra support.  Small initiatives may in many instances make the difference for many families and groups.  Huge natural advantages lie within the grasp of these historic communities.  The city is on their doorstep.  The port and canal basins offer opportunities for development that this legislation rightly recognises.  Fianna Fáil intends to ensure that those opportunities are used for the advantage of local people.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (5) (a) of the Bill requires that the <Col N="23" /> corporation shall consider the making of a development plan variation to ensure that it is consistent with the master plan prepared by the Docklands Development Authority.  Some would argue that, as the development plan was adopted by Dublin City Council, it should be regarded as a truly democratic statutory instrument.  Many people think the development plan should be the dominant document and the master plan should be consistent with it, not <i>vice versa.</i> The section does not make provision for the eventuality which might arise if the city council decides not to vary the development plan.  This would create a situation where the master plan and development plan were not consistent.  It might also be difficult at a later stage for An Bord Pleanála to make up its mind about which plan would be more important.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important legislation which will make a huge difference to the area but I am sorry educational opportunities for the local communities are not addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that such important legislation as this Bill is published at such short notice.  I appreciate the Government giving us an extra week to read it.  We are now trying to complete Second Stage in just over an hour.  As our spokesperson, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has stated, we are generally supportive of this legislation arising from the task force report and I wish to speak about a few areas of importance within it.</P>
      <P>The Bill comes before the House at a most important juncture in the city's development. Dubliners can see the tangible results over the last decade; clean air legislation, urban renewal schemes, tax designation and the growth of a new generation of quality employment in financial and technological services.  The prospects and the potential are good but we must plan to properly exploit that potential in the decades ahead.</P>
      <P>When Gandon's beautiful Custom House was completed in 1791, many of his critics complained that it was unnecessary and extravagant. However, it led to a major expansion of business in the Custom House docks area with the building of large warehouses and stores.  One of these is Stack A, a favourite building of mine, which is one of the finest examples of 19th century industrial architecture in the world.  Exactly 140 years ago, thousands of Irish soldiers who had fought and won the Crimean War had their mass celebration banquet there on their return home.</P>
      <P>Today we look forward to a totally new era for Dublin city which will bring excitement, energy and prosperity to all its inhabitants.  We are debating the future of the entire 1,300 acres of the Dublin docklands area and how we can ensure that this development will generate the employment, education, training, public and private housing, suitable enterprises, retail and leisure facilities which will release the potential of the Liffeyside development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This development will not be completed in the <Col N="24" /> lifetime of the Deputies in the chamber today but it is important and significant because, hopefully, it will provide the basis for many of those who will come after us to continue working on this plan.  We must endeavour to get it right at the first attempt.</P>
    <P>Of central importance to the development plan is the synchronisation and co-ordination of all the plans and programmes of voluntary, commercial, statutory and Government groups so that the citizens of Dublin will see by the middle of 1997 what is being proposed for their city.  There have been many relevant reports and studies undertaken in the past.  Some of these have been partially implemented, some have yet to be addressed and others have been put on the shelf.</P>
    <P>In the 30 years from 1957-87 very little development took place in the docklands area. Only ten new houses were built between the Liffey and the Royal Canal in that period.  Ten years ago a mere 17 people worked on the 27 acre site which now houses the IFSC with its 4,000 jobs.  This figure will certainly rise to 5,000 shortly.  I have had the pleasure and the privilege as a Member of this House and of Dublin Corporation of being involved with all the developments which have taken place over the last ten years.  These include the launch of the urban renewal scheme which I initiated as Lord Mayor in 1986 at the request of the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and the establishment of the Custom House Docks Authority and all that happened from 10 March 1987 when the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, took such an interest in the area.  As the Minister who established FÁS, I helped develop full-time co-operation with the Custom House Docks Authority which, even though criticised, still results in a great deal of good work in the area.  We also set up the local apprenticeship scheme and, of course, brought CERT back into the site in Amiens Street.</P>
    <P>The docklands area enjoys a number of unique assets which will aid its development and benefit the local communities and the city.  These include its city centre location, its historic links with rail and boat travel and the extensive waterway network which will create water and land-based leisure and recreational facilities.  The Dublin docklands area task force draws the comparison with Howth and Dun Laoghaire which are used by a large number of people for leisure activities in contrast to the Liffey, the quays and the canal basins.  It makes the point that, by optimising the advantages of the natural resources which waterways represent, the regeneration of dockland areas in our city can be very successful as it has been in many other cities around the world.</P>
    <P>In terms of direct, public supported investment in the docklands area in recent years, the Custom House Docks Development Authority project is the most significant.  There has also been considerable investment in new and refurbished local authority housing at a variety of locations in <Col N="25" /> the area, including the building and acquisition programme specifically designed to re-house the former tenants of the Sheriff Street flats area. The Minister will recall that some of the buildings have been knocked down.  Whatever Deputy Ryan said about what the Minister is not doing, I would consider it a favour to the citizens of Dublin if he ignored any proposals to refurbish the existing blocks and knocked them down as well.  Refurbishing them is the most ludicrous idea I have ever heard.  Fifteen years ago I was told the buildings could not be refurbished. Deputy Mitchell, myself and others have tried to work on them for years but I honestly believe the Minister would do everyone a favour by knocking them down.  Anyone who says different is looking for a refurbishment programme which will be another disaster.  If the Minister knocks the buildings down I will publicly thank him in the House.</P>
    <P>The next five years will see considerable additional public investment in the docklands area.  Substantial funds have been committed to the construction of the Dublin port tunnel, primarily to cater for heavy commercial traffic and planning is under way with a view to its completion by 2001.  Plans are ready for a major new waste water treatment facility east of Ringsend and preparations have been made to invite tenders on a design and build basis.  The new DART stations for Clontarf Road, Fairview and Barrow Road in Ringsend have already been announced.  These projects are part of the National Development Plan and I look forward to seeing them completed.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a development authority in accordance with the task force report which was laid before the House at the end of May.  The recent ESRI report <i>Dublin Docklands Area Master Plan</i> is of interest in assessing this Bill.  So too are the KPMG report on the impact of the urban renewal schemes, the proposed review of Dublin Corporation's 1991 development plan, the HARP initiative, the DTI report, the major tourism initiatives and the many community plans, all of which must now be combined to chart the best way forward for Dublin city.  I hope all of these reports will be taken into account and, while I would not stand over any of them in their entirety, they all have completed excellent research over the last decade and they should not be ignored.  We do not need any more reports but it is a question of acting on what is already there.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in principle, the thrust of the Bill because the initiatives and development proposals for Dublin docklands represent a unique opportunity for urban regeneration, environmental improvement and long-term development of an area at the very heart of the capital city.  More than any other part of Dublin, the people of the docklands and surrounding areas have suffered from the problems of chronic unemployment, social deprivation, urban blight and the lack of any concrete hope for the future. <Col N="26" /> In recent years there has been a very significant growth in the community sector, for example, the establishment of the area partnerships and the preparation of the local area action plans which are evidence of the consolidation, integration and focusing of the aims and objectives of community groups.  Through a continuing process of public consultation, it is essential to harness the energy of such initiatives in the preparation of the master plan by setting up community liaison workshops, open forum discussions, working group sessions, invited submissions and postal surveys.</P>
    <P>In the past, many of the communities living in the heart of the city were lectured on what was best for them.  We now have an opportunity of redressing that.  Both the financial services centre and Temple Bar are top class initiatives which have been an outstanding success and we in this party are proud of our associations with them.</P>
    <P>There are specific aspects of community involvement which have not proved successful. There must be a good mix of quality housing, private and public, and an assurance of employment for local people in their own area. The new docklands Authority must help local communities to develop waterside villages which will provide leisure facilities for water sports, sea food restaurants and cultural, educational and tourist attractions which will provide jobs for some of the young people in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The residential development must form a major part of the regeneration of this area if vibrant sustained activity is to be created during the day and at night.  The existing residential communities should be helped to consolidate and develop alongside new residential communities that would be attracted to the area.</P>
    <P>While a blanket tax designation for the whole area would not be a good idea, experience to date in urban renewal has shown it is essential to provide tax relief in derelict areas if renewal is to be stimulated.  This was the case in Temple Bar, Tallaght, the Custom House docks area and in other designated areas in the city and around the country.  The required level of development will not take place without the support of suitable tax incentives which should be targeted at areas of specific need.</P>
    <P>Developers and others will call for all the areas to be designated.  However, if one designates an area of 1,300 acres the benefit is lost.  In my previous involvement with the designation of urban areas developers told me there was no point in designating certain areas because nothing would happen in them.  However, when the designated areas were full they moved to those areas, for example, the North King Street and Smithfield areas.</P>
    <P>When the areas are developed I hope Dublin Corporation and the Department will insist that aesthetic and traffic plans will be implemented. When I was in a position of more influence in this regard I regret that cars were not banned from the Temple Bar area.  At this time of the year it is impossible to drive through Temple Bar with <Col N="27" /> all the cars parked there.  With regard to the development of the Smithfield area, if the plans for maintaining an open space with fountains, for example, are not implemented a proper residential community with families and associated facilities will not develop.  It will become an area for people who want apartments for the evenings during the working week and that will not contribute to a living community.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available I will not be able to go through every specific issue and I will communicate my points to the Minister in writing. There is no mention in the Bill of a general manager or chief executive function.  An area of 1,300 acres with a huge investment programme surely requires a manager.  I do not know what the Minister proposes in this regard but it should be provided for in the Bill.  I hope such a post might attract somebody from the business or development sector or perhaps somebody who may have been involved with urban regeneration in the past from the public sector.</P>
    <P>In so far as involving the community is concerned, the Minister should explain the role of the management body as against the executive. I believe strongly that the executive should have the power on such bodies.  I have had enough experience of talking shops to know that somebody has to take action and the executive should have full powers to deal with the matters in question.  For many years there was large scale dereliction along Dublin's north quays.  Political, business, community and other groups should be involved but they cannot always agree on what is best for development.  Somebody must take the decisions and I would rather see a strong executive doing so.</P>
    <P>There tends to be much argument about the rezoning of land in suburban and county areas. However, given the amount of land available in the inner city one could build for the next 20 years without having to move to the outskirts. However, to do so effectively one must deal with crime so that people may live comfortably in these areas.  Action on that front must form part of whatever plan we make for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on it.  There should be an engine of regeneration for the docklands area to which the Bill applies.  I agree with Deputy Bertie Ahern's warning about the social consequences of failing to take action such as is proposed in the Bill.  Dublin has been described as a doughnut &mdash; big on the outside and empty in the middle.  However, the regeneration schemes which have been in operation for the last ten years have made a significant difference.  I was in the courts this morning and I heard a judge handing out a sentence for heroin dealing in which he detailed the extent of the destruction of the inner city community.  I agree with Deputy Bertie Ahern that there must be progress on the social as well as the physical aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> I drove back from the courts this morning through the North King Street area and there is still a large amount of dereliction despite all the progress made along the quays and Dublin Corporation's plans for regeneration precincts in areas not properly developed to date.  There is much work to be done in the north inner city. The new docklands Authority will not deal with the area around the courts and the food markets. However, the same principles will apply.  One cannot expect the market system itself to regenerate inner city areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the market does not work unaided in urban regeneration.  In fact, the market has the worst possible effect in cities if left to its own devices because we need a combination of market forces, planning and special institutions to rebuild the city to make it pleasant.  This is a lesson which has no ideological content when one thinks about it.  Historically, the wide street commissioners needed powers of the kind this docklands Authority will have, to make the finer parts of Dublin that we love so much today.  Comparisons with other European cities lead to the same conclusion that there must be a strong planning function to combine with market forces to have any chance of doing something about the city.</P>
      <P>Huge economies can be made if we rebuild the inner cities.  They have schools, shops, roads, cinemas and shopping centres close at hand. There is a vast amount of social infrastructure which is perilously close to being closed down for want of people.  From that point of view it makes economic sense to build in the inner city especially if one calculates the number of people having to travel long distances into cities and the cost of the infrastructure, including roads, Luas and DART, that must be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could do a great deal more building in Dublin.  The area going westwards along the Thomas Street axis needs to be regenerated and needs a regeneration authority of some kind. Over the next ten or 20 years large portions of the Guinness brewery will be surplus to requirements.  I presume Guinness will be able to make beer on a small corner of that vast complex. An enlightened Government would create a regeneration authority for that corner of Dublin, out to Kilmainham and Mount Brown, to prime <Col N="29" /> the pump of development and get the planning process going.  It is not really all that important to pour vast sums of public money into these projects.  All that is needed is the power and a self-financing process can come into being.</P>
    <P>I have always been surprised by the conservatism of the legal advice available in the Department of the Environment in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  I remember many conferences at which people said the constitutional right to private property was the big problem because it stopped various things from being done.  I spoke at length to the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, on this subject.  Rightly or wrongly, he pointed the finger at the legal advice that was generally available at the time &mdash; some of which came from the Department of the Environment &mdash; to the effect that one could not touch the right of people to build in green belts because of property rights.  However, if one searches constitutional law casebooks to find a legal decision that planning was a massive curtailment of property rights, it is not there.  We were frightened of our own shadows.</P>
    <P>Everybody should accept what is written on the base of Drummond's statue in City Hall; that property has its duties as well as its rights.  In an urban environment there is no right to allow dereliction.  Looking at semi-derelict houses in Henrietta Street, it struck me that it is as indefensible to say someone has a constitutional right to leave them in that state as to say that Trinity College could leave the Book of Kells out in the rain overnight.  It is unacceptable that our architectural heritage can be allowed to decay in pursuance of somebody's notion of a constitutional right.  The courts have never laid down that notion.  We are frightened of our own shadows when it comes to property rights.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will encourage local authorities to use their compulsory purchase powers as soon as possible to assemble sites and get developments going.  The National Building Agency has, in fairness, done it in some areas. When one looks around Dublin at the quays and other places that have been blighted by tussles between various developers to get one last tenant off a corner site, surely there is room for using such compulsory powers.  The community has a right to ensure that inner city areas do not become derelict.  It also makes sense for adjoining landowners who have a right to expect that half a street is not falling down.  They have a right to some kind of passing trade and a right not to have the windows of neighbouring business premises cemented up.  Yet this is done because somebody else exercises a so-called constitutional right to bring about dereliction.</P>
    <P>The docklands area could be the heart of the inner city.  The whole axis of Dublin could change if this Bill is accepted.  South inner city areas, including Gas Company land, can be developed with imagination.  Some are already being developed and there is no reason that should not <Col N="30" /> apply to most of the inner city docklands, including the north inner city ones.</P>
    <P>How will the Dublin Port and Docks Board work with the new docklands authority?  Will it sell off its assets?  The Dublin Port and Docks Board is overburdened by debt and pension obligations.  Some mechanism will have to be found to unravel that mess and make Dublin a thriving port whose assets are mobilised for building purposes and the regeneration of the docklands rather than being used as collateral by a debt-ridden monster which the Dublin Port and Docks Board used to be and still is, to some extent.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that a master plan must be developed but I hope it will go along with market forces.  Having said that the market, by itself, is useless to achieve urban renewal, I would make the opposite point also; that a system which does not take market forces into account by using, guiding and directing them, is equally useless.  We do not have the resources to publicly fund anything on the scale required.  I hope, therefore, that we will not just establish a quango.</P>
    <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, the Minister hopes this body will become self-financing.  It should rapidly become self-financing and, like the National Building Agency, should pay its way as quickly as possible.  I would not like to see an expensive bureaucracy built up which becomes part of the problem rather than the solution.  I welcome the Bill which is only part of a broader picture requiring incentives for the huge effort involved to rebuild the Dublin Central constituency.  It is frightening to think of the deprivation in those areas and the grip which drugs, and the culture of crime associated with drugs, have taken on the social fabric of those areas.  Therefore, it makes good economic sense to concentrate our efforts to ensure that those areas are rebuilt.  Simply rebuilding will have some positive effect in bringing employment, hope and the absence of dereliction to those areas.  Bringing more people to live there will also have a tremendous effect in lifting morale and giving people the opportunity to find employment in their own neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about only one of the three or four such bodies which should be established, if they can all be self-financing, to hammer away at regeneration from the north inner city to Kilmainham on the southside and to do for those areas what the Temple Bar initiative did in that area.  If we have the imagination to unleash on the inner city of Dublin, the core, which is decayed at present, can be regenerated.  I welcome this Bill as a tremendous positive step towards starting in one particular corner to address a problem which will require a number of Bills such as this to complete the mosaic and get Dublin up and running.  I warmly congratulate the Minister on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am always complaining that Deputies come into this House and that Ministers <Col N="31" /> are not present to hear what we have to say, and now it has happened again.  This is a short debate and I resent that the Minister could not wait for it to conclude.  It happens all the time.  Ministers feel they can treat this House in a cavalier fashion and not be present to hear what the few of us, who want to contribute, have to say.  I am very sorry that the Minister for the Environment could not wait, as I have, for this debate.</P>
      <P>This Bill must be welcomed, but it is loaded massively in favour of the southside of the city. Ever since the Duke of Leinster migrated from the northside to the southside 270 years ago, the northside has never recovered notwithstanding the fact that people, such as Deputy Bertie Ahern, former Minister for Finance and now Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Tony Gregory and I, represent substantial parts of the northside. People will know, of course, that I am originally from the southside and my constituency straddles the border.</P>
      <P>The result of this Bill is to extend the Customs House area, which was a northside niche of virtually no benefit to the surrounding community, across the Liffey, down to Ringsend and as far as Merrion Square.  It is to yuppify that part of Dublin South-East which is not already yuppified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas the extension on the northside is a minor extension of the line down the River Liffey on what now constitutes the Custom House Docks.  Between 60 per cent and two-thirds of the proposed area to be covered by this Bill will be south of the river.  If one includes the Temple Bar authority area, which runs from Christchurch to Westmoreland Street, and the huge urban designated area on Burgh Quay, there is a whole raft of special authority areas from Christchurch right down to Ringsend on the southside.</P>
      <P>This is an outrageously anti-northside Bill and it completely ignores the west end of the city.  It is no coincidence, of course, that the Minister for Finance is a Deputy for Dublin South-East and that two of the three contributors were Deputy Michael McDowell and Deputy Eoin Ryan who also represent Dublin South-East.  Why would they not welcome the Bill when it will yuppify that part of their constituency which is not already yuppified although, as Deputy McDowell rightly said, large rafts of the Liberties, North King Street, Smithfield and Inchicore are in tatters?  Of course the Bill must be welcomed because it will further improve the city, but it shows an enormous bias in favour of the southside and totally ignores the needs of northside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been trying to engage Ministers for the past three years since Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister for Finance in debate on the north-west corner of the inner city.  The 72 acres of public <Col N="32" /> authority lands at Grangegorman which are about to be disposed of by the Eastern Health Board, the 30 acres in the public ownership of CIÉ at Broadstone, the Smithfield area down to the quays and the North King Street area are in dreadful dereliction.  There is an enormous opportunity to regenerate that part of the city which badly needs it.  We were told that, when Temple Bar on the northside and Custom House Docks on the southside were completed, the initiative would move to Smithfield.  However, it will not move to Smithfield but to Ringsend and up to Merrion Square.  It shows an alarming disregard for the north and west sides of the city and it was reinforced by the decision to go ahead with the two Luas lines on the southside and postpone the northside line.  I protest vehemently at this.</P>
    <P>When Ray MacSharry was Minister for Finance and Pádraig Flynn was Minister for the Environment Sligo and Castlebar, respectively, benefited from a great deal of development and both towns have benefited ever since, and fair play to them.  Now Deputy Quinn is Minister for Finance and, fair play to him, he is looking after Dublin South-East but we need somebody who will take a fairer and more balanced view of the needs of this city.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gregory also adds Seán McDermott Street.  Something in addition needs to be done there although much renewal has taken place in that quarter.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the village of Inchicore?  I have asked one Minister after another to come and see how run down and socially deprived Inchicore is because of public policy decisions &mdash; placing drug treatment centres and problematic tenants into Dublin Corporation flat complexes in the area.  The multiple effect is to destroy what was once an established area.  The people of Inchicore look hopelessly at what has been done for Temple Bar, the Custom House Docks and large strands of Dublin South-East but there is nothing for the needy areas of this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made that protest and notwithstanding it, I support the concept of this Bill.  I want to raise a number of questions about transport before I hand over to my colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne.  Is it envisaged that more bridges will be built across the River Liffey?  Will the Macken Street-Guild Street bridge be built because it would help the development of the area and ease traffic in the city centre?  Are there any proposals for pedestrian bridges across the River Liffey?  Is it proposed to build a bridge across the Grand Canal and the River Dodder where they enter the River Liffey to link <Col N="33" /> up the quays for the last few hundred yards on the southside and open up the area?</P>
    <P>Is there any proposal for public transport in the area?  I hope that as part of the development of the area there would be a Luas-type loop-line which would go down the northside and up the southside &mdash; one line would do &mdash; from the Custom House to the Point Depot or Dublin Port and back up by Ringsend on the southside as far as College Green.  That would link with the proposed Luas system.  The development of the area will not be optimised unless there is some form of public transport along those lines.</P>
    <P>Are there any proposals for what the French call <i>grands objectifs?</i> Is it proposed in the next few years to construct any buildings of significance in this city?  Not one building of significance has been built since Independence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody who has travelled the East Wall Road, walked along Amiens Street towards Busaras or looked in any direction from the East Link Bridge has any doubt about the need for the regeneration of the docklands area.  In common with many parts of Dublin between the canals, it <Col N="34" /> has been hit by industrial decline and migration from the inner city to outlying suburbs.</P>
    <P>I recognise many of the problems facing the area which are similar to problems in my constituency of Dublin South Central.  There are run-down corporation blocks of flats, erected in the mid 1960s, which coexist with increasingly dilapidated traditional working-class housing stock where the elderly struggle to survive on low fixed incomes and many young people struggle to survive on social welfare or low pay.  The result is urban blight and all its physical and social consequences, including environmental degradation, the closure of small businesses, long-term unemployment, social disintegration, drug abuse problems and high levels of opportunistic crime.</P>
    <P>Dublin port is, or should be, the city's lifeline. The quayscape and its hinterland are an essential element of life in the capital city.  I welcome the Government's decision to address the problems facing the docklands area, but I am not convinced that the establishment of this Authority in isolation will achieve the desired results.  One of the many side effects of incentive-led top-down development is to suck investment into designated areas and leave adjoining communities to fall further into decay.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill outlines the areas which will be covered by the Authority.  It takes in the intersection of East Wall Road and the North Strand Road and continues in a southwesterly direction towards Amiens Street. Where does this leave Ballybough and Summerhill, areas which have traditional links with the docklands?  Where does it leave the Clonliffe area between Ballybough and the Drumcondra Road?  How will other urban renewal schemes in the city, such as the Smithfield scheme, compete for the investment involved in the various incentives which are likely to be offered by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority?</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that the Authority will make a significant difference to its immediate catchment area but there should be a much more integrated plan which takes in Dublin's inner city as a whole while still maintaining the area-based focus identified as vital in the study of the urban renewal schemes.  The recent publication of this study has provided a valuable framework for the future and the context in which the Dublin docklands proposals and future urban schemes should be judged.</P>
    <P>If one walks around Temple Bar and looks at the adjacent communities, which did not benefit from incentive-led development, one can see the obvious difference.  I warmly welcome the initiatives of the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, in this area and I do not doubt the recommendation in the study will mark a watershed in the urban renewal not only of Dublin but of other urban centres in the country.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a series of villages &mdash; for example, Perrystown, Kimmage and Crumlin &mdash; but they are interconnected and this connection, in <Col N="35" /> addition to the specific character of each area, should be recognised in the urban renewal schemes as in other areas.  There is an urgent need to ensure that Government policy in other Departments does not militate against urban renewal and regeneration.  This point is explicitly recognised in the study.  Urban renewal of areas with old housing stock is not facilitated by a finance policy which expressly favours new housing only.</P>
    <P>People buying second-hand houses over a certain age &mdash; for example, houses built pre-1914 &mdash; should be eligible for the first time house buyer's grant and exempt from stamp duty.  At present people seeking to move to the inner city are actively enticed into new developments and dissuaded from purchasing older housing stock. There is a need to take a fresh look at the issue of home improvement grants with a view to targeting them in a way which complements urban regeneration and encourages architecturally and environmentally appropriate renovation.  The study on the urban renewal schemes highlighted what it termed &ldquo;the lack of a clear policy defining what a conservation policy should set out to achieve&rdquo;.  It recommended that conservation policies should be developed for each area and then form an integral part of the proposed strategic area plans.</P>
    <P>There is a need to conserve communities in addition to buildings.  In this regard, further incentives for the provision of over-the-shop accommodation are required on retail thoroughfares, such as the North Strand Road, Talbot Street, Mary Street and Capel Street on the northside and Thomas Street, Meath Street and Francis Street on the southside.  I have encouraged the Minister to visit these three famous streets on the southside and to examine the accommodation above the shops.  Sadly, particularly in Meath Street, there are only dilapidated buildings.</P>
    <P>One of the worst examples of urban blight in Dublin, which has been brought to the Minister's attention previously, is the Cork Street-Dolphin's Barn area of my constituency.  Since the 1940s, development in the area has been put on hold pending the anticipated Coombe bypass.  Small businesses, which are the commercial lifeblood of areas, have moved out one by one and have not been replaced.  Pre-1920s housing stock is crumbling before our eyes and in many cases the residents are not in a financial position to undertake the necessary works without appropriate assistance.  There is a strong case for the development of a regeneration package for the Cork Street-Dolphin's Barn area but there should also be regeneration proofing of all Government policies, ranging from financial to industrial, which may impact on it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to redevelop the docklands area but I hope necessary measures will be taken to ensure that a relatively small area does not benefit at the <Col N="36" /> expense of other inner city areas and that the recommendations of the study will be incorporated not only by the DDDA but also the urban renewal process throughout the inner city of Dublin.  I would also welcome an assurance that the communities living in the docklands catchment area will be consulted at every stage regarding projects undertaken by the DDDA. There should be no displacement of the indigenous population or indigenous industries or commercial enterprises.  I hope I left a couple of minutes for Deputy Gregory to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time.  I am disappointed that he was not present for Deputy Jim Mitchell's contribution because it paralleled my views.  Given that these views are held by Members on both sides, perhaps the Minister will give more consideration to them than he might otherwise.  I wish to make two specific points about the Bill.  The first relates to my great disappointment about the limited section of the northside of the city included within the boundaries of the new Authority's brief.  The area north of the boundaries proposed in the Bill comprises Buckingham Street, Seán MacDermott Street, Summerhill and Ballybough and is the area of the greatest social and economic deprivation in the State.  In excluding that area from its one chance for renewal, redevelopment and hope, we are missing a fantastic opportunity.  This point was already made by local community representatives and I merely wish to place it on record.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the Authority's proposed boundaries and include the area to which I have referred.  This area is in the immediate vicinity of the docklands and was traditionally dependent on the docks, which are long since gone, for employment.  I speak from experience of that tradition because my father worked on the docks.  Dublin Corporation drew up its own report in recent years on the area comprising Rutland Street, Seán MacDermott Street and Summerhill and has been pressing for the provision of European funds for the area.  It is a great shame and pity that the area in most need is being excluded from the provisions of the new Bill.  Urban funding recently became available and various areas of the city submitted proposals but again that part of the north inner city lost out.  When they learned of the new Authority and its plans for the docklands area, community representatives and organisations in that area had great hope that it represented a light at the end of the tunnel.  It seems this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider extending the boundaries, at least as far as Capel Street.  Deputy Mitchell rightly referred to the area surrounding <Col N="37" /> Grangegorman and Smithfield where the Eastern Health Board must dispose of huge tracts of land. This will lead to the possibility of major renewal and redevelopment in that area which, as several Members indicated, is in great need.  I hope the docklands area will extend to Capel Street.</P>
    <P>The experience of members of the local community regarding past redevelopment by the Customs House Docks Authority was that they had little or no involvement in the employment opportunities on offer.  Virtually no one in the area obtained job opportunities during the redevelopment which took place.  Whatever redevelopment is under way in this area, it is essential that it be written into the contracts of building and construction firms that they employ a percentage &mdash; perhaps 20 or 25 per cent &mdash; of people who live in the area.  There cannot be a greater social injustice than to see major redevelopments taking place beside communities where 70 to 80 per cent of residents are unemployed.  The people in such communities are not given the opportunity to work in the construction phase of these redevelopments and it would be a major injustice if that were to happen again.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ahern and Mitchell raised the Sheriff Street redevelopment.  I believe everyone is of the opinion that Sheriff Street flats should be entirely demolished and that whatever redevelopment occurs should take place on an open site giving adequate space for the provision of amenities for the local community.  That redevelopment should not be a continuation of the process of constructing blocks of small apartments with transient residents who make no contribution to the local community.  There is a great need for additional local authority housing in the immediate vicinity of Sheriff Street and there is an opportunity for the Minister to provide such housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important legislation.  The Bill has received broad support and, while many Members sought to expand or comment upon the Bill's contents, everyone welcomed the tabling of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Eoin Ryan focused on things which are not in the Bill and largely neglected to refer to its actual contents.  For such comprehensive legislation, this Bill is one of the speediest strategic statements of any major initiative to be put into effect in recent times in this House.  The Minister for Finance made a statement in his budget this year in connection with this legislation and the Government immediately established a specific task force to bring together the various agencies and individuals to take soundings. That task force completed its deliberations and published its report.  We are now in the process of implementing the two key strategic elements of that report.  We have begun the process of developing the master plan for the area and we are debating comprehensive legislation in this House.  That is a great credit to everyone involved and underscores <Col N="38" /> the importance of the Government's regard for this development.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Ryan could not give credit where it is due and instead concentrated on issues which are not necessarily germane to this legislation.  He is wrong to criticise the lack of housing provision and he is wrong to criticise the Government.  Last year the Government published a new social housing programme and has provided housing for 10,000 families and individuals under the most comprehensive social housing programme in the history of the State.  That impacts on Dublin and elsewhere but Dublin Corporation is encountering difficulties in finding adequate space to build the houses provided for.</P>
    <P>In terms of Deputy Ryan's comments about the lack of education opportunities, the Minister for Education has done more to focus on disadvantage than any of her predecessors.  If there is one milestone in her period of office it is that she has highlighted the area of disadvantage as her primary focus.</P>

Flowing from that there was a specific FÁS training course to involve people from the local community in training and employment in the Jury's Hotel project and onsite development and works.  I recognise the importance of involving the local community and this was not done until I became Minister.  That policy is strongly represented in the provisions of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern also spoke about traffic management.  It is important that a comprehensive view on urban renewal should take account of traffic management.  As regards this month's operation freeflow initiative, I hope the director of traffic for Dublin will be in place early in the new year.  Preparatory administrative work, including a consultative paper on how the post fits into the management structure in Dublin Corporation, is well under way.  I welcome Deputy Bertie Ahern's kind and supportive comments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell welcomed the Bill, which he described as an engine of regeneration. His fear that this regeneration would disadvantage other areas was raised by other Deputies.  On Smithfield, the specific area he mentioned, Dublin Corporation has prepared an integrated plan for this area known as the Harp area.  The plan is being fully funded by the EU and my Department, which the Deputy will welcome.  I take on board points made about the powers of local authorities and the NBA to acquire sites by compulsory purchase order which is done very effectively in other areas.</P>

      <P>I have three Bills before the House today and I left the House for approximately five minutes.  It is unfair of Deputy Mitchell to say Ministers act in a cavalier fashion. I will read his comments on this subject carefully. He voiced a concern about the effect this proposal will have on other areas.  When an urban renewal project is announced, people who are not <Col N="40" /> in the area will say it will have a bad effect on their area.  If we acted on that basis there would be no urban renewal schemes.  Urban renewal schemes have been a huge success and almost £2 billion has been invested.</P>
      <P>This measure will not pull the International Financial Services Centre southside.  There is a specific promotional requirement in the Bill to develop the IFSC in the current Custom House Docks area on the northside.  I have powers in the Bill to extend the new docklands area.  There are no powers to develop it further south but there are powers to develop it further north.  I will take account of the constructive comments made by Deputy Gregory in that regard.</P>
      <P>Such a measure will not please everybody. However, it is a significant step in the regeneration of the ailing heart of the capital city. I look forward to this measure passing swiftly through the Houses of the Oireachtas and, more importantly, being implemented by the new Authority, with the benefit it will bring not only to the designated areas but also to those contiguous to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 33, to delete &ldquo;£20,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£30,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on this Bill previously, I mentioned the importance of civil liability and compensation for the dependants of a deceased person.  I am particularly concerned about cases where a wife is left to look after a number of children.  As the Minister said, compensation or a solatium will help but in many cases it is all the wife will get.  The Minister went further than he originally intended and increased the figure from £7,500, the amount payable at present, to £15,000 and then to £20,000 on Committee Stage.  I compliment him on that increase and on going <Col N="41" /> beyond the strict consumer price index figures. We are happy he has increased the amount to £20,000.</P>
    <P>We have not resolved the problem in relation to the size of families.  That is why I said this measure was discriminatory, that it is anti-family. If the father, who in many cases is the breadwinner, meets an accidental death, the mother must look after the family which may comprise one child or six children.  If the family comprises one child and the widow, the family will get £20,000.  However, the situation is different if there is a widow and six children.  We did not resolve this problem on Committee Stage; we did not find a way to compensate each child so that all family members are treated equally. That is a matter which I regret and which must be considered since there will be a difference in the amount received in terms of the size of a family.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly argued that this is only to compensate for the sense of loss suffered by family members.  However, if six people experience loss, the compensation provided should be greater than that for one person.  We increased the amount provided from £15,000 to £20,000.  We proposed that the figure be increased to £30,000 and even then I was not happy that the provision of a bigger figure would resolve the situation.  I would be happier if the figure was £20,000 and if there was also a means of compensating the children in such circumstances. We have been unable to find a solution so I can only look to the future for a means of removing the anti-family element and providing for more equal treatment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 propose that the maximum amount of compensation payable for mental distress in fatal injuries cases be increased to £30,000.  These amendments are of similar effect to amendments which Deputy Woods proposed on Committee Stage.  The figure of £20,000 in the Bill was accepted on Committee Stage and Deputy Woods indicated he was happy to accept my amendment containing that figure. I do not propose to increase that figure and I regret I am unable to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods said the size of the family is not taken into account.  However, his proposed amendment does not address this point.  He cited as an example the person who died being the father and the breadwinner.  That comes under a different heading of compensation.  The law already provides for full and complete recompense to the family for all financial losses as a result of the negligent act which caused the death of the person in respect of whom the proceedings are brought.  It takes into account what their loss of earnings would be and their potential loss <i>vis-á-vis</i> what their likely working life would be.  Other losses, apart from the loss of expectation of income and earnings, are already provided for independently of this <i>solatium</i><Col N="42" /> figure.  This figure is only for <i>solatium</i> and encompasses no other heading of compensation.</P>
    <P>My proposal represents a major increase on what is available at present.  As I said on Committee Stage, if the figure was brought up to date on an index-linked basis it would be under £15,000.  I am proposing a figure of £20,000, which Deputy Woods agrees is reasonable.  On Second Stage, Deputy Lenihan suggested, from his point of view as an experienced barrister, that the range under this heading should be £20,000 to £25,000. I decided on £20,000 as the appropriate figure but I am making provision in the Bill to have that figure varied by ministerial order from time to time.  This is a reasonable compromise and Deputy Woods accepts that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had considerable discussion about the amount on Committee Stage.  I told the Minister I accepted his compromise figure, although the amendment proposed by Deputy Woods and me was for £30,000.  I wish the Minister could have provided for a greater amount but he went some way in acknowledging the arguments we made.  It is also valuable that there is provision for a ministerial order to vary the figure in the future.  I am glad there was a compromise on this matter and I accepted the Minister's amendment on Committee Stage. However, it is important to emphasise this issue, as Deputy Woods has on this Stage.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister has made a step forward by providing for £20,000.  I did not say the amendment resolved the position of the children in the family.  On Committee Stage we failed to find a solution to that problem and I would have been happier if we could have found a solution.  The Minister explained the complexity of the situation.  It must be addressed, although it will have to be done in future legislation.  We have progressed from £7,500 to £20,000 and it is a reasonable compromise, although I would have preferred if the Minister had moved further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Section 7 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>'(2A) (a)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7(2) of this Act, exemplary damages may be awarded where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> (i)  the death was procured by a deliberate act of the wrongdoer or other parties acting on his behalf or in consort with him, or</P>
    <P>(ii) the death is as a result of actions of the wrongdoer or other parties acting on his behalf or in consort with him which were reckless as to whether death could result therefrom.</P>
    <P>(b) Subsection (1) shall not have effect in relation to a cause of action that commenced by the issue of proceedings before that subsection comes into operation.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We discussed this amendment at length on Committee Stage.  Although the Minister pointed out that exemplary penalties mainly relate to the criminal law area, there are practical situations in civil law where there is a need for exemplary damages.  A recent relevant case, the number of Veronica Guerin, demonstrates the truth of that contention.  That murder was planned and ordered by people who have substantial resources.  We recently introduced legislation to hit these people where it hurts, in their pockets, and that is the intention of including a provision for exemplary damages in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will examine this matter in the future and that he might ask the Law Reform Commission to examine it.  I urge him to do so urgently.  This amendment is important and I would have been happier if it could have been included in the Bill.  I accept that complex issues are involved and that the issue will have to be examined.  However, there is a necessity to provide for exemplary damages in cases such as the one I mentioned.</P>

      <P>The passing of this Bill adds to the reform of our laws on civil liability.  I initiated reforms some time ago with the Occupiers Liability Bill and earlier this year I gave a commitment to the House that I would look at amending that part of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, which deals with compensation in fatal injury cases.  This Bill increases the compensation from £7,500 to a maximum of £20,000.  It also extends the definition of dependants, who may claim damages as compensation for loss of benefits, funeral expenses and mental distress under the Act, to include cohabitants, persons divorced in the State and persons whose foreign divorces are entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate on the Bill and express my appreciation for their constructive approach.  I thank the staff of my Department for their work on the preparation of the Bill.</P>

    <P>Mr. Blair emphasised strongly that he and any future Labour Party Government in Britain <Col N="47" /> would give a high priority to efforts to bring about lasting peace and a widely acceptable political settlement in relation to Northern Ireland.

Mr. Blair pledged his party's continuing support for efforts to secure progress in advancing these key aims.</P>
    <P>At the same time, he made it clear that there is no justification whatsoever for anyone to take the path of violence instead of the democratic route.  The multi-party talks have been up and running for some months now.  They are inclusive in intent and can become so in practice &mdash; when the IRA has called an unequivocal ceasefire, in words that are believable, and provided there is nothing done that is inconsistent with this casefire or with the Mitchell Principles.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together, as they both relate to the 1997 Estimates provision for local development under the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The main element of the 1997 allocation for Subhead F.1 &mdash; Local Development &mdash; relates to the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.  Exchequer co-finance will be provided for that part of the programme being managed by ADM Limited and the technical assistance funding will be managed by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Activities under the operational programme are well under way and gathering momentum and the budget allocation reflects the forecasts of expenditure for 1997.  The EU funds for the programme will be paid, as appropriate, directly to ADM Limited or to the Exchequer in 1997.</P>
      <P>This subhead will also provide for the costs of the liaison team, who assist the county strategy groups in co-ordinating local development initiatives at county level &mdash; £192,000; and special once-off grants for local development projects &mdash; £250,000.  It is proposed that applications for these grants will be invited, by public advertisement, early in the new year.  The provision for these elements are broadly similar to the 1996 allocations.</P>

    <P>The provision in Subhead F3 &mdash; URBAN Initiative &mdash; relates to the 1997 forecast of expenditure for the operational programme for the implementation of the URBAN Initiative in Ireland, which is managed by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The operational programme was <Col N="49" /> approved by the European Commission in July 1996 and plans were prepared by the three URBAN steering groups in Dublin and Cork.  It is expected that the action plans will be finalised early in 1997 and expenditure on approved projects will commence.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that information.  Does the Minister of State agree such an increase in funding demands that the funds are administered in a more efficient fashion than in 1995 and that they are distributed fairly with proper adherence to the guidelines which have been set out?</P>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 5, on 6 November last the Minister of State indicated decisions on allocation of funds were still pending in many instances.  Have all those decisions been made?  If not, how can he be sure the increase in funding is necessary or adequate?  How much of the £6 million goes towards administration?</P>

In regard to the discretionary fund the figure of £250,000 is the same as last year and is a relatively small amount of money.  An advertisement will be placed, as it was for the past two years, for applications.  With regard to the increase in other areas, for example, the urban initiative, the allocation is to be increased from £3.5 million to £6 million this year because early in 1997 we expect a number of plans in the pipeline to be approved and work on them to commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Delivering Better Government report published on 2 May 1996 recommended changes to existing financial management controls and procedures, including a more appropriate public financial framework for setting public expenditure allocations and delegating authority to Departments to manage resources allocated to them.  The changes are designed to provide the basis for improved financial performance required to underpin a results driven approach across the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>In particular, the results driven approach of SMI requires clarity in the outputs to be derived from public expenditure and is designed to achieve better efficiency in service delivery and to place greater emphasis on achieving the best value for money.  The costs of providing improved quality public services under the SMI must be met from efficiency gains and the new systems and structures being put in place in respect of public expenditure management and control, as envisaged in Delivering Better Government, are designed to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the main areas of change proposed for financial management centre on the introduction of a multi-annual budgetary process, delegation of financial authority within Departments and to Departments from the Department of Finance, improvements to the administrative budget system and the introduction of financial management systems which reflect accruals accounting principles.  In order to implement the proposals in the report in these areas, a financial management working group has been assigned the task of developing and overseeing implementation of proposals in the report.  The working group has now developed an overall programme of action which will see these changes being implemented in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes, when taken in tandem with the publication of departmental statements of strategy, will result in better control of expenditure and the achievement of value for money through regular reviews of expenditure programmes.  This process will take time to <Col N="52" /> implement but we will begin to see the first benefits of this new approach in 1997 with the introduction of multi-annual budgeting.</P>
    <P>The SMI approach is also based on the integration of a number of elements into the overall programme of change for the Civil Service.  The initiatives which have been outlined above in regard to financial management systems must also be integrated in the overall framework for managing performance in the Civil and Public Service.  Changes in this area are being overseen by the working group on human resource management and the programmes of action of the working groups are being designed and integrated to underpin the approach to improved performance across the entire range of services provided by the Civil and Public Services, including financial performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the strategic management initiative was to make savings by reducing administrative overheads. Will the Minister explain in detail why she believes substantial savings will be made in 1997 when the administrative budgets for 1997 for all Departments have increased enormously?  I understood the SMI would result in a huge reduction in administrative overheads but instead there has been a dramatic increase.  At what stage is the three year cycle of the budgets?  I understood in this year's Book of Estimates there would be comprehensive detail about departmental budgets over a three year cycle, but I was gravely disappointed when I did not find that information.  The Minister said it will be available in 1997.  Will it be part of the budget day presentation?  Is it the Minister's view or is there evidence to show that millions of pounds will be saved under the SMI in the short, medium or long-term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the Deputy has a misconception of the strategic management process.  If it was merely to be fiscally driven and if savings were the bottom line the guiding Department would be the Department of Finance, but the SMI is steered by the Department of the Taoiseach.  It was started in February 1994 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  The reason the Department of the Taoiseach has ownership of the strategic management process is that there is a much greater vision in terms of the Civil Service as we approach the 21st century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be savings, but they will not necessarily translate into a reduced budget in all cases.  We will have to redirect the money saved in certain areas into other areas as services are demanded and decide the most effective way to use the Civil Service and public service.  There is expenditure in some areas that perhaps will not <Col N="53" /> be needed and specialities may be needed in future which heretofore were not needed.  Making savings does not automatically mean a reduced budget in all areas, although it can mean that. One area where there has been an improvement in the past two years &mdash; I think everyone will agree it was needed &mdash; is in the numbers in the Civil Service, where major problems were experienced.  There is not a reduction there yet, but if the previous rate of increase had continued we would have had severe problems.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern referred to the Estimates and increases for next year.  In presenting the 1997 Abridged Estimates and summery capital programme, the Minister for Finance pointed out that while the increase in current spending is greater than the target set in A Government of Renewal, that is an average annual 2 per cent real increase in 1996-7, budget targets will provide for the general Government deficit to be maintained comfortably within the Maastricht guidelines and 1997 will be the ninth consecutive year in which Ireland's fiscal performance has satisfied the defict criterion. Moreover, the debt-GNP ratio continues to decline.  Significant real spending increases to meet social and economic priorities are possible because we achieved rapid economic growth in revenue buoyancy.</P>

      <P>The public finances are under control and that will continue.  There will be an opportunity on Thursday next for a more detailed debate on the Estimates and as that aspect of the Deputy's supplementary is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I respectfully suggest that he wait until then to pursue that avenue.  A financial management working group has been set up with specific terms of reference to report to the new co-ordinating group of secretaries and the first report is with Government this week. That group&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be facetious.  If he read Delivering Better Government he would understand the procedure. Deputy Ahern understands the procedure but apparently Deputy Burke does not.  The financial management working group has examined four areas: multi-annual budgets, which is the subject of the Deputy's supplementary; delegation of financial authority from the Department of Finance down the line; the administrative budget system and accrual of accounts.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that multi-annual budgeting has been introduced.  The Government has <Col N="54" /> approved expenditure projections to 1999 on an existing policies basis with contingency provisions for 1998 and 1999.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, as the next step, to draw up medium term financial envelopes for Departments as well as programmes of policy review on specified outcomes relating to the financial envelopes and initiate a consultation process with senior management in Departments when the medium term budget targets are being set.  Much work is being done in that area at present.  Notwithstanding the interruptions, I trust I have answered the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with many of the Minister's replies.  I agree with the Strategic Management Initiative and will continue to support it, but saving money was part of the objective.  The initiative was launched by the Taoiseach to try to keep order over all Government Departments and the Minister for Finance was to deal with the fiscal aspect &mdash; I instigated most of the systems to commence work on it.  The administrative budgets for 1997 for every Government Department have increased dramatically and that is in line with public expenditure generally.  Whoever gave the Minister her briefing note &mdash; probably somebody from the Department of Finance &mdash; it is gobbledegook.</P>
      <P>Expenditure for the period 1995-7 has increased by 20 per cent.  There are no savings, although in some areas the increases are not as substantial as some of those to which I referred earlier.  Strategic management in the public service will be at nought if we continue as at present.  The country cannot afford an increase of one-fifth in public expenditure in a two year period.  As soon as growth levels decrease and inflation and interest rates increase we will be in a bad way again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence at this point of a reduction in expenditure.  Delivering Better Government, which was published on 2 May last, is the document which recommends changes to existing financial management controls and procedures, including a more appropriate financial framework for setting public expenditure allocations and the delegation of authority to Departments to manage resources allocated to them.  Since that document was only published in May of this year, it is not yet reflected in public expenditure.  I accept what the Deputy is saying.  The Deputy's question was specifically to ask the Taoiseach about the savings, if any, made as a result of the SMI to <Col N="55" /> date, which assumes it is driven by savings <i>per se.</i> I ask him to use the expression &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; instead of savings.  Achieving value for money should mean we will get effective savings in the years to come, as opposed to what would have happened otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Value for money is critical and all Government expenditure must be underpinned by that principle but value for money and savings are not quite the same thing.  As the Taoiseach said, the strategic management initiative for the public service and Civil Service for the future must be driven by a vision of what we want it to contribute to social and economic life the 21st century.  We must decide, first, what we want, and second, the most effective and efficient way of delivering that through the public service.</P>

      <P>As published in the 1997 Book of Estimates, the allocation in the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of western development amounts to £4,910,000.  This figure comprises £2 million as start up capital for a new western investment fund; £300,000 in respect of the cost of establishing the new Western Development Commission; £1,750,000 for the development of priority access and infrastructural projects on the offshore islands; £250,000 in respect of the continued commitment to rural renewal initiatives; and £610,000 for the provision of all-year-round ferry services to the Aran Islands.  The increase in the 1997 allocation for western development is further evidence of the Government's continued commitment to the future of rural communities, particularly in the western region and on the offshore islands.</P>

      <P>In spite of little help from the Government, my efforts all year to get money for offshore islands have had some success.  We raised questions practically every week on behalf of those who briefed us from the islands. However, the administration has received almost as much as the islands, judging by the figures mentioned.  Will the Minister of State indicate how many jobs will be created as a result of the funding increase?  Has that calculation been made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have an estimate of the total number of jobs but the administration of the Western Development Commission will be small, comprising one chief executive officer, one company secretary, one projects officer, three development officers and two clerical staff.  I expect it will substantially increase the employment opportunities in the region.  The Government response to the key recommendations of the action plan for western development, prepared by the Bartlett partnership board, has been substantial.  A major commitment has been made to a western investment fund with £25 million made available <Col N="57" /> from the Exchequer over six years towards a total potential fund of £100 million.  If that total is realised it will mean a substantial amount of funding for the region.  Even though money is available for the islands I assure Deputy Ahern that neither Usher's Island nor Islandbridge received any of this money.</P>

      <P>I do not have information on the membership of the commission.  Its objective will be to complement and add value to the activities of the State agencies, particularly the regional and local authorities which currently operate in the western region.  The commission will promote economic and social development and the interests of the people in the region.  It will also achieve this in collaboration with the existing statutory and community-based agencies working in the region.  In the pursuit of this central function the terms of reference of the commission will include the following: to prepare a strategic plan for the region and to set out annual objectives to be pursued in the context of the plan; to promote and manage the western investment fund in accordance with the arrangements to be settled with the Department of the Taoiseach; and to develop close working relations with regional and local authorities and with the various agencies engaged in local development with the region.  There will be close liaison between all the agencies and the new commission.</P>

      <P>What plans are there to make sure this investment fund will not go to areas in the west which are already growing rapidly, but will be directed towards those with the least capital currently available and with the greatest decline in population?

I hope the activities carried out by my colleague, the Minister of State responsible for western development, and me in my capacity as Minister of State responsible for local development, will combine to make this additional money as effective as possible, and to target it disproportionately at those areas not currently receiving funding to give them an opportunity to develop adequately.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is an EU initiative.  The sources of funds are the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and Exchequer co-financing.  Those elements of the peace programme which are being managed by ADM Limited are funded through the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The programme was approved by the European Commission in July 1995.  The implementation of the programme throughout 1995 and 1996 involved advertising for funding, the development of local plans, the evaluation of the plans and allocation of funding by ADM.  The expenditure on the programme for 1996 was, accordingly, estimated at a reasonably low level. It is envisaged, however, that expenditure in 1997 will substantially increase and this is reflected in the 1997 allocation for the programme in the Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>Since this question relates to the European Union, may I be permitted to express my appreciation to the Leader of the Opposition, the only Opposition party present in the House today, for the co-operation given to the Irish Presidency in the European Parliament?  It was my job to take questions on behalf of the European Parliament.  The leader of the Fianna Fáil group, Mr. Collins, pledged the group's co-operation which was forthcoming.  I greatly appreciate that; it was very much in the national interest.  They did their job as MEPs but they were very co-operative and I welcome the opportunity to record my appreciation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, through the Minister of State, for their belated support for the rowing back in relation to this fund.  The House will recall that an effort was made, sponsored by the socialist group in the European Parliament budgetary committee, to remove much of this funding from the allocation and direct it elsewhere.  I thank the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for their efforts in that regard which were important for the Border areas.  What proportion of this fund has been spent on administration this year and what is the estimate for next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties provides for a new five year community initiative with EU funding of approximately £240 million for the years 1995-7 with 20 per cent, approximately £48 million, being allocated in the Border regions.  It has been agreed that a minimum of 15 per cent of total funding will be spent on cross-Border projects.  I do not have the administration costs in this regard.  Some of it will be administered by and through ADM and some by local authorities.  I will try to obtain an estimate for the Deputy but it will only be an estimate because much of the administration is being done by existing organisations.  I expect in some cases they will have to take on additional resources but I do not believe that will be a substantial part of the £240 million which has been committed.</P>

Will the Minister indicate the percentage of funding that will be allocated to the six southern Border counties?  In regard to Deputy Ahern's comment, I never suspected that the fund would have been abolished or drastically reduced by the socialist party knowing that a very influential member of that party in the European Parliament is John Hume, who has done more than many others for cross-Border co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on Tuesday, 10 December 1996 in reply to Private Notice Questions, I was made aware of the residual problem relating to HIV infected blood on Monday, 9 December when I was briefed by my Department on the incident at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The BTSB has confirmed it did not inform my Department until 8 December 1996 of the residual problem relating to potentially infected HIV blood.  The residual problem can be stated as follows.  It has not been possible to date to trace all the recipients of the 16 issues derived from potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985 from the blood of seven donors who have tested positive for HIV since HIV testing of blood donors commenced in October 1985.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on Tuesday, 10 December, 24 blood donors have tested positive in the 11 years of testing.  Eight of these donors were first time donors and, accordingly, no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved. In the case of nine of the remaining 16 donors, recipients of issues regarded as being at risk were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tracing of recipients of the issues from the remaining seven donors has been rendered very difficult by the absence of the BTSB dispatch records for the period prior to 1986.  Of the 31 issues from these seven donors, 17 were donated prior to 1981 and are not regarded as a potential source of infection.  As I have already stated, the residual problem relates to tracing the recipients of the balance of 16 issues derived from <Col N="62" /> potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House on 10 December, I understand that following the introduction of the HIV donor screening test in October 1985, no look-back was undertaken in the period between 1985 and 1989 in respect of earlier donations made by donors who now screened positive. However, their donations were not used and they were advised to contact their general practitioner for further assessment and counselling.  I also informed the House on 10 December that the BTSB had, from 1989 onwards, a look-back procedure for newly presenting donors.</P>
    <P>It was under this procedure that a look-back on previous donations took place in respect of a donor who tested HIV positive in March 1993. This particular donor had donated previously in November 1989 and May 1990.  The 1990 donation was traced and tested negative.  The BTSB, therefore, considered it unnecessary to undertake a look-back on the 1989 donation.  I should emphasise that this 1993 donor is one of the nine donors whom I have already mentioned where recipients of issues regarded as being at risk were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.  I indicated that last Tuesday in reply to the Private Notice Question.</P>
    <P>Following the 1993 look-back on this particular donor, the then chief medical consultant of the BTSB wrote to the chief medical officer of my Department on 16 April 1993 outlining the action taken following the identification of this donor. The letter was at that stage brought to the attention of the other relevant senior officers in the Department by the CMO.  This letter was brought to my attention by officials of my Department on Friday last, 13 December.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of this letter of 16 April 1993, I understand that at the next meeting of the board of the BTSB, held on 21 April 1993, the chief medical consultant reported to the board meeting on the recent look-back and was requested by the board to prepare an updated Protocol for the handling of such cases in the future.  I understand that a revised Protocol was submitted and accepted in principle by the board of the BTSB at its next meeting on 26 May 1993.</P>
    <P>Since my statement to the House on 10 December 1996, I have met with Mr. Liam Dunbar, chief executive officer of the BTSB, and officials of my Department have also met senior management of the board on a number of occasions.  I sought an explanation as to why the board did not inform me or my Department until last week of the residual problem which exists in relation to untraced donations.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has provided me with a detailed document setting out its approach to the look-back in respect of the seven donors and 31 issues which gave rise to concern.  I do not want to read a long report into the record of the House because I would probably be accused of attempting a filibuster.  However, I intend, a Cheann Comhairle, to make the report I got from <Col N="63" /> the BTSB on this issue available to Deputies.  I am also, as requested, circulating a copy of the BTSB's letter of 25 September addressed to the hospitals.  In addition, I am circulating full details of the main features of the work programme undertaken by the new management of the BTSB since April 1995.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will note from a reading of the document dealing with the look-back, it was decided by the BTSB to avail of the mechanism of the tracing programme for hepatitis C undertaken by the hospitals to determine the possibility of tracing the small number of potential HIV infected individuals.  Then it planned to assess the results of that initiative in terms of the number of issues traced or untraced. When the outcome of this was known, it was intended to inform the Department of Health with a full assessment and recommendations for action at that stage.</P>
    <P>I feel that the BTSB should have informed me and my Department in advance of the arrangements which it intended to put in place to trace the recipients of the potentially infected blood issues.  However, I accept that the management of the BTSB acted in good faith and saw valid reasons for proceeding in the manner in which it did.</P>
    <P>During the past week the BTSB, with the assistance of my Department, has intensified its efforts with hospitals in tracing recipients and I was informed earlier today that the position is as follows.  There are 31 outstanding issues, 15 of which relate to pre-1981 donations and are not considered to be a potential source of infection. There are 16 issues of concern, of which six have now been traced, leaving ten issues of concern which remain to be traced.</P>
    <P>As I assured the House last week, I have given this matter very serious consideration.  I am advised there can be no guarantee that all the remaining ten issues will ever be traced.  I am also aware that some donors who may have been HIV positive prior to the introduction of the screening of donations in October 1985 have not come back to donate since 1985 and, therefore, cannot be identified.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, decided that there should be an optional HIV testing programme put in place for blood transfusion and blood product recipients between the beginning of 1981 and October 1985.  I have instructed my Department to put in place the necessary arrangements with the BTSB and other health agencies so that the optional testing programme can commence in January 1997, aimed at the cohort of people who were recipients of blood or blood products during this period.  Of course, the trace back will continue in parallel for the ten issues which have not been traced.</P>
    <P>Deputies who tabled questions have asked me to make a statement on this matter.  Since I replied to the Private Notice Question on 10 December, there have been criticisms made of <Col N="64" /> the board's performance and, in one instance, a call made for its disbandment.  I think it is essential to put the matters raised by the Deputies in context and to avoid creating further avoidable problems in what is an already difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Deputies share with me an appreciation of the enormous difficulties which face the board and its new management in undertaking a vast programme of reorganisation and restructuring in one of the State's most vital health agencies.  This is being undertaken against a background of unprecedented adverse circumstances which have their origins in events which occurred over a period of 20 years.</P>
    <P>I have circulated to Deputies details of the 17 major initiatives undertaken by the new management team since April 1995.  I would, in particular, like to highlight the significant steps which have been taken to improve quality assurance measures.  These include improvements in donor screening; archiving of samples of all donations; improvements in the structure of the laboratories, including the construction of a specific hepatitis C laboratory; upgrading of the quality assurance function and the introduction of environmental monitoring; ensuring standard operational procedures manuals are in force in all areas of the BTSB; and the introduction of HLTV I and II viral screening.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, the new management has had to cope with an unprecedented volume of litigation and the preparation of documentation for submission to the tribunal of inquiry.  It has also managed to maintain the blood supply, the essential and primary purpose of its existence.  It is my view that the scale of the renewal and reorganisation process is such that it will require a further number of years of intensive work before the BTSB's job is completed.  During this period the board and management of the BTSB needs and deserves the support of the Minister and the House.</P>
    <P>The issue of extending the current tribunal of inquiry to examine the questions which have arisen in relation to HIV infection has been raised.  The current tribunal of inquiry in relation to hepatitis C has been conducted with widely acclaimed efficiency, expedition and care by Mr. Justice Finlay.</P>
    <P>I am advised, and it is my own view, that it is not appropriate that the careful planning and scheduling of that inquiry should be disrupted in midstream, but rather that it should be allowed complete that work.  Deputies will be aware that the terms of reference for that inquiry include provision for an interim report not later than the 20th day of oral hearings.  I understand that the tribunal will adjourn this week for the Christmas break and I expect to receive the interim report during the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>It is very important that neither I nor the House should presume upon the willingness of any particular person to conduct a further inquiry into a different, although related, matter.  Any <Col N="65" /> new questions would involve the assembling of new documents and statements, steps which would involve further time and effort of unknown dimensions.</P>
    <P>What I propose is exploring the feasibility of either extending the existing terms of reference or setting up an additional but related inquiry to deal with specific questions which are now being raised in relation to HIV infection and the way that that problem was handled by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The success of the current tribunal is widely ascribed, among other things, to the specificity of the terms of reference and if there is to be an extension of this inquiry, or an associated inquiry in relation to HIV, then that example should be followed.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that terms of reference which express specific questions can be drawn up with care and reasonable expedition and put before the Dáil at the end of January, at which stage the interim report will be to hand and it will hopefully have been possible to explore with the tribunal whether it, or some variant of it, could best undertake these further inquiries.</P>

      <P>I hope, a Cheann Comhairle, you will be lenient with us considering the length of the Minister's reply which lasted almost 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>I suggested to the Minister this morning that he should come before the House in a special way, and not just in response to Priority Questions, to deal with this issue.  The necessity for this has been borne out by his reply.  There are two documents which neither I nor Deputy O'Donnell possesses.  The first is the full work programme of the new management and the second is the report of the Blood Transfusion Service Board to the Minister.  I appreciate the reason he gave for not having either of those for us.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will appreciate it is rather difficult for us to go through them at this stage.  We know from the Minister's answer that on 16 April 1993 the chief medical consultant of the Blood Transfusion Service Board brought the HIV contamination problem to the attention of the chief medical officer in the Department.  The Minister stated that the chief medical officer brought that to the attention of the relevant officials in his Department.  Did they tell the Secretary of the Department at that time?  Did the Secretary of the Department tell the then Minister?  When the Minister realised that he had not been informed, did he ask the Secretary why?  I have great difficulty in establishing what, if any, new Protocols have been put in place by the Minister since the hepatitis C scandal.  The Minister did say last week at the committee that if anybody should have learned from the mishandling of the <Col N="66" /> hepatitis C scandal, it should be the Minister for Health.  I would have expected the same.  I want to know what communication there is between the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the chief medical officer of the Department and the Minister, and at what level.  Why are there Department of Health officials on the Blood Transfusion Service Board if not to keep a watchful eye on the Minister and to report back to him if necessary?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A number of questions have been raised.  In my reply to the House last Tuesday I outlined the number of donors who offered blood to the BTSB who had tested positive for HIV from 1985 to 1996.  In my reply I stated that three people presented in 1993, one of whom was the subject of the letter to which we refer.  The circumstances are that a donor came forward to give blood and tested positive for HIV.  His blood was not used, but it was discovered that he was a repeat donor who had given blood in 1990 and in 1989.  There was discussion between the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and the chief medical officer of the BTSB.  There was an immediate look-back at the donor who, it was discovered, had tested negative in 1990.  That information was given orally and, in effect, the all clear was given. The problem when a donor tests positive is not that his blood will be used, because it is screened out immediately, but whether he or she was in the system previously.  The all clear was given quickly that the donor had tested negative in 1990.  Subsequently, in May, details that had already been given orally were made in writing. There is no mystery about it.  It was just the manner in which one donor out of the 16 donors who tested positive from 1985 to 1996 was dealt with.  Senior officials in the Department were informed.  The Minister was informed of the problem in the first instance and, very quickly thereafter, was informed that in 1990 the donor had tested negative.  The letter, which has been the subject of much comment in the newspapers, simply put in writing information that had been given already.  Nothing hinges on that.</P>
      <P>What I do not understand is why the Deputies who have addressed themselves to this issue seem to have avoided the main issue, which is why no look-back took place from 1985 to 1989 or subsequently.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy had colleagues who were Ministers for Health from 1987 until 1994.  There were two repeat donors who tested positive in 1987, there were none in 1988, one in 1989, one in 1990, one in 1991, two in 1992, three in 1993 and two in 1994.  Two of the Deputy's colleagues who are medical doctors were in the Department of Health at that time. The Deputy leader of Fianna Fáil was in the <Col N="67" /> Department of Health at the time, but the Deputy is asking me to explain why nothing was done until I became Minister.  The look-back commenced last May, as nothing had been done up to then about the problem of people who got blood between 1980 and 1985.  I am not ascribing political blame to anybody, but I am tired of explaining the defects of the regimes of my predecessors; I am tired of explaining things that happened in the distant past.  If I get my way this will go into the inquiry along the lines I suggested, and it can be explored.</P>
      <P>Let me put something else to the Deputies across the floor.  Everybody knows the 1989 election was triggered on a vote during Private Members' time.  The approximate cause of the 1989 election was the fact that haemophiliacs had been infected and the manner in which the Government of the day refused point-blank to give them any compensation.  Subsequently there was a very uncertain result to the election but eventually, after a long period, the former Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Malley came together and formed a Government in 1989.  That Government gave a commitment to give compensation to haemophiliacs.  How is it that the people in the parties who now have all the wisdom did not have a review of HIV infection in blood product when that was the cause of the election that brought them to power?  Why did they not raise the issue of HIV infection in the blood supply?  It was a current issue all over Europe in the 1980s.  It was not an issue in my time, unfortunately for 1,600 people, mostly women.  Hepatitis C was the issue which concentrated our minds before I became Minister for Health and during my time as Minister for Health.  No donors tested positive for HIV in 1995 or 1996.  Donors tested positive in every year from 1985 to 1994, and every party in this House held power during that time.  I will not be lectured on probity by people on the other side of the House when they had better opportunities nearer the event to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>I put in new management in discussions with the new chairman of the BTSB, Professor Shaun McCann, who has now returned to his professorship at Trinity College and has been replaced by a full-time chief medical officer who is a haematologist, and Mr. Liam Dunbar, the former chief executive of St. James's Hospital. They took on this task when it would have been difficult to get people to take it on.  It is no joy to run the BTSB at the moment.  Because of all the difficulties, it is not a great career move to run the BTSB, if one has another job.  I would like to see people giving a small bit of credit to these people for their public spirit in actually taking on this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put all the facts before the House and stated how we will proceed.  We will have an optional testing programme to trace those who have not been traced already.  We will continue with the look-back programme the BTSB is <Col N="68" /> running.  I have laid out in great detail the manner in which I intend to proceed in getting this matter inquired into judicially.  When we come back in January, I hope to present the House with terms of reference and we can have the fullest debate possible.  We will not simply debate my tenure in the Department of Health.  We will debate everything from 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>Nobody is blaming the Minister for the failure of the BTSB to do anything in terms of tracing those persons whom they knew, 11 years ago, to have been possibly contaminated by their product, HIV-infected transfusion.  My question relates to the board which has been <i>in situ</i> since his term of office.  That is the political question which is asked of the Minister today. The Minister continually cites the maintenance of public confidence in the blood supply as the paramount objective of both him and his Department.  Does he consider it inspires public confidence in the blood supply when, on three occasions in the space of a week, he had to explain to the House the failure of the board to inform him and his Department that, on the basis of legal advice obtained this summer, it investigated this matter and distributed a cryptic and misleading letter to 45 hospitals?  Does he also consider it inspires public confidence that, up to last Friday night, his Department advised that it was first notified of contamination last week and that he is now a permanent apologist for the board and the previous board?</P>
      <P>The present board was meant to be a fresh start, yet it is taking up where the outgoing board left off in terms of lack of accountability, secret operations and failing to keep the Minister informed of crucial matters for which he is politically responsible.  Is he satisfied that until last Friday night, the response of the board was one of self preservation and damage limitation, in the same mode as the previous board?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I outlined how the new management of the BTSB reviewed the look-back programmes in respect of the 16 individual donors and how a look-back was undertaken to trace infections every time a positive donor was discovered.  In so doing, the board found a significant gap which it proceeded to trace, putting discreet arrangements in place.  I already indicated that it would have been better if the board had informed me at the start of the process.  However, it advised that it was trying to follow the trail to identify the risk before reporting to me and my Department.  This is a tenable explanation.</P>
      <P>This event occurred between 1980-5 when many Ministers and boards were in office, and many political appointments were made to the boards.  While the first management group to address the issue, undertake a look-back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is similarly unfair to call for the abolition of the BTSB, as the Deputy's party has done.  Indeed, it is ridiculous populism to call for its abolition in circumstances where it is the only supplier in the country, with people undergoing operations every day and with the attendant increase in the number of accidents over Christmas.  It would be more realistic to call for the abolition of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not reply to the question on communications.  What is the level of communication between the chief executive officer, the board, the officials in the Department of Health and the Minister?  What changes has the Minister made since the hepatitis C scandal?  I presume he changed the Protocol on the communication of vital information to him from an institution, such as the blood board.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister appoint a senior official from his Department to be based in the BTSB?  If so why and when was this done?  What functions within the board does this individual have?  The Minister says that the BTSB should have informed him in advance.  What was the response of the Chief Executive Officer to this?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I told the chief executive officer of the BTSB that he should have informed me in advance of putting procedures in place for the look-back programme, which investigates the residual problem described by the Deputy.  He agreed that, on consideration, he perhaps should have done so.  However, he then explained why it was his intention to report at the end of the process.  He knew there would still be a residual problem because the records were bad and rather than presenting the opening position <Col N="70" /> he decided he would complete the process, which we are now reaching, and then advise.  While this is a tenable explanation, I would have preferred if he had informed me at the outset.</P>
      <P>The relationship between my Department and the BTSB is regular and ongoing.  In line with all situations involving agencies, I have delegated communications to the Secretary of my Department.  An assistant secretary has specific responsibility in this area.  I meet the chief executive officer, the chief medical officer and the chairman of the board when it is appropriate to discuss specific matters.  An officer in my Department joined the BTSB.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The flow of information is stronger and better than it was prior to the time when my predecessor was Minister.  As Minister for Health in 1994, he told the House of the position regarding hepatitis C and the fact that so many people had been infected.  The reporting procedures improved significantly from that point.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the reporting procedures, although I should have obtained information on this issue in the early summer rather than in the first week in December.  However, the only difference this would have made would have been in respect of my ability to communicate it earlier to the House, but not with the level of certainty I have today.</P>
      <P>I will obtain a more detailed reply for the Deputy regarding an official from my Department.  An officer from my Department at either principal level or assistant principal level assisted Mr. Dunbar for a period.  However, nothing hinges on that.  He was only involved in helping the incoming chief executive officer of an organisation with a long tradition and who required specific assistance.  There was nothing peculiar about his involvement and I will communicate more detailed information to the Deputy in due course.</P>

When dealing with the Department of Health Estimate last Thursday, the Minister was questioned by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and me on the level and state of knowledge of his Department with regard to possible HIV infection in blood.  Did his officials make him aware of the letter of 16 April 1993, to which he referred today?</P>

I said I was not giving the Deputy a huge amount of additional information and I gave a commitment to come back with all the information I had at this point.  I was shown the letter on Friday.  They did not have that information until Friday when it was pointed out to them by the BTSB.  Today I have given chapter and verse on it.  Anybody who has held office will appreciate that when something happens suddenly the Minister is given as much information as possible and the most accurate information is given to the House at the first opportunity.  Those among the Opposition who have held office will also know that additional information can come to hand subsequently.  If it is relevant there is an obligation to communicate it to Deputies and that is what I did.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has been in office or is an office holder when a major scandal erupts in the Department for which they have responsibility ensures that the flow of information from their civil servants to themselves is cleared in a specific way and that guidelines are laid down by them.  The Minister's head is on the block in this House and with the public interest.  It seems there is no communication between his officials and him.  In that context how can we expect communication between the blood board and his officials?  Will the Minister explain how he could have given one item of information on Thursday last &mdash; in an Estimates debate in which a substantial amount of his speech was devoted to the hepatitis C scandal, the hepatitis B issue and the HIV infection &mdash; and how his officials did not give him basic information relating to issues they knew he would be asked about?  How can the Minister justify their not giving him that level of information?</P>
      <P>What we are talking about in relation to these scandals in the blood board is not missing files but people's lives and the Minister being accountable for what is happening during his tenure in the Department and the lack of a flow of information.  What changes has the Minister put in place in respect of communication between the blood board and his Department and between the Department and himself?  Surely he will not tell me he is happy with the same flow of information which existed prior to the hepatitis C scandal.  We must have learned since then.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now saying he did not have the right officials with him when he was asked the questions.  This is a new development and it is not surprising from this Minister.  Will the Minister agree that up to Friday last the Department of Health denied it had any knowledge of HIV infection in blood, that it was only on Friday night when the media said it had information about a letter of 16 April and confronted the blood board with that fact, and ultimately the Department, that the Department of Health and the BTSB announced a damage limitation exercise stating there had been a letter but that the Minister had not been informed?  It is convenient that the Minister was not informed because as we are aware from the Dominic Lynch affair, if the Minister does not know then the Minister is not responsible.  He has conveniently described it to the House today, saying that maybe his officials knew but he did not know and cannot be accountable.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy O'Donnell will always try to misrepresent what I said.  When I addressed the House last week I gave the information I had to date on the Private Notice Question.  I heard about the events on the Monday night and gave a very full answer on Tuesday afternoon.  I approached the Estimate in the normal way with a full range of officials who were experts on the financing of the various sections of the Department.  I briefed myself on the other matters in anticipation that the Deputies would raise them and gave very full replies.  I am not making any excuse.  The position still remains the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> The letter of 1993 which was the cause of newspaper comment over the weekend was brought to my attention on Friday.  I have examined the full facts and I have given the House the information.  It was about a donor who was positive in 1993.  Obviously they would not use his donation but they discovered he was a repeat donor.  When the previous donations were checked they were found to be negative.  As in any Department there was anxiety for a couple of days and the word came through that in 1990 the recipient was negative.  Subsequently medical officer to medical officer reported by way of letter but nothing hinges on that.  It was discussed as if the donor was positive at the time his blood was used.  That is not the situation.</P>
    <P>The donor tested positive the same as any donor giving blood.  The blood was not used. Obviously when it was discovered he was a repeat donor that caused anxiety.  When the immediate previous donation was checked and found to be negative the anxiety disappeared.  Subsequently, because of this, it was reported in writing and a new Protocol was put in place at the next board meeting.  That is my full information about that letter.  That 1993 letter was not relevant to what I explained last week because it was about a donation on which there was a look-back and the all-clear was given.</P>

His explanation that he did not believe this issue would be raised and that, therefore, he did not bring the appropriate officials does not hold water.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What I said is that the normal progress of HIV runs its course and there is quite a period between the date of infection and the development of symptoms &mdash; normally symptoms develop between the tenth and twelfth year.  These incidents took place between 1980 and 1985.  There was not the same level of risk during 1981 to 1985 and the risk increased nearer 1985.  This is the way the infection came into the system.</P>
      <P>I said that, on the basis of the empirical evidence, the numbers involved in absolute terms in 1996 will be small.  More than 1,600 people were tested for HIV and the primary cause of infection was identified in only one case, apart from the Kilkenny case, as being blood related. That blood transfusion was received in another European Union country.  I said in my statement that we had identified the person in Kilkenny who, unfortunately, had been infected.  This is a great tragedy for her and I am sure all Deputies will join me in expressing sympathy to her and her family.  I said that, apart from her, only one of the 1,600 people tested for HIV was positive, and that person was infected by a donation received outside the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the look-back programme, the infection has been traced down to ten.  A man in his 70s from the north west received one of these issues but he seems to be in full health.  He received the blood a long time ago but is being tested.  A deceased person from the west received an issue during his terminal illness but it is clear he died from the underlying causes of his illness.  A deceased elderly man from the midlands &mdash; this area is <Col N="76" /> covered by the South-Eastern Health Board &mdash; received blood in hospital but did return to hospital.  The Deputy can draw her own conclusions from that case.  A Dublin man who also received an issue died at 69 years.  A person in the west who received an issue has been approached and is being tested.  I hope this case works out well.</P>
      <P>One person has tested positive for HIV, two people have not displayed symptoms but will be tested as quickly as possible and a number of people are deceased.  There is no evidence to suggest that the blood the deceased people received contributed to their deaths as they died in advanced age.  However, one can never be 100 per cent certain.  It is very easy to sound callous when giving statistics.  Regardless of the cause, the deaths were a tragedy for the people involved and their families.  I extend my sympathy to those people caught in the wider reaches of this infection.</P>
      <P>There are still ten issues which have not been traced and we are redoubling the efforts to trace them.  Apart from the initial letter &mdash; this was the discreet approach in accordance with the look-back programme carried out by the BTSB in respect of hepatitis C &mdash; my Department contacted all chief executive officers and hospital managers to ensure there was absolute co-operation and to make it clear what was being sought.  Extra people were brought in to check files.  Rather than check the blood transfusion files with numbers of batches which no longer exist they are checking hospital files to see if the names are recorded on them.  This is a big job and I hope that the other ten issues are traced.  My advice is that even if the other ten issues are traced there is a group which will not be found. As Minister I have an obligation and duty &mdash; the House shares in this &mdash; to trace this group by offering an optional testing programme through GPs.  We did this with great success in respect of hepatitis C when the records were not sufficient to identify people.  We have identified a number of people and they have been approached.  This is the way we are proceeding at present.</P>
      <P>On the question of the inquiry, Deputies will appreciate that Judge Finlay willingly took on a very onerous task with specific terms of reference.  I need to have discussions with the people associated with the tribunal before I decide whether a modification of the terms of reference or a parallel ensuing tribunal is the way forward.</P>

I described how look-back programmes were initiated in respect of some of those donors for various years.  One of the three positive donors in 1993 was the subject of correspondence which led to the introduction of a new Protocol, but that is not the central issue. We had 16 untraced blood products which could have potentially infected Irish citizens between 1980 and 1985.  Even though the infections took place between 1980 and 1985 and look-back programmes were initiated internationally from 1986, there were no such programmes initiated from 1985 to 1989.  That is what we must examine. That is the central issue, not the issues that are being rehearsed all over the place.</P>

Will the Minister of State's announcement be accompanied by an initiative to ensue that the public is clear on the action people can take if they suspect abuse?  Will he ensure teachers and other professionals get ongoing training on handling these issues in schools and communities?  People are unclear about how to act when they have suspicions of abuse and they are concerned about litigation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> In page 3, to delete lines 14 to 18.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete that part of section 1 which would give the Minister power to bring the Bill into force in parts through commencement orders.  The effect of the amendment is that the Bill would come into force immediately upon being signed into law by the President.  The Minister indicated last week during a meeting with me that he would have no objections in principle to doing this.  I tabled the amendment because there is no reason to delay the implementation of any of the provisions.  It provides that on the day the Bill will be signed into law its principal measures concerning the obligations on local authorities and returning officers to provide accessible polling procedures and the extension of the postal vote can come into effect without further work.</P>
    <P>The provision of Braille templates at polling stations will require a small amount of work.  That is recognised by the devolution to the Minister of the power to make regulations in the area. Overall, Fianna Fáil wants to stress there can be no further excuse for delay in providing accessible polling.  This is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 19 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;The Electoral Act, 1992, is hereby amended in section 28 by&mdash;</P>
      <P>the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(1A)  Each local authority shall, in making a scheme under this section, endeavour to appoint as polling places <Col N="83" /> only such areas as shall allow the returning officer to provide at each polling place at least one polling station which is accessible to wheelchair users.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (5):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(5A) (a) Where it is not practicable to provide a polling station which is accessible to wheelchair users at a polling place appointed for a polling district by a scheme for the time being in force in respect of a county or county borough, the local authority may appoint an alternative polling place at which it is practicable to provide a polling station which is accessible to wheelchair users for that polling district.</P>
    <P>(b)  As soon as may be after the appointment of an alternative polling place for a polling district under paragraph (a), the local authority shall notify in writing details of such appointment to the Minister.&rsquo;,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(c)  the substitution in subsection (6) for 'a scheme under this section shall be' of 'a scheme under this section and an appointment under subsection (5A) of an alternative polling place for a polling district in a scheme for the time being in force shall each be'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for the amendment of section 28 of the Electoral Act, 1992, to enable a local authority to appoint an alternative polling place for a polling district where the existing polling place does not allow the provision of a polling station which is accessible to wheelchair users.  The adjustment to a polling scheme under this amendment can be effected without the necessity of drawing up a complete new polling scheme for the local authority area.  It would not be necessary to seek the approval of the Minister to such a proposal under my amendment.  The local authority is simply required to notify details of such change to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an alternative polling station under this provision will be a reserved function as is the adoption of a revised polling scheme currently.  This provision complements section 2 as amended by the select committee. That section requires local authorities in making a polling scheme to endeavour to appoint as polling places only such places as will allow the returning officer to appoint at a polling place at least one polling station which is accessible to wheelchair users.  The new provision will enable local authorities to react to a change in circumstances during the currency of a polling scheme without undue formality and to achieve <Col N="84" /> the objectives we commonly share as set out in section 2.</P>
    <P>The amendment will meet the objectives of Deputy Wallace and the requirements sought by the select committee in a more user efficient and less cumbersome way than her amendment and I ask her to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides alternative wording to an amendment we tabled on Committee Stage and provides for a simplification of the polling scheme process where it is intended to extend the provision of accessible polling.

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3) of section 94:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3A)  The returning officer shall give public notice in such form as may be directed by the Minister of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than the eighth day before the polling day.&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment requires returning officers to provide public notice when they put polling stations in inaccessible buildings.  It is proposed that this be done at least eight days before polling.  Such notice will give those affected by inaccessible polling stations a chance to meet the deadline to apply to vote at an accessible station. At present people must apply to vote at another station seven days before polling day, but they only receive their polling card three days before polling day.  In practical terms the way the law is currently written does not provide a way for such people to exercise their right to vote elsewhere.</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary because of the Minister's difficulty with the Bill's original proposal to change the deadlines included in the 1992 Act and to oblige that polling cards contain information on accessibility.  The Minister originally agreed to consider those points but stated on Committee Stage that he was informed they were not practical.</P>
      <P>The amendment represents the very minimum we can do to give people a practical opportunity to exercise their right to vote at an accessible polling station.  There can be no doubt that this amendment is practical.  Polling stations are decided at least eight days before polling and under the Bill the returning officer is obliged to take account of their accessibility.  It is reasonable to expect at least some public notice concerning accessibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Giving public notice will provide a means of <Col N="85" /> assessing whether the Bill is being properly complied with.  At present there is no means of determining the level of accessible polling being provided by returning officers.  That was demonstrated on a number of occasions.  The Minister will recall I tabled a question on that matter but he was unable to give that information because the Department did not have it.  The inclusion of this amendment would assist the compilation of such information.</P>
    <P>A justification for opposing the Bill's original proposals was that advertisements could be put in newspapers that would have the same effect.  This will ensure something as fundamental as this cannot continue to have the administrative basis which failed utterly to provide accessible polling stations to date.  Acceptance of this amendment would indicate the Minister's good faith in helping people to have access to a polling station to vote.  I know the Minister is concerned with this issue and this amendment represents a reasonable way of dealing with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to this Bill demonstrates my concern about the issue the Deputy has just mentioned.  As she said repeatedly, it is quite unusual for the Government to accept a Private Members' Bill from the Opposition but this was done on the basis that it was good law, that we could work together to have an enactment that represented not only progressive but practical legislation. There are a number of practical issues which I, as Minister, am charged to have regard to.</P>
      <P>The issue sought to be addressed in this amendment is one rehearsed on Committee Stage.  I have explained the difficulties in accepting the thrust of this amendment because of the practical burden it would place on presiding and returning officers but I am anxious to move as close to the Deputy's proposal as I can.  Therefore, I suggest that we insert the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first line and delete the words &ldquo;in such form as may be directed by the Minister&rdquo; in lines 1 and 2 of the amendment.  Amendment No.4 would then read:</P>
      <P>The returning officer shall, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than the eighth day before the polling day.</P>
      <P>That would allow sufficient flexibility for the returning officer to comply with the law but at the same time would ensure that somebody could not overturn a decision from a polling station by virtue of it not being possible to live up to this requirement.  That captures the spirit of the Deputy's amendment while affording the returning officer sufficient flexibility.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Returning Officer shall not later than one month following the conclusion of the count inform the Minister where an inaccessible place was appointed at which to count the votes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments would oblige returning officers to inform the Minister whenever they use inaccessible buildings as count centres.  The purpose is to afford the Minister the Oireachtas and the public a means of assessing the degree of compliance with this section.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that one of the consistent features of our electoral system has been a presumption that something was being done merely because it was detailed in the relevant regulations, which is clearly absurd.  For example, the Department of the Environment has no means of assessing compliance with the accessibility requirements of Part M of the building regulations, a point I raised also on amendment No.4.</P>
      <P>These two amendments represent a tiny, reasonable and proportionate administrative imposition on returning officers.  I hope the Minister will find his way to accepting amendments No. 5 and No. 6 which propose to amend the local election regulations in like manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Section 5 provides for the insertion in electoral law of a requirement that the returning officer shall, where practicable, ensure that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 propose to add a further provision into electoral law.  They require the returning officer to inform the Minister of each case where a count centre appointed by him or her is not accessible to wheelchair users, not later than one month following the conclusion of the count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept these amendments.  A returning officer is an independent, statutory officer responsible for conducting the election and counting the votes, as set out in section 31 of the <Col N="87" /> Electoral Act, 1992.  He or she is not answerable to the Minister and does not have to account for the performance of his or her functions to the Minister.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to require a returning officer to furnish the Minister with details of any count centre not accessible to wheelchairs.  That would be inconsistent with electoral law which places full responsibility and independence on a returning officer for the performance of his or her duties.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a new provision which, for the first time, places a statutory requirement on returning officers to appoint places, where practicable, accessible to wheelchair users to be used as count centres.  I cannot see how provision along the lines set out in these amendments would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I went as far as I could on the previous amendment.  Since I would be concerned to trespass on the statutory independence of returning officers, I ask that this amendment not be pressed.</P>

      <P>I am proud to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this will be the first legislative enactment to implement a recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disability published last month.  I thank the Minister who has been more than helpful on this and earlier Stages and has shown a commitment to help people with disabilities.  I am greatful to him for having persuaded his colleagues to accept this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledge the help of Deputy Jim Mitchell, chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, its Secretariat, the many people with disabilities and the organisations who contacted me in support of this important Bill, demonstrating that Members take seriously the right of those with disabilities to equal access to the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope local authorities and returning officers will ensure that all of its provisions are implemented by the time of the next general election, when there should be greater numbers of wheelchair accessible polling stations, thus ensuring a fairer voting system for those who to <Col N="88" /> date could not gain access to polling stations. They should also ensure the availability of Braille templates so that blind people can vote, unaided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we have agreed a further amendment today it might be useful to give a brief summary of its provisions, how it will impact on and dovetail into the body of electoral law. Under the Bill, as amended, a local authority, in devising a polling scheme, will have to endeavour to appoint polling places where at least one polling station in each polling district is accessible to wheelchair users.  Where a polling place appointed under an existing scheme does not allow for the appointment of an accessible polling station, a local authority will be able to appoint an alternative polling place without undue formality if a more suitable building becomes available in the vicinity but outside the polling place.</P>
      <P>Under this provision, returning officers will be required, where practicable, to provide polling stations and count centres accessible to wheelchair users.  While making arrangements in polling stations to facilitate the marking and placement of ballot papers in ballot boxes, they will be required to make such arrangements &mdash; to be provided for in regulations made by me &mdash; to facilitate electors with visual impairment to mark their ballot papers.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill postal voting is being extended to electors with a physical illness or disability which prevents them from voting at polling stations.  This arrangement will be available to such electors resident at their normal place of residence.  Special voting will continue to apply to such voters resident in hospitals, nursing homes etc.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a transitional arrangement to enable me, by regulation, to appoint dates for the giving of public notice and the receipt of applicaitons from electors for entry into the postal voters' list for the register which will come into operation in February next.  Once the Bill is passed by the other House, I intend to make those regulations without delay.  It is my intention, and I know it is the wish of Deputy Wallace, that they will have full effect for the next general election which, I hope, is many months away.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Wallace on her initiative in introducing this Bill and her tenacity in pursuing its passage through the House.  Both I and the officials in my Department have been relentlessly pursued to ensure its speedy enactment.  I am happy we have been able to work together to produce this important legislation which will make voting easier for those who are physically challenged.  It has been a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The origins of this Bill are in the Joint Communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister on 28 November 1995, when it was agreed to launch a twin track process to make progress in parallel on the decommissioning issue and on all-party negotiations.</P>
      <P>The process launched in November 1995 resulted in the establishment of the International Body, comprising Senator George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  The body was also asked to report on the arrangements necessary for the removal from the political equation of illegally held arms and, to that end, to identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning and report whether there was a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve that.</P>
      <P>The report of the International Body was presented to the Irish and British Governments on 22 January last and published two days later. Following its publication, the Government made clear that it accepted the report without reservation.  As I said in this House at that time, &ldquo;The Irish Government agrees with the report and is convinced it provides the basis to move forward confidently and with renewed vigour now in the political track&rdquo;.  Those were also the views of this House generally.</P>
      <P>Since then the Government has repeated on many occasions its commitment to all aspects of the report.  It has also consistently made clear in public statements its willingness to work with others to give effect to the report and to take the legislative and other measures necessary to that end, consistent with the proposals in the report. That is the purpose of the Bill we are discussing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the Bill has been taken forward since January by my Department, in close consultation with the Attorney General's office.  That process has also involved consultation with the Northern Ireland Office, and a key objective for both Governments was to ensure a legislative framework which would permit a co-ordinated approach and the implementation of complementary arrangements in both jurisdictions.  I am <Col N="90" /> satisfied that the combined effect of this Bill and the corresponding British legislation &mdash; the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Bill &mdash; will be to permit such an approach.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the Bill, I want to say something about the approach of this Government to the issue of decommissioning and its role in the Northern Ireland talks process.  Our approach to decommissioning has, from the beginning, been informed by the conviction that a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem must be sought and established exclusively by peaceful and democratic means.  More generally, that principle has informed the approach of successive Irish Governments to the Northern Ireland issue.</P>
    <P>Our approach continues to be guided by that conviction.  We have also, consistent with it, long recognised the importance of securing the decommissioning of arms held illegally both in this State and in Northern Ireland and Britain. Decommissioning is not only important in its own right in terms of upholding the rule of law but is capable of underpinning the peace process in a way that is both real, in terms of providing reassurance, and symbolic, in terms of demonstrating longer-term intent to resolve political differences by peaceful and democratic means.</P>
    <P>The Government has equally recognised, however, that decommissioning on its own cannot guarantee peace and would not in itself be decisive in preventing a return to violence at a future date.  The broader guarantee that the peace process is irreversible must come form the political process, underpinned by a negotiated settlement.  As the International Body's report puts it in paragraph 23: &ldquo;What is ultimately essential if the gun is to be taken out of Irish politics is an agreed political settlement and the total and verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nor have we sought to underestimate the difficulties that are likely to be involved in securing the voluntary decommissioning of illegally held arms.  The International Body recognised that the decommissioning question is closely related to the underlying issue of trust. Much as we might wish it were otherwise, therefore, the reality we have to deal with is that progress on decommissioning cannot be divorced from the need to secure political progress.  Nor, as the report of the International Body also makes clear, can decommissioning be divorced from other confidence building measures, such as the early termination of paramilitary activities and continued action on prisoners, illegally held firearms, policing and emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>The objective situation has undoubtedly changed since the International Body issued its report.  Events since January last have impacted negatively on the process of building trust between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  They do not, however, in the view of the Government, invalidate in any way the central argument advanced by the International Body <Col N="91" /> that decommissioning will not be brought about separately from progress in political negotiations no more than political negotiations are likely to result in agreement unless the recommendations made by the International Body are also brought forward.</P>
    <P>The Government therefore, remains convinced of that reality and the value of the report as a means of taking forward the decommissioning issue.  We believe that it sets out, in a realistic and practical way, a means of resolving the many practical problems associated with a process of total and verifiable decommissioning.  Sensibly, it also left many of the details for subsequent negotiation and agreement.</P>
    <P>The International Body recommended that decommissioning should receive a high priority in the all-party negotiations.  The convening of such negotiations was the key objective of the twin-track process launched by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in November 1995.  Much work by both Governments meant that it was possible to convene multi-party negotiations on the 10 June last and those talks have now been under way for some time.</P>
    <P>The issue of decommissioning is being addressed within the talks.  As part of that, the two Governments tabled a joint paper on 1 October setting out their proposals on how the issue could be dealt with as part of the wider talks process in a manner consistent with the broader considerations underlying the international body's report which I have already mentioned, Those proposals have, regrettabbly, not yet attracted sufficient agreement to allow progress to be made on decommissioning and substantive negotiations.  The Government is working actively with the other participants to secure an agreement which will enable progress on both issues to be made simultaneously.  This Bill has its part to play in that regard in that the Government hopes that its publication and enactment will contribute to a climate in which real progress can be made in the talks.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Bill and how it seeks to give effect to the International Body's report and the recommendations it contains.  A number of key considerations have determined the nature and approach adopted in the Bill.  First, there is a need for the legislative framework intended to facilitate decommissioning, in the sense that term is used in the body's report, to be realistic by recognising the basic and inescapable reality that decommissioning can only be effected by the parties who have possession of the arms and in circumstances where they are prepared to decommission.  Second, the International Body recommended guiding principles which should govern the decommissioning process.  These require that that process should suggest neither victory nor defeat; take place to the satisfaction of an independent commission; result in the complete destruction of armaments in a manner <Col N="92" /> that contributes to public safety; be fully verifiable; not expose individuals to prosecution and be mutual.  The report contained detailed recommendations intended to give these guiding principles effect.</P>
    <P>Third, there is a need, if decommissioning is to contribute to a progressive pattern of mounting trust and confidence, for the details of decommissioning to be determined by the parties themselves &mdash; a requirement to which the proposals tabled by both Governments on 1 October was directed, in that those proposals would have facilitated the involvement of the talks participants at all stages of the process, as progress was made on decommissioning.  Fourth, there is a need to permit a co-ordinated approach and the implementation of complementary arrangements in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland and Britain.  Fifth, there is a need to ensure public safety and that the rights of citizens are not otherwise prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Those considerations have meant that a number of important provisions in the Bill are enabling in character and are intended to preserve maximum flexibility in order to permit me to give effect to any arrangements that may be agreed as to how decommissioning would take place.  That is true of section 2, for example, which provides for the regulation making power, by means of which I will be empowered to make provision for the decommissioning of arms in this jurisdiction.  Furthermore, it provides for the introduction by regulation of the four methods of decommissioning identified by the international body.  These are the transfer of arms to a commission to be established by an agreement between the two Governments or to the designated representatives of either Government, for destruction; the provision of information to the commission or to designated representatives of either Government, leading to the discovery of arms for subsequent destruction; the depositing of arms for collection and subsequent destruction by the commission or by designated representatives of either Government and the destruction of arms by those in possession of them.</P>
    <P>I will be able to give effect to any combination of these methods of decommissioning or to other methods identified by the parties or any variation of them which may be agreed.  The section will also permit the transfer of arms from one jurisdiction to the other for the purpose of decommissioning as will the corresponding Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Bill. Provision is also made in the section for regulations to deal with such matters as the locations and times for decommissioning or any particular method or manner of decommissioning by reference either to particular methods of decommissioning or to the decommissioning of arms generally.</P>
    <P>The international body also recommended that the decommissioning process should take place to the satisfaction of an independent commission to <Col N="93" /> be appointed by the Irish and British Governments on the basis of consultations with the other parties to the negotiating process and that the commission should be able to operate independently in both jurisdictions and enjoy appropriate legal status and immunity.  Section 3 makes provision for such a commission which it is intended will be established by agreement between the two Governments.  The section guarantees the independence of the commission by providing that it will be independent in the performance of its functions and will have the legal capacity of a body corporate.  The issue of immunity is also dealt with by providing that I may make provision for inviolability, exemptions, facilities and immunities, privileges and rights in regard to the commission, its property and persons connected with the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 4 will enable regulations to be made by me regarding the commission.  The precise nature of the regulations will depend on the role which the commission will be required to perform in the context of whatever modalities of decommissioning are agreed.  Such a role under the section could include the making of arrangements for, and joining or assisting in, the decommissioning of arms; the taking possession of arms decommissioned; the observation, verification and supervision of the decommissioning of arms; the recording of information relating to the decommissioning of arms; the making of reports and the facilitating and securing of the safe and secure movement, handling and storage of arms during and after decommissioning.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the regulations, without prejudice to the generality of the regulation making power, may also provide for such matters as the membership of the commission, the terms and conditions under which members of the commission may hold office and staff may be employed, the provision of moneys, premises, etc. to the commission and other related matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 are concerned with the position of those in possession of illegally held arms who participate in the decommissioning process.  They provide protection for them in keeping with the recommendations contained in the international body's report.  The body recommended that individuals involved in the decommissioning process should not be prosecuted for the possession of those arms; amnesties should be established in law in both jurisdictions; arms made available for decommissioning should be exempt under law from forensic examination and that information obtained as a result of the decommissioning process should be inadmissible as evidence in courts of law in either jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will introduce an amnesty linked to the decommissioning process by prohibiting the taking of legal proceedings by the State in respect of an offence with regard to any particular arms provided that at the time of the commission of <Col N="94" /> the offence the person concerned was engaged in the process of the decommissioning of those arms in accordance with regulations or arrangements; the regulations or arrangements were satisfied as respects both the person and the decommissioning the decommissioning was taking or took place at a time or during a period specified in the regulations and the act constituting the offence or an act that is an ingredient of the offence was a part of the process of decommissioning and was done in pursuance of regulations or arrangements under which decommissioning was taking place.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for regulations which may specify particular offences to which the section applies either generally or by reference to particular methods of decommissioning if this is considered desirable.  The prohibition on proceedings will not apply to an offence alleged to have been committed by the use of arms before they have been decommissioned or, by virtue of subsection (4), to an offence alleged to have been committed by the use of arms after they have been decommissioned.  This latter provision is intended to meet the possibility of decommissioned arms being misappropriated after their decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Section 6 prohibits the forensic examination or the testing of arms or related material made available for decommissioning in accordance with regulations or arrangements.  The prohibition will apply not only to arms themselves, but to anything resulting from the process of decommissioning; any substance or thing found on or in arms decommissioned; anything on or in which arms were when they were decommissioned or any substance or other thing found on or in such a thing.  That prohibition is subject to certain specified and limited exceptions which are directed to ensuring that decommissioned arms or other substances can be handled safely, by allowing for testing for the presence, quantity and stability of ammunition, explosives or explosive substances, and the prohibition will not prevent the examination or testing of arms for the purpose of discovering information concerning an offence alleged to have been committed by the use of arms after they had been decommissioned. The section will also prohibit the use by, or on behalf of, the State of arms or information, obtained in the course of, or as the result of, decommissioning, in criminal proceedings or in any appeal in relation to such proceedings.  Also prohibited is the use by, or on behalf of, the State of evidence of anything done for the purposes of decommissioning in such proceedings or appeals. The only exception to those prohibitions is where the arms, information, etc. would be relevant to proceedings in the case of an offence alleged to have been committed after the decommissioning concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the core provisions of the Bill which are linked to the recommendations in the report of the International Body.  The other provisions are in standard form.  Section 1 contains the <Col N="95" /> definitions for the purpose of the Bill.  Section 7 contains the general provisions relating to the regulations which, in accordance with our standard practice, will require that regulations are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall be annulled if a resolution annulling them is passed by either House within 21 sitting days.  Section 8 contains the standard form of expenses provision.  Section 9 deals with the short title and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation will represent the first step in a process which can and should lead to the removal of the gun forever from the political equation in Ireland.  Other steps will have to be taken before that process can begin.  There is much significant and important work ahead before decommissioning can become a reality. That will require, first, the creation of conditions of peace.  In that connection I renew the appeal the Taoiseach has once again directed to the republican movement for an IRA ceasefire so that representatives of all the people can negotiate our future together free of threat. There is also much work to be done within the talks framework, both in terms of creating the conditions in which decommissioning will be possible and on the decommissioning issue.  The parties to the talks will, in that latter connection, be able to contribute to the development of the detailed schemes on the modalities of decommissioning decisions on the independent commission and its role and the role of other confidence building measures.</P>
    <P>The regulations which I, as Minister for Justice, will make will flow from those discussions.  The two Governments will in the meantime proceed with the preparatory work that will enable both Governments to give effect to agreements reached within the framework of the talks.  I am convinced this Bill can act as an important element in achieving progress towards a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland, one which we all hope will ensure that violence is never used for political ends.</P>
    <P>Many people thought this legislation might not be introduced because we did not think we would reach a stage where we could look forward to politics without the gun.  I pay tribute to the officials in the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's office who worked long and hard in preparing this sensitive legislation.  There was much co-operation with the Northern Ireland office and the British authorities in general.  I hope when our legislation and the British legislation, which is due to pass around the same time as this Bill &mdash; early in the next session &mdash; are passed, we will have the enabling legislation that will allow for the decommissioning of arms once and for all I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This Decommissioning Bill is essentially enabling legislation, broadly in line with the recommendations of the Mitchell report. That report and the legislation approach the whole issue in a flexible manner.  Both accept that the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons could be carried out in a wide variety of ways. The organisations holding the weapons may want to carry out decommissioning themselves or they may seek technical assistance from an independent third party such as the commission. Two things are important: that decommissioning should take place as part of a settlement and that it should be verifiable.  The establishment of an independent commission by the two Governments is designed to assist that.</P>
      <P>Any reservations we would have about the approach of the two Governments to decommissioning legislation, which has been introduced by both Parliaments &mdash; this matter will be dealt with by Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; relate mainly to its handling in a wider political context.  We would be against any attempt to present the legislation as reinforcing a precondition.  I am concerned that the passage of this legislation might encourage those parties who want to use decommissioning as a means of blocking the peace process more or less indefinitely, and with it Sinn Féin's access to the talks table, even in the context of an irrevocable IRA ceasefire.  On the other hand, we too in this Parliament have an obligation to show good faith and to take the legitimate concerns of others seriously.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, from our time in Government, has not doubted the importance of the decommissioning issue.  Huge arsenals of sophisticated weaponry have been built up by paramilitary organisations on both sides up to recent times.  There are no precedents for this in any previous period of Irish history to guide us. In conflicts in Latin America, South Africa and elsewhere the issue has been tackled, but not in such a way as to block peace negotiations.  The issue of illegal arms, however difficult, cannot be avoided when it comes to a peace settlement. Fianna Fáil does not wish to see the issue kicked into the long grass, in the sense of the issue being treated in advance as a lost cause that will eventually be forgotten about.  Neither Government could accept the continued existence of large arsenals, even in cold storage, as there would always be a temptation in times of political tension or crisis to resort to their use.  There is also the danger that paramilitary weapons could find their way into the hands of criminals or be used for criminal purposes.  Above all, lasting peace requires a clean break with the past, which is not possible if there are hidden arms dumps around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has argued strongly and consistently that decommissioning should not be a precondition to any progress in the peace process. That seems to be putting the cart before the <Col N="97" /> horse.  It is to ignore the lessons of history.  The War of Independence could have ended six months earlier in 1921 if Archbishop Clune's initiative had not been sabotaged by the Tory demand for a surrender of weapons.  It has always seemed inconsistent, in a talks process based on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, to demand that the decommissioning of illegal arms be settled in advance of any political progress.  We have been equally determined that decommissioning is an issue that must be tackled along with all other issues at the appropriate time.  Part of the commitment to a peaceful, democratic future will be demonstrated when decommissioning eventually takes place.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, like to dispel any illusions or cynicism that somehow or other the issue can be put off forever and that it need never be confronted.  While there are key issues of timing and monitoring to be resolved, it is a central and crucial confidence-building measure as Mitchell identified.  It is not entirely easy, however, for the Government to convey that message with the authority required.  No account has ever been given of whether Official IRA weapons, which were in use in the North until quite recently, have been decommissioned.  It is often argued, even by Unionists, that this is no longer a live issue.  On the other hand, however, it sets an undeniable example of a party and an organisation involved in the present troubles that got away with doing nothing about their arms, ultimately by the expedient of disassociation.  There are few issues on which it would be more important to have openness, transparency and accountability.  This is not least because the present position implies that there can be one standard required of the Provisional IRA and the loyalists and another standard required of others.</P>
    <P>The decommissioning issue has bedevilled the entire peace process.  It was turned into a blocking mechanism or a plausible excuse for inertia, as a leading journalist once put it, in Washington in March 1995 by the Secretary of State under pressure from the Ulster Unionist Party which was not prepared to negotiate on the basis of the Framework Document.  The reason the ceasefire was not restored and Sinn Féin did not take part in talks on 10 June was that they foresaw that the talks would be totally dominated by the decommissioning issue.  The question of permanence holding up admission to talks, followed by decommissioning, are the two lines of defence constructed by the British Government-Ulster Unionist Alliance to put off as long as possible, if not indefinitely, Sinn Féin entry into meaningful talks.  The Stormont talks have been held up by this issue for much of the autumn.  The full passage of this legislation through all Stages should await a satisfactory conclusion to the talks. While we are not opposing this legislation on Second Stage we will reserve our final position <Col N="98" /> on whether we believe its passage will assist and facilitate the peace process or merely serve to obstruct it further.</P>
    <P>It has been evident to us that there is a good opportunity for renewed peace at present.  The Hume-Adams initiative and the signals from the republican movement are clear.  Unfortunately, Anglo-Irish diplomacy at the highest level has signally failed to resolve the impasse.  The gap could be bridged with sufficient effort and as an experienced negotiator I urge people not to give up at this stage, particularly the Governments.  I regret that there was no time for an Anglo-Irish meeting in the margins of the EU summit but I am glad President Clinton was sufficiently interested to seek a bilateral meeting <i>en marge</i> of the EU Summit with the US.  To leave matters where they are would be a failure of statesmanship.</P>
    <P>While I admire John Major's earlier contribution to the peace process I regret that he has not attempted or been able to follow through the vision contained in the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document, because of his parliamentary situation.  The Ulster Unionist Party has exploited its position in Westminister in a way that is short-sighted.</P>
    <P>In the absence of an accommodation and with continued tensions and instability, Northern Ireland as a society and as an economy will inevitably lose competitive ground.  Peace and prosperity are interlinked.  It is a time for firm and courageous leadership on all sides.  The message the Unionist parties are sending out is that, even in the event of a durable ceasefire, they are reluctant to talk to the elected representatives of the Nationalist 40 per cent of the population, except under conditions that will not be accepted. That smacks too much of the mentality of the old Stormont.</P>
    <P>The ugly scenes at Drumcree and outside Harryville Church and the arson attacks on Catholic Churches and schools show a basic religious intolerance which the vast majority of people of goodwill on all sides do not seem able to overcome.  There was a bemused reaction to the new Grand Master of the Orange Order standing over his remarks that the marriage of Mr. Tony Blair, MP, to a Catholic was &ldquo;disloyal&rdquo;. Neither this House nor the public might be inclined to take that too seriously, when applied to a British Labour Party leader but unfortunately it is deadly serious for anyone in a Protestant housing estate who forms a mixed marriage with a Catholic to be branded as disloyal.  He or she quickly finds out that the right to live wherever one chooses without hindrance as set out in the Downing Street declaration is seriously curtailed in those circumstances.  People have been killed, burnt to death even, purely because they were involved in a mixed marriage.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly condemned the continuation of boycotting to the extent that it is still occuring. It is not just a one-sided phenomenon.  There is an onus on Nationalists and republicans to resist <Col N="99" /> the temptation of a sectarian response to provocations.  We have a duty to maintain the highest standards of tolerance in our own jurisdiction.  The Taoiseach was eloquent at the Inchicore War Memorial last year in demanding that the British tradition be honoured here but it is always easier to preach than to practise.  <i>The Times</i> of London, in a prominent article and editorial yesterday, contrasts that aspiration with dated jibes directed by the successful Fine Gael candidate in Louth against an unsuccessful titled rival, who has done his bit for those who enjoy open-air pop concerts.  The Taoiseach has so far passed no comment but Councillor Brannigan of Drogheda Corporation had it right when he said, in a letter to the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> on 6 December that &ldquo;nobody in this Republic feels themselves inferior to anybody else&rdquo; and that we could do without divisive remarks against those of a different Irish background.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not cover the decommissioning of baseball bats and iron bars.  I say bluntly to our republican and loyalists friends that nothing alienates public opinion so much in this State than daily reports of continued brutal punishment beatings inflicted mostly on young members of their own community.  Sympathy and support for the human rights of prisoners is sought from Members of the Oireachtas and freely given on all sides of the House but human rights are indivisible.  Corporal punishment was abolished long ago in civilised societies. Punishment beatings are a reactionary throwback and send a profoundly anti-democratic message.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest the Tánaiste's comment after the summit that both the British Government and Sinn Fein must move from their present positions.  That was broadly my analysis in the debate before the summit.  Our Government must also keep trying.  The Taoiseach should have said publicly in the United States not only that he wanted a new unequivocal ceasefire but also that he wanted the British Government, in that event, to guarantee Sinn Féin access to talks at an early date.  The current talks are essentially a resumption of the 1991-2 talks and so far have been less productive.  The British Government has refused point blank to give any clear timescale for Sinn Féin entry to talks, the original <i>quid pro quo</i> that it offered publicly for an end to violence.  The American public should be clearly told that it is not just the republican movement but also the British Government that is an obstacle to peace, a point well understood by the Irish public.  It is not the business of the Taoiseach to provide diplomatic cover or make excuses for the lack of British co-operation. There is rarely any real diplomatic pressure on the British Government because the Taoiseach always tries too hard to keep up a false front that the two Government are totally united, whereas we know, not least from the Tánaiste, that they are not.  I sincerely hope the Taoiseach will not waste the opportunity of his meeting with <Col N="100" /> President Clinton today.  The Americans can be helpful, if they are told the true position.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with Mr. Tony Blair last week, he told me that if republicans were genuinely looking for peace he would facilitate them, but if a ceasefire were only tactical he would have serious difficulties.  That was the tone of Mr. John Major in 1993 and 1994 but unfortunately this British Government is no longer in a facilitating frame of mind.</P>
    <P>What underlies the decommissioning issue is a determination that a renewed peace must hold. Our fear is that too strong an insistence on decommissioning upfront will prevent or delay any renewed peace.  However, while we might go about it another way, the demand of both British and Irish democracy is the same &mdash; that paramilitary and other violence end for good. Then any party previously associated with violence is entitled to have a place at the table as a matter of democratic right.  That all along was our position in Government.  Signature of the Mitchell principles upon entry into talks represents a formal commitment to democracy and they are essentially the substitute for the decommissioning precondition and the reassurance that other parties require.  The difficulty since August 1994 has been the British Government's inability or unwillingness to guarantee Sinn Féin's place at the table and to make the exercise of their rights entirely dependent on Unionist agreement.  On the other hand, any continued actions by the IRA will make it easy for their enemies to cast further doubts on the value or sincerity of any future commitment to peace and democracy that they may be prepared to make.</P>
    <P>If it is the case that no further progress will take place this side of a UK general election, I appeal for a suspension of all further paramilitary activities and attacks so that the situation can be clarified post-election without adding further difficulties in the meantime.  It appears that there may be no formal ceasefire this Christmas but it is the absence of further attacks that really matters.  We hope there will be no further action this side of Christmas or ever again.  We need the British Government &mdash; if not this one, the next &mdash; to guarantee Sinn Féin a place at the table within a short space of time, in return for a guaranteed and definitive end to IRA violence. Future political battles for peace and the rights of Nationalists must be fought politically, using exclusively peaceful and democratic means.  At no stage will the going be easy, as we know from the events of the past few years but no other way has been found that shows any chance of lasting success.  As this year ends we must hope 1997 will bring more progress to this area than was achieved in the year just ending.</P>

      <P>Every democrat on this island can identify with the declared objective of this Bill.  The removal of munitions from the political stage should be the ideal of every <Col N="101" /> democratically elected representative of the people.  It is a necessary component of a free and democratic society.  Our focus ought to be on achieving that end.  The order in which it occurs, the timing of its occurrence and the method by which it might be achieved are secondary matters. They are side issues in the peace process and ought not be afforded an exaggerated importance.  We have seen, to our cost, what can occur when participants, for whatever purpose, become distracted about the means of achieving peace rather than the goal of peace itself.</P>
      <P>The discussions and negotiations of recent years have revealed decommissioning as a step to be taken on the road to permanent peace. Whether it be the first, the last or an intermediate step has been the subject of much debate.  Not all of that debate has been directed towards the goal of peace &mdash; it appears that some has been directed towards obstructing rather than assisting the attainment of peace.  Whatever side of the debate is viewed, it is clear decommissioning is an issue which, sooner or later, must be addressed. It is an issue of importance and sensitivity.  It has been the subject of much study and examination.</P>
      <P>The international body, comprising Senator George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, was established on 28 November 1995 to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue and to advise on a suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning. The report arising from the deliberations of the International Body was presented to the Irish and British Governments on 22 January 1996.  Nearly 11 months later, on 9 December 1996, the Minister for Justice presented this Decommissioning Bill to the House.  It is regrettably clear that the Minister afforded the preparation of this Bill the same sense of urgency as her Government has afforded the peace process generally.</P>
      <P>The objective sought to be attained by the Bill is laudable &mdash; the method chosen to give effect to the attainment of that objective is, regrettably, both shoddy and second rate.  Despite the passage of 11 months since the presentation of the report the Bill, as presented, is hopelessly incomplete.  It amounts to an admission by the Minister for Justice that she has, yet again, not completed the work assigned to her.  It is more than regrettable that proposed legislation of this importance should have to acknowledge, as this Bill does, that substantial further work remains to be done before it will be ready to be implemented. Whether this deficit results from a lack of political will or a lack of political competence is unclear.  What is clear is that the Bill is nowhere near to being complete and it has been served up to this House as the best the Minister could produce after nearly a year of endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has two central pillars; decommissioning and the establishment of a commission to oversee decommissioning.  They are the reason for the introduction of the Bill.  They are the <Col N="102" /> matters to which the Minister for Justice had to apply her ability and efforts.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first pillar, decommissioning, so incomplete is the Minister's work that section 2 is forced to state: &ldquo;Regulations may provide for the decommissioning of arms&rdquo;.

      <P>As a result of the Minister's administrative error, this House is forced to debate proposed legislation which is nakedly incomplete.  The first pillar of this Bill does not yet exist.  It may or may not be lurking, in a state of unpreparedness, in an envelope in the Minister's private office.  Nobody, least of all the Minister, seems to know, but I am not prepared to pretend the Bill is anything other than a parliamentary fig leaf to cover the Minister's blushes.</P>
      <P>The second pillar of the Bill is a commission to oversee decommissioning, yet the same acknowledgement of inadequacy exists in relation to this.  Section 4 states: &ldquo;Regulations may make provision in relation to the Commission&rdquo;.  The same questions need to be asked &mdash; the Minister can answer them at the end of the debate.  Why is this necessary?  Why are the details relating to the commission not ready to be included in the Bill?  Why has the Minister, who has had 11 months to prepare this legislation, brought it to the House in an incomplete and dishevelled state?</P>

      <P>Last summer I criticised the Minister for putting everything on her long finger.  Since she went to the Department of Justice, promises of action have always been followed by periods of inactivity, committees are <Col N="103" /> followed by procrastination and she has strived without success to implement her underlying philosophy, &ldquo;Do nothing and it will all go away.&rdquo; This Bill does little more than promise regulations in the future.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister's efforts have not worked in the past, why does the Government presume they will in the future?  Is it hoped that, like the Leader of Democratic Left, she will make a new beginning by having a bonfire in her back garden on which she can burn the details of her political career to date?</P>

      <P>The reality is that the Minister has been as slow at producing legislation as Deputy Lowry has been at providing explanations.  Today the Minister does no more than say that at an unspecified date in the future she will do by regulation what she has conspicuously failed to do in this Bill.  She is capable of promising but not delivering.  This is the least well prepared legislation ever to be introduced in this House.  It is a shameful end to what has been for the Government a shameful year.</P>

      <P>The Minister may take some comfort from the fact that she has the full support of her colleagues.  There can be no doubt now that in every corner of the country Labour and Democratic Left TDs are preparing posters with the slogan &ldquo;A vote for Roisin Shortall is a vote for Nora Owen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vote for Eric Byrne to put Nora Owen back in office&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I watched with fascination the attempts by Labour backbenchers to disassociate themselves from the actions of their own Government.  These are the Deputies whom I have previously described as people who talk tough and vote soft. They are the compliant critics of the rainbow &mdash; always criticising and always supporting.  Their voices travel in different directions from their feet.  In reality they are in Government, in spirit they are in Opposition and in future they will be in the Visitors Gallery.  They are the vital supporters of an Administration which has become so consumed by the trappings of power that it no longer offers even the pretence of exercising power.  They have moved from writing IOUs in the economic sphere to writing them in the legislative sphere.  This Bill is, even to the eyes of the most illiterate legal observer, no more <Col N="104" /> than an IOU from the Minister.  She tells the House, &ldquo;IOU regulations which will deal with decommissioning and IOU regulations which will deal with the commission&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, for example, introduced a Bill which provided that regulations may provide for a television station, he would be justly criticised. The same applies to decommissioning and the commission.  The purpose of legislation is to put the detail before the House for democratic debate.  It is not intended as some form of notice board on which the Minister can hang her future intention to do work long since required by the Cabinet.</P>

    <P>The decommissioning Bill as presented is no more than the heads of a Bill.  Its introduction at this stage reveals the dearth of ability in Government.  Is this really the best that could be done?  Could the combined intellect of the Cabinet not progress matters beyond this?  We must look no further than section 3 which purports to deal with provisions in relation to the Commission.  It provides that the commission shall be an independent legal body and the Minister may make a variety of orders.  That is it. That is what the Government has achieved since 1 January.  If one looks at it in detail it amounts to five orders and a declaration.  Section 3 (1) provides that subsequent subsections shall come into operation subsequently; section 3 (2) provides that the commission shall be independent; section 3 (3) provides that the commission shall be a legal body; section 3 (4) provides that the Minister may make an order &mdash; it also deals with what the Minister is to do in the order when she gets around to dealing with it; section 3 (5) provides that the Minister may make another type of order; section 3 (6) provides that the Minister may make a further order; and <Col N="105" /> section 3 (7) provides that orders, whenever made, shall be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Although he was constantly interrupted I greatly enjoyed what I could hear of Deputy O'Donoghue's speech.  He made some quite valid points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill consists of a very literal and precise transcription into general legislative form of paragraphs 38 to 50, inclusive, of the Mitchell report.  There is very little substantive law, it is mainly regulation making powers.  The only substantive law is in sections 5 and 6 which will only have effect if and when a commission is established.  The rest of the Bill, as Deputy O'Donoghue said, could have been put together in a matter of days.  I do not know why the Minister is at such pains to commend those who put it together because it is nothing more than <Col N="106" /> headings giving her power to make regulations on a wide variety of topics, as recommended in paragraphs 38 to 50 of the Mitchell report.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a couple of points about the Bill which, limited as it is in its objectives, should be considered before the end of Second Stage and certainly before Committee Stage, if that Stage is ever taken.  Rather curiously, Second Stage will finish when I conclude my contribution and will not be put to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill refers in its second definition to &ldquo;the agreement&rdquo;.  It states: &ldquo;the agreement&rdquo;&ldquo;means the agreement between the Government and the Government of the United Kingdom establishing the Commission,&rdquo;.  I inquired earlier whether such an agreement exists because if it does is should be a Schedule to the Bill.  I was told it does not exist.  However, it is referred to in the Bill as if it were an existing agreement.  I do not know why this House should, or how it can, legislate in relation to an agreement which does not exist.</P>
      <P>The Long Title, which is very much part of the Bill, states: &ldquo;TO MAKE PROVISION... IN RELATION TO A COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TO PROVIDE FOR RELATED MATTERS&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;ESTABLISHED&rdquo; is in the past tense and suggests that this commission has been established.  If the commission were to be established the proper phrase would be &ldquo;a commission to be established by a proposed agreement between the Government and the Government of the United Kingdom&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It may be that because it is not intended to complete Second Stage today and because the Bill, if it is ever passed, may not be passed until some time well in the future, the Minister may have in mind that agreement would have been entered into before the Bill is passed and a commission might then be established.  However, as matters stand today, 17 December 1996, it is meaningless to refer to something as having been established when it does not exist.  Neither the commission nor the agreement which would purport to set up the commission have been established.  I do not think it is possible to legislate in those circumstances for such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 is more important than the others because it is substantive law, as opposed to simply power to make regulations.  Although it may not have been the intention, it seems that all four of the requirements set out in paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1) would have to be complied with. <Col N="107" /> The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should appear between each of those paragraphs because any one of them should be sufficient to give immunity to somebody handing up arms in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are several references in the Bill to &ldquo;the Secretary of State&rdquo;.  However, &ldquo;Secretary of State&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a Secretary of State in the Government of the United Kingdom&rdquo; and not necessarily the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I do not know why that is the case and why he is referred to as &ldquo;a Secretary of State&rdquo; in one place and &ldquo;the Secretary of State&rdquo; in another.</P>
    <P>The powers to make regulations are very widely cast and follow paragraphs 38 to 50, inclusive, of the Mitchell report.  On that basis, neither I nor anybody else can reasonably object to them if and when the opportunity to implement all this ever comes about.  When one reads the Mitchell report again after an interval of nearly 11 months after its publication, it stands up in many respects because it is a splendidly drafted document.  However, there is a certain air of innocence about it.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the rug was pulled from under the Mitchell principles within two or three weeks of the publication of the report by the resumption of hostilities and violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government did that the day it was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perhaps more arguable than the effect of the clear resort to violence on 9 February at Canary Wharf and various subsequent events.  The innocence which perhaps underlay some of the report is contained in paragraphs such as paragraph 13 which states: &ldquo;Nobody should underestimate the value of the consensus for peace, and the fact that no significant group is actively seeking to end it&rdquo; which, unfortunately, turned out not be the case. Paragraph 25 states: &ldquo;We have concluded that there is a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve a full and verifiable decommissioning as part of the process of all party negotiations; but that commitment does not include decommissioning prior to such negotiations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The part of this report which was latched onto by the British Government was paragraph 56 where the most conditional references were made to an elective process.  There were three conditions &mdash; first, &ldquo;If it were broadly acceptable&rdquo;; second, &ldquo;with an appropriate mandate&rdquo;, and third, &ldquo;within the three strand structure&rdquo; an elective process &ldquo;could contribute to the building of confidence&rdquo;.  The British Government sought to portray that as a recommendation for an election.  The election, which was held in May, was a disaster from any point of view and moved the position backward rather than forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decommissioning is dealt with in detail and, in <Col N="108" /> general, with great common sense.  However, we have to remind ourselves of the context in which this report was published.  That was the context of cessation of formal violence at least at that time.  The report was undermined some weeks later by a resumption of that formal violence.  It is worth reminding ourselves that Mitchell spoke about more than just formal violence.  He said in paragraph 52:</P>
    <P>Support for the use of violence is incompatible with participation in the democratic process.  The early termination of paramilitary activities, including surveillance and targeting, would demonstrate a commitment to peaceful methods and so build trust among other parties and alleviate the fears and anxieties of the general population.  So, too, would the provision of information on the status of missing persons, and the return of those who have been forced to leave their communities under threat.</P>
    <P>He also, in his six principals, expresses his abhorrence for and the unacceptability of socalled punishment beatings.  Within the past couple of weeks in this House I had to draw attention to the fact that punishment beatings in this present year had quadrupled as against the number that took place in 1994, which is very unsatisfactory indeed.  It demonstrates that formal decommissioning is only one aspect of this whole matter.  In his report Mitchell draws attention to the fact that it is not likely to happen, that it will not happen in advance of talks and suggests a compromise.  Most people would be very happy to accept the compromise that Mitchell proposed, but the context in which he made it has changed.  It has changed by the resumption of violence, and therefore the opportunity to implement that compromise is also removed.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes the opportunity of implementing what he calls the modalities of how decommissioning, if it were to arise, might take place under independent supervision.  I agree that his recommendations are appropriate and suitable if the opportunity arises.  This is one Bill that, although I am sure it will not be opposed in this House, may never become law; there is no point in it becoming law unless all parties remove from themselves the disqualification which they at present impose on themselves from taking part in the talks.  If we have talks, and the talks are ongoing, then this decommissioning procedure can take place in parallel with them, as Mitchell suggested.  It is a matter of great regret that Sinn Féin choose to disqualify themselves from participation in the talks.  The opportunity given to them is one that should not be lightly cast aside.  I hate to think what might be the ultimate outcome if the opportunity that now exists is not grasped by them.  There will probably be changes in Britain during 1997.  Uncertainties will arise about what might be the situation in the future. The window of opportunity is there at the <Col N="109" /> moment, and I join with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and many others inside this House and outside it on both sides of the Border who have called for common sense to prevail and for violence in all its forms to come to an end. It is not too much to ask people after such an extraordinary long period of violence to desist now when they see the opportunity offered to them of political progress.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not terribly important in itself for the simple reason that it may never be enacted &mdash; there would be no point in enacting it ultimately unless the conditions that Mitchell envisaged existed.  Whether they will ever exist again, I do not know.  Let us hope they will.  At least this is a minor legislative matter to enable the modalities of Mitchell to be implemented.  What is more important than the modalities of Mitchell on decommissioning is the spirit of Mitchell and, in particular, the six democratic principles which he says should underlie the approach of any and every party to the problem.  That is more important, and we should seek to use the opportunity we have now to try to urge the acceptance of those principles which are set out in paragraph 20 of Mitchell's report and which seem to be perfectly reasonable.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm at this stage to repeat them briefly, because they are significant and useful and have withstood the passage of time.  They will withstand the passage of time whatever other circumstances may exist in the future.  They are that parties to such negotiations should affirm their total and absolute commitment:</P>
    <P>a.  To democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues;</P>
    <P>b.  To the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations;</P>
    <P>c.  To agree that such disarmament must be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission;</P>
    <P>d.  To renounce for themselves, and to oppose any effort by others, to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations;</P>
    <P>e.  To agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may disagree; and,</P>
    <P>f.  to urge that &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; killings and beatings stop and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread but not universal acceptance of those principles.  In particular, the principles have not been accepted by Sinn Féin or the IRA.  This House is entitled to ask why they have not been accepted and to urge their acceptance.  If those principles, which are very reasonable, were accepted, a major step would be taken on the way to overcoming problems that <Col N="110" /> beset this island, particularly the Northern part of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill assists in a small way in the achievement or clarification of the second and third of those principles.  However, what is important is the anxiety of those to whom they are addressed to accept them.  The Bill is of minor importance, but I welcome it to the extent that it helps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill is an integral part of the anti-litter initiative Action Against Litter which was launched last February.  Local authorities must have adequate statutory powers to undertake the task of litter prevention and control.  Their existing powers have been set out in the Litter Act, 1982.  However, shortcomings in this legislation have emerged over the years and it is now opportune to restate litter legislation comprehensively, to sharpen its focus and to broaden the legislative and regulatory instruments available for combating litter.</P>
      <P>The essential purposes of this Bill are to put in place a wide-ranging legislative charter for action against litter; to spell out clearly what occupiers of property must do to keep their property free of litter and to set out the duties of local authorities for preventing and controlling litter. The Bill will provide a good statutory framework for dealing with the problem of litter.</P>
      <P>Before elaborating on the concepts of the Bill, I will set out some background factors.  Litter is a serious environmental problem in Ireland.  While not highly toxic or, as a general rule, liable to inflict lasting damage on ecosystems, litter is still a visible and objectionable form of environmental degradation that damages the Irish countryside. While there are many reasons we should strive for a high quality environment, we should not overlook the obvious reason that a clean environment presents a positive and attractive image, and that people prefer to live and do their business in this kind of setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Litter is one of the most immediate threats to <Col N="111" /> this sense of amenity.  It undermines and challenges the credibility of other policies and measures for protecting the environment.  It runs down shopping, business and residential areas and damages efforts to promote tourism, conservation and heritage protection.  It also compromises our ability to attract and consolidate commercial development.</P>
    <P>To quantify the extent of the problem countrywide my Department commissioned a national litter survey to provide an accurate assessment of the incidence of litter.  This survey was conducted in October 1995 at various locations throughout the country and was designed to establish a detailed breakdown of the composition of litter and to identify and classify typical types of littered locations.</P>
    <P>The main findings of the survey were that very few of the places inspected were either totally free of litter or grossly littered.  However, more than 80 per cent of sites surveyed were found to have significant amounts of litter.  The incidence of litter was prevalent and is especially likely to be found near fast food outlets, automatic bank telling machines and near secondary schools.  The survey has been made available to all local authorities and will serve to give factual guidance to local initiatives.  It also establishes a baseline against which progress can be monitored for the future.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking office in this Administration, the Minister for the Environment indicated that a more urgent and aggressive approach to litter prevention would be promoted.  At the beginning of this year, the Action Against Litter initiative was launched.  It is built on four main foundations: improving local authority performance, including more effective enforcement against offenders; reforming, updating and streamlining litter legislation; promoting public awareness and education, and developing effective partnerships with commercial and voluntary interests to combat litter.  To drive this initiative, a new anti-litter unit was established within my Department with a dedicated budget in support of the campaign.</P>
    <P>Image and quality of service must be vital concerns of the modern local government system. Local authorities have to serve the public in many ways, but most fundamentally, they are charged with maintaining a functional and attractive local environment, one in which local people can take pride and which visitors and investors will also appreciate.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made in the delivery of a much improved local environment.  Urban areas are being revitalised and made more accessible. The quality and design of social housing is being improved.  Major urban air pollution problems have been addressed and modern water supply and waste water treatment systems are being extended.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a key role to play in tackling the problem of litter.  Some local <Col N="112" /> authorities have reasonably effective arrangements in place; others are stepping up their performances.  However, there is still much to be done because overall performance is uneven.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for the Environment met local authorities earlier this year specifically on this issue he asked them to move litter prevention and control up the scale of their priorities and that as a first step they should prepare litter abatement plans for each of their areas in consultation with business interests and community groups.  Already more than 40 authorities have completed these litter abatement plans and the other authorities are finalising them.  Local authorities generally agree that their approach to litter needs to be sharpened.  I am confident that in 1997 we will see a significant stepping up of prevention and control of litter by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In dealing with litter prevention and control, we need compliance with the spirit as well as with the letter of the law.  A strong emphasis of the Action Against Litter initiative is to promote education and awareness across all sections of the community.  It is essential to promote understanding by young people, from an early age, of the degradation caused by litter.  To approach this task in a structured way, educational materials for schools have been specially prepared for the Department by one of the specialist teaching centres.  These materials have been circulated to all first and second level schools and I am happy to confirm from responses to a recent questionnaire sent to schools that the issue of litter is now being enthusiastically addressed in our schools.</P>
    <P>Young people are not the sole offenders in relation to litter.  Adults, young and old, can also be indifferent to litter and its spoiling effects. Given that there is such a large deficit in public awareness generally of the extent of our litter problem it was considered imperative that a wider public awareness campaign be mounted as quickly as possible to give the public a wake-up call about litter.  This multi-media campaign is being continued and is designed to bring about change in public attitudes and behaviour towards litter.  Funding these measures is being met from my Department's Vote at a cost of some £400,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Local authorities cannot provide a litter-free environment on their own.  Accordingly, the Action Against Litter initiative seeks to develop the involvement of the private sector and voluntary interests in the fight against litter. Caring for the environment is a shared responsibility.  There is a greater acceptance today that business and industry should become involved more creatively in finding solutions to environmental problems, such as solid waste and litter, which are partly of their making.</P>
    <P>However, producer responsibility is not just a burden on business and industry.  Environmental initiatives such as Action Against Litter give companies the opportunity to prove themselves <Col N="113" /> as good corporate citizens.  The emergence of the Irish Business Against Litter movement demonstrates this point.  Consumers relate better to companies who demonstrate strong environmental credentials and performance.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Action Against Litter initiative is to change the public mindset in relation to litter.  It will be important to know how we are getting on in this task.  It is intended, therefore, to establish a system of performance measurement that will monitor the state of cleanliness and assess progress by local authorities in implementing this initiative.  My Department is engaged in consultation with an outside body about the development of an external monitoring process, which is intended to be activated next year.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on some of the main provisions of the Bill.  A more detailed commentary will be found in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill.  I remind Deputies that the Bill repeals the Litter Act, 1982, but restates and strengthens some of the basic provisions of the earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains standard definitions but goes beyond the 1982 Act in providing a definition of &ldquo;litter&rdquo;.  Section 6 sets out an important requirement on the occupier of property, if it is a public place or visible to any extent from a public place, to keep the property free of litter.  In addition, where a property or premises faces a public road and is within the confines of a speed limit area, the occupier will be required to keep free of litter any footpath or pavement between their property and the roadway.  This requirement applies to all speed limit areas except where the general 60 miles per hour or the 70 miles per hour motorway speed limit applies.  It is designed to cover properties in all built up areas.</P>
    <P>The provision is necessary to tackle the problem of litter and to ensure that responsibility is taken by individuals for maintaining a litter free local environment.  In section 6 also, in addition to the duties of occupiers, a duty is imposed on the owner of a house that is let in flats or bedsits to ensure that the curtilage of the house is kept free of litter.  This provision is included in response to requests from local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation, which has encountered difficulties with refuse and litter being left to accumulate outside houses let in flats.  Section 7 imposes an explicit duty on local authorities to keep public roads free of litter as far as practicable.  Roads are an acknowledged respository for litter and it is appropriate to state a clearer obligation on road authorities to maintain good litter management arrangements in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains a new power for local authorities to issue a notice to the occupier of a littered property which is visible from a public place to clean it up and take specified measures to prevent a recurrence.  It will be open to a local authority to take action itself and recover the cost <Col N="114" /> involved in the event of an occupier failing to comply with the terms of a notice.  I would like to see this provision being actively availed of by local authorities to demonstrate seriousness about tackling heavily littered sites.  Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 all relate to the duty of local authorities to draw up litter management plans for their functional areas.  Such plans are essential to guide and support a more systematic approach to litter prevention and control.  The adoption of these plans is a reserved function of elected councils but the Bill also requires local authorities to consult local interests on their intended proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 15 sets out obligations for the operators of mobile food outlets in relation to litter control in the vicinity of their business.  This provision has been suggested by a number of local authorities. It will also be open to local authorities to frame additional requirements for mobile outlets by way of special notice.  Section 16 provides local authorities with a new power to take stronger action against the operators of premises whose business activities have a particular tendency to create litter.  The types of premises on which additional requirements can be set out are in section 16 (9) and this list may be extended by regulations to include other classes of premises. The need to impose additional requirements on these types of premises is a matter to be judged by individual local authorities having regard to local circumstances.  An obligation being imposed on an occupier under this section can extend to an area up to 100 metres from the person's premises.</P>
    <P>By agreement with the local authority, an occupier of property may be relieved of the obligation directly to implement litter control measures by making a financial contribution to the local authority.  A notice from the local authority imposing additional obligations must first be served in draft form to allow for comments on it.  A confirmed notice may be appealed by the person affected to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 are designed to create a more structured litter management regime for events which are likely to be attended by large numbers of the public.  Litter is inevitably created at well attended events such as major sports events and concerts.  The Bill authorises local authorities to serve a notice on the organisers or promoters of major events requiring them to take specified measures to prevent or limit litter creation and to provide for its removal.  A notice under section 17 may also require a deposit to be lodged with the local authority as security against the taking of required measures.  A local authority may also afford organisers or promoters the option of making a financial contribution to the local authority in lieu of taking direct measures. This contribution must be applied by the local authority to litter prevention or removal at the relevant event.  A local authority may also act to remedy any failure by a person to carry out the <Col N="115" /> requirements of a notice and it may recover its costs in doing this.</P>
    <P>Section 21 prohibits the placing of advertising material on the windscreens of cars and other vehicles.  There is no hesitation in proposing this measure because the placing of advertising leaflets in this manner is well known as a cause of litter.  In addition, local authorities will be able to introduce by-laws at their own discretion to prohibit or regulate handing out advertising leaflets in streets.  Section 22 is a new provision imposing a duty on the person in charge of a dog to clean up if it fouls in certain public places such as on the street or footpath, on a beach or in a park.  Apart from environmental considerations there is a health imperative in relation to this provision because of the danger of children contracting the disease of toxocariasis.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 to 28 deal with the important area of enforcement and penalties.  The maximum fine for an offence under the Bill is being increased from £800 to £1,500 and there is also a maximum penalty of £100 for each day there is a continued contravention by a convicted person.  The on-the-spot penalty remains unchanged at £25, but it may be varied in future by regulations.  All the proceeds from fines will now go to local authorities as opposed to the Exchequer which currently benefits from any fines imposed.  Local authorities will also be able to ask the courts to award costs against a convicted person in respect of the expenses incurred by local authorities in investigating, detecting and prosecuting offences. I am confident that this change will act as an incentive to local authorities to tackle enforcement more effectively.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of the on-the-spot fines against litter offenders has proved to be problematic in the past for local authorities.  It is now proposed that in addition to litter wardens, members of the Garda Síochána will be empowered to issue on-the-spot fines.  It is not intended that the Garda will take over the role of issuing on-the-spot fines. It is desirable that this remains primarily with local authority litter wardens.  However there are circumstances where gardaí on street patrol could very usefully penalise transgressions of our litter laws.  The fact that the public know gardaí are empowered to issue on-the-spot fines should act as a further deterrent against littering.  It will also now be possible for litter wardens to call on the assistance of the Garda where they believe they might be obstructed in the course of their duties. This, I believe, will strengthen the standing of litter wardens.  I am confident that local authorities will become more involved in active enforcement once the new Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill allows the Minister for the Environment to issue directions and guidelines in relation to the carrying out of the provisions of the Bill.  Whenever the Bill is passed it is my intention to issue comprehensive guidelines to local authorities in relation to their duties under the Bill.  I look forward to hearing <Col N="116" /> the views of Deputies who will no doubt have valuable perspectives on this matter.  I shall be receptive to any practical proposals for strengthening the Bill's provisions.  We will look at this in detail on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Without meaning any disrespect to the Minister of State, it is very disappointing that the Minister is not present for this debate. We have been waiting for this Bill for over two years and the Minister has made a virtue out of the PR campaign he has run about litter.  When he has the opportunity to talk in the House on this subject he finds himself busy elsewhere.  The Minister was in the House earlier in relation to another Bill and I am disappointed he is not here now because I had some points to make to him about litter and his PR campaign.  The Minister of State will convey my views to him.</P>
      <P>On the basis that one cannot be against good intentions, Fianna Fáil will not oppose this Bill. The Bill is a wish list that contains no provision for the enforcement of the existing litter laws, let alone the further provisions now proposed by the Minister.  It might as well have been addressed to Santa Claus at the North Pole as to the Dáil.  The measure is a continuation by other means of the expensive and pointless PR campaign the Minister engaged in, which featured himself mainly, over the last 12 months.  The campaign cost over £500,000 but did not result in the appointment of a single extra litter warden or an extra prosecution under the Litter Acts, which are to be replaced by the Litter Pollution Act. Without enforcement, which I am glad the Minister of State mentioned, this Bill will not advance the existing situation by one iota.  We have had many good intentions littered around by the Minister over the past months and he is losing an opportunity in this Bill by not placing an imperative on anyone, including himself.  The Bill has many enabling provisions but it is most unfortunate that it places no imperative on the Minister or local authorities or anyone save the Garda.  The Minister is side-stepping the litter question.</P>
      <P>Most people have no choice except to wade through the litter on our streets.  The Minister seems to be avoiding this in the Bill.  Enforcement of litter laws is crucial.  The proposal in the Bill to give the Garda power to impose on the spot fines is farcical.  There is no problem with the Garda having that power but I have no expectation that litter will become an operational priority for them.  This provision comes hot on the heels of the Minister's invention of a special Garda traffic corps in Dublin for Christmas.  The reality is that Garda operations are a matter for the Commissioner to decide in light of the needs of the day, as Members know.  The imposition by the Minister of these duties on the Garda is not sustainable by the force in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force report on the future of the Garda prepared for the Government is very <Col N="117" /> forceful in its recommendation that the Garda should concentrate on their core duty of solving and preventing crime and that extraneous functions should be farmed out.  This report has been accepted in principle by the Minister for Justice and the Government.  Clearly this has not gone as far as the Department of the Environment.  What the Minister for the Environment is trying to pass off in this Bill as enforcement is the cynical use of the Garda as a chorus line for what is essentially a PR initiative. It also runs totally counter to the thrust of Government policy on the future of the Garda. The Minister's vision of the Garda as pooper scoopers and meter maids will not meet with much favour among gardaí, the Commissioners or the public.  Thankfully that vision is not generally shared.  The ineffectiveness of the Minister's proposals for enforcement leaves the very serious social and economic problem of litter unaddressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about some of the problems caused by litter and mentioned Bord Fáilte, which receives thousands of complaints annually about litter and illegal dumping.  These complaints are not only about the streets in our cities and towns but also about the most inaccessible beauty spots and beaches.  Bord Fáilte has stated it receives more complaints about litter than all other matters combined. Executives from our trade promotion board and industrial development agencies tell me they have to pick very carefully the route on which they bring potential investors.  Litter creates the impression of a country that cannot manage even its most basic public hygiene functions.  We spend £25 million annually to clean up litter.  Despite the high cost to the taxpayer, we still have a serious litter problem.  Clearly, the vast majority of our citizens want the problem solved.  A study carried out by IBAL, Irish Business Against Litter, earlier this year highlighted the problems and costs caused by litter.</P>
    <P>The key findings were that two out of every three adults identified &ldquo;takeaways&rdquo; as the location where litter was most likely to be found. That is reflected in the Bill.  Only 10 per cent of adults believe that the litter laws are being enforced.  It is surprising that even 10 per cent do. Only 5 per cent would resist tougher enforcement of litter laws.  A litter-free Ireland would be useful in attracting more foreign companies, according to 80 per cent.  Some 70 per cent believe that a litter-free Ireland, would improve the image of our food industry and create more jobs in Ireland while 78 per cent feel that the laws should be enforced more strictly.</P>
    <P>Litter is frequently mentioned in the media and is one of the most common gripes of people calling into talk shows.  The Minister's endless PR initiatives are testimony to his sensitivity on this. Governments have two policy instruments at their disposal in tackling environmental problems.  Command and control can be used, which basically means a law and enforcement <Col N="118" /> approach, or economic instruments can be employed.  These may include charges or subsidies to encourage or discourage particular behaviour.  Central to the latter concept is the principle that the polluter must pay.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to expand the command and control approach.  Given that existing legal commands are routinely flouted, this Bill is likely to bring the law into further disrepute until the issue of enforcement is tackled.  We already have a system of on-the-spot fines imposed by local authority litter wardens.  Clearly this system is a joke.  When the Minister, Deputy Howlin, came into office the country boasted 23 full-time litter wardens.  After a PR campaign costing £500,000 the number had declined to 22.  In 1994, 512 on-the-spot fines were issued relating to a range of offences including littering, graffiti, fly posting and the abandonment of vehicles.  This is a clear indication that only the surface of the problem is being scratched.  Additional offences are to be added including giving out flyers, putting them on cars, dog fouling and littering from small commercial vehicles, including taxis.  All in this House support these measures but the Minister's refusal to challenge vested interests and to seriously enforce these laws make a nonsense of the Bill.  Fianna Fáil believes that the core of any litter policy must be effective enforcement which ensures that the costs involved are borne by the polluter, in this case, the litter lout.</P>
    <P>The Bill is another litany of obligations the Minister may put on local authorities.  While I welcome the fact that the proceeds from fines will go to local authorities rather than the Exchequer, local authorities should be able to get courts to award costs against convicted persons.  There is a reference to this in the Bill but it is not imperative.  I have had too many experiences of local authorities prosecuting people for these and other offences, winning their case but losing huge sums of money because the court imposed a fine of £100 to £200 whereas the cost to the local authority ran into thousands of pounds.  This is especially the case with environmental prosecutions where much investigation must be done to acquire proper evidence for a watertight case. This can cost huge sums of money.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for the abysmal record in enforcing the Litter Act, 1982, and other environmental Acts is that it is not worth it for a local authority, strapped for cash, to pursue polluters and other law breakers.  I would like an amendment tabled, especially to sections 23 to 28, which would make it imperative on courts to force polluters to meet all costs of the prosecuting local authority.  If we are serious about environmental legislation, we must include that in Bills.  Local authorities should have a dedicated enforcement capacity which pays for itself.  If it is feasible there will be enforcement, but pious aspirations will not work.</P>
    <P>A key to making enforcement pay is to go about it as proactively and constructively as possible.  The local fire officer does not wait for a <Col N="119" /> fire to inspect a premises.  The most important part of his work is to advise people on how to prevent fires.  If litter pollution were tackled in a proactive way by drawing up plans for individual shops and streets, as outlined in the Bill, with avoidance as the primary objective rather than cleaning up after the event, the cost of enforcement and cleaning would be greatly reduced.  This is all predicated on a bottom line of enforcement and prosecution.  That issue must be dealt with comprehensively.</P>
    <P>With £25 million now being spent on cleaning up Ireland every year and very little value got for it, throwing more money at the problem is not the solution.  It is unacceptable to ask the taxpayer to pay for cleaning up other people's mess.  The cost of cleaning up litter must be borne up by the polluter.  The Bill is short on effective ways of doing this.  It refers to drawing up plans but not to the key issue of specifications.  By what measure is enforcement to be set?  In other countries, such as the UK, standards are being developed by which exact measurement of litter can be ascertained.  For example, an inspector can go onto a beach and check the number of items of litter on a given square metre of ground. Standards for measuring litter can be set.  Streets and beaches can be graded over a period and black spots identified.  This would represent a huge improvement on the current situation which is essentially reactive.  I take it this is the type of approach the Minister is adopting as the Minister of State referred to monitoring performance and consultation with outside bodies.  If she wishes to intervene to confirm that, I would be delighted to hear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that because it is important to set standards and specifications.</P>
      <P>National standards can be similarly set for large commercial advertising hoardings.  These standards should include the location of hoardings and restrictions on the size and number in any area.  The local authority should be allowed to charge an annual licence fee for permission to use such hoardings.  Public advertising is a cost on the environment and should be handsomely paid for by those benefiting from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar philosophy should apply to the organisation of large public events.  The issue is mentioned in section 16.  However, there is ambiguity in the wording.  The Bill requires that organisers of large events draw up a plan to deal with litter and allows the local authority to step in and take the necessary measures in the event of a failure to do so.  My concern is that a clean up later on the day of the event or on the following day will pass as a plan.  I want the Minister to include a provision in this section that the clean up process must be an intrinsic part of the ongoing management of the event from the start.  If cleaning up begins afterwards, half the <Col N="120" /> litter will have already blown away.  In some places where these events are staged, litter can be widely dispersed if it is left until the day after to be collected.</P>
    <P>An event which took place on numerous occasions in my constituency, the concerts in Slane, is now running into difficulties.  The site was self-contained but the surrounding area where people came and stayed for the concert, especially the village which is beautiful and well kept and which has an active tidy towns committee, was often left in an absolute mess under two or three feet of litter for two or three square miles.  Cleaning up after an event is not acceptable.  The plan must be in place from the word go.  All of us have seen these events.  They are unsightly and a disgrace.  A plan from the beginning of the event would help reduce that.  If promoters want customers and tourists to patronise their event they must have the capacity to keep it clean while it is in progress.  Merely cleaning the site afterwards is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister has entirely omitted any effective control from his command and control-based strategy.  He has also shied away from any serious consideration of the use of economic instruments. Their use must be at the heart of any effective strategy against litter.</P>
    <P>Takeaways are one of the most obvious sources of litter in Ireland.  No serious effort is being made to have them pay for the considerable economic costs their haphazard business practices impose on the community.  They impose a cost on the taxpayer by way of cleaning up the mess they cause.  They also impose other serious economic costs, in cleaning up the pollution caused by the dispersal of the huge amount of packaging they provide for their goods.  Anyone looking at O'Connell Street late at night cannot fail to be appalled by the drifts of litter on the street.  The great majority of this is directly traceable to the international brand name fast food outlets on the street.  The famous floozie in the jacuzzi is usually to be found bathing in a sea of styrofoam.  The cost to the economy of having the main street of the capital city awash with litter is incalculable.  It seriously undermines the huge investments being made to develop a sustainable tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Plastic bags, the bane of everyone's life, given out free by shops and supermarkets also have a large economic cost attached.  After leaving the shops these bags are most prominently seen adorning the hedgerows on country roads and littering our streets.  Plastic bags are not free even if there is no cost for them at the checkout in the shop.  They are also largely unnecessary.  Until a few years ago nobody would have thought of going shopping without bringing a carrier bag. There is no reason that situation should not be returned to.  In one chain of supermarkets in Japan the imposition of a charge on plastic bags reduced their use by 70 per cent.  The cost to the national economy of plastic bags and take away restaurants should be charged up front.</P>
    <P>A range of economic instruments should be <Col N="121" /> developed and imposed to deal with litter at source.  These would prevent littering in the first instance and where it does occur they would be used to heavily penalise it.  Fianna Fáil will bring forward a comprehensive package of economic instruments as well as addressing the crucial issue of enforcement for command and control measures.  The failure of the Minister to include either of these measures makes this a lame duck Bill which we will attempt to strengthen on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The futility of the present approach, which this Bill largely continues, is illustrated by Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte having spent millions of pounds of public money developing new logos.  There is hardly much point in painting the shingle on the gate if the house looks like a disaster zone.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the latest instance of the superficial approach taken by the Minister to major issues. Deputy Ryan correctly remarked this morning that the Minister's only hope of any lasting legacy is the docklands Bill which will probably change the face of Dublin forever.  However, even the Minister's most brazen handlers would not claim that he is responsible for the concept of urban renewal.  He is entitled to credit for having the Bill passed on his watch.  However, the Minister has side-stepped or fudged other key issues on his Department's agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister has buried the issue of local government reform under a plethora of commissions.  On the fundamental issue of local authority finance, the Minister has fudged and foot dragged for two years and will announce the abolition of service charges purely for electoral reasons.  I hope that more thought has gone into this than appears the case.</P>
    <P>As a politician, I admire the Minister's fluency and fancy foot work which I have observed at close quarters for two years, and at a distance for four or five years previous to that.  It is a very useful skill for getting out of a tight corner.  These qualities, divorced from the will to tackle issues meaningfully and bring about real change, are simply play acting.  The Minister managed to get out of the Department of Health just as he heard the buffalo coming down the tracks.  His handling of issues in the Department of the Environment indicates a similar desire to get out before the going gets tough.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a wish list of commendable aspirations.  I may have gone into the shortcomings of the Bill in some detail but I have done so to indicate how dissatisfied we are that the Minister has not gone far enough in the Bill.  We will be proposing extensive changes to it but we will support the Bill on Second Stage.  In the past the Minister has indicated his willingness to accept amendments and I hope he will do so on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  My party wishes to signal its support for the principle of the Bill and its aims and objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> This is a comprehensive Bill, but its success or failure will depend on the enforcement mechanisms built into it.  This is the weakest section of the Bill and the section which my party will try most vigorously to amend on Committee Stage.  We should learn from previous experience. The Litter Bill, 1982, failed because of lack of adequate enforcement.  For example, in 1994, 502 on the spot fines were issued by 99 part-time or full-time local authority litter wardens.  This represents less than six fines per warden per annum.  In that year Limerick city failed to record a single on the spot fine or court conviction.  In 1994 County Limerick had one full-time litter warden and the city had five part-time wardens. If the failure to enforce the litter laws is compared to the manner in which parking laws are enforced one will learn some valuable lessons. The revenue collected from parking fines is retained by local authorities and, in most cases, put to constructive use in the local authority area.</P>
    <P>In Cork city the municipal high rise car park with over 600 spaces was financed by revenue from on the spot parking fines.  This is an example of a local authority benefiting from the imposition of fines.  When the incentive exists enforcement is rigid.</P>
    <P>Uniformed traffic wardens are a constant presence in our streets reminding motorists of the consequences of breaking parking laws.  Under the existing Act, revenue from litter fines is sent to the Exchequer.  Local authorities have decided that the enforcement of litter laws is not financially rewarding and, starved as they are for cash, they have thrown in the towel.  The Minister of State said that when this Bill is enacted the Minister will issue guidelines to local authorities. Something more than guidelines will have to be issued to local authorities, they need greater resources to enable them to make a success of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Governments have a habit of enacting laws and putting obligations on local authorities to implement them.  A recent example of this became evident recently in Tipperary North Riding.  A certain listed Georgian property was extended out of all recognition without planning permission.  When questioned on the issue the planning officer for the local authority area replied that there were only two planning enforcement officers for this extensive area.  I make no statement on the validity of the excuse but I use it to illustrate the point that additional demands are put on local authorities without their being given additional resources.  If this Bill is to be successful we must give local authorities the resources needed to enforce it rigorously.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dempsey said, enforcement can be rewarding for the local authorities.  They can use the money raised from fines and penalties to enhance their own litter prevention or education programmes or to improve the placement or maintenance of litter bins.  They could use such moneys if they are given the manpower to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> Some local authorities have a good track record when dealing with litter and waste management.  The litter management plans which this Bill requires of local authorities should be monitored regularly.  The local authorities should set targets for themselves which they should meet.  Unless such an approach is adopted at the outset the Bill will fail.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby local authorities may keep the money raised in fines. We spend £25 million a year to clean up litter &mdash; money raised from the ratepayers and taxpayers. These contributors must feel they are getting a poor return on their investment.  Citizens who care about the enviornment are forced to live with the squalor of litter, particularly in the cities. Bord Fáilte receives about 5,000 complaints each year from tourists, most of which deal with litter and illegal dumping of cars and household appliances.  Our overseas visitors find it hard to accept that such an accomplished and creative people, who can win Nobel prizes and Olympic gold medals, cannot deal with litter.</P>
    <P>Executives from the trade promotion bodies find that due to the prevalence of litter black spots, particularly in areas where jobs are most needed, they are forced to show potential investors sites for factories via circuitous routes. Sadly, it is often the areas which are most in need of jobs which make the least effort to make themselves environmentally attractive to investors who would create jobs.</P>
    <P>It is fatal for a country so dependent for its survival on the growth of its tourist and food industries to be &mdash; and to be seen to be &mdash; so casual about litter.  If Ireland fails to live up to its reputation as a clean green island the future will be bleak.  In recognition of this the group Irish Business Against Litter was founded.  I pay tribute to its dynamic and patriotic chairman, Dr. Tom Kavanagh from Fermoy.  If it had not been for the group's efforts this Bill would not be before the House.  It is significant that the Bill was published two days before a recent conference on litter organised by this group.  It deserves the highest praise for kick-starting this Bill and bringing about its publication.</P>

      <P>That is what I expect the Deputy to do.</P>
      <P>The Irish Business Against Litter group carried out a survey in February 1996 which provides a valuable insight into attitudes about litter.  It helps us to focus on particular black spots which need to be targeted by the new legislation.  It confirms, for example, that 72 per cent of those interviewed believe that stronger enforcement is essential. That should encourage us to put in place stringent enforcement measures because by so doing we would respond to the wishes of the citizens.  This legislation will impact on the problem only if strong enforcement structures are part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> However, in addition, we also need a carrot and stick approach which will yield the best results.  We must put in place well designed programmes of public and school based education to convince people that our environment is our greatest national asset.  We must carry out one in conjunction with the other.  I agree with Deputy Dempsey that the £400,000 spent by the Minister on a TV campaign in the last six months has had no impact.  It was a waste.  Conducting such a campaign in the absence of the legislation was the wrong approach.  The money should have been reserved until such time as the legislation was in place and the two could have been used in conjunction with each other.</P>
    <P>Young people have a key role to play in changing attitudes about litter.  Young people under 25 are not drinking and driving.  You will not find anyone under 35 in any pub saying they had four pints before driving home.  They will take a taxi home instead.  Young people have changed their driving habits which is a good thing.  They have grown up in an atmosphere where drinking and driving are not tolerated.  If we can bring young people to the same awareness of the role they can play in changing attitudes towards litter we will be doing a good job for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister should establish a green flag competition for clean schools based on the blue flag awarded for beaches where a high standard of cleanliness is maintained.  The blue flag award gives a great sense of local pride and patriotism and a scheme modelled on that should be applied to schools in conjunction with this legislation. Schools would then be challenged to put in place a waste management plan both inside and outside their walls.  They would also be encouraged to create an energy management plan with prizes and green flags being awarded.  In doing so, we would go a long way towards changing people's attitudes to litter.  No matter how well framed and implemented, legislation alone will not achieve the Bill's objectives.  Education is also needed.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a cleaner Ireland task force. It is heartening to see what has been achieved by the Tidy Towns competition over the years.  Most provincial towns and villages are sparkling and a delight to visit during the summer holidays.  Such places are totally litter free as well as having hanging baskets, window boxes and other features distinctive to different towns.  All that has happened in response to the Tidy Towns competition which has been an enormous success. I congratulate the organisers in Ardagh, this year's overall winner of the contest.  I also congratulate Kenmare, County Kerry, and other towns that achieved awards.  What gave me enormous pleasure was the fact that a suburban area like Ballyfermot also received a Tidy Towns award.  It demonstrates without doubt that what has been achieved in provincial towns and villages can also be done in cities if the effort is made and the community spirit is there.  I take this business seriously.  The Minister should put <Col N="125" /> in place a cleaner Ireland task force to parallel what is being done under the Tidy Towns competition.  In that way we would have a better expectation of the Bill's objectives being achieved.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the importance of educating the public through the media and of educating young people through schools but we must also enlist the support of the commercial sector if we are to achieve the Bill's aims.  It would make a great difference if there was a small return of 5p or 10p on empty cans.  The first thing one sees in the morning is cans left over from the night before with the remains of take-away chicken suppers.  Both these items represent a huge component of the litter that spoils our streets.  If we could enlist the support of the commercial sector to give a return on each empty can it would provide a great incentive to young people not to discard them.</P>
    <P>Some primary schools have successfully organised programmes whereby young people collect cans and bring them to school for recycling.  That is a good scheme which could be extended.  However, we will not achieve this Bill's objectives unless and until we can involve the commercial sector which, as well as giving a small return on cans, could charge 2p for each plastic bag used.  Such bags are a litter scourge but they could be controlled through the imposition of such a monetary penalty.  People would then be more careful and would use fewer plastic bags.  We should talk to women, in particular, about this. We might even return to our grandmothers' practice of using a shopping bag.  One way or another we must put in place a system to reduce the number of plastic bags.  They are doing substantial damage to watercourses, for example.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated I will be tabling amendments to a very weak section relating to the enforcement of these provisions.  Section 3 (3) of the Bill states that no person shall place household waste into or near a litter receptacle.</P>
    <P>The placing of household waste in litter bins is a scourge in our cities, particularly in areas where there are flats or multiple occupancies.  That problem must be tackled in the context of section 6 (3) of the Bill which states: &ldquo;The owner of any land appurtenant to a residence that is let in two or more dwelling units (not being seperate hereditaments) shall, notwithstanding the obligation of an occupier under subsection (2) in relation to land, keep the land free of litter that is to any extent visible from a public place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill the total responsibility is put on the owner of the property.  However, I do not think that will work because tenants are there every day whereas, in practice, the owner or landlord turns up once a week to collect the rent.  Unless the Minister can put some responsibility on tenants to control litter that section of the Bill will not succeed in obtaining results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The exploitation and sexual abuse of children for commercial purposes is a problem that is not confined to any one nation.  It is an international phenomenon which is universally condemned. Unfortunately condemnation is not sufficient. Moral opprobrium is not sufficient to deter the people involved in this evil business.  Something more is needed.  Most of the data which exist regarding the extent and nature of the problem have focused on North America and Northern Europe.</P>
      <P>The 1986 report of the permanent subcommittee on the investigations of the United States Senate concluded that the US market for child pornography is widely thought to be the most lucrative in the world.  In developing countries, the extent and existence of child pornography is often dwarfed by the magnitude of other problems such as poverty, infant mortality, hunger and disease.  There is little reliable data on the subject.  It is internationally recognised that children are at risk from those who engage in the production, exhibition, distribution and consumption of child pornography.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which has been ratified by an overwhelming majority of nations identifies child pornography as a violation against children and requires that nations who are parties take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic materials.  Article 34 of the Convention requires countries to take &ldquo;...all appropriate national, bilateral and multinational measures to prevent ... the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity ... and the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal measures to deal with child pornography vary considerably among European countries with no common approach to production, distribution or possession of child pornographic material.  In England and Wales the Protection of Children Act, 1978, makes it a criminal offence to take, distribute, exhibit or possess even one indecent photograph of a child.  In the Netherlands, the manufacture, dissemination, transport and export of child pornography is illegal.  In April 1995 the law in the Netherlands <Col N="127" /> was changed to provide sanctions for the possession of child pornography.  Section 207a of the Australian penal code, passed in July 1994, imposes criminal liability for the possession or acquisition of child pornography.</P>
    <P>Ireland has many statutes directed towards criminalising sexual conduct involving children. Those who would seek to produce pornographic material involving children in this country can rightly suffer a wide range of sanctions.  The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, makes it a felony for any person to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 15 years. The penalty for this offence is a sentence of imprisonment up to and including life.  Consent is not an issue.  The offence is there to protect young women.  The age of consent in Ireland is 17 years. It is an offence punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment for any person to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between the age of 15 and 17 years.  Consent is not an issue. The prohibition is on the act, as the law correctly concludes that a child of that age is not in a position to give an informed consent to sexual activity of this nature.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, provide for a sentence of imprisonment of up to life imprisonment for the offence of rape.  It is worthy of note that a sentence of life imprisonment was actually imposed by a judge in the Central Criminal Court in recent weeks after a lengthy contested trial.  The 1990 Act also provides for a sentence of up to life imprisonment for other acts of sexual violation which are now described as rape, contrary to section 4 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>We can, I believe, be satisfied that our laws are adequate to deter the manufacture or production of child pornography in this country.  That is not the end of the matter.  Filth of this nature is only produced because there is a demand for it.  It is produced because there is a market for it.  People are involved in the distribution, sale and purchase of child pornography.  It is an evil trade designed to corrupt and has no place in a free society.  The Bill which I introduced today is one which I believe will command the support of all Deputies. It is one which has no party political purpose.  The objects of this Bill fit comfortably within the ideals of every political party and every individual Deputy.  It is a Bill designed to decimate a trade in degradation by criminalising the possession of child pornography.</P>
    <P>It fills a gap in our legislation, a gap which has become all the more apparent because of the prevalence of home-video cameras and selfdeveloping cameras.  It is a Bill which will have a very small impact on the world market in child pornography.  If enacted and enforced by all countries it would decimate this evil trade throughout the world.  By enacting this Bill we can take a small but significant step towards curtailing child pornography.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The Bill prohibits the possession of indecent material and indecent photographs.  There have been difficulties in other jurisdictions in the past in defining child pornography.  This Bill seeks to avoid those difficulties by relying on internationally accepted definitions.  In defining what is meant by child pornography, the Bill uses the definition adopted by the Council of Europe i.e. &ldquo;any audio visual material which uses children in a sexual context&rdquo; and the definition used by the International Criminal Police Organisation INTERPOL i.e. &ldquo;the visual depiction of the sexual exploitation of a child, focusing on the child's sexual behaviour or genitals&rdquo;.  By adopting these internationally accepted definitions of child pornography it is intended that the prohibition contained in the Bill should apply to all categories of internationally recognised child pornography.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the age of 18 years is used as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as being a person under the age of 18 years.  I recognise this definition is far from being universally accepted.  In all Australian states and territories child pornography legislation defines &ldquo;child&rdquo; as a person under 16 years of age.  In Canada a minor, for the purposes of child pornography, is a person under 18 years of age.  In various jurisdictions of the United States minors as young as 15 may legally consent to sexual activity with an adult.  However, the same adult could not create, distribute or possess a visual record of that activity because federal child pornography statues define a minor as any person under 18 years of age.  The definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; contained in this Bill is internationally recognised and accepted.</P>
    <P>The Bill is directed at every category of exploiter in the child pornography industry.  It is directed at the producers, including photographers, publishers and creators of home videos.  It is directed at the middlemen including procurers and compliant parents.  It is directed at the distributors as well as child pornography collectors.  I hope the enactment of this Bill, if accepted by the Government, will represent an ever present cloud of worry for all those who participate, at whatever level, in this evil trade.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks also to deal with difficulties which arise from modern computer technology. It is regrettable that its development has made a tremendous impact on the production and distribution of child pornography.  It has transformed the production of child pornography into a sophisticated global cottage industry. Anyone with access to a computer and a modem has access to commercial on-line services and to the Internet, a remarkable global network of nearly 30 million people joined by computers. Amongst many other things such access means it is possible to send and receive pornography.  The Internet is becoming an increasingly significant factor in child sexual exploitation.  This House will have to be vigilant and aggressive in devising means of protecting children from the misuse of this technology.  The Bill recognises that images <Col N="129" /> can be distorted and altered by the use of computers and it includes what are termed pseudo-photographs in the category of materials prohibited.</P>
    <P>The World Congress Against the Commercial Exploitation of Children which took place in Stockholm in August was the culmination of a process of global mobilisation against the commercial sexual exploitation of children which began in 1994 when the &ldquo;End Child Prostitution in Asia Tourism Campaign&rdquo; was launched.  A total of 1,341 delegates from 125 countries participated in the congress which called for increased protection of children, including the criminalisation of the possession of child pornography.  This Bill is a response to that call. I met the Irish branch of UNICEF which strongly advocated the introduction of a Bill which criminalised the possession of child pornography.</P>
    <P>The provision of penalties for the offence of possession of child pornography is guaranteed to strike fear into the hearts of the ultimate consumers of this wicked enterprise.  If there was no demand there would be no production and if there was no production there would be no exploitation of innocent children on the scale which, regrettably, takes place.  There is a direct causal connection between the ultimate purchaser of child pornography and the corruption and exploitation of children.  This is why the Bill proposes a sentence of one year's imprisonment and a fine of up to £1,000 in respect of the offence of possession of an indecent photograph or any other indecent material defined in the Bill. People who use or possess child pornography must be made responsible for what they have brought about.  They are responsible for encouraging and fuelling the child pornography industry which is socially and morally re-prehensible and causes harm to the most vulnerable members of society.  For those reasons, it is a proper area for the criminal law to act in and restrict and for society, through the Legislature, to intervene in and create criminal penalties.</P>
    <P>I hope that with the co-operation of Members this measure can become law in the near future. I also hope it will be enforced with determination as the imposition of jail sentences on a number of people for the possession of child pornography will have the effect of decimating this trade.  We can do no more than legislate for our own country and co-operate with international bodies in seeking to outlaw trade in this material.  If all countries were to act in a similar fashion it would result in a global crackdown on child pornography and those who prosper from it.</P>
    <P>Adults who participate in the child pornography industry deserve to be condemned and punished.  However, there are different degrees of participation in this industry.  For example, the ultimate purchaser is in a different position from the manufacuturer or distributor who have made a commercial decision to become involved in this trade for monetary gain. <Col N="130" /> Different criteria must apply to persons who deal in or promote child pornography by way of sale or distribution.  They are the godfathers of this type of crime and must be treated seriously.  They are directly responsible for the commission of reprehensible actions against children for monetary reward.  The punishment for these offences must reflect the evil involved.  The Bill proposes a penalty of ten years' imprisonment and-or a fine of up to £100,000 for persons found in possession of child pornography for the purpose of distribution.  This is a potentially harsh punishment but it will punish those people responsible for particularly despicable actions.</P>
    <P>The punishments proposed in the Bill are neither excessive nor unjust.  They fit the crimes involved and are richly deserved by those who participate in this trade.  We must ensure that people who are not deterred from participating in the child pornography industry on moral grounds will be deterred from participating in it on financial or other grounds.  We must put all the obstacles available to a democratic society in the path of the purveyors of child pornography. Every possible deterrent must be used and, if necessary, people must be sent to jail for lengthy periods.  The Bill contains the usual ancillary powers of search and arrest necessary to make its primary objectives enforceable.  It is also designed to permit the Garda to root out and pursue all involved in the child pornography trade.</P>
    <P>I earnestly ask all Members to support the Bill. I acknowledge that the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice have shown considerable generosity in the past in accepting Opposition Bills.  I have responded to this attitude by keeping a completely open mind on Committee Stage and by accepting reasonable amendments which leave the central purpose of the Bill intact.</P>
    <P>The criminal law is the sole weapon in a democratic society for countering evil and it should not be used in a profligate or dispassionate manner.  We must move slowly when creating criminal offences and be sure that the activity involved warrants criminal sanction.  The possession of child pornography is a reprehensible activity which deserves criminal sanction.  The measures proposed in the Bill do no more than bring Ireland into line with other countries in the western world which, during the past five years, have found it necessary to amend their laws so that they can fight more effectively against child pornography.  This is a measured, limited and potentially effective Bill and the only persons who will suffer from its enactment are those who participate in the trade of child pornography either as dealers or consumers.  I am sure that, like me, Deputies have little sympathy for people who are directly responsible for the sexual exploitation of vulnerable children.  They should be on the receiving end of the criminal law and the existence of a statute such as this will act as a considerable deterrent.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and earnestly request all Members to support it.  I ask the <Col N="131" /> Government to accept the Bill in the full and certain knowledge that the Opposition can present legislation but it is the Government who decides whether it is enacted.</P>
    <P>The legislation is necessary at this juncture, it is extremely unfortunate and tragic that it has to be introduced but there is no escaping the necessity for it.  I ask the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, to accept the legislation in the spirit of magnanimity in which it is put forward.  This House will do a great service to the public if it enacts this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being put forward with the best of intentions.  At the conference in Sweden the Minister of State and I attended workshops which dealt with the exploitation of children, an issue about which everyone feels very strongly.</P>
      <P>The Child Pornography Bill has been put forward in response to the massive public concern at the increase in child sexual abuse and the discovery of individuals and groups who have preyed on young children who have had no protection from the State or its institutions.  The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, introduced by Fianna Fáil and at present before the President for signature, will outlaw sex tourism, while this Bill will close loopholes in the law which enable child sex abusers to ply their evil trade through photograph collections, contact magazines and the Internet.  For paedophiles pornography is the theory and child sex abuse is the practice.  The two are proven to be directly connected in a series of respected academic studies.  It we are serious about tackling child sexual abuse, we must first ban the production, sale, distribution and possession of this form of pornography.  The Bill will enable us to achieve these objectives and I urge the Government to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, ratified in Ireland in 1992, imposed an obligation on States to protect children from &ldquo;all forms of physical and mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parents, legal guardians or other persons who have care of the child&rdquo;.  Under Articles 34 and 35 of the convention we are obliged to put in place legislation and policing measures &ldquo;to prevent any coercion of children to engage in unlawful sexual activity, prostitution or exploitative pornographic performances&rdquo;.  Almost seven years later, despite a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission to introduce a new specific offence of child sexual abuse and in the face of sexual scandals exposed on a weekly basis by the popular press, we the legislators have failed to tackle the abusers.  Fianna Fáil's Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill and this Child Pornography Bill are two concrete actions now under way.  We owe it to all the children concerned to put in <Col N="132" /> place these basic measures as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <P>Article 40.6.1.ºi. of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The limitations of existing legislation to control the production or possession of pornography is shown in the judicial and public perception of section 1 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946.  This section defines &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; as including &ldquo;suggestive or inviting to sexual immorality or unnatural vice or likely in any other similar way to corrupt or deprave&rdquo;. Pornography is now seen to be a relative term, in the sense that it relates to what the individual sensitivities of the public will tolerate.  The current emphasis in the objection to pornography is the direct link to violence against women. Society objects to depictions of women and children as sexually subordinate objects and willing victims of sexual violence.  While there may be an ongoing debate regarding the commercialisation of pornography and the availability of magazines on the shelves of newsagents in recent months, there can be no doubt that child pornography in its explicit or subtle form will not be tolerated in modern Irish society.  Criminal sanctions against distributors, retailers and others who allow pornography to become available to children are the best way of enforcing this principle.  In general, if younger people see women treated as mere objects for sexual gratification, we must balance educational initiative in our schools to counter this message which pervades from many magazines, videos, songs and television programmes.  This is not thought control, but a reasoned and proactive response from legislation to a reality in a free information society.  The Video Recording Act, 1995 is a step in the direction of ensuring that children in particular are not exposed to gratuitous sexual or violent scenes through age certification of films.  The policing of such measures can be effective only if it is carried out at the production and distribution levels.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for us as legislators and parents to utter the realities of child sexual abuse and its expression in child pornography.  It is accepted by law enforcement agencies, including the Garda Dublin Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit that there are three types of paedophiles. There are those who &ldquo;groom&rdquo; children; there is the introverted offender who hangs around outside school gates and there is the sadistic offender who has to hurt children to get sexual pleasure.  He is more likely than any other child abuser to abduct and murder his victim.  The horror of children abducted and murdered in Belgium has brought this reality home to many of us.  Many paedophiles claim that children are wicked little creatures, wanting and waiting for sex and throwing temptation in the paths of unsuspecting adults.  One paedophile said he could not be expected to resist the advances of <Col N="133" /> children &ldquo;after all they know exactly what they are doing&rdquo;.  An expert who spoke at the conference said it is common for paedophiles to show no remorse and that they believe the child encouraged them to carry out the act.  Therefore, child pornography is not the tawdry glamour of the playboy centrefolds, but the evidence recorded on film or video type of serious sexual assaults on young children.</P>
    <P>Child pornography ranges from posed photographs of naked and semi-naked children, showing various explicit acts and other base activities.  Children of all ages are photographed. The reality of child pornography is that it cannot be produced without a child being sexually abused.  Failure to grasp that essential truth which, above all else, separates it from adult pornography lies behind 20 years of legislative confusion throughout the world.  In those twenty years child pornography has become established as a world wide commodity.</P>
    <P>Magazines are sent to customers in Ireland, the rest of Europe and the United States.  The single largest geographical source of commercial child pornography has been Scandinavia.  In 1969 Denmark removed all restrictions on the production and sale of any type of pornography. The result was a short lived explosion in adult pornography and the birth of the commercial child pornography.  The most widely traded child pornography magazine originated in Denmark. The magazine, written in A5 format, with a colour cover of a naked child, frequently no more than five years old, is depraved.  Some of the photographs inside are of toddlers in various poses.  These magazines also provide a contact service for paedophiles enabling them to advertise for child pornography and child sexual partners.  While legislation in recent years has clamped down on the production of such material, the collectors of these magazines have become the new producers for the child porn industry.  Individual paedophiles are now known to record themselves abusing children in photographs and on videos.  They are then sold, bartered or exchanged with other abusers.  In effect, legislation aimed at eliminating child pornography has merely eliminated the middle man, requiring paedophiles to deal directly with each other. Although the abuse they record may have taken place years before, the paedophile industry continually recycles it.</P>
    <P>A paedophile involved with a child or with several children realises that his victims will grow older and out of his age or development preference.  The paedophile also recognises that there will be periods in his life when he will not have a victim to molest.  Paedophiles therefore have a compelling need to record the act of physical molestation with their victims.  They will use whatever tools are available, ranging from memory, diaries, computer recordings photographs, films or video tapes.  The most graphic and popular method now used for paedophile rings is the Internet where photographs and <Col N="134" /> descriptions of child sex abuse are freely traded by paedophiles.  The existence of these pornographic images is especially disturbing to the exploited child who lives with the knowledge that a record of his or her humiliation endures for years afterwards.</P>
    <P>The US Congress enacted the Communications Decency Act which sought to protect children by banning material with indecent content from computerised network.  Contravention of the Act was punishable with a fine of up to $250,000 and two years in jail.  It was struck down in June, 1996 as being unconstitutional but I understand it is currently the subject of a Supreme Court appeal.</P>
    <P>There are certain software producers available which enable parents and teachers to block the availability of certain programmes on the Internet to children although none of these are regarded as fully effective.  The challenge of restricting access to child pornography on the Internet is addressed in the Child Pornography Bill which makes illegal the possession of any photographic image which may be an image made by computer graphics or stored on computer disc or other electronic means.</P>
    <P>The less explicit version of child pornography is the soft kiddie porn which is subtly presented in advertising promotional material.  As a society we must attempt to draw a line, however difficult this may be, between acceptable portrayal of children in advertising and the unacceptable presentation of children by sexual innuendo.  We recently had a public outcry when a young girl was portrayed in a provocative manner in an advertisement in a popular magazine.  While most advertisers are careful to portray children as children, some have stepped over the line.</P>
    <P>Society cannot claim to abhor the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and women in pornography and yet allow the portrayal of children as sexual objects in the popular press and in advertising.  The sight of young children selling jeans in a seductive manner pleases paedophiles. We all know children do not naturally sit or look that way.  We learned at the congerence in Sweden that paedophiles are attracted to this.  At one of the workshops people showed a collection of such photographs found in paedophile houses. This is glamorising children as sexual objects by presenting them in inappropriate sexual contexts. Children should be protected, loved and nurtured not used and abused.  They should be treated as children.</P>
    <P>I encourage consumers, when faced with this type of unacceptable advertising, to write to the Advertising Standards Authority, refuse to buy products which use children in this way, tell manufacturers what they are doing and why and become more aware of how children are being used.  This type of pornography is also referred to indirectly in the Bill in regard to photographs of an indecent natre presented to give the impression that the subject is a child even though the subject may be an adult dressed or undressed as if the subject were a child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> The Bill creates the specific offence of taking any indecent photograph or photographic image relating to a child and also makes it an offence to distribute, show or have such photographs in one's possession or to publish or adver such photographs.  The Bill covers not only photographs and text for magazines and written publications, but also photographs and text on any computer media whether on disc or on the Internet.</P>
    <P>The Bill also envisages the prosecution of companies if they are the offender and will prevent individuals hiding behind limited liability companies as the producer, importer or seller of such indecent material.  The directors and officers of the company can be personally prosecuted if they are responsible for the offence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives a right of entry, search and seizure following a District Court order made on the application of a Garda inspector who has reasonable grounds to suspect a premises contains or is being used for the promotion or sale of child pornography.  The Bill refers to a power of forfeiture which closes a major legal loophole where pornographic material is confiscated by the State for destruction.  It could be returned to the offender under current legislation.  The Bill also imposes a fine of six months on summary conviction and up to three years on indictment for possession or promotion of child pornography.</P>
    <P>I urge all parties and the Government to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has no objection, in principle, to what this Bill sets out to achieve and for that reason is not opposing its Second Reading.  I want to make it clear, however, that I will be proposing an alternative approach which will have the effect of achieving the Bill's objective, but in a more complete and effective manner.  My approach will involve bringing forward proposals for updating our law in this area and giving effect to those proposals by way of amendments to the Children Bill, 1996.  That Bill is currently awaiting Second Stage in this House and already contains a number of child protection provisions.  By adopting that course I expect the law will be updated with the minimum of delay and there will be no need to progress this Bill any further.  Notwithstanding the work of Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan on the Bill, I consider that the alternative approach I am proposing will be in the best interests of children. I say that because there is no getting away from the fact that the Bill before us is seriously flawed and would not do enough to protect children.</P>

    <P>There has been a heightened awareness of the problems of child sexual abuse and child sexual exploitation following the discovery of the Belgian paedophile ring last August and the Stockholm World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children the <Col N="136" /> same month.  Those events gave a massive impetus to progress in this area and ensured the problem of child sexual abuse found its rightful place at the top of political agendas.</P>
    <P>The detection of the paedophile ring in Belgium shocked not just the Belgian people but people all over Europe and beyond.  While there had been concern about child sexual abuse before that case, for many that concern manifested itself in an abstract way.  There may also have been a naivety in many quarters about the nature and extent of such abuse.  The Belgian case changed all that.  It opened our eyes to the vileness of paedophile rings and showed us how organised paedophiles are.</P>
    <P>The second event in August that highlighted the child sexual abuse problem was the Stockholm World Congress which the two Deputies mentioned.  Ireland sent to that congress a strong team which I headed and a number of Deputies and Senators also attended including Deputy Eoin Ryan, one of the co-authors of this Bill.  That congress made a valuable contribution in drawing attention to the extent of child sexual exploitation but also, importantly, in setting out an agenda for action.  That agenda sets out a practical plan for progress on a number of forms of sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography, to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>In the context of pornography generally, there are differences of opinion about whether it leads to sexual abuse.  Put briefly, there are two opposing camps &mdash; those who argue pornography causes sexual abuse and those who maintain it may be cathartic, that it may provide a release for the urges of those with perverse inclinations. Where child pornography is concerned, however, I regard that debate as irrelevant.  I take that view because a crucial point that needs to be borne in mind where child pornography is concerned is that its very production involves child sexual abuse.  Much of that abuse is of a very serious nature.  There is no doubt that child pornography is a serious problem and many aspects of it involve many people at different levels, from those engaged in the production of child pornography to other who distribute it and those who consume it.</P>
    <P>The question of what constitutes child pornography is quite a complex issue.  Standards applied in different societies or countries are highly subjective and contingent upon differing moral, cultural, sexual, social and religious beliefs that do not readily translate into law.  Even defining what constitutes child pornography in any one country can prove a difficult task.</P>
    <P>Another problem one encounters when dealing with child pornography is the dearth of information on the extent and nature of the problem.  It is difficult to get hard information on the extent of the problem here and it is of little consolation that similar situations seem to apply in other jurisdictions.  Most of the available data concern North America and Northern Europe, places that have played a key role in the <Col N="137" /> production, distribution and consumption of child pornography.</P>
    <P>In developing countries the view has been expressed that the child pornography problem is not of the same magnitude as other problems such as poverty, infant mortality, hunger and disease and, not surprisingly, in those countries there is often little reliable data on the subject. Nevertheless, it is fair to conclude that the pornographic exploitation of children is a phenomenon that exists worldwide and it would be foolhardy of us to assume we are in some way immune to it.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the number of children worldwide involved in child pornography range from thousands to hundreds of thousands.  While it is very difficult to obtain accurate date, the extent of the availability of child pornography indicates that a significant number of children are being sexually exploited in this way.  In most countries it is children such as those on the margins of society or those from deprived backgrounds who are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and to being seduced and coerced into the production of pornographic material.</P>
    <P>It would, however, be naive to assume that these children are the only victims.  Producers of child pornography frequently target children with whom they have contact through their work or otherwise.  Sadly, in many countries, including developed countries, it is the unfortunate reality that child victims may come from homes where their parents use them to create child pornography or where their parents offer them to others for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Tackling the problem can be difficult due to a lack of clarity about what constitutes child pornography, the lack of data regarding its production and distribution and the shifting patterns of production and consumption.  As many Deputies will be aware, technological developments have made it even more difficult to tackle the child pornography problem.  Many people associate the Internet with the problem, but other newer technologies are involved too.</P>
    <P>Child pornography seriously affects its child victims.  There is the trauma attached to the making of child pornography.  This can involve the vilest of sexual abuse.  I will spare the House the details of the depths of depravity that can be involved.  The trauma for many of the children abused in the making of child pornography may be compounded by other forms of abuse.  They may, for example, be forced into prostitution with all that that entails.</P>
    <P>As it does in relation to many other child-related matters, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out a clear international standard for us to follow in tackling the child pornography problem.  At a general level, Article 19 of the convention requires States parties to take appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or <Col N="138" /> negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse while in the care of parents, legal guardians or any other person who has the care of the child.  Of particular relevance in the current context is Article 34 which provides that States parties shall undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual abuse.  The article goes on to state that for these purposes, States' parties shall, in particular, take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent, among other abuses, the exploitative abuse of children in pornographic performances and materials.</P>
    <P>The Stockholm World Congress elaborates on the requirement of the convention in its Agenda for Action to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children.  The congress's Agenda for Action calls for action from States to promote better international co-operation.  Measures at that level are intensifying.</P>
    <P>Within Europe undoubtedly effective action has been taken in relation to the problem of child sexual abuse and exploitation in the course of our Presidency of the European Union.  For the benefit of Members who may not be fully aware of these developments, I shall give the House a brief outline of the action taken.</P>
    <P>Trafficking in persons and the sexual exploitation of children was one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency.  Events in Belgium served to make us all the more determined and focused our attention on ensuring that all appropriate action was taken to deal with the problem, with particular emphasis on child sexual exploitation. To underline that fact I should point that the Justice and Home Affairs Council held in Brussels on 28 and 29 November, in which I participated, gave political approval to a number of important measures to tackle the problem of trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children.</P>
    <P>The first measure was an Irish Presidency proposal to extend the mandate of the European Drugs Unit to trafficking in human beings which will cover the activities of paedophiles and those who supply children to them as well as the trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  In effect, this will confer on the European Drugs Unit the responsibilities in relation to this form of activity which will be held ultimately by the EDU's successor, EUROPOL, when the convention establishing that organisation is ratigied by all EU member states. The extension of the European Drugs Unit remit will facilitate co-operation, the exchange of information between police forces and allow that unit to provide any assistance it can in relation to these activities.</P>
    <P>The second measure agreed was a Belgian proposal to establish a programme for the exchange and training of persons responsible for dealing with sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>The third measure was a joint Belgian-Irish Presidency proposal concerning the creation of a <Col N="139" /> directory of competences and specialisations in the fight against particular crimes of this nature. Those proposals will significantly assist international co-operation between operational police forces.</P>
    <P>The fourth measure approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council is probably the most relevant in the context of this Bill: the council approved a joint action obliging all member states to undertake a major review of their laws on the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings.  This will mean that all member states will render trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children criminal offences and provide for the punishment of perpetrators of those offences.  Of particular importance is a commitment by member states to ensure that all aspects of the exploitative use of children in pornography is criminalised including the production, sale, distribution and possession of such pornography.</P>
    <P>The Stockholm Agenda for Action calls for various measures to protect children at national level.  Before going on to talk about changes in the law in relation to child pornography, I want to refer briefly to the problem posed by the Internet in this regard.  For some time I have been concerned at the manner in which the Internet is being used not just to carry child pornography but for a variety of other harmful purposes.  To address the problem, officials from the Department of Justice met representatives of the Irish Service Providers and UNICEF in early October and discussed the problems which had to be faced in addressing this difficult issue.  It was generally acknowledged that controlling pornography on the Internet raised a wide variety of technical and legal issues which could not be addressed exclusively on the domestic front.  The option of some form of self-regulation by the service providers was discussed and will be re-examined shortly.</P>
    <P>However, because the harmful use of the Internet extends beyond its use for child pornography, the Department of Justice proposed to proceed with the establishment of an interdepartmental group to study all the implications of the Internet.</P>
    <P>As part of a further initiative, the Taoiseach asked the Minister for Justice recently to set up a group to tackle the problem of harmful and illegal content on the Internet, including child pornography, and to specifically include representatives from the private sector.  It is proposed to bring together the thrust of these ideas and arrangements are in hand to establish a group that will include both public and private sector enterprise.</P>
    <P>One of the principal means of enhancing protection of children is through changes in the law.  The Agenda for Action specifically calls on States to develop, strengthen and implement national laws to establish the criminal responsibility of service providers, customers and <Col N="140" /> intermediaries in child pornography, including possession of child pornography.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to pornography is contained principally in the following &mdash; Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967, Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1992 and Video Recordings Acts, 1989 to 1992, which provide for censorship of books and magazines, films and video recordings.  The task of censorship is carried out by the Censorship of Publications Board in relation to books and magazines and by the film censor in relation to films and video recordings. In addition, there are appeal boards to decide an appeal against decisions of the Censorship of Publications Board and the film censor.</P>
    <P>While those laws may be adequate to deal with some aspects of child pornography, I am satisfied they are inadequate to deal with all aspects of the problem.  For example, the legislation does not criminalise the mere possession of child pornography, nor are the penalities sufficiently severe.</P>
    <P>In recognising the need to update our laws, I am at one with the thrust of this Bill.  I also share Members' conclusion that there is need for urgent action to update the law in this area.  Lest I be accused of foot dragging I want to make a particular point clear.</P>
    <P>Following the Stockholm Congress work took place in the Department of Justice on reviewing our child pornography laws but could not be satisfactorily progressed until relevant developments in the context of the European Union, of which I was aware came to a conclusion.  I referred earlier to the joint action which obliges all member states to undertake a major review of their laws on the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings.  Among other things, that instrument places an onus on member states to criminalise the exploitative use of children in pornography. The offence should be comprehensive and extend to possession of child pornography as well as its production, distribution and sale.  Late last month the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels give political approval to the joint action.  It would have been most inappropriate to have concluded the review of the child pornography laws without taking account of the text of that joint action.  I still assure the House that not only will that joint action be taken into account in the context of my proposals for updating our laws on child pornography but that the work will be carried out expeditiously.</P>
    <P>As regards the details of the proposals before the House, I appreciate the difficulties faced by an Opposition party in bringing forward a Bill such as this.  I am conscious of the fact that Fianna Fáil does not have the benefit of the resources available to the Government in preparing legislative proposals.  Having said that, there are flaws in the Bill which the Government believes will not be possible to resolve without adopting a different approach and this will become clear from my observations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> The Bill was introduced before the finalisation of the text of the EU joint action on the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings to which I already referred.  It does not, therefore, take account of that instrument's requirement that member states criminalise certain child pornography related activities. Those activities are not adequately covered by the Bill.  I accept that the Deputies could not have been expected to have been aware of the significance of the developments in Europe and I am not criticising them for that.  I am raising the matter because it is important to be aware that the joint action conditions, in an important way, how we approach this task of bringing forward legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>A number of the Bill's problems seem to be related to the fact that the Deputies chose to follow an unsuitable legislative model.  The Bill is based on the UK Protection of Children Act, 1978, which is inappropriate in a number of respects, notwithstanding that the Deputies have taken account of amendments to that Act made by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, 1994.  It is not that the UK legislation does not go some way towards dealing with child pornography, but that the 1978 Act seems to focus too much on photographs and related materials as well as related activities instead of taking a broader view.  I will come to the consequences of that approach in a moment when I discuss the text of the Bill's sections.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the text of the Bill to suggest that consideration was given to how it fits in with existing law.  For example, although a major focus of the Bill is indecent photographs, there is nothing about how its provisions fit in with section 18 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, which makes it an offence to sell or import for sale any indecent picture.  It seems that photographs, including &ldquo;photographic images&rdquo;, are different from pictures, a word which is not defined in the 1929 Act.  Whether the Deputies intended the two categories to be separate is not clear.</P>
    <P>I now turn to specific sections of the Bill.  There are one or two aspects of section 1 with which I am unhappy.  I would be interested to hear why the Deputies used the expression &ldquo;photographic images&rdquo;.  I note that the Bill takes account of changes made by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, 1994, to the Protection of Children Act, 1978.  Most of those changes involve provision for what are referred to in the UK legislation as pseudo-photographs.  For the benefit of Deputies who may not be familiar with the expression, pseudo-photographs are made up by combining a number of photographs.  Using computer technology, a photograph of a child's face can, for example, be superimposed on a photo of an adult body to produce child pornography.  At the Stockholm Congress there was a demonstration of how this is done and of how disturbingly realistic the outcome is.  Instead of using the expression pseudo-photographs, the <Col N="142" /> Bill refers to photographic images.  It seems that the expressions cover the same ground and I would be interested to know why the change was made.  I am assuming there is more to it than an attempt to disguise the authors' source of inspiration.</P>
    <P>The definition of child in paragraph (d) of section 1 needs to be reconsidered.  By defining a child as a person under the age of 16 years, the Bill follows the equivalent provision in the UK's Protection of Children Act, 1978.  While that age makes sense in the context of the UK, it bears no relation to the situation here and is not appropriate to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>The principal shortcoming of section 2 is that it fails to cover a number of activities related to child pornography.  For example, the section does not prohibit the sale of indecent material.  It is not clear why that is the case but possibly it is considered that sales are covered by the reference to distributing indecent material.  I have doubts that that is the case and in support of these doubts, I am aware that in other jurisdictions the sale and distribution of child pornography is made an offence.</P>
    <P>A more glaring and puzzling omission, despite what Deputy O'Donoghue said, is the fact that section 2 does not make it an offence to possess child pornography for personal use.  There is a growing realisation that such possession needs to be outlawed and various international instruments encourage states to do so because, as I have already stated, its production involves child sex abuse.  Yet, all the Bill does is provide for the possession of indecent material with a view to it being distributed or shown to others.  I am not sure whether Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan took a conscious decision not to criminalise mere possession, but it is strange that a Bill which is so firmly rooted in UK legislation did not follow the UK lead in relation to mere possession.  For the information of the two Deputies, the relevant provision in UK law is section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1988.  I have no doubt that the possession of child pornography for personal use needs to be made an offence and it will be provided for in the legislative proposals I will bring forward in the near future.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(a) seeks to include in an inappropriate way provision in relation to texts. While I have no difficulty with the principle of so doing, when it comes to the execution a problem is encountered because the reference to text does not fit in with the rest of the paragraph concerned.  One can take or make an indecent photograph or photographic image but I have doubts about the appropriateness of referring to taking or making a text.  This may seem to some Members to be a minor drafting point, but it is worth mentioning because it is symptomatic of the sort of thing that can happen when an inappropriate legislative model is used.  The UK's Protection of Children Act was designed to deal <Col N="143" /> with indecent photographs and related matters and it is difficult to stretch it beyond that.</P>
    <P>The entry search and seizure provision in section 4 of the Bill may need to be dealt with in greater detail as may the provision for forfeiture in section 5.  The penalties provided for in section 5 are on the low side and may not give our judges sufficient scope to deal with the more serious child pornography related offences.  It would be unsatisfactory if, for example, the head of a paedophile ring, who was at the centre of its child pornography activities, having been convicted of producing such pornography, could not be sentenced to more than three years in prison.</P>
    <P>These are some of the more substantive points but the Bill also raises a number of minor drafting points which need to be attended to.  For example, the Bill would need to be gender-proofed, section 7(2) is superfluous and would have to be deleted.</P>
    <P>What the foregoing clearly indicates is that the Bill is flawed in many respects.  The Government has always shown itself willing to take on board Private Members' Bills, subject to amendments, where that was the appropriate course of action. In this instance, however, the Bill's flaws are of such a fundamental nature they are incapable of being rectified by amendments.  As I indicated at the outset, I will, therefore, bring forward my proposals with a view to incorporating them in the Children Bill.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the course I am proposing will amount to a more thorough updating of the law on child pornography.  It is also capable of being given effect quickly in that the Children Bill is already before this House and its Committee Stage, on which I propose to move my amendments, is likely to take place early in the new year.  I hope the House agrees that the course I am proposing is the better one.  I know we all want to ensure that to the greatest extent possible steps are taken to outlaw all aspects of child pornography and, therefore, afford the greatest level of protection to vulnerable children.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Government is not opposing this Bill.  Ministers often announce they will not oppose legislation, but then they introduce their own Bills.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act is a typical example of where the Government brought in its own legislation which incorporated everything in the Fianna Fáil Bill.  I compliment Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue for introducing an extremely important and pertinent Bill.  Child pornography is lurid, disgusting, anti-social and a plague which must be eradicated.  We must legislate so that every nuance, detail and occurrence is removed from society.  In particular, <Col N="144" /> those involved must be held responsible.  We must impress on those who control the airwaves and print media and are involved in the importation of magazines that child pornography and exploitation is totally unacceptable in our society. We must ensure they are made aware that what they do damages children and that they must act in a positive manner.  Legislation on this issue must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that pornography, child abuse and paedophile rings are prevalent in many cities in this country.  I have a problem with channel 18 which is transmitted by a local television company in the Cork area on Friday and Saturday nights when parents are out socialising and their children are looked after by young babysitters.  The Minister is aware of the dangers that are inherent in houses where there are young children and babysitters.  There is a great deal of evidence to suggest young people flicking television channels at the weekend in Cork come across lurid and pornographic films with illicit sex scenes.  Some of these have been videotaped and in one instance the video was for sale in a school on the following Monday morning to other children.  We have made calls on the group in question to ensure such channels are not available so easily to young people and, unfortunately, they have gone unheeded.  It was suggested to us that a parental control box should be put in place but this could only be done at a cost to parents.</P>
      <P>The initial shock and revulsion over the paedophile outrages in Belgium have given way to urgent reflection.  That is important and welcome.  Everyone is now looking at how such rings can be prevented by greater national and international controls.  Attention has been focused on appropriate penalties and mandatory sentencing for such offenders and especially on the need for international controls on trade in child pornography and the sophisticated network which maintains and sustains it.  It is a loathsome crime dramatically illustrated by the Belgium experience through the horrific circumstances surrounding it.  There is no doubt much can be done if the political will exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People often ask us to distinguish between child abuse and paedophilia.  Child abuse victims respond to counselling, education and behavioural orientation.  Paedophilia is a more highly structured, even ideological system of belief, based on a serious argument that children consent to sexual involvement.  I was surprised and worried that at a conference during the summer in Cork Ms Mary Crilly of the Cork Rape Crisis Centre indicated we do not have to go outside Ireland to become aware of what is happening.  Within the Southern Health Board area the incidence of child abuse from 1990 to 1996 has trebled.  Ms Crilly said analysis by rape crisis centres found that a vast number of people are involved in this business in Ireland.  She said society appeared to be excusing paedophilia.  In <Col N="145" /> Ireland there was no body of research on the subject that she or her colleagues knew about.  If there is, why have the rape crisis centres not been asked for their views?  She further stated that the problem of paedophilia would have to be recognised for what it is.  Something would have to be done about it as children were not being listened to when it mattered most.  She particularly stressed that children had no voice when it came to pornography.  The rape crisis centres suggest they must be listened to and the increase they have indicated clearly illustrates that we have a major problem on our hands. Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue have brought this to our attention and it is important that it is addressed.  This Bill goes a long way in ensuring that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue stressed the problem with the Internet.  The best selling pornographic CD-ROMs are available at the push of a button on the Internet to those who wish to utilise the material which grossly exploits millions of vulnerable children around the world.  There is widespread abuse of the Internet and other electronic media by child pornographic users. This legislation proposes that indecent material including data stored on a computer disk should be outlawed.  Fianna Fáil has already introduced the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1996, to provide that Irish criminal law is extended to try sexual offences against children committed elsewhere by citizens of the State or by persons ordinarily resident in Ireland.  This means, for example, that any Irish resident who commits a sexual offence against a child in the Philippines or Thailand will be subjected to the rigours of Irish law.  There should be no escape route for any such sick individuals in our society.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations to Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue for introducing this important legislation.  I am surprised, yet not terribly disappointed, the Minister of State was so mealy mouthed and negative in regard to this.  Whatever else is not working in his Department, the word processor is because we have the same old line about flawed legislation which is impossible to amend.  How often have we heard that in the past year and a half?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about it and am able to talk with some authority on the matter.  The line that word processors should be outlawed in all Departments is so hackneyed that it is sickening when used in regard to such an important matter as the protection of our children from depraved people, people who bring a great deal of shame on everybody.  It is timely that Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan have <Col N="146" /> brought forward a measure to constrain people who involve themselves in this sordid activity. Society will support the House on this measure. The criminalisation of this activity is extremely important and the sentence imposed should be sufficiently severe to deal with the crime.</P>
      <P>This activity was brought home to us earlier this year with the Belgian experience.  Many people thank God this activity does not take place in Ireland, but it does.  A recent conference in Cork revealed startling statistics in that regard. A worldwide report suggested that as many as ten million children are enslaved in child prostitution, the sex industry, sex tourism and pornography. Those are shocking statistics.  Individuals who trade in and distribute grossly offensive material should be severely chastised.  The children involved are the most helpless in society.</P>
      <P>Despite having a very high standard of living, with an excellent economy, as late as last week a report revealed that in the past 12 months there was an increase of 150 per cent in the homeless, many of them children as young as 12 years of age, who roam the capital and other cities.  Those unfortunate children are the most labile in society and run the risk of involvement in paedophile rings, a regrettable section of society who regularly trade in pornographic material.  We must address these issues.  It is unacceptable for a Minister to abuse Deputies who bring forward positive legislation in this regard.  The children involved are crying out for help and it is a disservice to treat such depraved behaviour in a cynical way.</P>
      <P>At the conference in Cork it was stated that in terms of pornography children have no voice and often no choice.  We must ask ourselves what are we as legislators doing about this sordid activity. We have a responsibility to the children involved to introduce legislation to have the activity criminalised and outlawed.  To this end Fianna Fáil has produced this Bill to prohibit the possession, making of or trading in photographs, images or literature relating to children, or pornographic material.  As my colleague Deputy O'Keeffe said, that extends to videos.  The material in some videos on sale freely throughout the country is bestial and sickening, and the sooner we pass laws which will outlaw that type of activity the better.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed legislation people found guilty of having in their possession or under their control an indecent photograph or indecent material will be liable on summary conviction to severe terms of imprisonment.  We propose that people found guilty of taking, distributing or threatening to distribute, publish or advertise the availability of an indecent photograph of a child will be liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child pornography is no longer confined to what is termed the more traditional paper medium of magazines, leaflets and pamphlets.  As regards television, in the Cork area channel 18 is beamed into thousands of homes.  Many <Col N="147" /> responsible people have brought this matter to our attention and asked us to update legislation in this area.  Countries throughout the world have taken this matter in hand and updated legislation to ensure that videos, television, the Internet and CD-ROMs, vehicles used for this type of exploitation, are classed as indecent material. Data stored on computer disc or by any other means will be outlawed under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Bill and call on the Minister to take it seriously.  If amendments are necessary to strengthen it they will have the full support of the House.  It must be a priority not only of the Government but of the entire House that child pornography is criminalised without delay so that abusers are prevented from using child pornographic material to seduce children. We cannot allow that to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I pay tribute to my colleagues, Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan on their initiative in bringing this excellent Bill before the House.  They were successful in terms of the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill which was accepted by the Government and is awaiting signature by the President.  That team has been active in a legislative sense on a number of other issues.  I am somewhat surprised and disappointed that the Government did not have the generosity of spirit to accept this Bill and allow it to proceed to Committee Stage, where amendments to it could be made.  It is disgraceful that the Government should send the wrong signals to the country by not accepting this legislation.  The reasons advanced by the Minister do not justify the Government's stance.  The Minister's basis for rejecting the Bill is flawed and flimsy.  He advanced no fundamental core reason for not allowing the Bill to pass Second Stage in its present form.</P>
      <P>With the previous Government's acceptance of Private Members' Bills put forward by Deputy Shatter, I thought a new era had emerged in Irish politics in which Governments were becoming more amenable to accepting such Bills, irrespective of the hue of the Government or Opposition of the day.  Deputy Shatter's good work in his specialist area was accepted by the then Government.  This Administration continued that policy in accepting Bills put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue on his own and Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue together.  I think the reason for not accepting this Bill is that someone does not want the Deputies to notch up another success &mdash; it is as mean-spirited as that. An extra Bill would be too much because the record would look too good.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to lead on this issue. The Minister is right to say there are different needs in different countries and I would not be too confident in awaiting a joint initiative from the EU because I am not happy about the standards applying in other EU countries.  We cannot take a strong enough line against people who trade in child pornography, which is the same as abusing children.  We should send the strongest possible signal from this Legislature, irrespective of what happens in Europe, that we will deal harshly with anyone in possession of child pornography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be accepted if for no other reason than to send that signal.  As a Legislature, Opposition and Government could use Committee Stage to deal with amendments or improvements to the Bill.  There would be no difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that all we have done on the use of the Internet for child pornography is to set up an interdepartmental group.  An extraordinary feature of modern technology is that something which should be a tremendous educational tool is being used as a vehicle for promoting trade in child pornography and abuse.  We must urgently police the Internet and introduce legislation to protect children who use that technology from being exposed to this material.  Children should <Col N="149" /> have access to the Internet in schools but only under specific guidelines and controls with adult supervision at all times.  Technology is one of the most important aspects of this problem and it must be tackled.  Deputy Ryan represented us at the Stockholm world conference, which generated much of the momentum on this issue. We should not lose any more time in introducing legislation to criminalise child pornography, which is what this Bill does.  It criminalises the possession of pornographic material.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  I urge the Minister to read the Bill again.  The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill was accepted by the Government and sent a powerful signal from this Legislature.  It was well received internationally and did us no harm.  There is no good reason for not allowing this Bill, which concerns the rights of children, to pass Second Stage.  The Minister for Education introduced the Universities Bill to which she herself will propose about 30 amendments.  It is not a big issue to amend a Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is dragging its feet because it does not want to give too much credit to Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Ryan, who have been productive and effective on the legislative front and tackled issues of major public concern.  We <Col N="150" /> know from experiences in Belgium and this country that this is a top priority with the Irish people and they will not look favourably on the Government for giving such a negative reaction to a pro-active way of dealing with one of the most horrendous aspects of modern society, not only in Ireland but throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Practitioners and professionals in the education community are crying out for protective legislation.  We must put the needs and rights of our children at the top of the political agenda but I am not sure we are doing so in terms of bringing legislation before the House.  I am a great admirer of the work of Mr. Cian ó Tighearnaigh and the ISPCC, who have advanced the rights of children for many years.  This Bill endeavours to give primacy to the needs of the child, which should be uppermost in all our minds.  Particularly in this season of goodwill, we should put aside party politicking and the normal political jealousies and allow this Bill to go to Committee Stage, where I am sure Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Ryan will be more than generous in accepting Government amendments and improvements to the Bill.  They have proven to be so in the past, not least on the legislation to seize the assets of criminals, which was introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue and accepted by the Government under pressure.  It has turned out to be the most effective legislation against organised crime.  We can thank the Opposition parties for the introduction of that package, particularly the Bill, which is hurting the most in the criminal world. The Government should learn from that and accept the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was speaking about Part II of the Bill, specifically sections 3 and 10.  Section 3 states: &ldquo;No person shall place household waste into or near a litter receptacle&rdquo;.  That is a good provision.  This seems to happen in areas where there is an intensification of flats development, in houses with multiple occupancies and in areas where proper provision is not made for the storage of domestic refuse.  In such areas tenants tend to put <Col N="151" /> their domestic refuse in a plastic bag which they then put into a litter bin on the side of the street. That happens constantly in my city and I suspect in other cities also.  This problem must be tackled under this new legislation.</P>
      <P>I will be seeking to amend section 10 to put an obligation on the owners of houses that are divided into flats with multiple occupancies to make proper provision for the storage of domestic refuse within or at the rear of the building so that refuse can be kept there until it is presented in a proper fashion for collection by the municipal collection services.  That must be done if these two provisions in the Bill are to have any effect.</P>
      <P>On section 3, there is not an adequate number of litter bins in any of our cities, and that is confirmed by the litter survey.  We need to have more litter bins which must be strategically placed and properly managed and maintained. That is vitally important if we are to get litter off our streets.</P>
      <P>In respect of section 10 and the duties of landlords <i>vis-á-vis</i> those of tenants, the Bill, as currently drafted, puts the obligation on the landlord to ensure that the requirements of the Bill are met.  That is not the correct way to approach the problem I have outlined.  There must be joint responsibility between the landlord and the tenant.  There must be an obligation on the landlord to provide proper facilities for houses with multiple occupancy and if it can be demonstrated that the landlord failed to provide such facilities the penalty must then be on the landlord.  If the landlord makes proper provision, however, the obligation will have to be put on the tenant to comply with the requirements of the Bill.  I am talking about joint responsibility between landlord and tenant and I will attempt to be more specific about that on Committee Stage when I hope to table an amendment.  This is an important issue because there is a great deal of litter in areas where there is a large number of flats.  I know that because I live in such an area.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to plastic bags and cans and the fact that we will have to get co-operation from the commercial sector.  I spoke to somebody a short while ago who told me she was in Italy during the summer.  In Italy people pay the equivalent of 50p for a plastic bag in which to take home their shopping.  That is a good way of dealing with the problem.  If people had to pay 50p for a plastic bag they would do what our grandmothers did when they went shopping, namely, bring their own bags with them.  In the past, the shopping bag was a permanent item hanging on the hall stand and people would take it with them when they went shopping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That idea might not be practical, however, when one considers the volume of groceries now being bought from supermarkets, but we must use some monetary mechanism to reduce significantly the number of plastic bags that issue from our supermarkets.  Plastic bags are major pollutants. <Col N="152" /> They remain in the soil for years, clogging up our water courses and distorting the flow of our rivers and streams.  They remain in sanitary landfills for years because they are not biodegradable.  They are a major element in pollution and in the accumulation of waste and we must think of ways to reduce the use of plastic bags.  I will table an amendment in that regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My party will be seeking to amend a number of other areas on Committee Stage.  We have the bones of a good, but not a great, Bill.  I hope by the time it has gone through Committee Stage we will all put forward our best ideas to make this Bill succeed where its antecedent, the 1982 Bill, failed.  Litter is a serious problem and there is an obligation on us to work on an all-party basis to put in place the best procedures and resources to ensure that the legislation is enforced and fully implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  Obviously I would prefer if it were not necessary to introduce legislation in this area but, given the attitude of some members of the public, the legislation was inevitable.  The Bill is to be welcomed and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.  If those of us in the public arena play our part it will bring about an improvement in the litter problem that currently exists.</P>
      <P>The central purpose of the Bill is to enable more effective arrangements to be made for the prevention and control of litter so as to achieve a cleaner outdoor environment.  In the past, much lip service was paid to Ireland's green image.  The National Development Plan emphasised the opportunity for competitive advantage offered by Ireland's green reputation in the promotion, in particular, of agriculture, food and tourism.  A sound environment is the country's natural resource base but it must be sustainable.  The anti national and greedy attitude of a very small number of people has put our agricultural base and green food image at risk in recent times.  I hope this small group can be identified and their activities stopped.</P>
      <P>We are collectively putting the potential growth and job creation possibilities of our tourism industry at risk by our attitude to litter. If one goes to countries such as Switzerland and Austria, for example, one sees the marked differences between this State and their towns, cities and countryside and their attitude to litter. People there have pride in their country, which is something we must build in this country; we must have pride in our gardens, roads, beaches, parks, cities and towns.  I hope this Bill will awaken people's sense of patriotism and community spirit, for which we were renowned in the past when the chips were down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the provisions of the Bill is to require all local authorities to prepare a litter management plan.  The Bill also proposes that the preparation of these plans will require local consultation and their adoption will be a reserved <Col N="153" /> function of elected councillors.  I greatly welcome this aspect of the Bill, particularly as local elected members rightly complain of the undue centralisation of our local government system.  If this Bill is to succeed it is imperative that the elected members accept their responsibility, in co-operation with the officials, as outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Bill, we must start by acknowledging that a major litter problem exists here which, if not adequately dealt with, will have knock-on implications, particularly in regard to job creation in the tourism industry.  We have already been told that over two thirds of tourists visiting Ireland feel that action needs to be taken to tackle the problem of litter.  In any plan we must be able to first, identify the nature and extent of the litter problem; second, assess the shortcomings in any existing prevention and control system in operation; third, define our requirements for cleanliness in public places; and fourth, define what needs to be done to achieve these standards and monitor them on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there is a major problem with the discarding of wrappers and plastic bags, which have recently become synonymous with most supermarkets.  This problem is more acute in built up areas, particularly near fast food outlets, take-aways, bus stops, schools, shops and commercial enterprises.  There is also a problem with fly tipping in ditches and drains, particularly in rural areas.  Sometimes this occurs on the way to domestic tip heads, which is hard to believe.</P>
    <P>Old motor vehicles comprise another form of litter.  In the past this was predominantly a rural problem.  However, in recent years it has also become a major problem in urban areas, arising from joyriding and the subsequent burning of cars.  In this regard there should be an obligation on local authorities to remove these vehicles from the landscape as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As a member of the public I am utterly appalled at the litter problems associated with refuse collection.  The presentation of domestic refuse left out for collection is totally inadequate in many cases.  There is a need for greater consultation between the local authorities and residents.  I know that in many cases, although not all, it is necessary for some residents to leave their refuse out overnight.  However, the net effect of this is that refuse bags are ravaged by dogs and other animals and the rubbish is strewn over paths and roads by the time the refuse collection takes place the following morning.  There is a need for consultation between the local authorities and those who find themselves in this position.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives specific power to local authorities.  I am very angry that different departments within some local authorities do not co-ordinate their actions.  For example, the roads and paths in some housing estates are cleaned by a mechanical sweeper the day before the refuse <Col N="154" /> collection takes place.  Is that not utterly appalling?  It is common sense that such activity should be co-ordinated and I hope the action plans referred to in the Bill will address this matter.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the Minister to address the type of covering required for trucks and commercial vehicles.  It is totally unacceptable that such vehicles are allowed to travel through our cities, towns and villages with makeshift covering.  Apart from being a danger to members of the public using the roads, it is also a health hazard.  It is appalling to see refuse falling from the side of vehicles being driven to tip heads.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give the Garda Síochána the power to act against environmentally unfriendly business people.  Residing in a seaside resort, I am appalled at the amount of litter that is left behind on beaches during the summer months notwithstanding that bins are available and cleaned on a regular basis.  I wish to compliment the management and staff of my local authority, Fingal County Council, on providing litter bins and on the regular daily beach cleaning carried out during the summer.  It is no coincidence that a number of seaside towns have won blue flag awards.  It is hoped that many more will do so in the coming years.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill I congratulate the Tidy Towns committees on the fantastic work they are doing throughout the country.  Since it was established nearly 40 years ago, the Tidy Towns competition has become a huge success.  It now attracts nearly 700 entries from villages and towns.  The competition has given the initiative to local community activists to become involved in improving the appearance and tidiness of their towns and villages.  A community spirit has been built up, and I compliment all concerned.  I also wish to compliment the various local authorities who have set up their own tidy district awards within their jurisdictions.  These awards encourage people to be involved in a small way in the estates where they reside and bring up their children.  Often those who go on to do well in national awards began in this very small way.  The Fingal tidy district awards are presented in several categories &mdash; large, small and medium estates, factory fronts, thatched cottages, school grounds etc. &mdash; and the competition is healthy in all categories.  We want to further build on this type of healthy competition which is necessary. The army of volunteers, although generally small in number, bring about improvements annually. Derelict areas are turned into areas of beauty.  It is my belief that the Tidy Towns awards and the Tidy Districts competitions should put more emphasis on the absence of litter in assessing results.  We are most fortunate that volunteers are prepared to go out in all weathers to keep their streets, estates, villages and towns not only tidy but renewed and interesting.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the towns of Malahide, Lusk and Skerries are synonymous with tidiness. I am particularly proud of the results achieved <Col N="155" /> by Swords this year which has special difficulties because of the high rate of residential development in the town.  With the growing public awareness of the awards won by these towns and other towns throughout the country in recent years, visitors and local residents are conscious of the lack of litter, and they will bin their litter rather than throw it on the street or beach.  That is the spirit we must build up. Notwithstanding this, people wreak havoc on the efforts of the volunteer force on Saturday or Sunday nights.  If you walk through many towns on a Sunday or Monday morning you will see a disgusting heap of rubbish outside fast food and take-away restaurants.  It is no secret where this rubbish comes from.  The businesses are there for all to see.  Under the Bill not only litter wardens but the Garda Síochána will have power to take action in this regard.  I hope that will be enforced. I would be pleased if this Bill did nothing else but make the owners of these premises liable for some of the costs of cleaning the streets, and I hope the increased penalties will be applied.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have an ongoing public awareness campaign promoting education on litter prevention and greater public participation in the control of litter.  Schools, both first and second level, should be targeted in highlighting the litter problem and the assistance of school children sought to promote an anti-litter culture in the home and in public.  We should also involve businesses and the community.  The local authority would be the appropriate body to set this up.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by the sponsorship of litter bins by businesses in villages and towns throughout the country and hope this can be developed in the future.  The Estate Management Bill, which the Minister will be introducing, will have a major input in local estates.  We must all work together to ensure that a litter free green environment image is built up.  We must work to change our attitude because in doing so we can create jobs and provide a better environment for our people and future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While successive Governments have endeavoured to tackle the problem of litter through legislation over the past number of years, we still have a long way to go before we can honestly say we have overcome this problem.  Some would suggest that the situation in our country is a national scandal which affects tourists and tourism and also gives us a bad name abroad.  For this to change, there must be a radical turnabout in the public's attitude to litter.  It would be consoling to think that the litter problem we are experiencing is the work of a minority, but the reality is different.  There seems to be a widespread indifference to the problem of litter. It would be easy, and wrong, to say that the problem is created by the young.  Any fair-minded <Col N="156" /> individual knows that many adults are also to blame in this respect.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us repeals the Litter Act, 1982, which in itself was seen at the time as revolutionary, I welcome the fact that it will strengthen sections of the current Act.  To say that the previous Act was unenforceable or that there was no commitment by local authorities or statutory bodies would be correct.  The law needed strengthening.  The enactment of stronger legislation cannot come quickly enough.  A radical approach will have to be adopted by Government to improve the litter problem and ensure a cleaner and more enjoyable environment for everybody.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the positive and worthwhile amendments which we may put forward on Committee Stage to improve the effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been a noticeable improvement in some areas of littering over the years.  Following the enactment of the 1982 Bill, the problem of disused and abandoned cars and vehicles, which were a common sight throughout the country, was tackled.  However, there are areas where the problem of littering has not improved but worsened and this will not change unless firm action is taken.</P>
    <P>The litter problem is especially bad in urban areas, and the bigger the area the worse the problem.  It is greatest where people congregate for entertainment and recreational purposes, whether they be scenic areas, picnic areas or beaches &mdash; littering of drinks canisters, consumer debris, plastic bags, tins and glass.</P>
    <P>Roadside dumping of rubbish in suburban areas, on the outskirts of towns and in parts of the countryside is now a major problem which we must do our best to solve and any legislation which improves the ability of authorities to take corrective action is to be welcomed.  The entire community suffers when our environment is degraded.  More people are inclined to litter when they see that there is little, if any, action.</P>
    <P>One of the commonest complaints by foreigners and tourists is the extent of the litter problem.  This must be tackled at local level and local authorities should be the principal agents for addressing it.  I am pleased that the Bill provides a major role for them.  They have been given insufficient resources to implement current legislation.</P>
    <P>Parents, teachers and schools have an important role to play in educating and encouraging our young to be litter conscious.  Far more children are aware of the environmental impact than their parents.  However, the problem will not be overcome solely by legislation or by giving local authorities increased powers; it will only be overcome when people decide that they prefer a clean environment.  In this regard, the influence of parents, schools and community organisations in pursuing their own initiatives and in supporting and complementing the efforts of statutory bodies is of great importance.  While advertising campaigns, on radio and television <Col N="157" /> and in the national print media, have focused minds on the problem, greater effort is required to ensure that it becomes socially unacceptable to litter public places.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made to encourage waste recycling, although it is a complex, costly and uncertain business.  However, this is not a local authority function.  Indeed, because of the constraints under which they must work, local authorities cannot be expected to commit public funds to costly recovery schemes of doubtful viability.  The Department of the Environment should make grants and assistance available to those involved in the recycling business in the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note the number of bottle and paper banks that have been made available by local authorities on their sites.  This is a move in the right direction.  The value of scrap metal has ensured that it is now the exception rather than the rule to see abandoned vehicles on roadsides.  Commercial realities dictate that they be recycled.</P>
    <P>It takes little effort for individuals to avoid littering by putting their rubbish in a bin taking it home or to a dump.  Once litter is discarded the cost to local authorities of collection and disposal is substantial.  They have a duty to take measures to prevent, reduce and remove litter, but because of the numerous demands on their resources it is not possible for them to implement existing legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on business and property owners to keep the public area surrounding their properties litter free and I am glad to see that they will be held responsible for this under the Bill.  How many times have we travelled through towns and seen the disgraceful sight of sections of streets littered with paper, plastic cups and cartons from nearby take-away premises?  How many times have we seen the areas around mobile food outlets at sporting grounds and musical events littered because of the failure to provide suitable bins and refuse sacks?  It is reasonable to expect that those engaged in this type of business should be responsible for keeping the footpaths and their immediate environs free of litter.  Under existing legislation, local authorities have the power to make by-laws requiring occupiers, or specified classes of occupiers, or those in specified areas, to keep their immediate environs as litter free as possible. The proposed measures in this Bill will enhance the provisions of the 1982 legislation.</P>
    <P>The provision for erecting &ldquo;no litter&rdquo; signs is ineffective.  I also question the effectiveness of the on the spot system of fines for littering offences. The prosecution of litter offenders through the courts is costly and time consuming for local authorities.  However, if given adequate publicity they would deter and focus the minds of those prone to litter.</P>
    <P>There is a general responsibility on occupiers to keep the areas around their premises litter free.  When this Bill is enacted, the relevant <Col N="158" /> authorities must ensure that local authorities are aware of their responsibilities to the public.  They will be obliged, as far as practicable, to keep public roads free of litter.  I pass a lay-by three times a week on the main Dublin-Cork road in the local authority area of Kildare.  There appears to be no effort to provide for litter bins or other means of litter disposal for the motorists, and especially truckers, who use it.  I have indicated my disgust to the local authority.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I ask that the Committee Stage amendments which we will introduce to strengthen it be accepted.</P>

      <P>I welcome the initiative by my party spokesperson which was so important in bringing this Bill to fruition.  My party's deputy spokesperson, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has listened to all contributions in the House.  In this regard I am annoyed that the Minister for the Environment did not see fit to introduce this legislation, but rather handed it over to the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State for having to introduce this important legislation.  Were it not for a man from my constituency, Tom Kavanagh of Fermoy, who thought up the initiative and brought Irish business people and the major industrialists in the food area together, this legislation would not have seen the light of day.  This legislation is very important.  If we do not have clean towns and villages we will not have clean food.  That was the reason he laid the foundation and put his money where his mouth is in calling the meeting and taking the initiative.  That is something that cannot be forgotten.  The Minister would do well to refer to him in the closing Stages of the debate.</P>
      <P>The Litter Act, 1982, is now being repealed because its provisions were not implemented. According to press reports Dublin Corporation employs three litter wardens.  Assuming they work only from Monday to Friday and avoid what one might call &ldquo;good litter days&rdquo;&mdash; Saturday shopping and Sunday sporting features &mdash; they could work 240 days each year.  Assuming that 40 of these days are spent in court giving evidence, that would leave 200 days to carry out the fulltime duties of a litter warden.  I am sure it would not be difficult to find somebody in breach of the 1982 Litter Act before lunch and another person or body after lunch, making a total of 400 cases a year but the reported rate was only one per week. Clearly it would be wrong to apportion blame to the litter wardens.  Those who employ them and who are responsible should explain the lack of activity and results in this area.  The 1982 Act might not be perfect but there were fines &mdash; perhaps they were too low &mdash; and opportunities to avail of the legislative powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that legislation coming before the House would appear to suggest that something is happening when much of the <Col N="159" /> legislation it updates or replaces has not been implemented.  On the basis that the Minister for the Environment will apply his talents and energies to ensuring that the powers he is now requesting will be vigorously implemented, I welcome and support the legislation.  This Bill is undoubtedly a better model than its predecessor but I hope it is implemented with the same drive that was shown by the Minister's county championship team.</P>
    <P>I remember walking to school with class mates whose families were experiencing financial difficulties.  Although they could not afford new clothes and footwear they were always clean and tidy, thanks to their hard working mothers and their family pride.  Since we have become more affluent we have lost some of that pride.  The Tidy Towns Competition run by Bórd Fáilte has done a tremendous amount of good.  Nonetheless many of our towns and villages fail in terms of tidiness by comparision with towns and villages less than one hour's flying time from here.  Why?  We are more intelligent and imaginative and we describe ourselves as a proud race.  We sell ourselves abroad as being a clean and idyllic land backed by photographs of traffic free roads and litter free beaches.  It is time we lived up to our advertising. In our debate today on the Supplementary Estimate for Tourism and Trade, the Minister, Deputy Kenny, gave a resumé of the country's future requirements.</P>
    <P>It does not cost anything to be clean.  While litter is a problem, there are other areas which must be tackled.  Food hygiene and sanitary facilities also require attention.  Pollution in its various forms is worse than litter.  When she was in office Deputy Harney showed what could be done by dedication, initiative and hard work in cleaning up Dublin's smog.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about a marriage.  If anything I said is incorrect the Deputy has a right to reply and I have no doubt he has the capacity to do that.  When I was a member of the farming organisations the Deputy always reminded me of where my allegiance lay.</P>
      <P>The Litter Pollution Bill could be enforced much more effectively if it was part of a concerted national campaign to restore cleanliness to and pride in our land.  To that end I suggest a unit comprising elements of the Department, the Department of Health, the various health boards and local authorities be set up and co-ordinated by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, if somebody was taking an action about litter outside a premises it would be no harm if that person inspected the lavatories and kitchen at the same time.  When visiting our <Col N="160" /> lovely bars dotted around the country &mdash; admiring the character and quaintness of these premises &mdash; many tourists are appalled on discovering that the lavatories on the premises have a character and quaintness that ensure they would not wish to return.</P>
    <P>This legislation put a huge onus on county councils.  As a member of Cork County Council I welcome the increased powers being granted to local authorities.  Cork County Council will not shirk the extra burden and responsibility.  It is wrong and unfair to impose burdens on local authorities without providing adequate financing. This is a key to the success of the Bill.  Outside Dublin local authorities are collecting service charges as an important source of revenue. Current rumours, rightly or wrongly, attributed to the Taoiseach, about the abolition of the service charges do nothing to help the collection of this source of revenue.</P>
    <P>My colleagues will be proposing amendments to the legislation.  When the Minister is given these powers, I hope he will avail of them.  I wish him well.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate debate on tourism I was impressed by the Minister, Deputy Kenny, who spoke about his visit to Singapore and said that the offence of graffiti on the walls and littering carries three year sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and assure Deputy O'Keeffe that the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, is capable of dealing with the Bill.  She showed an understanding of urban renewal issues and the need for tidy towns when she visited my constituency of Monaghan some time ago.  I am satisfied she can cope with any questions the Deputy or his colleagues may wish to raise.</P>
      <P>As emphasised in the Minister's speech there is a need for partnership between business, local authorities and voluntary groups.  As an island we pride ourselves on the green image we project abroad.  We use our green image to sell our farm products: 80 per cent of all our milk and beef has to be sold in European or third countries.  It is extremely important that we live and work in a tidy environment.</P>
      <P>The litter problem is of particular relevance to the tourism industry.  At a committee meeting today the Minister for Tourism and Trade referred to the importance of the tourism industry.  It is our second largest industry and it may become the largest.  The problem of litter outside late night restaurants and take-aways must be dealt with immediately.  In this respect, the owners of these premises must be subject to much more scrutiny.  It is very difficult for local authorities to collect the rubbish outside these premises late at night.  The owners of these premises earn a significant income and they must play a more active role in collecting this litter. The provision of bottle banks, etc., is very important but there is a need for more litter bins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm relief service proposes to establish <Col N="161" /> structures for the collection of the black plastic used to cover silage bales and plastic fertiliser bags.  This plastic causes serious litter problems and takes from the beauty of the countryside. Shabra Plastics in Castleblayney produces high quality bags for many shopping centres. Previously this product was imported.  I thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for putting in place a grant system under which a sum of £73,000 was allocated to Shabra Plastics for the installation of new machinery for the processing of this very important by-product.</P>
    <P>Poultry and mushroom production in County Monaghan accounts for two-thirds of the national figure and there is huge potential for further development in these sectors.  The Minister for the Environment and his colleagues must avail of the opportunity to deal with the litter problem which, in turn, creates serious pollution problems. Grant aid must be provided for the setting up of a power station which uses litter to produce power. There are two such power stations in England and they can supply electricity to approximately 15,000 households.  The Departments of the Environment and Tourism and Trade have an important role to play in setting up such a power station here, thereby showing our commitment to resolving the litter and pollution problems.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Tidy Towns Competition.  Carrickmacross is an example of what can be achieved by an active committee.  It is no longer a mediocre town but is one of the better places in which to live.  The Tidy Towns development groups.  FÁS and the local authorities have made tremendous progress in improving towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure a cleaner and better environment at a low cost and provide benefits for the public.  It will also benefit the tourism and agriculture industries in that we will be able to promote our clean, green environment and high quality food products.  When the BSE scare is over, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, should allocate funding for the promotion of the agricultural industry to ensure the highest quality food continues to be produced.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  She is more than capable of dealing with all the problems to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, who has a personal interest in this matter, on introducing the Bill.  While the Bill will do nothing but good, there is no point enacting it without strong, workable enforcement measures. If the law is not enforced it will be brought into disrepute and it is essential to put in place strong enforcement structures which are followed up from the start and which allow no exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Bill will be different from the existing law in terms of enforcement.  The fine of £25 should have been increased.  We cannot rely on the Garda to enforce the legislation.  Legally we should not see <Col N="162" /> noxious weeds, yet during the spring and summer we see fields of weeds, particularly the yellow buachallán, in all areas.  Gardaí are trained to prevent crime, not to act as litter wardens.  Extra burdens are being placed on gardaí.  For example, calls have been made for them to be put back on the streets so that they will know what is happening while, at the same time, they have to deal with the drugs problem and protect the elderly.  They will not be able to play a meaningful role in the enforcement of the litter law.</P>
    <P>The only way this legislation can operate effectively is to impose stiff fines, even stiffer than those proposed by the Minister, and enforce them from the outset.  The softly, softly approach, education and awareness and appeals for good citizenship have been tried but to no avail.  We must make it unprofitable for the polluter and profitable for local authorities, who are much more vigilant in imposing parking fines since it became possible for them to make money from it.  The same could apply in respect of litter fines. We must also ensure that litter wardens or gardaí do not get entangled in the courts system when trying to enforce fines.</P>
    <P>The concept of tidiness should be ingrained in people's minds.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State for the initiatives she has adopted in respect of our villages.  When villages are enhanced the local community is less likely to litter.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Chicago the Cook County police explained how they operate a system where people found guilty of a crime are given the option of doing community work and cleaning up areas instead of going to prison.  They must also pay £10 per day to cover the capital cost involved in the scheme.  As a result large sections of the city are being cleaned up at no cost to the city and the people who would be in prison are satisfied with their part of the deal.  That scheme is working successfully in Chicago.</P>
    <P>We should also pay tribute to the work done through the Tidy Towns Competition, the original means of ingraining an element of tidiness into the minds of our citizens.  I hope the Minister and Bord Fáilte make every effort to ensure that scheme does not lose its impetus.</P>
    <P>I come from Sligo, which I am sure most people would agree is one of our greatest beauty spots. However, we are no better or worse than our counterparts in other counties when it comes to litter.  There appears to be a greater appreciation of the value of tidiness north of the Border. Irrespective of whether this is the product of education, major incentives or the mentality of the people there, areas north of the Border are tidier than in the south.</P>
    <P>One of the favourite places for abandoning old cars is the bogs in the west, our new areas of natural heritage and conservation.  We should appoint a task force with responsibility for removing such cars and introduce laws to prevent that type of dumping.</P>
    <P>I sound a note of warning to the Minister about <Col N="163" /> the provisions in section 6 which deal with the duties of occupiers, etc., regarding litter.  This will lead to major difficulties.  How will people living next door to take-away restaurants react when they come out in the morning and find the footpaths outside their premises covered with litter?  This provision will cause major difficulties between neighbours unless it is carefully worded. A large proportion of litter originates in take-away restaurants and people living next door to such premises will not take kindly to being asked to clean up their litter.</P>
    <P>Tourism will soon be our greatest industry and local communities are making great efforts to attract more tourists to their areas and keeping our areas free from litter might be more valuable than any other endeavour.  I welcome the imaginative initiatives adopted by the Minister of State in respect of our towns and villages, but it is disastrous to see them ruined by litter louts. Many of us are responsible for littering because of a lack of awareness about the concept of tidiness.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister's work and wish her well.  This legislation will be a major advance, provided it is rigorously enforced from the outset; otherwise it will be a useless new law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nealon referred to the tidiness and cleanliness that is apparent when one crosses the Border.  The house reconstruction grant scheme means there are very few derelict houses in the North.  Substantial grants are available for the repair of houses there.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give serious consideration to reintroducing the house improvements grants scheme here.  We are all aware of houses that lack basic comforts and sanitary facilities and are in need of reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nealon and myself frequently use the N16 which takes people from the west to County Fermanagh.  I accept this does not relate to the legislation before us, but as it comes within the Minister of State's brief, I appeal to her, as other Deputies have done, to provide funding to upgrade that road which has seen a huge increase in the volume of traffic since 1 September 1994.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with that terrain and I hope her Department will give the matter favourable consideration.  Deputy Nealon and other Oireachtas Members representing Cavan-Monaghan and Sligo-Leitrim would like funding provided to facilitate the huge volume of traffic between the North and the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the Bill is defective, I welcome it as a measure to highlight the litter problem throughout the country.  All its aspirations are commendable.  Other speakers stated it is necessary to create a greater awareness of the problem.  Proper enforcement procedures and the allocation of necessary resources to local authorities are also required.  It is essential that there should be a greater awareness of the <Col N="164" /> problems associated with litter.  The litter problem can be tackled effectively with little additional expenditure.  Legislation alone will not slove it, it will help, but public awareness of the large-scale damage caused by litter is essential. We must create the proper civic spirit to overcome the small local obstacles.  Small problems associated with dumping at local level amount to a large problem nationally.  I do not support the idea that every country's environment except ours is pristine clean.  I have not been fortunate enough to travel the world, but I have travelled throughout Europe and I have seen litter on the streets and main thoroughfares of plenty of cities and towns, of which no one could be proud.</P>
    <P>The fact that we need additional legislation to tackle the litter problem demonstrates clearly the inadequacy of our civic pride.  Litter and dumping are damaging to many facets of our economic and social life.  As Deputies Ó Cúiv and Crawford stated, our food and tourism sectors come to mind when one considers the litter problem.  Too often we hear complaints about litter in rural and urban Ireland made by concerned citizens on radio programmes.  The issue is frequently mentioned by visitors from abroad and by people who visit other parts of the country.  The problem is not confined to urban areas.  All too often pockets of dumping are found in many isolated rural areas.  The dumping of vehicles and major items of refuse in country lanes, boglands and lowlands is an increasing phenomenon. Enforcement of the legislation must be effective. Local authorities must be given the necessary regulations and resources to deal with the issue. I was surprised to learn that £25 million each year is spent cleaning up Ireland.  One must question the value we are getting for that expenditure.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dempsey said, the results of a survey carried out by Irish Business Against Litter highlight the problems and costs caused by litter.  Those findings speak for themselves.  Two out of every three adults identify takeaways as the location where litter is most likely to be found.  Only 10 per cent of adults believe litter laws are being enforced; only 5 per cent would resist tougher enforcement of litter laws; 80 per cent believe a litter free Ireland would be useful in attracting more foreign companies into this country; 70 per cent believe it would improve the image of our food industry and create more jobs at home and 78 per cent believe the laws should be enforced more strongly.  Those statistics speak loudly about our litter problem.</P>
    <P>For a number of years Cavan County Council ran an annual competition confined to primary schools to create awareness among the school-going population of the damage caused by litter and the success that could be achieved in local parishes through awareness of the problem and giving people an incentive to do something about it.  Prizes were awarded annually for various projects including cleaning up the local graveyard, a local facility or the village generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> The Departments of Education and Foreign Affairs run an essay competition confined to schools on the future development of Europe etc., and the school that wins gets a valuable prize, a visit to the European Parliament and Commission.  It would be worthwhile for the Department to run a competition in association with the Department of Education.  Schools could be allotted projects and worthwhile prizes could be given to the winners.  It is essential that the civic pride necessary to keep our country in the state in which it should be kept is instilled in children in primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Tidy Towns committees have undertaken valuable work.  In my county Ballyconnell, Ballyjamesduff and Virginia have won that competition twice.  That success was due to the work of a small number of people in those towns who may have got up at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. to clear litter and who tended to the flowers and plants. It created a great awareness among the local people of the usefulness and effectiveness of having a town in pristine condition.  That competition put those small towns on the map.  It is always a source of great pride to local people to have a plaque denoting that their town won a national award.  Great credit is due to the work of Tidy Towns committees.  The Department held a presentation night in my county recently for the north-eastern region winners.  I could not attend because of other commitments, but the local people present were very impressed by the attitude of Department officials.</P>
    <P>It has been rightly mentioned that plastic bags strewn around the country contribute to the litter problem.  On a number of occasions during Question Time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was asked if a national cleanup could be organised, particularly of black refuse bags associated with silage fodder.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes have been crucial in providing people to carry out worthwhile community work, cleaning local public buildings, facilities, graveyards or tidying the streets of towns and villages.  For many participants work on such schemes constituted their first job and it was the first time they received a cheque for doing a day's work.  Too often participants who spent two years on them have had to be let go.  I know it can be argued that others, who never had a chance to participate on them, are on the waiting list.  Far too often a person who was the guiding light and took a great personal interest in a project has had to come off a scheme having completed two years on it. Schemes, such as community employment schemes, that are valuable to local communities should be flexible enough to cater for the person whose leadership role in such projects is necessary.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me recently that our inland waterways should also merit blue flag status. Some people with great commitment, an enormous amount of time and much of their own finance have undertaken trojan work <Col N="166" /> endeavouring to combat the pollution of Lough Sheelin and many of our major inland waterways. Perhaps the Minister of State and her officials would consider granting inland waterways some recognition as they are vital to tourism in the midlands and north midlands region.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will favourably consider the amendments tabled by my party to strengthen the enforcement procedures of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I represent the beautiful western county of Sligo, where we are proud of the cleanliness and blue flag status of many of our beaches.  However, much more can be done to eliminate litter on our beaches, roadsides, towns and villages.</P>
      <P>Our schools' curricula, beginning at primary level, should educate our children about the damaging effects of litter and the need for its elimination in our beautiful countryside.  I once observed children throwing litter out the windows of a school touring bus.  If from the onset of their schooling our children are educated to respect their environment and beautiful countryside, they will be less inclined to destroy them with litter. Others have referred to fast food outlets, or take-aways, the site of much litter.  A number of litter bins should be located outside such outlets as repositories for papers and other food containers.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte contend that in its survey of many towns and villages in rural areas litter constitutes one of its greatest problems, especially in the context of the Tidy Towns competition, which invariably leads to the subtraction of many points from their merits.</P>
      <P>Tourism will continue to be one of our largest revenue earners.  In recent years I have observed many more tourists in County Sligo where the slogan is &ldquo;Sligo is Surprising&rdquo;.  Heretofore not as many people visited Sligo as, say, Galway, Mayo or the west generally, tending to travel through the county only en route to Donegal.  We are indeed glad they are discovering our county, its beautiful beaches and lakes which reminds me of Yeats' beautiful poem: I will arise and go now and go to Inisfree and a small cabin build there... I should indeed like to see such beautiful parts of our county litter-free.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brendan Smith referred to participants in the community employment scheme who have done tremendous work cleaning our towns and villages, demolishing and rebuilding derelict houses, building stone walls, making our many rural areas ever more beautiful.  Under this scheme also many litter bins have been located at appropriate locations, another step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remembering that tourism will continue to represent our greatest industry in future years, I have observed many European cities, some very clean, others not so clean.  Once one crosses the Border from Sligo into counties Leitrim, Cavan or Fermanagh one immediately notices the difference, particularly between Blacklion and <Col N="167" /> Cavan into Enniskillen which is abundantly cleaner.  Local authorities must endeavour to make more funds available to keep our towns, villages and roadsides free of litter and, until such time as they do, we shall continue to encounter this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this much sought Bill, on Committee Stage of which I hope provision will be made requiring local authorities to employ litter wardens in all urban and rural areas.  I represent one of the most beautiful towns in the west, Westport, which this year won the county and province award in addition to County Mayo being awarded the greatest number of blue flag beaches.  However, on RTE radio the evening of that announcement, most comment focused not so much on those towns and counties that had gained blue flag beach status as on those that had lost it.  I was glad to note County Mayo had been awarded the highest number of blue flag beaches, which alone speaks for its immense beauty.</P>
      <P>Within the time available to me, I intended to refer to fast food outlets or take-aways, the disturbance their clientele create at night and the enormous amount of litter distributed on the streets outside.  We must control their opening hours and make them responsible for the litter outside their premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency's criteria for the identification of schools in designated areas of disadvantage was the basis for the selection of schools to participate in the Breaking the Cycle scheme.  In the foreward to the report, Educational Disadvantage in Ireland, the Combat Poverty Agency states:</P>
      <P>Education has a central role to play in improving the life chances of young people today.  This is particularly the case for young people coming from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Children who have been born into poor households or live in deprived areas are most subject to educational failure and subsequent labour market exclusion.  ...Poor educational achievement can lead to low confidence levels and a poor sense of morale and self-confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The likelihood of obtaining qualifications is associated with social background; those from disadvantaged backgrounds constitute the majority of those with no or low qualifications. Thus, to improve the life chances of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, equal access to education and equal opportunities to participate in and benefit from education are <Col N="168" /> not sufficient.  Positive discrimination is required to ensure at least fairness, if not equality, in outcomes.  ...Poverty is about exclusion, isolation, and powerlessness, as well as material poverty.  Poverty affects both urban and rural communities.  Unequal distribution of resources and opportunities is the main reason for the relatively high level of poverty in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the heading <i>Rural Disadvantage</i>, the report states:</P>
    <P>It appears that about 60% of pupils defined as disadvantaged under the criteria adopted in this report live in rural areas.  It may be assumed that the vast majority of them are in the 50% of primary schools which do not have the services of a remedial teacher.  Further, the Early Start project is confined to urban areas and less than one pupil in twenty living in a rural area is in a school designated under the Scheme of Assistance for primary schools. Thus, the access of the rural disadvantaged to schemes for disadvantaged pupils appears grossly unequal.  It may even be that the lack of access to these schemes contributes to the high level of disadvantage in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In view of these statements, it is extraordinary that the Breaking the Cycle scheme discriminates against pupils in the disadvantaged rural schools, which have been selected to participate in this pilot scheme, <i>vis-á-vis</i> those in the disadvantaged urban schools which have also been selected for the scheme.  The scheme states that the pupil teacher ratio in urban national schools shall not be more than 1:15.  In the case of Our Lady Immaculate National School in Darndale, County Dublin &mdash; an urban disadvantaged national school &mdash; the number of teachers will, I understand, be increased from 17 to 29 to meet the terms of the scheme.  However, because the 1:15 ratio does not apply in rural schools, the pupil teacher ratio in Letterfrack national school, County Galway, which is also in the scheme, remains at 1:30.  Due to a small decline in numbers recently, the number of teachers has been reduced from four to three.  Had the urban disadvantaged national schools criteria been applied equally to rural schools, the number of teachers at Letterfrack national school would have been increased from four to seven.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education stated that it based the Breaking the Cycle scheme on the criteria set out in the report of the Education Research Centre, yet that report does not recommend that a pupil teacher ratio differential of this magnitude should apply between urban and rural disadvantaged schools.  There is no educational or philosophical reason for this deliberate discrimination against rural disadvantaged schools and one is forced to come to the conclusion that the reason for discrimination must be political.  The least that pupils in disadvantaged schools are entitled to is equality <Col N="169" /> of treatment under such a scheme, whether their school is located in an urban or a rural area. However, that is not the case under this scheme. Children in second class in a disadvantaged school in an urban area, for example, will now have the advantage of one teacher per class which will consist of no more than 15 pupils.  However, in a rural school 30 children from four different classes, beginning with junior infants, will sit together in the same classroom and be taught by one teacher.</P>
    <P>This scheme was designed to deal with disadvantage.  However, in the case of rural schools it seems to perpetuate the disadvantage rather than taking a serious step to remove it. Why is there discrimination?  Surely it cannot be justified on any grounds?  Will the Minister for Education alter the rules now so that urban and rural schools receive equal treatment under this otherwise excellent scheme?</P>

      <P>The package of supports being made available to selected rural schools under the Breaking the Cycle initiative represents a distinct response to the assessed needs of the schools in question.  This response was developed by the Education Research Centre following a detailed study of educational disadvantage as manifested in urban and rural settings.  The study in question was carried out by the Education Research Centre and the Combat Poverty Agency and represents one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  I reject the allegation that there was political interference in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The study reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage.  It evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches, using a wide range of national and international research data and recommended approaches for the future.</P>
      <P>While the report recognised the considerable advances which have been made in alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage, it also made a series of comments and recommendations aimed at improving on former arrangements. Among the key issues raised in the report was a concern that under the current criteria the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the selection criteria be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural settings as well as urban settings.  It also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas. The report also considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the study, the Minister for Education <Col N="170" /> commissioned the Education Research Centre to carry out further work aimed at developing precise criteria to be applied in the selection of schools for special disadvantaged supports and identifying a range of appropriate supports.  The outcome of these studies formed the basis for the Breaking the Cycle initiative which was recently launched by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Under this initiative, a new targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in large urban areas.  The 25 schools in question were selected by the Education Research Centre following examination of data submitted by the schools.  A further eight associated schools were also included in the urban element of the scheme because their enrolments involved a high proportion of children from the same families as those attending one of the 25 most disadvantaged schools.</P>

      <P>In the case of the rural phase of the initiative, the centre concluded that the initiative should focus on schools with fewer than five teachers and whose proximity to each other was such as to create a cluster which can reasonably be served by one locally based co-ordinator.  In the case of both the urban and rural elements of the initiative, a specific package of support measures was devised to address the particular needs as identified in the studies to which I referred.  Many of the features of the support package are common to both urban and rural areas.  For example, both the urban and rural schools will receive special funding for the purchase of materials and equipment; special funding for local initiatives and special targeted in career development for staff.  In addition, the <Col N="171" /> rural schools will receive increased capitation funding at a rate of £75 per pupil.</P>

The appointment of a locally based co-ordinator to each individual cluster of rural schools is a feature of the rural dimension which will not be applicable to urban schools.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been contracted by the Department of Education to assess the effect of each component of the two dimensions on pupil attainment.  The advice of the centre at the end of the five year period of this initiative will inform future directions and the nature of future supports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your courtesy.  I recognise that you <Col N="172" /> do not wish to create a precedent.  I thank Deputies O'Keeffe and O'Dea and both Ministers of State for giving way.</P>
      <P>This issue is of great importance to a number of people.  At a time when we are told there is unprecedented growth in the economy and hear announcements of thousands of jobs on a daily basis which would almost make one's head reel, it is sad to note the workers at Packard Electric, which closed nearly six months ago, await £1.5 million which was promised to them as an extra redundancy payment in June.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be aware the deal was sold to the workers on the basis that the Labour Court recommendation would be fulfilled.  They voted on that and accepted it.  We lamented in this House in a debate on 28 June that it looked as if management were refusing to accept the recommendation in its fullest terms.  Following that, the Government and the Minister of State put on pressure to ensure the parent firm and European management would pay this surplus, which was in pension funds, to the workers; they are still waiting.  They expected it in July but it is now December and the money, £1,000 to £3,000 approximately for each worker, has not been paid.  They genuinely believed they were getting this money and many people have made arrangements to spend it.  There is a moral imperative on the Government to ensure the money is paid.  It was promised by the trade union, management and the Minister of State on behalf of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has done his best in this instance but his best has not been good enough to date unless he has some good news for us this evening.  My information is that the ground has been cut under the workers' feet on the money due.</P>
      <P>One can imagine what a difference that money would make to many people.  The back to school season came and went as people waited for their money.  Will Christmas come and go?  Is there a moral compulsion the Government should exercise on this firm to see the money is paid to the workers?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I hope I will have good news because as the Deputy says, it is overdue.  I hope discussions with the company and other parties concerned will result in an agreement that will be the subject of a meeting tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court recommended redundancy terms for Packard Electric workers of five weeks' pay per year of service, in addition to statutory entitlements.  The payment actually made to the workers had been five weeks, including statutory entitlements.  At the request of the unions, I intervened last June to seek company implementation of this Labour Court recommendation, following which an agreement <Col N="173" /> was reached at the Labour Relations Commission on 28 June.  Under the terms of this agreement the company agreed to &ldquo;the use of any excess funds&rdquo; in the pension scheme as part of the overall redundancy settlement.  This agreement by the company was &ldquo;subject to the decision of the Trustees (of the Pension Fund) within the rules of the Pension Scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was informed at the time, following contact with senior management of the company, that arrangements necessary to secure payment of the pension fund surplus would take a matter of weeks.  I made this information available to the workforce on 15 July and the trade unions, following their own contacts with the company, advised the workers on 2 August that it might be mid to late August before the additional payments were made.</P>
    <P>Payment was not, however, made in August, and from early September I recommenced regular and frequent contact with the company to secure payment.  I have been in contact with, among others, Mr. Carlos Ferreira, managing director, Delphi Packard Europe, the personnel manager, Mr. Dolan at Packard, the Irish Pensions Trust and legal advisers to try to secure transfer of the money in question.  Although it appeared clear that the major delay was due to concerns expressed by the trustees, I wrote on 6 November to the company seeking to have payment made.</P>
    <P>In that letter I expressed the view that it was &ldquo;difficult to believe that the reported legal queries to be dealt with are so difficult or unusual that they would take such a lengthy time to process&rdquo;.  In a reply of 14 November the managing director of Delphi Packard stressed the &ldquo;total independence&rdquo; of the trustees, but stated that the company had &ldquo;given all the assurances requested by the Trustees&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The trustees, who have a legal responsibility to act in the best interests of the members, met several times in recent months and have been considering legal advice on the distribution of the surplus.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the trustees on Friday, 6 December 1996, I am advised that a proposal was agreed which was put to the company solicitor, through legal channels, last Friday.  Following consideration by the company advisers of the proposal, the matter of making some changes to the trust deed amendment has been referred back to the trustees who have arranged a further and, I hope, final, meeting for tomorrow, Wednesday, 18 December 1996.  If these changes are accepted, my understanding is that this will lead to a resolution of the matter and payment of the moneys to the workforce before Christmas. Obviously I am hopeful of an immediate resolution of this outstanding matter and will keep in close touch with the position.  While I have done and continue to do everything humanly possible to find a satisfactory resolution of this matter, at the end of the day it is a matter for the trustees of the pension fund and the <Col N="174" /> parties to the agreement reached under the auspices of the LRC.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the drama and heartbreak of the Packard closure.  I have lived with that drama and heartbreak in my constituency and I hope tomorrow's meeting will be the final chapter in this phase of a tragic event in the constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for being so magnanimous in allowing our Deputy Leader to take my place on the second matter.  I am very disappointed at the failure of the Minister for Justice to come in here to address one of the most serious problems that has arisen in my constituency.</P>
      <P>On 1 July 1996 the Garda station in Doneraile was transferred to an office in the community hall measuring ten square feet by eight square feet. It is unbelievable that this could have happened. There is inadequate heating and lighting in that building.  There is no privacy as voices can be heard through the slab walls which are not sound proof.  There is a sergeant and one garda in the area and to date this year, of 24 reported crimes 16 have been successfully solved, an outstanding achievement in poor working conditions.</P>
      <P>The transfer took place because the original Garda station was in a state of decay and the conditions posed a threat to the health of those working there.  The garda and sergeant would like to return to that building as soon as possible.  The undue delay in having the building restored is unreasonable and the whole community is dissatisfied with the present position.</P>
      <P>The old station was a Georgian streetscape.  It was used as an RIC barracks many years ago and Doneraile was served well at that time by the Royal Irish Constabulary.  The building was originally part of the Doneraile estate.  Since the 1920s when this great State was founded &mdash; we all identify with that great era &mdash; there was a sergeant and four gardaí in Doneraile, but the numbers were gradually reduced.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State who has done an excellent job for Cork &mdash; there is no Minister from Cork in the Cabinet &mdash; and I admire him for that.  I wish him many days of success.  The population served by the Doneraile Garda station is 2,000.  There are 3,000 acres of forestry in the area, which must be properly policed.  The area covers 15 square miles by nine square miles, including two villages and a town, with four hotels, a golf course, a bank and seven public houses.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use his influence in Government to solve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was put down recently to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht about the Georgian status of the Doneraile Garda station.  If law and order is to be upheld good working conditions must be maintained.  I ask the Minister to meet the needs of Doneraile, <Col N="175" /> which is a historic place.  Canon Sheehan, the great literary writer who wrote many great novels, was from that area.  The Minister should give a commitment that before the next general election a new facility will be put in place so that the Garda Síochána can uphold the law and protect the citizens of my constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has often failed to come into the House to reply to these issues.  If it was not for Fianna Fáil there would be no law and order.  Deputy O'Donoghue and other Front Bench Deputies have put approximately 11 Bills through the House to protect the citizens and we see the fruits of those daily in our courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe started very well by praising me and generally taking part in the Christmas spirit, but matters deteriorated as he proceeded.  I share the Deputy's concern for the position in Doneraile.  I apologise for the Minister for Justice who is absent for very good reasons and sends her apologies.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to explain the latest position regarding work on Doneraile Garda station.  In June 1993 a report was published following a review of the Garda building programme.  The object of the review was to assess the existing stock of accommodation and, among other things, to examine the various options for replacing Garda stations.  One of the recommendations to emerge from the review was that to make the best use of available financial resources, consideration should be given to sharing buildings with other users.</P>
      <P>A local developer put forward a proposal to the Office of Public Works that a new Garda station be incorporated in a new retail development on the existing station site.  Following approval by the Garda authorities of the plans for the new station in this development, sanction for the project was received by the Office of Public Works from the Department of Fianance.  In the normal way Doneraile would have taken its place on the Garda building priority list. When the developer made his offer the Minister grasped the opportunity to expedite the project.</P>
      <P>The Minister had inquiries made of the Office of Public Works and it is understood the contract has not been signed yet because the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht had requested that a number of conservation steps be incorporated into the new building under section 10 of the Heritage Act, 1995.  The Minister has been informed that these conditions have been accepted by the developer.  The necessary revisions to the contract agreement are now being attended to by the Chief State Solicitor and it is expected that the revised documents will be executed before Christmas thus enabling the developer to commence on site in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was aware that accommodation in Doneraile was less than adequate and was glad to lend her support to this venture.  As the project entails the demolition of the old site, <Col N="176" /> arrangements were made to provide the gardaí with temporary accommodation.  A local community hall was made available and it was occupied by the gardaí last July.  That explains the position outlined by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to stress that a great deal of work has been done in recent years in improving standards of accommodation at Garda stations.  It is, however, a large scale operation. This programme of improvement has a high priority with the Minister and the Government. This year, for instance, almost £9 million has been provided to build and maintain Garda stations. The gardaí occupy 704 Garda stations and other accommodation, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda Headquarters, and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings are old RIC and DMP stations designed for a different age and need major upgrading or replacement.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been done in recent years to improve the situation and I am sure Members will all be aware of examples of improvements to Garda stations and of new stations provided in recent years.  The Deputy knows, for instance, that work commenced recently on the building of Douglas Garda station and Clonakilty District Headquarters in County Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter but, like Deputy O'Keeffe, I deplore the absence of the Minister for Justice.  While I have every respect for the Minister of State and I sympathise about the new responsibilities thrust upon him, he seems to have been appointed Minister with responsibility for Adjournment Matters in addition to his other responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phenomenon known as contract killing has been one of the most sinister developments in the <Col N="177" /> rising tide of violent crime.  When I last raised this matter in the House on 30 April 1996, I referred to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> which listed 11 cases of murder, all of which were almost certainly contract killings, some dating back to 1994.  None of them had been solved at that time, although I understand a number of files have now gone to the DPP.  As the year has progressed we have been forced to endure yet another spate of gangland executions.</P>
    <P>The rise in contract killings is inextricably linked to the greater availability of illegal firearms.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 sets out to control the supply and distribution of illegal guns but unfortunately it has not worked and illegal firearms continue to proliferate.  In many cases these are imported with large consignments of drugs as the trafficker's &ldquo;sweetener&rdquo; in the drug deal.  In Limerick city, which I represent, the experience has been that almost anyone who wishes to gain access to an illegal firearm can readily do so.  It can be purchased for the going rate or, alternatively, rented for a period.  The current price for renting an illegal firearm in Limerick is about £40 per hour and the standard charge for a contract &ldquo;hit&rdquo; is about £2,000.  However, as guns proliferate life inevitably becomes cheaper.  In Limerick recently a price of £400 was quoted for shooting someone.  In some larger urban areas of the US, the police have managed to reduce levels of violent crime by targeting illegal firearms.  The gardaí should mount a similar operation here without delay.</P>
    <P>I recognise that contract killings are hard to solve.  In many cases they are carried out by professionals who are well acquainted with the law and careful to leave no forensic evidence. There is no link between the killer and his victim, therefore there is no motive in the popularly understood sense of that word.  Nevertheless it has to be said that Garda success in solving these crimes has been conspicuous by its relative absence.  The force has made much progress in the battle against organised crime but all too many contract killers and those who order the murders are still at large.</P>
    <P>A number of factors contribute to this.  The Garda management style, notable for its lack of consultation, has led to a devastating collapse in morale.  The abolition of specialist units in the Garda, again without consultation, has proved in retrospect to be a catastrophic blunder.  The Garda promotion system has denied opportunity to those more skilled in the art of detection, and overall competence has been badly compromised as a result.</P>
    <P>The people are entitled to ask where this will stop.  Some have advanced the theory that highly organised death squads are at work, operating covertly and with ruthless efficiency.  There is some evidence to support that.  What is certain is that the inexorable rise in gangland killings and <Col N="178" /> the lamentable failure of the authorities to stem the tide presents a deadly threat to democracy.</P>
    <P>The victims of contract killing are often people who have been involved in crime.  This has tended to give the public the subliminal message that it should not be as concerned about those killings as it might be about others.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no room for complacency about murder.  The greater tendency to resort to murder, even to settle the most trivial dispute, inevitably endangers everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I again apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Owen, who has good reason not to be here tonight.  I ask Deputy O'Dea to accept that apology.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that all killings, however described, are the subject of an exhaustive Garda investigative process.  Crimes of this nature are investigated by divisional investigation teams whose membership includes detective personnel who have been trained in the investigation of serious crime.  These crimes are investigated by gardaí who know the local community and work in close proximity to the sources of intelligence. The divisional investigation teams are assisted by gardaí from the Garda technical bureau based at Garda Headquarters, who provide services in areas such as ballistics, photography and fingerprints.  Further assistance and co-ordination is provided by gardaí from the central detective unit.  In addition, two superintendents and a number of sergeants with a high level of investigative expertise are based at Garda Headquarters and are available on request to divisional officers.  There can be no question but that the Garda authorities are putting all required resources into the investigation and detection of these horrific crimes.</P>
      <P>On the broader front Deputies will be aware of the Government's total commitment to the fight against organised crime and drugs related crime.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I take this opportunity to briefly put on record again initiatives which have been taken to tackle these serious areas of criminal activity.</P>
      <P>In July 1995 the Minister for Justice obtained Government approval for a comprehensive package of measures to deal with the drugs problem.  This resulted in improved co-operation between the gardaí and the customs service, the establishment of a Garda national drugs unit, a review of dance and pub licences and measures to deal with the use of drugs in prisons.</P>
      <P>These measures have been reinforced by the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in August 1996.  This new body, which has staff drawn from the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, is designed to facilitate co-ordinated action by these agencies to fight organised crime. The Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, put the bureau on a statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the bureau was one of a number of developments approved by the <Col N="179" /> Government in a major package of measures to tackle the crime and drugs problem in July 1996. They included an increase in Garda numbers, recruitment of further civilians to release gardaí from administrative duties, a review of Garda efficiency and cost effectiveness, provision of some 800 prison places, the appointment of additional judges and arrangements for extra sittings of the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court, a number of law reform measures including a referendum on bail and additional staffing resources in the Forensic Science Laboratory where drug seizures and other forensic evidence are analysed.</P>
    <P>In October 1996 a Ministerial Task Force on Demand Reduction presented its first report. This recommended the establishment of new structures designed to achieve a more effective, co-ordinated delivery of services to deal with the drugs problem at national and local levels.  The measures will involve the establishment of a local drugs task force for each of the 12 areas identified in the report.  The task force also recommended new treatment, education, prevention and rehabilitative measures in relation to drug abuse. The recommendations have been approved by the Government and are in the process of being implemented.  They will be implemented by a high level strategy team and monitored closely by a Cabinet committee.</P>
    <P>In October 1996 the Garda Commissioner announced a new initiative, Operation Dóchas. The operation, which came into effect on Monday, 7 October, involves all Dublin districts and the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain clothes gardaí to target specific areas of the city.  Uniformed gardaí are adopting a high profile through both foot patrols and mobile patrols and work to forge greater links with local communities, both community leaders and individual families.  Backup is provided by specialist mobile units and other units.  All these <Col N="180" /> developments have been accompanied by significant legislative developments to strengthen the hand of the forces of law and order in their fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.</P>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, provides a powerful new mechanism for the freezing and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which provides for detention of up to seven days for drug trafficking offences, allows for the presence of customs officers at interviews of suspects and allows inferences to be drawn by a court from the failure of an accused to mention particular facts when being questioned by a garda.  The Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, provides for more effective exchange of information between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>On 3 September this year Ireland ratified the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.  As a party to this convention, Ireland will be able to play a full part in international co-operation against drug trafficking, ranging from practical co-operation on drug trafficking at sea to judicial co-operation in obtaining evidence and in confiscating the proceeds of drug trafficking.  The Department of Justice will act as the central authority in this jurisdiction for the purposes of international co-operation under the convention. These measures greatly enhance the powers of the State in tackling the menace of organised crime and drugs related crime.</P>
    <P>It must be clear from what I have said that there can be no doubt about the Government's commitment to the fight against the menace of drugs and the fallout from drug trafficking, including so-called contract killings.  The Government has long since recognised the urgent need for action and has taken it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 December 1996.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> BUPA Ireland Ltd. launched schemes of insurance on 19 November 1996.  These comprise a community rated indemnity scheme known as the essential scheme and age rated cash plans at four different levels.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, I am the regulator of the private health insurance market and I must approach any question which may affect any insurance undertaking in an independent and open minded manner.  My concern is the integrity and effectiveness of the legislation enacted, in the interests of the common good, to regulate the health insurance business in this country.  I informed the House as recently as 10 December that the principle of community rating is regarded as an essential part of our health insurance system.  Accordingly, section 7 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, prohibits non-community rated health insurance contracts.  I will fully uphold the principle of community rating as set out in the 1994 legislation.</P>
      <P>The House has previously been advised on 20 November that my Department, as part of its normal regulatory function, was considering in detail the schemes which have been launched by BUPA Ireland Ltd.  My Department has now written to BUPA seeking its views on certain issues.  I will decide what further action, if any, is warranted in this matter when BUPA responds to this communication.  There will be no delay in my determining the issue once I have had an opportunity of considering the response by BUPA to my Department's letter.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes competition in the health insurance market and it will facilitate this to the fullest possible extent within the legislative framework enacted to safeguard and maintain our long established core principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.</P>
      <P>Under section 3 of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996 the VHI Board is obliged to give me prior notice of a proposed increase in premiums.  I have not received notice from the board of any such impending increase.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Since the introduction of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on 1 September 1993 to 31 October 1996, 9,731 subventions have been approved.  This year, just under £17 million has been made available to the health boards to fund subventions under the Act.  There are currently 18,678* beds available in public long stay hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Health Strategy recognises that the rapid rise in the number of elderly people will pose a special challenge to the health services in the coming years.  Last year, I made £3 million in capital funding available to the health boards to commence work in new community nursing units for the elderly and to carry out remedial work on some existing units.  A further £2 million has been allcoated in 1996 to continue these developments.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent Supreme Court decision to allow the case taken by the County Louth residents against British Nuclear Fuels Limited to be heard in the Irish courts, the Government decided to offer financial assistance and other support to the residents for specific purposes. These purposes have been outlined to the House by the Minister for the Environment, and include <Col N="183" /> relevant health-related research.  In addition, the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental working group, subordinate to the ministerial group on Sellafield and the Irish Sea, with the following remit: &ldquo;to examine all available evidence, and to explore and assemble all further evidence, with a view to supporting effective action against the risks posed to the population of Ireland by the installations and operations at Sellafield&rdquo;.  This working group, which includes a representative of the Department of Health, has already met the County Louth residents to begin the process of indentifying areas of possible research, and further meetings will be arranged.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific areas of investigation which have been raised by the Deputies, I am aware of proposals by Dr. Chris Busby to carry out an epidemiological study on cancer incidence on either side of the Irish Sea and I am aware that the research of the late Dr. Patricia Sheehan is being continued by another researcher on a voluntary basis.  I understand that the reported findings on vitamin and enzyme deficiencies are contained in a study being carried out by a general practitioner in the area &mdash; this study has not yet been published or made available to the health board or my Department.  All of these areas of possible research will be considered by the working group.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Home support services include home helps, home care attendants and personal assistants and are provided both by health boards and voluntary organisations on behalf of the baords.  Support is also provided by the provision of respite care either in a residential centre or with a host family. Such services enable many people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence.  The objective is to provide a flexible service which can meet the varying needs of different individuals with disabilities and their families.  The development of these services is a priority element in the development of services generally for people with disabilities and substantial resources have been devoted to them in recent years.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Since 1993 a substantial programme of investment amounting to £35 million on an annualised basis has been provided for the development of new child care and family support services to facilitate the phased implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991. These development have included the creation of additional foster and residential care placements in each of the health boards.</P>
      <P>It is the case that a small number of the children whom the health boards are endeavouring to assist are so unruly that they cannot appropriately be cared for in the existing range of residential care placements available. The challenging behaviour displayed by some children makes their acceptance by residential units difficult to obtain.  These children require specialised, intensive care and support because of their level of disturbance and difficult behaviour. The boards are developing a variety of responses to try to cope with these children.</P>
      <P>A number of the boards have developed special fostering schemes and other special care arrangements.  Emergency facilities for individual children who have been found to be out of control have been established by the Eastern and Southern Health Boards in response to a number of High Court judgements directing the State to provide suitable accommodation for children who need to be detained for their own safety and welfare.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are in hand for the planning and construction of a special care unit in the Eastern Health Board area to cater for children in need of intensive therapeutic support in a controlled safe environment.  The recently published Children Bill provides a legislative framework for the establishment of these special care units.</P>
      <P>I accept that a continued programme of investment in our child care services is necessary in order to adequately address the needs of children in care.  I submitted a detailed child care programme to Government earlier this year which has been given approval in principle.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 27, 112, 121, 129 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national disease surveillance unit is currently being considered and the faculty of pathology of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland has submitted to the Department a consensus proposal drawn up by a group representing the various professional organisations with a particular interest in the area.  This proposal envisages a national surveillance mechanism which would build on the reporting systems which have been developed in some regions, and which would assist in the control of all communicable diseases, including hospital acquired infections such as MRSA.  This proposal is currently under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been anxious to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to control and reduce the prevalence of MRSA and I am glad to inform the <Col N="187" /> Deputy that significant measures have already been taken by my Department in this area.  In September 1993 a committee comprising representatives from the Department of Health, consultant microbiologists, specialists in public health medicine, general practice, and the Infection Control Nurses Association was established to indentify the extent to which MRSA was a problem in the Irish health system and to establish priorities for its control.</P>
    <P>A national survey of the prevalence of MRSA was carried out to assess the extent of the problem and the committee also recommended a comprehensive set of guidelines covering procedures for the management of MRSA in acute hospitals and other health care settings.  The committee also produced guidelines and information for patients and health care staff.</P>
    <P>These national guidelines were endorsed by a wide rage of professional bodies involved in the control of MRSA and I was happy to publish the guidelines last year.  The guidelines have been widely circulated throughout the country and are an important step in promoting awareness of MRSA and the measures for its control and will ensure an even safer environment for the care of the sick both in the hospital and community.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I intend to take Questions Nos. 22, 47, 94 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the review referred to by <Col N="188" /> Deputy Lynch is that of the 1978 working party established to examine the grading structure for physiotherapists in hospitals.  The report of the working party was circulated in 1979.  However, this was not a pay review.</P>
    <P>Physiotherapists, similar to all other para-medical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes down through the years.  The relative position of physiotherapists, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other para-medical disciplines.</P>
    <P>IMPACT, on behalf of physiotherapists is currently pursuing a pay claim under Clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> These negotiations are complex and are ongoing under the auspices of the Health Service Employers' Agency, with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I am sure that Deputies will appreciate that any further comment on my part would not be appropriate or helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Additional funding was made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This is reflected in the ongoing progress being made to improve further health and welfare services for the eldrely and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>I might add that my Department allocates £80,000 annually in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Just under £17 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the conference, entitled Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders &mdash; Practical Management and Prevention, which was held in Limerick on 20-22 November.  This conference was organised by my Department, in association with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and with the support of the European Commission.  The purpose of the conference was to exchange information and to evaluate the success of practical advice and management and prevention strategies currently employed in relation to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.  The conference was extremely successful and the various papers presented were thought provoking.  It is intended to publish the conference proceedings in the new year and I am sure that the final document will provide a useful database for policy makers, health professionals, hospital managers and carers working with sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The strategy to deal with cardiac surgery waiting lists has been to provide additional facilities and infrastructure within the public hospital service to increase annual activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date this strategy has resulted in: an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed at the Mater Hospital where the annual activity for open heart operations has been increased by 250 per year to 1,000 per year; an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed to Cork University Hospital to increase the output from 200 to 400 open heart operations per year.  The combined effect of this action will be to increase annual activity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital <Col N="190" /> service to 1,400 per year, an increase of 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the provision of additional capacity including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public hospital system over the next two or three years.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.</P>
    <P>In the interim my Department has contracted for the purchase of additional cardiology and cardiac surgery procedures from health care organisations at prices which are reasonable and affordable.  In 1996, I have provided £1 million for these interim measures.</P>
    <P>An examination of the longer term requirements for cardiac surgery is under way. One of the matters to be considered, as part of this examination, is the location of the additional capacity within the public hospital system.  I have received tenders from four hospitals for this additional work and these are being examined by a group specially convened to produce a report on how cardiac surgery for public patients could be expanded by 500 cases annually.  The group has been directed to report to me by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There are currently 1,630 adults on the cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As I informed the House on Tuesday 10 December 1996 in reply to Private Notice Questions, I was made aware of the residual problem relating to HIV infected blood on Monday, 9 December, when I was briefed by my Department on the incident at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The BTSB has confirmed that it did not inform my Department until 8 December 1996 of the residual problem relating to potentially infected HIV blood.  The residual problem can be stated as follows.  It has not been possible to date to trace all the recipients of the 16 issues derived from potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985 from the blood of seven donors who have tested positive for HIV since HIV testing of blood donors commenced in October 1985.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on Tuesday, 10 December, 24 blood donors have tested positive in the 11 years of testing.  Eight of these donors were first time donors and, accordingly, no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved. In the case of nine of the remaining 16 donors, recipients of issues regarded as being at risk were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
      <P>The tracing of recipients of the issues from the remaining seven donors has been rendered very difficult by the absence of BTSB dispatch records for the period prior to 1986.  Of the 31 issues from these seven donors, 15 were donated prior to 1981 and are not regarded as a potential source of infection.  As I have already stated, the residual problem relates to tracing the recipients of the balance of 16 issues derived from potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 10 December, I understand that, following the introduction of HIV donor screening test in October 1985, no lookback was undertaken in the period between 1985 and 1989 in respect of earlier donations made by donors who now screened positive. However, their donations were not used and they were advised to contact their general practitioner for further assessment and counselling.  I also informed the House on 10 December that the BTSB had, from 1989 onwards, a lookback procedure for newly presenting donors.</P>
      <P>It was under this procedure that a lookback on previous donations took place in respect of a donor who tested HIV positive in March 1993. This particular donor had donated previously in November 1989 and May 1990.  The 1990 donation was traced and tested negative.  The BTSB, therefore, considered it unnecessary to undertake a lookback on the 1989 donation.  I should emphasise that this 1993 donor is one of the nine donors whom I have already mentioned where recipients of issues regarded as being at risk where traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
      <P>Following the 1993 lookback on this particular donor, the then Chief Medical Consultant of the BTSB wrote to the CMO of my Department on 16 April 1993 outlining the action taken following the identification of this donor.  The letter was at that stage brought to the attention of the other relevant senior officers in the Department by the CMO.  This letter was brought to my attention by officials of my Department on Friday last, 13 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following receipt of this letter of 16 April 1993, I understand that at the next meeting of the board of the BTSB, held on 21 April 1993, the Chief Medical Consultant reported to the board meeting on the recent lookback and was requested by the board to prepare an updated Protocol for the handling of such cases in the future.  I understand that a revised Protocol was submitted and accepted in principle by the board of the BTSB at its next meeting on 26 May 1993. Since my statement to the House on 10 December 1996, I have met Mr. Liam Dunbar, chief executive officer of the BTSB and officials of my Department have also met senior management of the board on a number of occasions.  I sought an explanation as to why the board did not inform me or my Department until <Col N="193" /> last week of the residual problem which exists in relation to untraced donations.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has provided me with a detailed document setting out their approach to the lookback in respect of the seven donors and 31 issues which gave rise to concern.</P>
    <P>I intend to make this document available to Deputies; I am also, as requested, circulating a copy of the BTSB's letter of 25 September addressed to the hospitals and in addition, I am circulating full details of the main features of the work programme undertaken by the new management of the BTSB since April 1995.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will note from a reading of the document dealing with the lookback, it was decided by the BTSB to avail of the mechanism of the tracing programme for hepatitis C, undertaken by the hospitals, to determine the possibility of tracing the small number of potential HIV infected individuals.  Then they planned to assess the results of that initiative in terms of the number of issues traced on untraced. When the outcome of this was known, it was intended to inform the Department of Health with a full assessment and recommendations for action at that stage.</P>
    <P>I feel that the BTSB should have informed me and my Department in advance of the arrangements which they intended to put in place to trace the recipients of the potentially infected blood issues.  However, I accept that the management of the BTSB acted in good faith and saw valid reasons for proceeding in the manner in which they did.</P>
    <P>Over the last week, the BTSB, with the assistance of my Department, has intensified its efforts with hospitals in tracing recipient and I was informed earlier today that the position is as follows: 31 outstanding issues; 15 issues relate to pre-1981 donations and are not considered to be a potential source of infection; 16 issues of concern, of which six have now been traced; and ten issues of concern remain to be traced.</P>
    <P>As I assured the House last week, I have given this matter very serious consideration.  I am advised that there can be no guarantee that all the remaining ten issues will ever be traced.  I am also aware that some donors who may have been HIV positive prior to the introduction of the screening of donations in October, 1985 have not come back to donate since 1985 and, therefore, cannot be identified.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, decided that there should be an optional HIV testing programme put in place for blood transfusion and blood product recipients between the beginning of 1981 and October 1985.  I have instructed my Department to put in place the necessary arrangements with the BTSB and other health agencies so that the optional testing programme can commence in January 1997 aimed at the cohort of people who were recipients of blood or blood products during this period.</P>
    <P>The Deputies have asked me to make a statement on this matter.  Since I replied to the <Col N="194" /> special notice question on 10 December, there have been criticisms made on the boards's performance and, in one instance, a call made for its disbandment.  I think it is essential to put the matters raised by the Deputies in context and to avoid creating further avoidable problems in what is an already difficult situation.  I would hope that the Deputies would share with me an appreciation of the enormous difficulties which face the board and its new management in undertaking a vast programme of re-organisation and restructuring in one of the State's most vital health agencies.</P>
    <P>This is being undertaken against a background of unprecedented adverse circumstances which have their origins in events which occurred over a period of 20 years.  I have circulated to Deputies details of the 17 major initiatives undertaken by the new management team since April 1995.  I would, in particular, like to highlight the significant steps which have been taken to improve quality assurance measures.  These include: improvements in donor screening; archiving of samples of all donations; improvements in the structure of the laboratories, including the construction of a specific hepatitis C laboratory; upgrading of the quality assurance function and the introduction of environmental monitoring; ensuring standard operational procedures manuals are in force in all areas of the BTSB; and the introduction of HLTVI and II viral screening.</P>
    <P>In addition to all this, the new management has had to cope with an unprecedented volume of litigation and the preparation of documentation for submission to the Tribunal of Inquiry.  It also managed to maintain the blood supply, the essential and primary purpose of its existence.  It is my view that the scale of the renewal and re-organisation process is such that it will require a further three to five years of intense work by the BTSB before the Job is completed.  During this period the board and management of the BTSB needs and deserves the support of the Minister and of the House.</P>
    <P>The issue of extending the current Tribunal of Inquiry to examine the questions which have arisen in relation to HIV infection, has been raised.  The current Tribunal of Inquiry in relation to hepatitis C has been conducted with widely acclaimed efficiency, expedition and care by Mr. Justice Finlay.</P>
    <P>I am advised, and it is my own view, that it is not appropriate that the careful planning and scheduling of that inquiry should be disrupted in mid stream, but rather that it should be allowed complete that work.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the terms of reference for that inquiry include provision for an interim report not later than the 20th day of oral hearings.  I understand that the tribunal will adjourn this week for the Christmas break and I expect to receive the interim report during the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>I think it is very important that neither myself, <Col N="195" /> nor the House, should presume upon the willingness of any particular person to conduct a further inquiry into a different, though related, matter.  Any new questions would involve the assembling of new documents and statements, steps which would involve further time and effort of unknown dimensions.</P>
    <P>What I propose is exploring the feasibility, of either extending the existing terms of reference of setting up an additional, but related, inquiry to deal with specific questions which are now being raised in relation to HIV infection and the way that problem was handled by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>The success of the current tribunal is widely ascribed, among other things, to the specificity of the terms of reference and if there is to be an extension of this inquiry, or an associated inquiry in relation to HIV, then that example should be followed.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that terms of reference which express specific questions can be drawn up, with care and reasonable expedition, and put before the Dáil at the end of January, at which stage the interim report will be to hand and it will hopefully have been possible to explore with the tribunal whether it, or some variant of it, could best undertake these further inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which was published on 18 November, contains a wide range of recommendations concerning the provision of services to people with disabilities.  It refers specifically to the inclusion of women with disabilities and recommends that the National Women's Council address the impact of disability on gender equality.  It also recommends that specific action and research should be undertaken to combat the reality of the double exclusion experienced by women with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish a committee to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations, including the recommendations concerning work and training.  This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department will be represented.  The issues raised by the Deputy will be addressed through these new structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> This work will be supported by a number of important initiatives.  Training policy is being reviewed by my Department.  Also the National Rehabilitation Board is preparing a report on the development of employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  The forthcoming plan for women's health will also make specific reference to the needs of women with disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The advisory group on the transmission of infectious diseases was established with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to advise the Minister for Health regarding the prevention of the transmission of infectious diseases in health care settings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In common with my ministerial colleagues I commission a number of reports each year.  There is no general expectation that all of these reports will be published.  Many of them are simply regarded as an input to the policy formulation process, and their advice and recommendations may be incorporated in other documents which are published or circulated to interested parties. I understand that this very question of publication was raised at the first meeting of the advisory group, and that it was agreed that the group's role was to submit a report to me.  It would then be a matter for me to decide what subsequent action was appropriate.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the report within the Department of Health, a circular was issued to all health agencies advising them of screening procedures for hepatitis B to be introduced from 1 January 1997 for new employees in posts which involve exposure-prone procedures.  This circular takes account of the relevant recommendations of the advisory group.  However, in view of the concern which have been raised in this whole area, I have decided to make the advisory group's report available by placing a copy in the Library of the House, and it will also be circulated to interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards consultation on the report, the two <Col N="197" /> organisations representing the medical profession each had three representatives on the advisory group and so were fully involved in the process of drawing up the recommendations.  As the circular which has now issued seeks to implement the group's recommendations, further consultation was not required.</P>
    <P>There are several other complex issues which need to be examined in relation to existing and new health service employees who may have or develop infections diseases, such as hepatitis C and HIV.  In addition, I believe that there is a need for a central resources which will develop and oversee the implementation of Protocols for dealing with incidents involving infected health care workers, and which will also be available as a source of ready advice and guidance to health agencies dealing with such problems.  I am, accordingly, establishing a group, to be chaired by Dr. Jim Kiely, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, which will, not later than 31 March 1997, report to me on the further measures which need to be taken in relation to a range of issues not addressed by the advisory group, and which will also function as a central resources for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>This group will, <i>inter alia</i>, work closely with the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais to ensure that there is an integrated and complementary approach to dealing with the service, personnel, ethical and legal matters arising for health care workers and patients in relation to infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>The group's report will be published promptly after its completion and there will be widespread consultation with all interested organisations.  The public will also be invited to submit comments on the report.  This process will be concluded by the end of June 1997 and policy decisions will then be taken quickly.</P>

Any funding proposal which may be proposed by the health board will be given sympathetic consideration by me, in the light of the national cancer strategy and having regard to the availability of resources.</P>

    <P>EU law requires that irradiated foods should <Col N="199" /> be so labelled.  These provisions, which have been transposed into Irish legislation, are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I understand that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has made inquiries to establish the level and range of irradiated foods being imported into Ireland and has concluded that the quantities and range of foods involved are very insignificant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a proposal is currently being discussed at EU level which would harmonise laws relating to food irradiation among the member states.  The proposal, if adopted, will further strengthen the labelling requirements for irradiated foods as well as providing a range of other safeguards.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of treatment services for drug misusers is a matter for the regional health boards in the first instance.  Apart from the Eastern Health Board area, where there are waiting lists for treatment, all other health boards have adequate facilities for the treatment of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>Treatment may be provided on an out-patient or an in-patient basis, depending on the clincial assessment.  In the case of the person referred to by the Deputy, the South-Eastern Health Board has informed my Department that he has treated for his drug addiction as an in-patient in Waterford Regional Hospital, but discharged himself before completion of the programme.  He was subsequently referred to out-patient services, but has maintained only occasional contact, despite ongoing offers of service.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in addition, this person had been in receipt of methadone treatment from a general practitioner in the Eastern Health Board area.  He was also assessed in the Drug Treatment Centre, Trinity Court, Pearse Street and admitted to Beaumont Hospital Detoxification Unit in January 1996, but discharged himself against medical advice.  On the advice of the psychiatric services in Waterford the South-Eastern Health Board is not prepared to provide financial support for in-patient treatment in a private facility in this case, in the light of non-compliance and non-completion of the services provided by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> This case demonstrates the difficulties which can arise in providing appropriate treatment for drug misusers.  The drug misuser must decide to break his or her drug taking habit and remain committed to this during detoxification and treatment.  The sad fact is that a number of misusers relapse into their drug-taking habit.  This is one of the major issues addressed in the first report of the ministerial task force on drugs which was published in October last and which recommends the expansion of drug rehabilitation services, to provide a range of options which will assist drug misusers to remain drug-free and to resume a normal life, following treatment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Unlinked anonymous HIV testing programmes are used as a means of confirming that the information produced by voluntary testing is giving a true indication of the prevalence of the disease.  Where such programmes have been introduced internationally they have been aimed at particular target populations such as women of child-bearing age and people who are attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics and who are obviously sexually active.  Unlinked screening of the population at large by the testing of all blood samples would be pointless, because they would not necessarily be from representative sections of the population and the costs involved would be considerable.</P>
      <P>The testing carried out in maternity hospitals and units to which the Deputy refers is, in fact, part of a programme of anonymous unlinked testing, which was recommended by the Surveillance Sub-Committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  The report on the results of the first three years of this screening programme has been prepared.  The programme was conducted over a three year period from October 1992 to December 1995, in all major maternity hospitals.  Out of a total of 160,679 tests, 25 were confirmed HIV positive, giving a rate of 0.016 per cent, confirming a lower prevalence in this population group than in other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is ongoing on the second phase of the programme and anonymous unlinked testing, which is being undertaken in a number of STD clinics at present, will be extended to all major STD clinics as soon as possible.  In addition, plans <Col N="203" /> are in train to commence unlinked anonymous HIV testing in certain outpatient clinics of some major hospitals in 1997.</P>
    <P>Results of testing among various population groups will help to improve the information provided to service planners for HIV and AIDS and will allow interventions to be focused more effectively on various target groups.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board with regard to community rating in private health insurance. The chairman of the board wrote to me expressing his concern in this respect.  I am aware of the submissions made to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas by the VHI board.</P>
      <P>The House has previously been advised that my Department, as part of its normal regulatory function, was considering in detail the schemes which have been launched by BUPA.  This process is proceeding and my Department has now written to BUPA seeking its views on certain issues.  I will decide what further action, if any, is warranted in this matter when BUPA responds to this communication.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department is continuing to develop mechanisms for attributing acute hospital costs to the different elements of a hospital's activity.  This information is available for 26 of the biggest hospitals, and the average in-patient cost per bed-day has been extracted from the cost and activity <Col N="204" /> information supplied by those hospitals and is set out for 1994 in Table 1, this is the latest year for which figures are available.  Figures for 1995 will be available in 1997.  These figures exclude costs and activity attributable to day cases, outpatient services, long stay cases, dialysis, obstetrics and psychiatry.  They do not take account of capital costs.  There are many factors which affect in-patient cost per bed-day and these include, in particular, casemix workload and teaching obligations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is not possible to quantify the number of elderly people from the Republic who are currently in care in Northern Ireland.  However, as the Deputy may be aware, traditionally there has been movement of residents of the Border counties to and from nursing homes in Northern Ireland.  This is due to a number of factors, including family relationships, convenience of location and personal choice and not, as suggested by the Deputy, due to a shortage of accommodation in health board long stay homes or private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>In recognition of such movement, the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to pay a subvention to a person whom it has determined as qualifying for a subvention in a nursing home in Northern Ireland which is a nursing home registered by a health and social services board.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The report of the review group on the ambulance service was published in November 1993.  The group, in their report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and fire service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work, approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnel are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the fire service personnel or, indeed, the Garda.</P>
      <P>A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993.  The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994, during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a range of productivity/efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity/flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication, in December 1993, of the report of the review group on the ambulance service which heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which has not been addressed in a comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from this, a set of proposals was agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995, SIPTU advised that the proposals and been rejected.  A number of meetings have been held since then to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion.  An intensive series of discussions have taken place in the last few months in which progress has been made on a number of the outstanding issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Final agreement was reached on a package of proposals in recent weeks.  This package is currently being balloted on by the ambulance personnel.  It is my hope that this offer will be <Col N="207" /> accepted and that this group's parity with their Dublin counterparts will be restored.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Full-time home help, who account for approximately 1 per cent of those involved in the home help scheme, are permanent, pensionable employees of health boards and as such are paid the group 1 non-officer rate.  With effect from 1 October 1996, this scale is in the range of £205.92-£218.01.  This group are taxed and superannuated in the normal way.</P>
      <P>In contrast, part-time home helps are volunteers who are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  This gratuity is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.</P>
      <P>Payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system. Agreement was reached on this issue with the Revenue Commissioners as far back as 1979 and there has been no amendment to that exclusion for this group.  Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help &mdash; or the spouse of a part-time home help &mdash; is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>Requests in relation to the provision of PRSI numbers for existing home helps in some health boards is a separate matter and unrelated to the issue of taxation.  If the Deputy wishes to pursue this separate matter it would be more appropriately referred to the Minister for Social Welfare, whose Department deals with PRSI classification and payment for non-PAYE workers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Accommodation for the elderly is a matter, in the first instance, for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; stressed that the main emphasis in housing policy for the elderly should be to enable <Col N="208" /> elderly people to choose between adapting their homes to the increasing disabilities of old age or to move to accommodation which is more suited to their needs.  Priority should be given to improving the accommodation of the elderly lacking the basic amenities of an indoor toilet, hot and cold water and a bath or shower.</P>
    <P>The resources allocated to the special housing aid scheme for the elderly allow such repairs to be carried out to the homes of vulnerable elderly people.  This scheme is funded by the Department of the Environment but is administered by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Although there is excellent co-operation between some health boards and local authorities in relation to housing, there is scope for greater co-ordination as regards housing for elderly people.  If the Deputy wishes to raise any particular problem regarding co-operation between health boards and local authorities, I will look into the matter and reply in due course.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have been advised by the Midland Health Board that at present 15 patients from the Midland Health Board area are undergoing hospital dialysis.  The needs of these patients are served by a number of dialysis units in centres adjacent to the Midland Health Board area.  The board also meets the costs associated with a number of patients availing of home dialysis (CAPD).  A transport service for patients undergoing dialysis treatment is provided by the Midland Health Board.  Proposals for an enhancement of the dialysis service for patients in the Midland Health Board area are, in the first instance, a matter for the Midland Health Board and any such proposals will be considered having regard to the priority afforded to them by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1988 it has been Department of Health policy that all health care staff who have regular contact with blood and other body fluids and are at risk from occupational injury should be vaccinated against hepatitis B.  The vaccination of staff working outside the health services is a matter in the first instance for the employing authority.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations, 1994, every employer has a duty to assess the risk of exposure of employees to hepatitis.  If that risk assessment reveals that there is a risk to the health of employees due to their exposure then vaccination must be offered free of charge to employees.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers did not specifically recommend the introduction of hepatitis B vaccine into the routine primary childhood immunisation programme.  However, it did recommend immunisation for a number of at risk groups which include infants deemed to be at risk due to the positive hepatitis B status of their mothers.  The report further recommends that the prevalence of hepatitis B in the community should be monitored with a view to making a decision in the future on whether to introduce the vaccine.  In this situation we are at one with a number of other low prevalence, north-western European countries, including the UK.  In the meantime, hepatitis B vaccine is available to all high risk groups.</P>
      <P>In addition a circular was issued to all health agencies advising them of screening procedures for hepatitis B to be introduced from 1 January 1997 for new employees in posts which involve exposure-prone procedures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Southern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services, in County Kerry.  I am informed by the board that the development of mental health services in County Kerry has been clearly outlined and planned in the board's four year action plan which was adopted in May 1995. The plan in relation to County Kerry envisages the establishment of comprehensive new community facilities including a range of residential and day services which will replace the services currently provided at in-patient accommodation in St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney. Such developments are in line with the key recommendations of the report on the development of the mental health services, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; (1984), which has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The plan to develop fully the new community service in conjunction with the reduction of in-patient numbers at St. Finan's Hospital, currently standing at approximately 250, is in the process of being implemented.  These numbers will need to be reduced significantly, through development of alternative community-based facilities as resources permit, before the board will be in a position to commence arrangements for the disposal of the property.</P>

      <P>Regular contact is maintained by EU representatives on the ground with pro-democracy groups in Burma.</P>
      <P>Developments in Burma, and the desire by the EU to see democratic legitimacy in that country, have been raised on a continuing basis with ASEAN.  As President of the Council, as I have already informed the House, I raised the matter of Burma at the ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting, on 22-23 July 1996, and the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conferences, on 24-25 July 1996, in Jakarta.</P>
      <P>The EU common position on Burma, which was adopted by the Council on 28 October 1996, provides for a ban on entry visas to EU member states for senior members of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and their families as well as for senior members of the military or the security forces who formulate. implement or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and their families; and the suspension of high-level bilateral governmental visits to Burma.</P>
      <P>In addition, the common position recalls the action that has already been taken by the EU. This action includes expulsion of all military personnel attached to the diplomatic representations of Burma in EU member states and the withdrawal of all military personnel attached to diplomatic representations of EU member states in Burma; an embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment; and the suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes.</P>
      <P>The EU common position states further that its implementation will be monitored by the Council and that, in the light of developments in Burma, further measures may need to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 13 December 1996, an EU declaration was issued which expressed deep concern at reports of <Col N="214" /> police brutality in the dispersing of recent student demonstrations in Burma and at the restrictions which have been placed on the movement of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  The EU reiterated its call on the SLORC to enter into meaningful dialogue with pro-democracy groups immediately to restore peace and to bring about national reconciliation.  It was also made clear that the EU would hold the SLORC fully responsible for the physical well-being of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>

      <P>This matter has been discussed with our EU partners.  Our ability to intervene on Mr. Vanunu's behalf is limited because he was tried and convicted in accordance with Israeli law and had full access to legal representation.

      <P>I am aware of the case of Alexander Nikitin. Mr. Nikitin is a former Captain in the Russian Navy, from which he retired in 1992.  He is currently employed by the Norwegian environmental organisation, Bellona, in which capacity he was co-author of a report on potential pollution dangers arising from Russian nuclear submarines in the Arctic.</P>
      <P>He was arrested on 6 February 1996 by the Russian federal security authorities (the FSB) and subsequently charged with espionage <i>inter alia,</i> on the basis that the report referred to above &mdash; then at draft stage &mdash; contained state secrets. He was held without trial and without bail.  He was released on 14 December pending trial.</P>
      <P>The case has attracted a good deal of concern, including that of the European Parliament, which has passed a number or resolutions on the subject.  I share these concerns and have raised them, in my capacity as EU Presidency, directly with Russian Foreign Minister Primakov during the EU Troika Ministerial meeting on 8 November.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor the situation closely together with EU partners.</P>

      <P>From 1988 to and including 1996, national lottery funding to a total of £2,739,000 has been allocated to my Department for the promotion of Irish cultural activities abroad. Since 1994, this has been supplemented annually by Exchequer funding.  Grants under this heading are made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the advice of the Cultural Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>Detailed information on the grants made from this funding for individual projects, from 1990, is voluminous; I will have it forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  Details of 1996 projects will be available in January 1997, and will be made available then.</P>
      <P>Commitments of £53,000 for future cultural projects have been made from the total allocation for 1996.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund has received lottery funding on three occasions.  In 1988, funding of £800,000 was allocated to the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund for programmes in Sudan, Mozambique, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.  In 1991, funding of £690,000 was made available to the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund for relief operations in Ethiopia, South Africa, Sudan, Bangladesh and Cambodia.  On 11 December 1996, an allocation of £1 million was approved by the Dáil from the national lottery.  A number of grants are being disbursed to support humanitarian activities in Rwanda, Liberia, Iraq, Tajikistan and Bulgaria.  A complete list of all these grants allocated from national lottery funding will be published in the 1996 Irish Aid annual report.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 68 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputies refer.  On my instructions, it is being monitored by the Irish Embassy in London.  An official of the Irish Embassy paid this person a consular visit during a round of prison visits between 18-20 November 1996.  His case was raised at a subsequent meeting between Embassy officials and the relevant British authorities.  In particular, representations were made regarding his categorisation as an exceptional risk prisoner and the conditions under which he is being held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British authorities have responded by stating that it is their view that this person warrants this categorisation and that his <Col N="218" /> conditions of imprisonment result from the category under which he is held.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that we will continue to monitor this person's case in the period ahead.  We will also continue to raise matters of humanitarian concern relating to the Republican prisoners with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference and the Irish Embassy in London.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The system of closed visits, which has been in operation since 1995 for Republican prisoners classified as exceptional risk, has been raised with the British authorities on many occasions, both within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference and through the Irish Embassy in London.  The Government has consistently taken the view that these prisoners should be permitted open visits, especially for family members and legal representatives.  Concern has been expressed about the humanitarian difficulties caused for these prisoners as a result of the closed visits rule, particularly in relation to family contact.</P>
      <P>The particular individual to which the Deputy refers was among a number of prisoners visited in a consular capacity by an officer of the Embassy in London between 18-20 November. On my instructions, the concerns expressed by these prisoners about the closed visits policy were raised again by Embassy officials during a recent meeting with the relevant British authorities.  I also raised the conditions of Republican prisoners classified as exceptional risk, including those prisoners on remand who are subject to closed visits, during the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held in Belfast on 20 November 1996.</P>
      <P>In response, the British authorities have stated that the application of the policy of closed visits is a function of these prisoners' categorisation as exceptional risk prisoners and that these prisoners' categorisation is periodically reviewed. They have further stated that a request for an open visit to a prisoner classified as exceptional risk should be made through the Governor of the relevant prison.  Each request is considered on its own merits.  An open visit is permitted only in exceptional circumstances which must be outlined in the request.</P>
      <P>I assure you that we will continue to pursue this matter with the British authorities in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total yield from stamp duty on credit cards in 1996 was £7.94 million.  However, as the annual charge is £15 per account, this implies 529, 175 accounts.  As more than one credit card can be issued on an account it is not possible to state definitively the number of persons in Ireland with credit cards.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that under section 17, Finance Act 1981, a credit card is a card issued by a bank.  Charge cards are issued by promoters, for example Diners Card, and have not been included in the above figures as the Deputy sought information in relation to credit cards only.  In addition there are also in-store cards which are offered by various retail outlets and given that these in-store cards are not liable to stamp duty, we have no data on these type of cards.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that capital allowances may be claimed by a taxpayer in connection with the construction of multistorey car parks provided that such car parks are wholly for the use of members of the public <Col N="220" /> generally or, in the Temple Bar area, wholly or mainly for such use.  Capital allowances are claimed under the self assessment system and are subject to audit.  When, during the course of an audit, an inspector discovers that the claim can not be justified because some at least of the car parking is not available to the public generally, he may claw back the capital allowances granted by way of a balancing charge on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a charge to tax in respect of a benefit-in-kind arises under section 117, Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>As regards car parking spaces, the factors necessary to establish the value of any benefit to an employee include: whether a car parking space is for the sole use of one employee or is also available for the use of clients and customers, whether the cost of a car parking space is included in the overall cost of office space, and whether the space is required as a necessity for the performance of the duties of the employee.</P>
      <P>While the provision of car parking spaces is a factor that would be taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners, there can be considerable administrative and technical difficulties in identifying the cost to an employer and value to an employee of the provision of a car parking space for each individual employee.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the effect on Irish coal dealers of coal smuggling from Northern Ireland to the Republic in view of the 12.5 per cent VAT rate levied in the Republic; the volume of illicit coal discovered as a result of this activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the commercial supply of coal by traders from Northern Ireland, where coal is taxed at 8 per cent.  There are no statistics available in relation to the irregular supply of coal in the State.</P>
      <P>The position is that, under the rules of the Single Market established on 1 January 1993, coal dealers based in Northern Ireland who sell to the general public in this State are obliged to register and account for Irish VAT on their intra-Community acquisitions and sales here.  Such traders therefore have the same obligations as other VAT-registered traders here and must charge VAT at 12.5 per cent on supplies of coal. Traders making intra-Community acquisitions receive the goods zero rated.  However, they must account for the relevant Irish VAT in their VAT return, but are entitled to take a simultaneous credit; VAT must be charged on all their supplies of goods in the normal way.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent abuse of the VAT system, a series of legislature and procedural arrangements were put in place as part of the Single Market regime.</P>
      <P>In particular, traders in each member state are obliged to furnish a quarterly return to their tax authorities of all their zero rated supplies to traders in other member states &mdash; these are called VIES returns here and ESL returns in the UK.  In addition, special mutual assistance arrangements facilitate the transmission of the material between national authorities so that traders' quarterly returns can be checked against the normal VAT returns of the traders in receipt of the supplies.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, as a result of complaints received in 1993 and 1994 about VAT evasion arising from cross-Border trading between here and Northern Ireland, a systematic programme of visits by Inspectors of Taxes to various targeted sectors around the country, including coal merchants, was carried out.  That programme resulted in the regularisation of the VAT status of the traders concerned, where such action was appropriate. The Revenue Commissioners continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Deputy that, if he has any specific information in regard to irregular supplies of coal, he should contact the Revenue <Col N="222" /> Commissioners, VAT Administration Branch, Indirect Taxes Division, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2, who will investigate the matter.  They will, of course, treat any such information received in the strictest confidence.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he can take to assist a person (details supplied) in County Meath who in good faith took a decision to sell a ten year old car and to qualify for the £1,000 vehicle registration tax repayment based on the scrappage scheme, but who subsequently discovered that although the car was in its tenth year, that the authorities considered that it could not be scrapped until after the date of first registration had passed in the tenth year; the number of cases involved in a similar difficulty; the steps, if any, he can take to allow such cases to be considered as qualifying under the scheme in view of the fact that the cars are registered in 1986 and scrapped in 1996, and are ten year-old cars; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is a legal requirement for repayment of VRT under the scrappage scheme that the scrapped car must have been registered not less than ten years before the date on which it is scrapped.  This requirement is well known both to members of the public and to the motor trade.</P>
      <P>A car which was first registered on a date in 1986 becomes ten years old on the corresponding date in 1996.  The vehicle referred to the Deputy fell short of the ten years age requirements by almost four months.  Consequently repayment was refused as the car did not qualify under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The applicant appealed this decision under the independent excise appeals procedure which was introduced on 1 January 1996.  The outcome was that the original decision to refuse the application was upheld both at the first stage appeal and subsequently following a hearing, by the Appeal Commissioners.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the Revenue Commissioners have adopted a common sense approach to the administration of the scheme; however, a change in the existing legislation would be required to allow vehicles of the type referred to by the Deputy to qualify under it.  I have no plans to make such a change.</P>
      <P>Up to date figures of the number of cases involved in a similar difficulty are not immediately available, but they would be insignificant in terms of the overall number of cars scrapped under the scheme.  I will arrange to have the actual figures communicated to the Deputy in due course.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that pensions from whatever source, including disablement pensions, have always been taxable under section 109 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. Disability benefit became a taxable source of income with effect from 6 April 1993 under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1992.</P>
      <P>Income tax statistics do not distinguish between the numbers of individuals who are liable to tax on pension income and on other income.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the number of individuals who pay tax on disablement pension.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that self-employed taxpayers are obliged to make a preliminary tax payment on or before I November each year.  Where the amount of preliminary tax paid is less than a certain amount &mdash; which is calculated by reference to either the taxpayers eventual liability &mdash; for that year or by reference to the tax liability for preceding years &mdash; interest is charged at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month or part of a month on any balance of tax found to be due on finalisation of the taxpayers liability for the year.  Where the preliminary tax payment is greater than the taxpayers ultimate liability, interest at the rate of 0.6 per cent per month is paid by the Revenue Commissioners on any resulting refund.</P>
      <P>The PAYE system is designed to be self regulating by spreading payments evenly over the year as far as possible so that, as a general rule, significant underpayments or overpayments are minimised.  Hence there is no legislation specifically imposing a charge to interest on underpaid PAYE by individual taxpayers or providing for its payment in cases where tax has been overpaid.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities report, <i>A Strategy for Equality</i>, states that &ldquo;at least 80 per cent of all transport and transport services purchased by Health Boards from 1st January 1997 for transporting clients must be wheelchair accessible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Accessible transport to health services for people with disabilities is provided either directly by the health boards or through voluntary agencies providing services on behalf of health boards.  Funding for this service is provided through lottery moneys and the capital funds which my Department makes available through the health boards.  In this regard I was able to provide funding this year to a number of organisations for people with disabilities to enhance their transport services.  In addition, health boards provide the motorised transport grant to people with disabilities to help them gain or retain employment.</P>
      <P>Funding will continue to be made available to develop the transport services for people with disabilities availing of the health services, as appropriate, in line with the recommendations of the commission.</P>

      <P>Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services for persons with a mental handicap in the period 1990-6 which has enabled health boards and voluntary organisations to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,300 day care places.  A sum of £2.9 million was allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board from the funding which was specifically made available for the development of new services.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the annual injection of funds into services to persons with a mental handicap over the past number of years has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as sources become available.  This commitment is outlined in both <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i></P>
      <P>The national intellectual disability database is now providing my Department, the health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies with infomation on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists for hospital treatment and the Government remains committed to the objective of further reducing waiting lists.  The total public in-patient waiting list at the end of September 1996 of 31,519 is 21 per cent lower than the figure of 40,130 in July 1993 before the begining of the waiting list initiative.</P>
      <P>However, I had been concerned that waiting lists for hospital treatment have risen over the past 12 months and, in line with my commitment to continue progress in this area, I made available an additional allocation of £5 million to tackle this problem.  This brings to £12 million the total funding provided in 1996 for the waiting list initiative.  The impact of the additional activity which is taking place as a result of this additional allocation is not reflected in the quarterly waiting list figures for the end of September.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>I have informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that the person concerned was tested on 2 March 1994 under the national blood screening programme which was introduced to screen all women who had received the anti-D product to identify those who were infected with hepatitis C.  The test was ELISA negative, and the person's general practitioner was notified accordingly.  A further test was referred to the board by the person's GP in March in 1996 under the national optional testing programme which was introduced to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions or blood products who might possibly have become infected with the virus through the receipt of such transfusions or products were given the option of being tested free of charge.  This test was also ELISA negative and this result was reported to the person's general practitioner immediately.  The board did not conduct any further testing for the hepatitis C virus in respect of this person, and did not refer her for treatment at St. James's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been treated in St. James's Hospital for a number of complaints.  She first attended the special hepatitis C clinic in July 1996, having been referred by her general practitioner who understood that a positive diagnosis for the virus had recently been made by the consultant in the clinic although this was not the case.  A further test was carried out by the consultant in order to reassure the person concerned and this test has also proved to be negative.</P>
      <P>The person's medical chart was available for the appointment of the person concerned at the ENT clinic on 30 August.  The chart was not available for her appointment in the hepatology clinic on 3 October.  Despite intensive searches, the chart could not be traced and a temporary chart was created.  On 9 December the chart reappeared in the medical records area and it has not been possible to ascertain its whereabouts during the intervening period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provisions of dental treatment services to eligible persons in the Dublin 3 area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the board that a screening for second class pupils of the school referred to in the question was arranged to take place in North Strand dental clinic on 1 July 1996. Due to the unavailability of the examining dentist on that day this screening was postponed to 12 August 1996.  As the screening was originally arranged through the school, the cancellation and rescheduling was also arranged through the school.  This was done approximately ten days before the date arranged and children did not attend on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the child referred to in the question was seen, the screening indicated a treatment need and a subsequent appointment was given for the afternoon of 11 September 1996.  On this <Col N="232" /> particular afternoon the board was unable to provide cover for the absent regular dental nurse. The appointment was cancelled and postponed to 24 October 1996.  During this appointment five fissure sealings were completed for the child.</P>
    <P>A subsequent appointment for 2 December 1996 was arranged.  On this date the dental nurse assigned to the clinic rang in sick at 9 a.m. and a substitute nurse was not available at such short notice.  Those patients for whom telephone numbers were available were contacted and advised of new appointment times.  It was not possible to advise others until they attended the clinic.  The telephone number on the chart of the child in this case was not in service and directory inquiries advised that the number was &ldquo;ex directory&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The board both understands and appreciates the frustration of patients and parents when appointments are cancelled at such short notice. It is something it dislikes doing and is always a matter of concern and frustration to the board also.  However, in order to perform many dental procedures effectively and safely, the dental surgeon and dental nurse operate closely as a team.  The absence of the dental nurse curtails this effectiveness to a greater or lesser degree. Frequently, it is not possible to perform some planned procedures in the time that has been allotted to them and postponement is the necessary option.</P>
    <P>The need to maintain the highest possible level of proper cross-infection control in dental surgeries is of paramount importance.  Without the assistance of a suitably trained nurse the level of these controls can diminish to a degree when both patient and operator can be put at risk.  The current advice of medical protection societies is that it could be imprudent for a dentist to operate alone and this advice might well be considered to carry even more weight where young children are being treated.</P>
    <P>The board wishes to again offer apologies for the inconvenience caused to the child and her family and hopes that future arrangements with the clinic will proceed more smoothly.</P>

      <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers group formed the basis for this examination of the home help services.  Following these discussions, the Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services. Tenders for this review have been received and a contract will be signed in January.  It is expected that the review will be completed in three to four months.</P>

I have been advised by the board that there are 1,224 children on the waiting list for secondary care orthodontic treatment in County Donegal.  At an average cost per case of £480, the cost of reducing the waiting list would be £587,520.</P>
      <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  The North-Western Health Board has a consultant in place and is consolidating and extending its orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff. This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
      <P>I will, in conjunction with the health boards, continue to develop the consultant led orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan.  The ultimate objective is to bring the level of service provision in line with the level of treatment need.</P>

      <P>Revenue and capital funding of £133,000 was provided to the South-Eastern Health Board by my Department in 1996 for the establishment of a new respite centre in Waterford.

It is hoped that the service will commence in early 1997 and will provide a service for people with a mental handicap and for people with physical disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Long-term illnesses for the purpose of the long-term illness scheme are specified by statutory instruments.  The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the <Col N="236" /> State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is known that there is a possibility of thromboembolism associated with the use of all oral contraceptives and that the risk can be higher in patients with predisposing factors.  The overall risk associated with oral contraceptives, however, is very small in absolute terms and the risk of venous thromboembolism with the use of any oral contraceptive is substantially less than in pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Data from epidemiological studies published last year suggested there may be a slight increase in risk from combined oral contraceptives containing desogestrel or gestodene.  The results of these studies, however, have not yet been fully scientifically evaluated.  Following an initial examination of the studies by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European Community, on which Ireland is represented by the Irish Medicines Board, the committee decided it was not appropriate to call for the withdrawal of combined oral contraceptives at that time.  However, it established an expert group to examine the situation further and this group is expected to report back to the committee early in the new year.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the situation is one which is the subject of ongoing review and monitoring by the Irish Medicines Board in association with the committee for proprietary medicinal products.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> According to the national sudden infant death register, which is maintained by the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association, the total number of deaths due to sudden infant death syndrome in 1994 was 40 and the figure for 1995 was 32.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I recently explained to the Deputy, current personnel policy for the health services provides that health agencies which are managing resources within allocation may fill non-consultant replacement posts without recourse to the Department.  A separate procedure applies to replacement consultant medical posts as they have to be reviewed in conjunction with Comhairle na nOspidéal, which is the statutory body responsible for, <i>inter alia</i>, regulating the number and type of consultant medical staff.</P>
      <P>When new service developments are approved, the costs of any additional staff are incorporated, as a matter of course, into the relevant agency's funding allocation.  For these reasons the information sought by the Deputy in relation to vacancies is not readily available in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services in Dublin.  Acute in-patient beds for those with mental illness in Dublin north city and county, for those with a mental handicap together with services for the elderly are provided by the board on the St. Ita's Hospital campus. A range of other services, out-patient clinics, day hospitals, day care centres, group homes and a vocational and sheltered employment facility, are also provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past three years substantial upgrading works have been carried out on the St. Ita's Hospital campus.  Between 1994 and 1995 a total of £500,000 was spent on upgrading which included a special capital allocation of £350,000 made available by my Department.  In 1996 my Department provided a further £250,000 while the board provided £60,000 from its own resources, which enabled further substantial upgrading to be carried out in all patient care areas throughout the hospital.  The bulk of this funding was expended on the upgrading of the <Col N="258" /> accommodation provided for persons with a mental handicap on the campus.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the standards of care provided for patients in psychiatric hospitals is carried out by the inspector of mental hospitals.  The inspector carries out annual inspections of all public psychiatric hospitals, including St. Ita's Hospital.  In his report for 1995, the publication of which is imminent, the inspector notes the enhancement of the overall appearance of clinical areas and also the improvement in staff morale in the hospital, but acknowledges that further improvements in standards are necessary.  The hospital is also visited by members of the Eastern Health Board and is inspected by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>In the light of the inspector's comments on his most recent visit to the hospital, which are generally complimentary, I do not accept that conditions on the hospital campus are deplorable. I am satisfied with its overall physical condition while recognising that there is still scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has been pursuing a policy of transferring mental health services from institutional settings to general hospitals and community care settings, in line with the recommendations of the report on the development of the mental health services, <i>Planning for the Future 1984,</i> which has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments.  Funding was recently approved for the refurbishment of accommodation at Beaumont Hospital to enable acute in-patient psychiatric services to be provided at the hospital as soon as possible.  It is the board's long-term objective to provide all acute psychiatry for the catchment population at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>My Department has been working closely with the Eastern Health Board to implement the proposals of the board as submitted in 1994 to transfer clients with a mental handicap to community settings, where appropriate, and to improve the accommodation and services available to those clients who need to be cared for in a more structured environment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the provision of health centres in the Galway area is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. My Department made a capital allocation to each of the health boards in 1996 for the development of health centres in their areas and each board has been developing health centres on the basis of priorities for development.  The health centres mentioned by the Deputy were not included in the priorities which were undertaken in 1996 by the Western Health Board.  The development of the board's priorities in 1997 will depend on available resources and I am not in a position at this stage to give a commitment on funding for 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 123, 124, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>A report of a World Health Organisation expert committee on oral health status and fluoride use states that laboratory research suggests that fluoride is most effective in caries prevention when a low level of flouride is constantly maintained in the oral cavity.  This effect is achieved by community water fluoridation programmes at 1.0 part per million. The report, <i>Flourides and Oral Health, Technical Report Series 846,</i> which was published in 1994, is available from the World Health Organisation in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The scientific evidence proving the effectiveness of water fluoridation in reducing tooth decay is overwhelming.  Extensive studies over the past 50 years have established that individuals whose drinking water is fluoridated show a reduction of up to 50 per cent.  As recently as 1992 a study comparing the decay level of 12 year old children in Dublin and Glasgow showed that the level of decay was 45 per cent lower in Dublin which is fluoridated compared to Glasgow which is non fluoridated.  A recent publication comparing the decay levels for 5 to 7 year old children in 23 countries in Europe shows that Ireland has the lowest level of decay for this age group.  It is also the country with the highest percentage of its population receiving fluoridated water.</P>
      <P>Major reviews of the evidence by leading medical scientists have shown time and again that the use of fluoride in drinking water is safe to human health.  The Department of Health and Human Services in the United States has reviewed all the relevant scientific information including that put forward by anti-fluoridationists.  This comprehensive review of the benefits and potential health risk of fluoride has concluded that the practice of fluoridating community water supplies is safe and effective. The public health service of the Department of Health and Human Services continues to recommend the fluoridation of community water supplies where naturally occurring fluoride levels are deficient.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Advisory Board has recently established a working group to consider the food safety implications of fluoride arising from its natural occurrence in the environment and its addition to public water supplies.</P>
      <P>At present fluoridation is used as a public health measure in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  There are plans to extend this programme to Northern Ireland in 1997.  It is also used in Switzerland and Spain.  Some European countries discontinued water fluoridation as a surplus of dentists began to appear.  Water fluoridation was not promoted in some European countries where there was little interest in preventive dentistry.</P>

      <Quest>with regard to the rights of people with a disability as referred to in the reply to Question No. 59 of 6 November 1996 by Deputy Callely, if his attention has been drawn to the totally inadequate funding of services for people with a disability, particularly people with a mental handicap; the required level of funding to meet the 1997 demands; the actual level of funding for 1996; and the anticipated level of funding for 1997.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-96 which was enabled health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies to put in place over 1,000 additional residential-respite places and 2,300 day care places.  The estimated total revenue expenditure on services for persons with a mental handicap increased from £162 million in 1990 to £250 million in 1995.  Details of the total expenditure for 1996 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database is now providing my Department, the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies with information on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period.  I hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.  My priority is to ensure that provisions can be made to meet the needs of those who are currently without a service.</P>
      <P>In the period 1993-96 additional funding of £10.55 million was made available to develop services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap or physical-sensory disability awaiting services. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.  The Government is committed under both the health strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of services as resources become available.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to give the Deputy any information in relation to the level of additional funding for 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Over the last five years, a nutritional health promotion framework for action has been implemented by my Department to improve the nutritional status of the Irish population and help reduce the incidence of diet-related disease.  This has involved development at community level, in schools, the workplace and health care facilities. In this context, my Department has worked with the food industry and with relevant voluntary and professional groups.</P>
      <P>My Department's healthy eating policy involves the ongoing promotion of the healthy eating guidelines which seek to encourage Irish people to eat a wide variety of foods in line with current recommendations.  This is achieved through ongoing healthy eating initiatives like national healthy eating week, which focuses on a different theme each year.  The policy also embraces continuing nutrition education for health professionals and expanding community based healthy eating initiatives for lower income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious, however, of the understandable food safety anxieties felt by consumers in the wake of recent reports.  The Deputy will be aware that a comprehensive review of the food control arrangements in operation in Ireland took place this year.  As a <Col N="265" /> result of that review the Government decided to establish the independent Food Safety Board. The establishment of the new board must await the passing of the necessary legislation but, meanwhile, I have established an interim board which is making progress towards the necessary administrative and other arrangements.</P>
    <P>While the new board has research, co-ordination and advisory functions, its primary function is its audit-supervisory role in relation to other food control agencies.  This will enable it to assess the effectiveness and adequacy of controls operated by those other agencies.  The new board will have all the powers necessary to ensure compliance with the highest standards and it will be required to publish the reports of those audits. I am satisfied that by making information available in this way the board will contribute significantly to the level of consumer confidence in Irish food.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 136, 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a copy of the material prepared by the individual in question was sent to the chief medical officer of my Department who acknowledged receipt on 9 May 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> In April this year, I asked for a report from the Food Safety Advisory Board, FSAB, on the issue of BSE and the possible link with CJD and, more particularly, with new variant CID, nvCJD.  The report reviewed the available evidence at that time and was satisfied that all necessary precautions were in place.  However, the FSAB was aware that further information was emerging and called for measures to monitor this and for more research.</P>
    <P>At my request, the FSAB has been keeping the position under review and has considered all the new research evidence and other material available on the subject, including the material to which the Deputy refers and the report by Professor Anderson, July 1996, which suggested the possibility of maternal transmission.  In addition, I have established an expert advisory group on CJD for the purpose of advising me on all medical, scientific and public health questions relating to this disease and on research strategies.</P>
    <P>I have also established an active national surveillance system for CJD, based around two national reference centres in Beaumont and Cork University Hospitals.  This system is designed to increase awareness of the disease and to improve reporting arrangements.  In that context, I have also designated CJD and nvCJD as notifiable diseases.</P>
    <P>As to the question of pressure being brought to bear on a person to resign, I point out to the Deputy that staff matters are an executive function of the chief executive officer of each health board under the Health act and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in such issues.  If the person concerned has any grievance he should raise it with the chief executive officer of the health board, but I understand that no such grievance has been raised to date.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board concerning this case and have been assured that the application has been reviewed on hardship grounds.  However, as the person's income was substantially over the standard income guidelines used to assist in determining eligibility, the health board considered that the applicant would not be entitled to a medical card <Col N="267" /> on hardship grounds.  Should the circumstances of the applicant change, a fresh application would be treated in a sympathetic manner by the health board.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 150, 151 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap. Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services for persons with a mental handicap in the period 1990-96 which has enabled health boards and voluntary organisations to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,300 day care places.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the annual injection of funds into services to persons with a mental handicap over the past number of years has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as resources become available.  This commitment is outlined in both <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i></P>
      <P>I hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the National Intellectual Disability Database.  My priority is to ensure that provision can be made to meet the needs of those who are currently without a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue of an embargo on posts, the current recruitment restrictions applicable to the health service do not constitute an embargo. Since the restriction on public service recruitment, 1,200 additional posts, including 339 posts for services for persons with a physical disability or a mental handicap, were allocated to health agencies in 1995 and 600 posts, including 171 for persons with a physical disability or a mental handicap, were similarly allocated in 1996. Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Finance concerning funding and the posts associated with such funding for 1997.  Until these discussions are <Col N="269" /> concluded it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>
    <P>When calculating health service personnel numbers, only directly funded health agencies are included.  Funding for section 65 agencies is provided by way of health board budgets and as such, their employees are not included in the census.</P>

    <P>Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services for persons with a mental handicap in the period 1990-6 which has enabled health boards and voluntary organisations to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,300 day care places.  The number of places provided in any year is related to the level of funding available.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Eastern Health Board area additional revenue funding of £1.4 million was made available to the Eastern Health Board in 1996 which has enabled it to put in place 21 new residential/respite places, 112 new day care places and to further enhance the level of home support services available in the region.  Capital funding of £0.91 million was made available to the eastern region to support the additional services which were put in place this year.  In addition to this capital funding, £2 million is being made available to the board over a two year period to provide additional residential facilities on the southside of the city.</P>
    <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the different community care areas of the eastern region is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.  The allocation of the additional revenue for new services within the health board area is agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee, which is representative of the health board, the voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap, on the basis of priority need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The number of patients accommodated in acute psychiatric units and psychiatric hospitals at the end of 1994, the most recent year for which published figures are available, was 5,581.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the study group on the development of the mental health services, <i>Planning For the Future,</i> which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive <Col N="271" /> governments, forms the blueprint for the development of mental health services into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a shift in the delivery of services for those with mental illness from the predominantly institutional to a community based approach in the provision of care was a key recommendation of the report. This approach is underpinned in my Department's strategy for effective healthcare, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i></P>
    <P>In line with this recommendation health boards, which are responsible for the delivery of mental health services, are developing a comprehensive range of community based services, including, day hospitals, day centres, outpatient clinics and community residential accommodation, to replace services previously provided by psychiatric hospitals.  Other therapeutic interventions which have altered the delivery of mental health services include domiciliary assessment, community nursing and home support, respite care and clinical rehabilitation services.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the continued development by health boards of community based services and I have provided additional capital and revenue funding in 1995 and 1996 to underpin this commitment.  I am satisfied that significant progress is being made in providing a service which is comprehensive, integrated with other health services and based, as far as possible, in the community.</P>

      <P>The legal advice which I have received <Col N="273" /> is that countries such as Paraguay which operate a dual adoption system make a clear distinction between the two types of adoption decree that may be made in respect of a child.  I have been advised to respect that distinction and not seek to accord a simple or ordinary adoption a legal status beyond which it has under the law of the country where it was granted.  However, my Department is in the process of obtaining a comprehensive legal opinion from a lawyer in Paraguay with expertise in adoption law on certain aspects of that law.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and our Embassy in Argentina is assisting my Department in this regard and it is expected that this opinion will be available shortly.  If this brings to light new information which is in conflict with our present understanding of the nature of simple or ordinary adoptions, then the matter will be examined further.</P>
      <P>The various practical difficulties being experienced by the adoptive parents concerned were considered at a recent meeting of Cabinet Committee on Children's Services, which decided to establish an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of my Department to examine possible ways in which those difficulties might be addressed.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 October 1996 is in the range of £205.92 &mdash; £218.01 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
      <P>The latest available details of the rate of gratuities applying to part-time home helps and the numbers in each board are given in Table 1 as follows.  With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The actual number of home help hours to be provided is assessed individually for each client.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of the service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Southern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services, in its functional area.  The report of the study group on the development of the mental health services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments, recommended that the emphasis on the management of chemical dependency problems should be on community-based interventions rather than specialist in-patient treatment.  It is the policy of the Southern Health Board to develop its treatment facilities for chemical dependency in line with this recommendation and I am informed by the board that there is at present a range of treatment and rehabilitation services provided by both the board itself and voluntary and private agencies.</P>

    <P>The Southern Health Board's approach has been to develop a service where dependency and addiction arising from alcohol and substance misuse should be treated in specialist chemical dependency units on an out-patient basis rather than in a psychiatric hospital.  The board's model for this can be found in Arbour House in Cork which was founded in 1984.  The success of the out-patient treatment provided at Arbour House is reflected in the continuing decline in the numbers of patients admitted for treatment to the board's psychiatric hospitals in Cork.  The board's plans for the further development of the service includes the establishment in Kerry of a treatment unit based on the Arbour House model.  The board's psychiatric hospitals provide treatment for the small number of patients who do not respond to out-patient care.  I am informed by the board that it has established a sub-committee to examine treatment and rehabilitation needs in its functional area and that the Irish College of General Practitioners is represented on the sub-committee.  The Director <Col N="276" /> of Arbour House has also met with medical and administrative staff of the board's general practitioner unit in order to develop close liaison and co-ordination with general practitioners in the area.  The board's staff continue to be available to meet with any general practitioner who is experiencing difficulties in referring patients for treatment.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that I have made available a total of £12 million in 1996 to address the problem of long waiting times for hospital treatment.  The waiting list for ophthalmology procedures, including cataract operations is one of the areas which has benefited from this funding.  The reduction of waiting times will continue to be a priority for the Government.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the important role which Ennis General Hospital plays in the delivery of hospital services to the people of County Clare and I am committed to further improving these services.  As part of the Mid-Western Health Board's acute hospital strategy of providing specialist services locally, three new clinical specialities were introduced earlier this year to Ennis General Hospital on both an out-patient and day care basis.  These were, urology, genitourinary medicine and gynaecology.  It is also planned, as part of this strategy, to introduce a specialist day care oral surgery service.  A project team was established earlier this year to draw up a brief for the development of an acute Psychiatric Unit to be based at Ennis General Hospital.  The preliminary brief for this development is now being considered by the Mid-Western Health Board and I look forward to receiving it.</P>
      <P>In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on overall levels of service provided in general hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.  This is a reflection of the major changes in medical practice which have resulted in a reduction in the length of stay for in-patient care and the marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at out-patient level.  In looking at acute hospital service delivery I feel it is inappropriate to focus solely on in-patient beds as a measure of hospital resources. The emphasise is on overall activity levels and throughput, whether this is achieved by in-patient care or out-patient attendances.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community contains a wide range of recommendations for the provision of services, including health services, to the travelling community.  In authorising publication of the report of the task force, the Government decided that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should convene a group of officials to consider the implementation of the report and to report back to Government.  The report of the group was submitted to Government on 26 March 1996.  The Government has decided, in principle, to proceed with the implementation of the report.  A group of officials within my own Department is examining the implementation of the recommendations of the task force in relation to travellers' health.  The travellers health advisory committee comprising representatives of the health boards, the travelling community and my Department will be established in the near future with a view to publishing a policy statement on travellers health.  This policy statement will take account of the recommendations of the task force and build on successful initiatives already in place.</P>

      <P>The 1996 assessment by local authorities showed that 2,501 persons were homeless at 29 March 1996.  Details are given in Part IX of my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin for the September 1996 quarter which is being published today.  Copies of the <Col N="284" /> bulletin are being sent to the Oireachtas Library. Measures taken in recent years which directly or indirectly assist in the provision of accommodation for homeless people include the following: the expansion of the local authority housing programme from 1,000 &lsquo;starts&rsquo; in 1992 to some 3,900 in 1995 and 1996, which benefits approved applicants, including the homeless, for local authority housing; increased capital funding for voluntary bodies providing housing accommodation, a substantial part of which is accommodation for homeless people; increased funding for recoupment by my Department to local authorities in respect of expenditure under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 on accommodation of homeless persons; on-going funding for the emergency hostel at Lower Grangegorman in Dublin, operated by the Salvation Army; and the introduction of an after-hours referral service for homeless people in the Dublin-Kildare-Wicklow area seeking accommodation outside normal opening hours.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Homelessness Initiative, which I launched in December 1995, got under way in 1996.  New administrative structures and arrangements have been established, involving the statutory agencies and voluntary bodies providing services to homeless people, to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for the homeless in the Dublin area where the problem is greatest.  Under the initiative, funding has been made available through Dublin Corporation towards the cost of settlement and hostel-based care and support services operated by voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>A range of actions is being pursued for the improved management and/or reduction of nutients, including phosphorus, with a view to tackling the problem of lake eutrophication. These actions include: promotion of the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution launched jointly in July 1996 by the Ministers for the Environment and Agriculture, Food and Forestry; the amendment &mdash; in the Waste Management Act, 1996 &mdash; of the Water Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1990, allowing local authorities to impose statutory controls in respect of nutrients, including <Col N="285" /> phosphorus, where warranted for the purposes of restoring or protecting water quality; the launch on 13 December 1996 of revised Teagasc recommended application rates for phosphorus fertilisers for grassland; the extension, since 3 September 1996, of the integrated pollution control licensing system under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to new intensive agricultural activities in the pig and poultry sectors; the ongoing implementation by my Department, in conjunction with local authorities, of the major programme of capital investment, entailing estimated expenditure of £1.3 billion by 2005, on upgrading sewage treatment facilities so as to meet the requirement of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.  As part of this programme, phosphorus reduction facilities will be provided by 31 December 1998 for sewage discharges from Athlone, Nenagh, Tullamore, Killarney, Longford and Cavan, as well as other smaller towns, with significant benefits for water quality in Loughs Derg, Leane, Oughter and Ree. These facilities will significantly reduce phosphorus loadings from sewage, and the imposition by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency of controls, as appropriate, in respect of phosphorus discharges from industrial activities through the exercise of their statutory licensing control functions.</P>
      <P>To provide better co-ordination for the above actions, and to intensify efforts at protecting the vulnerable water quality of lakes, my Department in finalising a lake catchment management strategy.  This will aim to encourage an integrated approach to catchment management, based on the co-operation of all economic and other interests involved.  The situation will be kept under review in the light of ongoing assessment of lake water quality trends and further actions will be developed, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>An application for funding for a 20 bay temporary halting site at Blackglen Road, Sandyford, County Dublin, was received from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on 2 May 1995 and approval, subject to some technical modifications, was given on 16 May 1995.  Revised proposals were received from the Council on 14 June 1995 and were approved by my Department on 23 June 1995.  In mid-November this year, three persons were incorrectly informed that no proposals for funding had been received for the halting site at Blackglen Road.  The error was <Col N="287" /> discovered on Wednesday, 27 November, and letters with the correct information issued on Thursday, 28 November.  In addition, the persons concerned were contacted by telephone between Wednesday, 27 November and Friday, 29 November and the Department's apologies and the correct information were conveyed to them. Primary responsibility in relation to the location of halting sites rests with the local authority.  In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that development of the site in question is now the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, I do not consider that a meeting, as suggested, would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The design for this 30-house scheme was received in my Department in mid 1993 and was approved by Galway County Council in May 1994.  Because of the large diameter watermains needed to meet downstream demand, the scheme is an expensive one, estimated to cost £210,000.  For this reason, the scheme has to be considered in the context of the funding available from the European Regional Development Fund for the development of certain group water schemes. Having regard to existing level of commitments in respect of such funding, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve the scheme.</P>

      <P>Policy in relation to the provision of signals to assist visually impaired people at locations where traffic signals are provided is set out in the traffic signs manual which I launched recently and which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The manual advises that audible signals can be provided at non-junction pedestrian phases to indicate the green man period for the benefit of the visually impaired, if there is no danger of the unit being heard at adjacent signalised pedestrian crossings.  Where it is considered impracticable to install audible signals, for example at junctions where traffic lights contain more than one pedestrial phase, it may be desirable to provide tactile signals &mdash; a knurled knob mounted <Col N="288" /> beneath the push button box which vibrates when the steady green man is shown.</P>

      <P>A total of £51.956 million from the national lottery surplus has been allocated to my Department since March 1987 in respect of the following schemes: (1) amenities/recreational facilities grants scheme &mdash; from 1987 to 1993 &mdash; (2) local authority library service &mdash; since 1998 &mdash; (3) Dublin millennium celebrations &mdash; 1988 only &mdash; (4) provision and renovation of swimming pools &mdash; since 1991 &mdash; and (5) provision of communal facilities in voluntary housing projects &mdash; since 1991.  Details of grant payments under the above schemes are listed in the Appropriation Accounts for the years 1987 to 1995.  Payments under schemes (4) and (5) in 1991, which are not available in the Appropriation Account for that year, and payments under schemes (2), (4) and (5) in 1996, are set out in the following tables. Provision has been made in my Department's Estimates for 1997 for expenditure from the national lottery surplus on three schemes &mdash; £2.68 million for public libraries, £3.5 million for the provision and renovation of swimming pools and £1.033 million for communal facilities in voluntary housing projects.</P>

      <P>Cohesion Funding of £2.2 million was approved by the European Commission for stage 1 of the Westport Sewerage Scheme in March 1994.  Stage 1 provides for the planning and design of the scheme, investigation contracts, land acquisition and the procurement and processing of tenders. In the light of recent progress on the acquisition of a site for the treatment plant, the European Commission, at a recent Cohesion Fund Monitoring meeting, indicated that they would be prepared to modify the Stage 1 decision to take account of the revised completion date of 31 December 1997 for this stage.  Accordingly, the Commission no longer propose to close off the application.  A further application for Cohesion Fund assistance for the construction of the scheme will be submitted to the Commission next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1994 set out the standard information required in connection with an application for planning permission.  They do not contain any requirement for tests of the kind referred to but it is a matter for the planning authority, in any particular case to decide what further information may be appropriate, and the significance to be attached to such information in reaching a decision.  My Department's guidelines for planning authorities on &ldquo;Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures&rdquo;, &mdash; copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library &mdash; contain advice for planning authorities in relation to planning applications for such development but make no reference to radon as it was not considered to be a relevant issue in relation to telecommunications systems.  No guidelines have been issued in relation to the planning aspects of electricity installations.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, a body under the aegis of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, is responsible for radon detection and measurement and provides advice on such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Road Accident Facts 1995&rdquo;, published by the National Roads Authority, indicates that County Wexford has an accident rate above the national average &mdash; 2.5 accidents per 1,000 population, compared to 2.3 nationally.  It is also a fact that, nationally, motorcyclists account for a disproportionately high level of all road accident fatalities &mdash; 13 per cent in 1995.  I understand that a recent report to Wexford County Council provided information about road accidents in the county and highlighted a high rate of motorcycle accidents.</P>
      <P>When I launched a new national road safety campaign in May this year, I placed great emphasis on ensuring that all agencies involved should work together to increase the effectiveness of their enforcement, education, engineering and encouragement measures.  I took the initiative of inviting local authorities to become more actively involved in road safety by establishing local working groups which could provide a forum for co-operation and co-ordination between all involved at local level including local authorities, gardaí, health professionals and teachers.  Local groups of this kind would be well placed to address local trends and variations in accident types and causes, and to devise response measures.</P>
      <P>At national level, recent road safety measures include the introduction of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences; the publication of a guide to road safety engineering; the issue of a new traffic signs manual; and new TV and radio advertising campaigns.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council's TV and radio advertisements which focus on speeding and drink driving are aimed at all drivers, including motorcyclists.  The council also circulates widely a safety information leaflet for motorcyclists called &ldquo;This is Your Bike&rdquo;.  <i>The Rules of the Road,</i> published by my Department, also provide advice on good road user behaviour for motorcyclists. Regulations made in 1993 introduced new improved standards in relation to the compulsory wearing of safety helmets by motor cyclists and pillion passengers.  I hope that the combined efforts of the responsible agencies at national and local level, particularly their enforcement and education measures, will influence the driving behaviour of motorcyclists and help in reducing the high number of motorcycle accidents.</P>

The law on the matter is contained in section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended.  In the preparation of their development plans and in their assessment of particular planning applications, planning authorities can also include objectives or conditions, as appropriate, which will afford protection to trees.  Guidelines for planning authorities on tree preservation were issued by my Department in March 1994 and are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993 places a statutory obligation on landowners and occupiers to ensure that roadside structures, trees, shrubs etc. do not present a danger to road users.  Road authorities can take action where they consider a hazard exists.</P>

Pending the enactment of the legislation, local authorities have been requested to initiate the preparation of local traveller accommodation programmes and to push ahead with the provision of accommodation for travellers.  Accommodation for travellers is provided by local authorities in serviced residential caravan parks, group housing schemes and in standard houses provided under their ongoing local authority housing programme.  A total of £6.5 million was recouped to local authorities in 1996 in respect of the construction of serviced residential caravan parks and group housing schemes for travellers.  The capital allocation for 1997 for these purposes is £11 million.</P>
      <P>Ten serviced residential caravan parks were completed in 1996 providing 57 new bays and a further 26 redeveloped bays.  Six further projects are in progress which will redevelop and additional 98 bays and provide 70 new bays.

The development of the Castlebar campus of Galway Regional Technical College is a new and unique concept in the regional technical college sector in Ireland.

Pending this review of the development, it would be premature to make decisions on the question of a fully independent regional technical college for Castlebar.  A sum in excess of £2.3 million has been expended to date on third level capital developments at the Castlebar campus of Galway Regional Technical College.

      <P>I am aware of the growth in population in the Lucan area generally and I accept the need for additional school accommodation at both primary and post-primary level in the area.  At primary level, a major extension has been agreed for Archbishop Ryan national school, Balgaddy, which serves the new parish of Lucan South. Additional permanent accommodation has been approved for all three post-primary schools in Lucan and architectural planning is proceeding in all cases.  In addition, the proposed siting in Lucan of the all-Irish community college to serve the west Dublin-north Kildare area will further ease the pressure for places at second level in the area. I am confident that the completion of these projects will ensure that there will be sufficient pupil places available in the Lucan area to meet the projected demand.</P>

      <P>The question of replacing or refurbishing the national school at Wood Road, Ardara is under consideration within my Department.  A decision on the matter will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.  I included a refurbishment project for Leabgarrow national school, Arranmore Island, in my Department's 1996 list of primary school projects for planning. The architectural planning for this project is now well advanced.  When the contract documentation is finalised, a decision on the timing of the tender process will be taken in light of available funds. My Department has no plans for improvement works at Aphort national school, Arranmore.</P>

Arising from a detailed review of security arrangements, new internal control procedures have been put in place in each of these facilities. These measures have already contributed to a reduction in the level of absconding from the centres in question.  My Department is also considering the need for stronger physical security arrangements to supplement internal control procedures.  A detailed report on the feasibility or proposed improved arrangements has just been received in my Department.  The report in question also assessed the capacity of the Lusk complex to accommodate additional provision for young offenders in the context of developments proposed under the Children Bill, 1996.

      <P>to advise the Minister on actions to be undertaken in the interim prriod and, where appropriate, to undertake any such actions which it considers necessary to assist in putting in place a single, nationally and internationally accepted, certification structure covering all extra-university third level and all further and continuing education and training programmes including advice on the plans, programmes and budgets necessary for the carrying out of the function of TEASTAS as decided by the Government.</P>

The objective of the early start pre-school project is to expose young children to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227, 232 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>I asked the Higher Education Authority in 1995 to establish an international review team to advise on whether the Dublin Institute of Technology should be given the power to award its own degrees.  The establishment of the review team was a further strong indication of my commitment to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The review team reported this summer and recommended that degree-awarding powers should be granted to the Dublin Institute of Technology with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a meeting with representatives of the Dublin Institute of Technology on Thursday, 12 December, I indicated my intention to make an order to confer degree awarding powers on the <Col N="308" /> Institute from the 1998-99 academic year as recommended by the review team.  The relevant order is subject to the provisions of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>Degree awarding powers for the Dublin Institute of Technology will be within the policy framework set out in the White Paper on Education <i>Charting Our Education Future.</i></P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Universities Bill, now before the Dáil, provides a mechanism by which an institution can attain university status.  This is the first time that a formal mechanism, by which an institution may become a university, is being placed on a statutory basis.  If, in the future, moving to university status enhances the mission of the Dublin Institute of Technology, then section 9 of the Universities Bill provides an appropriate mechanism for achieving this.</P>

      <P>I am not yet in a position to say whether the capitation grant for primary schools will be further increased in 1997.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some schools experience difficulties from time to time in meeting the costs of heating, cleaning, insurance, etc., and that capitation funding may sometimes have to be augmented by local fundraising.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that since taking office, funding of primary schools has been as one of my main priorities.</P>
      <P>When I took office the standard rate of capitation grant stood at £28 per pupil.  I have succeeded in securing substantial increases in the level of this grant each year, with the result that the standard rate of grant now stands at £45 per pupil.  This represents an increase of more than 60 per cent over a four year period.  In schools designated as disadvantaged, the rate of grant has increased from £45 to £75 over the same period, an increase of two thirds.</P>
      <P>I have also introduced a major improvement in the special capitation rates payable in respect of pupils attending special classes and special schools, and additional resources have also been made available to schools in areas of disadvantage.  The provision of adequate resources for primary education will continue to be one of my main priorities.</P>

Matters in relation to school discipline and the selection and enrolment of pupils are matters for individual school authorities and I do not have the legal authority to interfere in decisions made by schools in these areas.</P>
      <P>The pupil in question was excluded from school in May 1992 for a serious breach of the school code of behaviour.  My Department through its guidelines on school discipline lays considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.  Where parents are dissatisfied with disciplinary decisions, it is open to them to appeal the decision to the board of management of the school involved.  My Department has made inquiries in the matter and I understand that the appeals procedure was followed and that the parents met with and made representations to the board of management of the school concerned.  However, the earlier decision to exclude the pupil was upheld by the board.</P>

      <P>My Department does not receive proposals in relation to staff appointments in the Higher Education Authority sector.  In the regional technical college-DIT sector, appointments to post are made by individual colleges within overall allocations of posts determined by my Department mainly in the context of the college's approved programmes and budgets for the coming academic year.  It is not the practice to sanction the appointment of individual staff in these sectors.</P>

    <P>In relation to the Army Apprentice School, my Department is not in receipt of any proposals for permanent staff appointments.  With regard to the <Col N="311" /> Tourism College, Killybegs, my Department received a proposal in early 1995 for eight permanent whole-time staff appointments.  This request was responded to shortly afterwards.  Six of the staff in question are eligible part-time post holders with between three and ten years experience.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two Colleges of Education For Home Economics, my Department has received proposals from St. Catherine's for seven permanent whole-time posts and from St. Angela's for 14 permanent whole-time posts. These requests have been received and responded to as quickly as possible at various times since 1987.  The staff in question have been in a temporary capacity for between one and nine years.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the terms of the Resolution in question.</P>
      <P>The sentiments expressed in that resolution were strongly reflected in the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee. Significant progress has already been made in implementing those recommendations across the entire spectrum of special needs and my Department is continuing this process on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>
      <P>In the case of children with special needs in mainstream education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I have also allocated an additional 98 remedial teachers at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have allocated 39 resource teachers to primary schools to provide special support to children with certain disabilities attending ordinary classes.  A further 56 resource teachers have been appointed at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy of my decision to appoint two additional teachers to the visiting teacher service in the current year.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with special needs.  A fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures which have already been taken to implement the SERC report and the commitment outlined in the White Paper are entirely consistent with and supportive of the sentiments expressed in the resolution to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>A building project for this school has been included in my Department's capital building programme for 1996.  The current position with regard to the proposed extension at the school is that the planning work is completed and the contract documentation is now ready.  A decision on the timing of the tender and contract processes must be taken in light of existing contractual commitments and the funds which will be available in 1997.  Both of these matters are under consideration at present and I expect that the process will be completed shortly.  At that stage, I will be in a position to take a decision on the tender process for the school.  Improvement works to the school yard are included in the project.</P>

      <P>Under the 1996 higher education grants scheme, independent mature students are defined to be mature students who are not ordinarily resident at home with their parents.  Their entitlement to a grant is assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The address of independent mature students for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles <Col N="318" /> of the college, the adjacent rate of grant is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.  However, where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college, local authorities can regard that address as the normal residence of the student.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the student's residence for the purpose of attending college is within 15 miles of the college. Therefore, the adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, as St. Kevin's school has a teaching staff of fourteen teachers, it is not possible to sanction the appointment of a full-time caretaker to the school.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress a phased programme of assistance by way of a supplementary capitation grant for the provision of caretaking and clerical services in schools was introduced from 1 September 1992.  St. Kevin's school qualifies for a grant of £15 per pupil per annum, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500, towards the cost of caretaking services.

      <P>A new office premises for my Department's probation and welfare service will be opening shortly at the location referred to by the Deputy at Poppintree Mall, Finglas, Dublin 11.  The premises will be assigned to my Department by the Office of Public Works as is normal practice for State sector offices.  Permission was granted on 26 July 1994 by Dublin Corporation planning department for a change of use of the premises from recreational use to Government offices to which the public will have access.</P>
      <P>The premises will accommodate a team of probation staff &mdash; that is, one senior probation and welfare officer and five or six probation and welfare officers &mdash; dealing with clients from Finglas and it's environs.  It will also provide space for group meetings and activity.  Clients of the service will visit the office as required and officers based there will also visit clients in their homes.</P>
      <P>The number of clients attending the office will be determined by the numbers placed on supervision to the probation and welfare service by the courts.  All clients would not be in attendance at the same time.  The frequency of attendance at the offices is determined by the nature of the client's offence and their circumstances.</P>
      <P>The establishment of local offices for the probation and welfare service is in keeping with my Department's policy as set down in the policy document, &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo;, which was published in June 1994.  Similar local offices have been established in other locations in the periphery of Dublin city.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort has been made to ensure that this new accommodation will not have any negative impact on local business or the surrounding areas. In fact, probation and welfare service staff have already been in discussion with some local interests to reassure them in this matter.</P>

      <P>Shelton Abbey is located approximately three miles from Arklow town and on return from periods of release, all offenders are collected in the town by Shelton Abbey staff in official prison transport.  I am advised by the prison governor that taxis have not been used at Shelton Abbey for this purpose since 1986 and even prior to that year were only used on an exceptional basis.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union brought within the single framework of the treaty aspects of foreign and security policy and of justice and home affairs which are concerned with migration and migration management policies.  It is recognised by all member states that the development of a comprehensive approach to migration pressures requires a combination of policies in related areas.  It requires also co-ordination in traditional areas of activity including in social policy and in trade, co-operation and development instruments.</P>
      <P>In so far as the justice and home affairs area is concerned, Title VI of the treaty sets out the obligations which member states have assumed to co-operate in a number of areas identified as being of &ldquo;common interest&rdquo;, including immigration policy.  It also sets out the rules and procedures for co-operation and establishes the respective roles of the member states, the Commission and the European Parliament.  It allows, where immigration is concerned, for all member states and the Commission to come forward with initiatives, for the European Parliament to be informed and consulted and for instruments of co-operation to be adopted.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the primary objective of the Irish Presidency in the area of immigration policy in Title VI was to maintain continuity with the work initiated by past Presidencies, having regard to priorities identified by the Council.  A particular emphasis was put on examining whether the potential offered by the Treaty on European Union for practical co-operation is being exploited to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above, member states continued their exchanges on migration matters generally.  Contacts were continued with third <Col N="328" /> countries and, for the first time, significant contacts with the United States on issues of mutual interest were developed within the framework of the New Transatlantic Agenda.</P>

      <P>Prisoners are escorted outside prison for a number of reasons, apart from court appearances and prison transfers, including compassionate outings to a family funeral or to visit a sick relative, attendance at training courses and attendance at hospital for out-patient or in-patient treatment. Such escorts are a normal part of the day-to-day operation of the prison system.</P>
      <P>The costs involved in providing these escorts comprise the remuneration of the escorting officers and some transport costs.

      <P>The late mother of the person concerned was in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension which is a means-tested payment.  When assessing a person's means for pension purposes the Department must take account of any savings, investments, property or income, including any other pension, which the person may have.  Old age non-contributory pension application forms include a request to notify the Department of all means held at date of application and of all increases in such means subsequently.</P>
      <P>Personal representatives of deceased non-contributory social welfare pensioners are legally obliged to inform my Department beforehand of their intention to distribute the estate.  In December 1995, following receipt of the schedule of assets of the deceased person concerned, it emerged that the person had a significant sum of capital which had not been disclosed to the Department, at the initial means investigation stage or subsequently, as is required under the legislation.</P>
      <P>In the light of this, her pension entitlement was reviewed by the Department and it was decided on the basis of the information available that the deceased person should not have been entitled to any old age non-contributory pension.  An overpayment of £5,487.30 has arisen as a result of this revised decision.  The personal representative was notified of his right of appeal against, but he has not done so.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Department's Code of Practice on Overpayments, the personal representative and his solicitor have also been notified of the amount of the overpayment due and have been asked for their response to the Department's proposal for recovery by way of lump-sum repayment from the assets of the estate.  No response has been received by the Department so far.  In accordance with the normal practice in such cases, the Department must now consider legal proceedings to recover the overpayment due.</P>
      <P>In view of the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy, I am arranging for an inspector of the Department to contact the people concerned before taking any further action.</P>

      <P>On 2 September 1992 the person concerned applied for equal treatment arrears on her unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims for herself and her four children.  She was subsequently paid £8,964.20 which included an amount of £2,351.74 for her two eligible children, both born prior to the introduction of the equality legislation in November 1986.  This latter sum comprises payment in respect of one child from 4 January 1985 to 2 April 1985 and two children from 3 April 1985 to 15 November 1986.  The total amount paid represents her full entitlement under equal treatment legislation.</P>
      <P>The person concerned did not claim an increase in disability benefit in respect of her child dependants from 15 November 1986. However, she was invited to do so earlier this year and was awarded the appropriate increases. It has been decided to award the increases from November 1986 or the dates of the birth of the children from after that date as appropriate.  The arrears payment will issue to her shortly.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 287, 288 and 290 together.  I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 199 on Tuesday, 5 November 1996, in which I indicated that the cost of paying double child benefit in respect of twins would be in the region of £8.5 million in a full year.  As the Deputies are aware this year I increased the grant in respect of the birth of twins from £200 to £500 and I introduced a new payment of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that, as I announced recently, I have made available additional staff for control activities and these are being deployed by my Department so as to give an effective spread of overall control resources throughout the country.</P>

This analysis was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm who were selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure.</P>
      <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors, including the recommendations of the product board and Bord Fáilte, as well as the results of the cost benefit analysis, subsequently agreed that a submission be made to the European Commission recommending approval of a proposal from the RDS to develop the convention centre.

      <P>Under S.I. No. 9 of 1996, which gives legal effect in Ireland to Council Directive 92/46/EEC on the hygienic production of milk and milk-based products, the use of milk which contains residues of substances which could be detrimental to human health is prohibited.  The best technical advice available to me is that antibiotic residues in milk would render it unsuitable for cheese production.</P>

      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, indicated my support for any initiative which would lead to the allocation of additional quota to milk producers in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>This matter was originally discussed between officials of my Department, the United Kingdom's Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  I also raised this matter directly with the UK Minister for Agriculture and, as the Deputy will be aware, I have also met the Cross-Border Milk Quota Action Group.  The success of an initiative of this nature will be dependent not only on the circumstances and timing of its presentation at EU level, but also, of course, on the position taken by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I feel that a further meeting with the cross-Border group at this stage would not advance the matter.  I will, however, keep the situation under review.</P>

      <P>The European Communities Act has been and is used as the basis for the introduction of Irish legislation establishing maximum residue limits &mdash; MRLs &mdash; for pesticides.  To date MRLs have been introduced for some 109 pesticides.  It is anticipated that the Commission will soon propose the adoption of MRLs for a further 60 pesticides.  As part of an ongoing review programme, proposals for MRLs for an additional 37 pesticides are being <Col N="342" /> developed.  There is no legislation to permit the establishment of MRLs on a national basis.</P>

      <P>My Department recruits forestry inspectors grade III through the Civil Service Commission.  All such posts are advertised in the national newspapers.  I understand that the last competition was advertised in 1991.</P>
      <P>Should my Department need to recruit forestry inspectors in the future, it will be by means of an open competition held by the Civil Service Commission and will be advertised as is normal practice in the national newspapers.  There are no plans to review this process.</P>
      <P>Any recruitment undertaken by Coillte Teoranta, the Irish Forestry Board, is a matter for that body and the Department has no involvement in the matter.  I understand, however, that Coillte recruited a number of staff since 1990 to fill specialised positions in forestry. The competitions were advertised in the national newspapers and on university noticeboards.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy on Tuesday, 10 December &mdash; Parliamentary Question No. 194 &mdash; my Department has undertaken a comprehensive review of the elements necessary to provide full traceability for beef products.  As a first step, a new computerised animal location file will be available shortly which will incorporate all relevant information on bovine animals held in my Department.  In addition, the user, technical and resource implications of a comprehensive bovine movement monitoring system are currently being finalised and funding has been provided in the 1997 Estimates to commence this process.</P>

      <P>The forest service in my Department has recently confirmed that evidence of the occurrence of the small banded pine weevil, <i>pissodes castaneus,</i> has been found in four different clearfelled pine stands, three of which are in County Sligo and one in County Donegal. Pissodes has also been recently recorded in County Fermanagh.  This insect has not previously been found in Ireland.  Under the Plant Health Director 77/93/EEC, the island of Ireland has a special protected zone status with regard to European species of pissodes.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the forestry plant health contingency plan and EU requirements, a special intensive national survey of forests is currently being carried out by the forestry inspectorate to establish the extent of the insect's occurrence. Pending the outcome of the survey, and a full review, the movement of logs from the four forests in question has been prohibited.  The position in general is being actively monitored by the forestry inspectorate, which is in regular contact with its counterparts in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>No instructions have issued from my Department to Teagasc advisers in relation to soil phosphorous levels.  In any event instructions to these agricultural advisers is a matter for the director of Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Teagasc have recently issued revised phosphorous recommendations for grassland.  At the launch of the revised recommendations on 13 December 1996 in Johnstown Castle I exhorted farmers to have their soils tested and, furthermore, to follow closely the analyses furnished.  It should be noted that Teagasc recommendations for satisfactory crop growth are based on the phosphorous &mdash; P &mdash; status of the soil.  Where the P level in the soil is adequate then no additional P is recommended.  Where the P level in the soil is inadequate the amount to be recommended is that needed to maintain soil fertility, that is, to meet the crop requirement.</P>
      <P>The 6 mg P-kg figure referred to by the Deputy cannot be a universal figure as some crops require higher levels of P for optimum production, for example, root crops.</P>

    <P>My Department will, in the near future, be advising planning agencies approved to devise plans under the Rural Environment Protection <Col N="351" /> Scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; on the revised P recommendations.

      <P>The emergency measures introduced in the United Kingdom due to the BSE crisis have resulted in the closure of export markets and the exclusion of approximately 300,000 tonnes of beef produced in the United Kingdom from the food chain under the &ldquo;over thirty months slaughter scheme&rdquo;.  Beef production in the United Kingdom has fallen by approximately 30 per cent as a result of the &ldquo;over 30 months slaughter scheme&rdquo; and, although export markets still remain closed to beef from the United Kingdom, this has significantly reduced the level of self sufficiency in beef in the United Kingdom.  The market in the United Kingdom is also quite buoyant at present because of strong seasonal demand at this time of year.  Accordingly, market prices in the United Kingdom have improved significantly from earlier levels and now stand at 76 per cent of the intervention price.</P>
      <P>Irish cattle prices have also recovered in recent weeks in line with lower supplies and improvements in EU markets.  Irish steer prices now stand at 72 per cent of the intervention price compared to 63 per cent for most of the autumn period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 359 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answers to Questions 16 and 29 of December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to measures to reduce levels of radon, I draw the Deputies' attention to the Department of the Environment's advisory booklet which issued in August 1995 and is designed to inform householders about radon in buildings and to provide guidance where it has been decided to take action to reduce radon levels.   The Minister <Col N="353" /> for the Environment also intends to amend the building regulations and to publish a new set of supporting technical guidance documents early in 1997 which will contain provisions in relation to radon in new dwellings.  Testing of homes for radon gas will be carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland on request for a fee of £15.</P>
    <P>I can make no comment at present concerning free testing by the RPII in the homes of residents in areas with high radon levels.  However, the matter will be kept under the review in light of Exchequer commitments and overall budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>Under the Telecom Éireann spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme, persons who are aggrieved by the failure or refusal of the company to make an award under the scheme or by the amount of any award made, have the right of appeal to me as Minister.  Unless and until such an appeal is lodged I have no function in the matter.  The Deputy should be aware that under the scheme, an appeal against failure by the company to make an award must be made within eight months after the occasion in respect of which the award is claimed and any other appeal must be made within six months after the decision to which it relates.  Obviously, any such appeal should be accompanied by a full statement of the facts relating to the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the purpose of the spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme is to provide benefits in respect of a member's spouse and children in the event of his or her death.  In common with similar schemes throughout the rest of the public service, all new entrants after a certain date are automatically made members of the scheme.  Members and the employer share the cost of the scheme equally between them.  The member pays a periodic contribution of 1.5 per cent of salary, while a deduction is also made from lump sum or death <Col N="356" /> gratuity in respect of any service for which periodic contributions have not been paid.  It is important to note that the overall funding of the scheme, and its low contribution rate, is conditional on a wide membership contributing towards its cost.  However, due to its insurance type nature, not all members are guaranteed to benefit from their membership.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to issue a medal or similar award to persons with 25, 30 or 40 years service in the FCA.  There is no precedent for the making of such awards to members of any branch of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>At present An Bonn Seirbhise &mdash; FCA agus An Slua Muirí &mdash; may be awarded to members or former members of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil who have seven years satisfactory service.  At first bar to this medal may be awarded after twelve years satisfactory service and a second bar may be awarded after twenty one years satisfactory service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the range of medals which are awarded for service, bravery and for overseas service is adequate to meet the needs of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 365, 366 and 367 together.</P>
      <P>Unlike the United Kingdom, my Department has no mechanism in place for verifying the standard of equivalency of certificates of competency from other EU member states.</P>
      <P>I understand the person concerned has recently applied to the relevant United Kingdom authorities for a certificate of equivalent competency.  While there is a bilateral agreement in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom which provides for the mutual recognition of certificates of competency, my Department cannot consider any further action in this matter until such time as the United Kingdom authorities issue this person with the appropriate certificate.</P>
      <P>In addition to the bilateral agreement in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom, Ireland has mutual recognition agreements with member states of the British Commonwealth such as Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand.  To date, there are no other bilateral agreements in place for the mutual recognition of certificates of competency with fellow EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from my Department are currently examining several issues which have come to light regarding the recent transposition into Irish law by the Department of Education of council directives giving effect to the mutual recognition of certificates of competency within the European <Col N="359" /> Union.  I am advised that under these directives, it may be possible for EU nationals to have their certificates of competency recognised.</P>
    <P>While it is my intention that my Department will review the scope for, as well as pursuing where appropriate, certificate of equivalent competency arrangements with Member states based on genuine equivalence and mutuality, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that this process will take some time to complete.  In order to establish that there is mutual recognition on the basis of genuine equivalence between Irish certificates of competency and those of the other member states involved, my Department's marine survey office will have to be satisfied that the training, examination syllabi and related elements of such certificates of competency are in line with the Irish certificates of competency.</P>

      <P>The fisheries &mdash; European Regional Development Fund &mdash; measure of the INTERREG II Programme, 1994 to 1999, provides funding for the protection, conservation and development of fisheries in the Border region.  My Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland are the responsible authorities in so far as the implementation of the fisheries measures of the INTERREG II Programme is concerned.</P>
      <P>A project involving the rehabilitation of salmon on the Erne catchment was approved under that measure in December 1995.  The project was drawn up by the relevant agencies North and South including the Electricity Supply Board, the Marine Institute, the Fisheries Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board.  This project, which involves a total investment of £1.77 million, aims to reintroduce salmon to the Erne tributaries with a view to producing a selfsustaining population and the creation of angling tourism revenue and employment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Erne catchment. which is divided approximately evenly between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is located mainly in Counties Fermanagh, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan but also encompasses parts of Counties Tyrone, Donegal and Longford.  It is not possible, therefore, to provide a breakdown of actual and proposed expenditure under this project on a county by county basis.  I have, however, asked the Northern Regional Fisheries Board to provide the Deputy with details of the works being undertaken in Monaghan.</P>
