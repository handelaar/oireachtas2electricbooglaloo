      <P>This side of the House recognises and acknowledges the beginning of the U-turn by the Government on Castlerea and the bail laws.  We welcome the fact that the parties in Government have at last realised the seriousness of the crime problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant that in view of public pressure and the efforts of the Opposition parties the Government was forced to do a U-turn on Castlerea and other matters.  When will the Taoiseach deliver the remaining <Col N="1782" /> parts of the crime package?  I think he will acknowledge that 25 spaces in Castlerea is a hopeless effort in dealing with crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to the initiative of the Minister for Justice, the package will deliver prison spaces immediately whereas the original project, which has been reviewed and is going ahead at a lower cost as a result of the review, would not deliver prison spaces immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I welcomed the Government package, which is a step in the right direction, and I thank the Minister for giving me details of it. Will the Government give details of six proposed Bills relating to the package, including when they will be published? I notice the issue of bail was absent from the announcement made by the Minister yesterday.  The Taoiseach said in the House last year that when the Law Reform Commission reported the Government would make an early decision on the issue, but it is now four months since that report was published. Will the Government proceed with the bail issue this year?  Can we expect a referendum on bail and is there agreement within the Government on that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will bring proposals on that matter before the Cabinet in the reasonably near future.  It would be premature to make an announcement of the Government's decision until it has considered those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach about this issue last September and he said that as soon as the Law Reform Commission reported the Government <Col N="1783" /> would make a decision on the matter. That report is now four months old. When can we expect a decision from the Government on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the matter is presented to the Cabinet, which I expect will be within the next six weeks.  I recollect that the Deputy's party was opposed to change in this area in the past.  I am glad it has changed its view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated yesterday that the Minister would give an outline of how the Misuse of Drugs Bill would be proceeded with in Committee. Since that was unclear from the Minister's statement last night, will the Taoiseach outline, during the debate on that Bill this week or next week, how the Government intends to proceed with the Bill.  I welcome Government support for the Bill on Second Stage and I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on the Bill but we would like to know what the procedure will be in Committee. On the question of prison spaces, I remind the Taoiseach that if the Castlerea prison project had gone ahead when originally proposed it would be almost complete now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks on the latter issue are inaccurate. His party's record on the bail issue is not very good.  When in Government rather than deal with the matter they sent it to the Law Reform Commission, probably as a delaying tactic.  This Government will come to a decision on the bail issue and will announce its decision.  It will not seek to refer the matter elsewhere, as Fianna Fáil did, or change its mind, as the Progressive Democrats did.  I remember eloquent speeches from Deputy McDowell opposing changes in the bail provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach remember the Bill I drafted to reform the law on bail which he voted down?  Does he remember I consistently stated that it makes no sense to reform the law on bail unless the Government does its duty and provides extra jail spaces?  It is only when the country is in virtual revolution on that issue the Government is finally willing to meet its responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister for Justice is providing extra jail places, which will enable us to consider whether a constitutional amendment is necessary to reform the bail laws.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter can now be considered because jail places will be available to accommodate people who might commit offences while on remand on bail.  That was not the case in the past, but it is the position now as a result of decisions taken by the Minister for Justice and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday in this House I supported the measures introduced by the Government and I did so again this morning because it is important not to play party politics with crime.  The Progressive Democrats understand the difficulties involved in changing the law on bail, but notwithstanding them we have always favoured changing that law.  I support the Government in bringing about that change and I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach, the Leader of the largest party in Government, if the Government intends to bring forward proposals and, if so, when.  That is a reasonable question and not one with which the Taoiseach should seek to play politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are not calling for cutbacks in the public service pay bill.  We are asking for a curtailment to avoid a cutback in public finances which could be held and pegged at their present level.  We are being told constantly that we cannot afford tax reform as if it were some type of luxury.  Real tax reform is possible provided we manage our public finances in a prudent and sensible way.  For example, the Government is planning to increase spending this year by almost £600 million or more than twice the rate of inflation.  If the Government had been able or had chosen to keep the growth in spending in line with inflation it would need to extract £300 million less in income tax.  That money could have been used to transform the position of the hard-pressed PAYE taxpayer and would have allowed the Minister for Finance to introduce a different budget last Tuesday.  Instead of the penny pinching changes he made, he could have chosen to cut the basic rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 23 per cent, he could have halved the rate of employees' PRSI or, if we were serious about helping low paid workers struggling with the burden of the PAYE system, he could have increased the basic tax allowance by £1,000 for single people and £2,000 for couples.  That last measure alone would have given a person on the average industrial wage of £270 per week an extra £8 in his or her take home pay.</P>
      <P>Because of the spendthrift way the Government deals with taxpayer's and other people's money, next April the average worker here will continue to pay tax at 48 per cent whereas his or her counterpart in Northern Ireland with the same income will be paying tax at 24 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we create additional, real jobs when we continue to tax work as if it were a luxury?  How can we encourage inward investment when, a few miles over the Border, it is now infinitely <Col N="1790" /> more rewarding for an investor to invest, set up business and create jobs? How can we compete with the neighbouring State across the Border?  That is the bottom line as far as this budget is concerned.  It has been pathetically hopeless in its attempt to tackle our two main problems which are unemployment and crime.  Those two problems are not unrelated because much of the second stems from the first.  How can we tackle those two main problems besetting us when we are not prepared to implement radical, job-creating tax reform?</P>
    <P>In my party's document <i>Tax and Spend</i> we have pointed the way, how it can and must be done but my sad admission now is that it will not be done by this three party Government.  That being the case, I am not optimistic about the future of this country, because valuable time is being lost.  The economic factors confronting the Minister for Finance preparing this budget may never again be so favourable to afford him to put in place a long-term, strategic budget whose provisions would begin to dismantle our taxation system and put in place a system leading to the creation rather than the destruction of jobs, one that would reward work and encourage enterprise.  That did not happen.  Since the process of radical reform was not put in place this year when all the internal and external economic factors were so favourable, with so much easy money available that will not be available in three or four years' time, I have grave fears for the future.  I fear that our best talent, brains and young energy will continue to emigrate and the working economy will shrink further.</P>
    <P>For every person contributing to the Exchequer there are 22 drawing out; that is a very dangerous set of circumstances. Unless we can get people back to work in gainful employment, when they can contribute to the Exchequer rather than drawing from it, I have very grave fears for the future.</P>
    <P>I am particularly upset at the one specific, direct measure introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare in <Col N="1791" /> relation to crime, that is the offer of a tax rebate of £800 for elderly people wishing to install a security system in their homes.  The Minister for Social Welfare is totally out of touch with the reality on the ground because the people I know most in need of that type of installation to protect themselves are not in the tax paying bracket, or in a position to avail of this meaningless gesture. That gives one an insight into the lack of proper thinking and planning in this budget.  It is an absolute scandal that a Government that spends £1 million a month on consultancy fees, public relations exercises and back-up services finds itself so totally out of touch with the reality on the ground.  I contend this budget will do nothing for unemployment, nothing for crime and, as such, is a failed one.</P>

      <P>I shall confine my remarks on the budget to the narrow area to which Deputy Quill has just referred comprised of its allocations to the Department of Justice and the proposals to tackle our crime problem.  I shall do so not simply because of the public focus in recent days but because there are a number of serious issues that need to be raised and debated in this House in a more considered way than the type of contributions we have heard in recent days and in interventions on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John O'Donoghue and the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, have a lot to answer for, as have past colleagues of theirs such as Deputy Gerry Collins who spends most of his time in the European Parliament and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who is currently unwell and whom I wish a speedy recovery.  In the context of recent events I have been reading comments of Deputies Bertie Ahern, John <Col N="1792" /> O'Donoghue and Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. The brass neck award for January 1996 should be awarded to those members of the Fianna Fáil party because many of the ills within the administration of our criminal justice system are the responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Party who were in Government from 1987 until just over a year ago.  Under successive Fianna Fáil Governments, when there was Fianna Fáil alone, Fianna Fáil in Coalition with the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in Coalition with the Labour Party, the difficulties so starkly evident in our criminal justice system were not addressed or dealt with.  Even worse, a former Deputy and Minister for Justice, Pádraig Flynn, now European Commissioner &mdash; having escaped from this House &mdash; and Deputies Gerry Collins and Máire Geoghegan-Quinn presided over the commencement and development of the revolving door prison system. It must be the only door opened by any Minister of Government that has not resulted in a plaque being erected to commemorate its opening, accompanied by a cheese and wine reception, to which members of the relevant Minister's party were invited to celebrate their contributions to political life.</P>

      <P>The revolving door system, in all its beauty, began in 1987 and 1988 to be used by a series of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice as a means of extracting people who had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment from the prison system as a means of making places available.  That revolving door system has undermined the authority of the courts, demoralised the Garda, resulted in offenders regarding their sentences as something of a joke, giving them a feeling of immunity from being brought to book for crimes they commit. It has been a stark illustration of the contempt shown the victims of crime.  Central to the present problems <Col N="1793" /> within our criminal justice system is that revolving door system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of vital importance that the revolving door system be abolished so that those convicted of offences by our courts will be left in no doubt that the sentence imposed will be fully implemented.  They must know that when they enter the prison system they will not be allowed out for holiday periods at Christmas.  At present, if they decide not to return behind bars nobody will greatly care because that will make another place available for some other offender.  It is time we applied the sentences imposed.  In addition to ending the revolving door system there is a need to bring forward a whole series of urgent reforms not yet spoken of by Government.  We need to provide an integrated prosecution service as suggested by the Director of Public Prosecutions on a number of occasions. There is no sign that the necessity for this has been understood.  There is a need to provide a modern court and Garda communications system and the records of criminal offenders should be computerised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person is being sentenced it should be possible for the courts to be aware not simply of what sentences have been imposed for past offences but the length of time served.  On conviction when gardaí or prosecutors are asked to tell the court of previous offences, it is <Col N="1794" /> not unusual for some convictions not to be brought to the attention of the court. When a person appeals a conviction for a violent criminal offence, he should not be released pending appeal.  There has been a series of instances where people convicted of horrendous violent offences have been released pending appeals and then committed other offences.  To ensure injustice is not perpetrated we should provide for a speedy appeals hearing but convicted criminals should not be released into the community.</P>
    <P>In the context of the courts system the bail issue is a hardy annual that is regularly produced.  It is an issue with which people play political games and it is not understood by the public.  The debate about bail and the manner in which it is being conducted is a nonsense. If we do not have enough prison places for people already convicted of criminal offences, what is the purpose of amending our bail laws to compel us to jail people who have not yet been convicted? Can anyone in this House address that commonsense issue instead of simply dealing with knee jerk reaction headline-catching statements when a problem arises?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the considered policy of a succession of Fianna Fáil Ministers to implement that approach. The present Government has been in power for a year.  Members of Fianna Fáil and, indeed, the Progressive Democrats whose party was in Government with Fianna Fáil, have been telling us there is something new and terrible happening. What they are not saying is that <Col N="1795" /> their parties in Government laid the foundation for the problem.</P>
      <P>In the context of the bail issue I have listened with interest to commentators on the report of the Law Reform Commission asking when will the Minister for Justice do something about bail and if she has implemented the report.  How many Deputies opposite and how many of these commentators have actually read the report of the Law Reform Commission?  It is a very interesting report.  What it emphasises is not that we need a constitutional amendment, to put behind bars people charged with criminal offences, but that there is a series of alternatives available to tackle the difficulties being experienced, which are caused by people charged with committing further offences before they are brought to trial.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission emphasises that a principal problem in this area is the length of time it takes for trials to be heard and recommends that additional judges should be made available. I understand those appointments are being made in the next two to three weeks.  The Law Reform Commission talks about aspects of our criminal procedures being cumbersome and productive of delay.  We need to tackle that. The courts are currently suffering gridlock not only because of the absence of judges and judges being overworked in the whole panoply of the civil and criminal justice system but because of the cumbersome nature of our legal procedures, some of which are a throwback to the 19th century.  Immediate reform of those procedures is required.  A reduction in delay in the prosecution of offences would substantially limit and reduce the problems caused by people committing offences who are already charged with offences.  Eliminating the revolving door system will end what we have witnessed in recent months.  Cases have been highlighted where people released early from prison have during the course of the so-called temporary release committed other crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to nail on the head a fallacy <Col N="1796" /> that is abroad.  The fallacy is that all the problems in this area will be resolved if only we repeal our bail laws and put behind bars all of those people who are being prosecuted for alleged offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The fallacy, which is a dangerous one, is that we should move away from the principle that people are innocent until proven guilty.  Has anyone in the House looked at the official Garda statistics of the number of offences committed by people on bail? In 1983 there were 8,295 offences committed by people who were on bail.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, sought to impose on the courts an obligation, where someone committed an offence on bail, to impose a consecutive sentence rather than a concurrent sentence. It was felt in the 1970s and in the 1980s that once a person was charged with one offence it was open to him to commit whatever further offences he wished until his case came to trial.  Having, perhaps, secured some substantial financial security for the day of release from prison one could plead guilty to all charges and get a concurrent sentence.  The 1984 Act required the imposition of consecutive sentences.  In 1983, 8,500 offences were committed by people on bail.  In 1994, according to the statistics, 4,416 offences were committed by people on bail.  Approximately 4.5 per cent of the total known offences committed in 1994 were committed by people on bail.  In 1983 approximately 8.5 per cent of the offences committed were committed by people on bail.  Why are we now having hysteria about the bail issue?  What we need to do is implement the other reforms to which I have referred.  We need to ensure, as the Law Reform Commission says, that the courts make greater use of the 1984 Act.  There has been a tendency for the courts in some of the recent court decisions delivered not to impose consecutive sentences when they should have done so.  The Law Reform Commission say we should <Col N="1797" /> legislate to stop that happening and it is right.</P>
      <P>The bail issue should be taken further than the debates and comments and some of the asinine short quotes given recently for the sake of headlines by members of the Opposition Parties.  I fully accept the view that a multi-faceted approach is required on this issue.  I accept, as the statistics show, that crime is prevalent in some sections of the community more than in others.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the view that we should look into the social background and family circumstances of people who commit crime and say, &ldquo;God help them, they could not help it given the circumstances in which they lived or were brought up&rdquo;.  It is time we took the clear view that people must exercise individual responsibility for their actions. People who resort to crime and attack and inflict appalling injury on elderly people in isolated areas in their homes late at night must take responsibility for their actions and accept the consequences when arrested and convicted. We should not make allowances for that type of behaviour.  We need an efficient criminal justice system which allows those people to be brought to book.</P>
      <P>In the context of the announcement by the Minister yesterday, there is a need to ensure that we have a more community oriented policing approach. It would be a good idea if Members and the Department of Justice looked at what happened in the United States over the past two years where cities which were racked by crime have been changed dramatically by a form of community policing in which police were taken out of their patrol cars and central police stations and small substations were set up in communities which have major crime problems.</P>

      <P>There are good examples of this in many cities.  Two years ago the Clinton administration was told that this innovation would not work but it has <Col N="1798" /> proven to be dramatically successful. That is the sort of innovation we need but we are not discussing it.</P>
      <P>In addition to modernising our police procedures and adopting the other proposals to which I referred it is time we codified our criminal law which is stretched through a labyrinthine series of Acts of this Parliament and Westminster which go back over 200 years.  We do not have a modern code of criminal law.  Rather we have a code of criminal law which is changed in a piecemeal fashion on an annual basis depending on the perceived crisis within the political world in a particular area. It is time the Department of Justice started putting together a modernised codified code of criminal law.  If the Department lacks the resources to carry out this work it should employ the necessary experts to ensure it is done so that within the next 18 months we can bring before the House a code of criminal law which not only sets out the law but which updates the fines and other penalties which have long since lost touch with the reality of the pressures of the modern world and of crime in urban and rural communities.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to three specific issues &mdash; agriculture, social welfare and law and order.  There is now greater confidence in the agricultural industry than at any time in the past. The increases in VAT refunds, reductions in PRSI and the other changes in the budget have been of benefit to people working in this industry. It is probably difficult to justify the sale of land for £4,000-£5,000 an acre but it is indicative of the confidence in the industry and the good job being done by the Minister, Deputy Yates. The relationship between the Minister and the farming organisations is unique and it can do nothing but good for the industry which can look forward with confidence to the future.  I wish the Minister well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Social Welfare was criticised day in, day out, particularly by members of Fianna Fáil, <Col N="1799" /> for not giving adequate increases in social welfare and not spending more on education, agriculture and health. However, this year they said the Government had done a bad job because it spent too much money in the budget.  It is a mystery how they can equate those two statements.  I welcome in particular the increases in payments to the elderly who have been given their due reward for their contribution to the country.  I also welcome the scheme for the unemployed which will give hope and confidence to those people who have been unemployed for three years.</P>
    <P>One of the major topics of discussion today is law and order.  An article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states that it is difficult not to feel sympathy for the Minister who is reaping the whirlwind of her predecessors' neglect and shortsightedness.  One need not say any more.  Having listened to the remarks made by Deputy O'Donoghue over the past two or three weeks one would think that up to 14 months ago there were no crimes or murders committed and no people in jail.  This kind of hypocrisy does not go down well with the public.  It is wrong for any Opposition party to hype up an issue of such importance to everyone.</P>
    <P>I agree that prisons may be too comfortable and people do not mind being sent back to them.  It is time changes were introduced in this area so that prisoners pay the full price for their crimes.  It is crazy deploying thousands of gardaí in the collection of unpaid fines for minor traffic offences when they could be doing the job they are expected to do, to fight crime.</P>
    <P>We have heard about some of the shocking crimes committed by people on bail and it is evident that the bail laws need to be changed.  The Garda must be given more power and the public must be given a greater say in this area.  It seems to be very difficult to secure a conviction in the courts, the law seems to be more focused on the rights of the criminal.  This is difficult to understand and we must consider giving the <Col N="1800" /> Garda more power so that it will be easier for them to secure convictions.  I am not talking about false convictions or anything like that.  I am merely saying that they must be given some help and encouragement to secure convictions in cases where they know the person is guilty.</P>
    <P>The Victim Support group, which is doing wonderful work, should be given greater help by the Government.  I have no time for prisoners' rights groups but I have great time for the Victim Support group and if it was given more help and support we would all be better off.</P>
    <P>Virtually every shop, supermarket and drapery in Dublin, Cork and other cities have to hire security men.  It is sad that the owners of shops can no longer rely on the Garda to carry out this job. I am not blaming the Garda who are doing a tremendous job but we have failed those people by compelling them to provide their own security.  This is wrong and it must be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, who inherited all these problems, has carried out remarkable work over the past 12-14 months.  The changes she announced yesterday, such as increasing the number of prison places, are a major step in the right direction.  The Minister is doing a remarkable job when one takes into account the problems she inherited.</P>
    <P>I would be wrong if I let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the Garda Síochána, which has had some remarkable success stories.  For example, it picked up culprits involved in a County Tipperary break-in a few hours later at Dublin port.  We do not hear enough about these successes.  As a rural Deputy, I would like to see grants made available to members of the Garda for building houses to live in rural areas.  When gardaí live in a locality they have a greater awareness of what is going on there.  This would be much more effective than what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>I also feel strongly that the right to silence must be changed.  I do not know of anyone with a clear conscience who would not answer any questions put to <Col N="1801" /> them by a garda.  If a person does not respond to questions put by a garda, it should be taken into account and added to whatever charges they may already face.  We should pay more attention to those refusing to answer questions in custody.  They should be able to answer if they have a clear conscience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill spoke at length about law and order and fiscal rectitude. Fianna Fáil has also been talking about all that is wrong with our justice system. It was in Government long enough. Why did it not solve these problems or at least make an effort to do so?  The current situation is not much worse then when Fianna Fáil was in power.  Its crocodile tears should dry up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the previous two Government speakers spent the past half an hour trying to shore up the Minister for Justice and promote the adding of some steel to her Department.  It was also interesting to listen to Deputy Shatter.  I remind both him and Deputy Crowley that it was the Minister for Justice who, on the public airwaves not long after she was appointed to office, made having an immediate referendum on the bail laws something akin to a pillar of what she wanted to achieve in her Department.  It was not raised as an issue by this side in that instance, although we were aware of it since the Law Reform Commission was looking into the matter.  The Minister felt she had found the Holy Grail and that she would deliver on it. However, the Government, in the absence of the Minister, cancelled the construction of Castlerea prison and the women's prison at Mountjoy.  It is worth reminding the Government that it was the combination of those issues and a range of promised legislation by the Minister on which she failed to deliver that captured the mood of the public arena.  When the Government's stated primary objectives were not beginning to be realised, questions rightly began to be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in this House for nearly ten years and over the past 12 months I <Col N="1802" /> have never seen any Opposition spokesman on Justice contribute as much by way of legislation as Deputy O'Donoghue. His record speaks for itself.  The Government has accepted his Private Members' Bills on two occasions and I commend it for that.  However, that effort had to be made, given the Government's failures in Justice over the last 12 months.  It is only after incredible pressure from the public that action is now beginning to be taken.  It was the Minister's failure to deliver on the announcements she made that contributed greatly to the concern felt in the public domain.</P>
    <P>When he was Opposition spokesperson for Finance, the current Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan said, "The Minister's Budget Statement clearly demonstrates again that we are living in a society which has been suffocated by a false consensus where creativity and initiative are covered by a thin veneer of political platitudes which mask fundamental disagreement&rdquo;.  How prophetic are those words.  It is now clear the Minister was referring to the future position of Fine Gael in this Government.</P>
    <P>It is extremely interesting that Fine Gael lectured when in Opposition on what it would do about fiscal policy, tax and PRSI reform and how it saw the collapse in the jobs market as central to those issues.  However, it ceded the Department of Finance to the Labour Party when coming to Government because it learned from its past mistakes. Every time it held the reins of the Department, it failed objectly to deliver in that arena.  On this occasion, it is happy to wash its hands of that Department in the hope that the blame will not be laid at its door for the fiscal policies being pursued.  This is sad.  Maybe it was wise of Fine Gael to take that approach.</P>
    <P>To do anything else would have left it open to the same results it achieved in past Governments when it had control of that Department by substantially increasing spending and the national debt and doing little else.  Fine Gael is part of a Government which is doing the <Col N="1803" /> same but the only excuse it can offer on this occasions is that for the first time it does not control the Department of Finance, either in name or practice, despite being the largest party in Government. That has now led to those failed left wing socialist policies, akin to those followed by eastern European countries some years ago, of increasing public expenditure and borrowing at a time of sound economic growth, coupled with giving no return to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance outlined his budget speech, he referred to three pillars which were the main objectives of the budget &mdash; to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  He failed, however, to do anything concrete to bring them to fruition.  Given the comments of trade union and employer representatives and various independent political commentators in the past week, as people have had time to consider the effects of the measures announced in the budget, the promise to reward work rings hollow.</P>
    <P>Sleight of hand appears to be the hallmark of this three card trick Government, as I described it some time ago.  It is worrying that it is attempting to hoodwink the public.  One can only wonder if it possesses the ability to introduce any worthwhile measures.</P>
    <P>The employees' PRSI allowance is to be increased from £50 to £80 per week. In other words, the first £80 of earned income will be exempt.  At first sight this appears to be a positive move &mdash; in recent years high PRSI rates have contributed to our inability to secure employment growth &mdash; but the Minister went on to announce that the £140 income tax PRSI allowance was to be scrapped and the PRSI ceiling raised from £21,500 to £22,300, an increase of £800.  The net effect will be negligible. How can the Fine Gael Party of all parties tolerate this nonsense?  One can only conclude that the Government has little or no interest in tax reform given that there is to be no change in either the lower or higher tax rates and the tax bands are to be widened by a miserable <Col N="1804" /> £1,000.  The real tragedy is that it will cost employers, particularly small businesses, more to make these minuscule adjustments than they will receive in benefits.</P>
    <P>When the increases in indirect taxation, on petrol and cigarettes, are taken into account we will all end up paying more.  This will have a devastating effect on the labour force who were asked from 1987 onwards to accept that there was no choice but to include fiscal rectitude on the agenda because of the policies pursued by the Fine Gael led Government in the mid-1980s.  The benefits began to be reaped in 1994 and 1995.</P>
    <P>We should all be concerned about what we might face in two or three years' time as a result of the policies being pursued by the Government, the effect of which is being masked by the high growth rates and the economic boom, which we welcome.  I &mdash; and others &mdash; have complained bitterly that it has failed to devise a forward looking fiscal policy to tackle the issues of public expenditure and tax reform.  It is proceeding on an <i>ad hoc</i> and year on year basis.  There is no vision.  It will be left to whoever is in office in two or three years' time to make the necessary adjustments, as happened in 1987 when two of the principal players in the Government left office.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of employers' PRSI is to be reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.  That is an extraordinary approach to tax reform.  The lower rate is to be reduced from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent and the lower rate band widened by £1,000, from £12,000 to £13,000. That negates the increase of 0.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The tax wedge has been the subject of discussion for many years with particular emphasis on the question of whether some body would be better off taking up low paid employment.  I wish to broaden the debate by suggesting that there is a social welfare wedge.  It has never ceased to astonish me that obtaining the medical card is considered akin to finding the Holy Grail.  It has a <Col N="1805" /> value way beyond its true worth.  That is not to say it is not important or that some families do not have a genuine need for it, but until the tax and social welfare systems are integrated, it will not be made attractive for those on social welfare to take up low paid employment.  One cannot suggest that there is a tax wedge only and concentrate on making marginal adjustments in the budget at the lower end of the scale.</P>
    <P>That will not work.  All one is doing with such adjustments is moving the goalposts of the tax wedge.  When somebody earns over £13,000, the cost of PRSI jumps phenomenally so we are back to the same problem.  It will be masked for a year or two by moving the goalposts but one ends up achieving nothing by making ring fence adjustments that are false in the first instance and which do not contribute to long-term planning.  That is very sad.  Only when the two systems are approached in an equal sense and when there is a marrying of the two at the lower end so that there is a smooth transition from one to the other will we begin to achieve the removal of the social welfare and tax wedges.  However, the ring fence approaches in the budget will not achieve anything over a period of a few years.</P>
    <P>The other offer from the Government is the proposal to pay £80 per week to employers who recruit somebody who has been unemployed for over three years.  I can understand why one would want to do something such as that, why one would consider it a positive thing to do or believe that it can help.  However, I have spoken to a number of employers about the proposal and there have been two responses.  In the first place, an employer will only employ somebody if there is a real job available and if the person can contribute as a profit centre to the well-being of the company.  The market is too competitive for employers to take on people in the hope that the subsidy will cover their costs while they need only make a contribution.  Anybody who is employed in a company nowadays must be part of creating <Col N="1806" /> enough profit for further reinvestment by the company in further expansion so that the company can compete and survive in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Employers have told me that companies in the past have tried these schemes for taking on the long-term unemployed.  They have found that although they employ the person, the new employee knows in his or her heart and soul that the job is not a long-term prospect so they do not generate an allegiance or the real work ethic that is necessary within the company.  Many of them end up, not through their own fault, causing more problems within the company because they have no real interest.  They do not see any future or prospect of long-term employment; they know their job is heavily subsidised so they do not have the commitment. Employers, large and small, have told me that they will not base their decision to recruit somebody on the basis of an £80 per week subsidy but on purely competitive criteria which result in real jobs.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the scheme which astonished me is the fact that there is no requirement on an employer to pay at least the average industrial wage to secure the £80 per week.  I would have thought that a minimum requirement on any employer who receives such a large subsidy for taking on somebody would be that the employer is obliged to pay the average industrial wage.  In other words, the contribution from the employer would be at least greater than that of the State.  Such a requirement would be logical.  However, there does not appear to be any such requirement. If that is the case and if it is not changed the Government will be wrong.  It will be wasting money.</P>
    <P>If somebody gets into a company paying the average industrial wage, the prospect may exist, no matter how limited, of a future chance of real employment. However, the £80 could be seen by some employers as a means of taking on people and paying them £100 per week so that the employer's contribution is only £20 or £30 per week.  It is <Col N="1807" /> a good deal because if the person only spends their time sweeping up and doing odd jobs, at least the employer is getting something out of it and the State and everybody else is paying for it.  Of course, the person who is taken on knows from the beginning that there is no long-term prospect in the company so their real interest simply does not exist, which is tragic.  Many of these schemes &mdash; not all but some &mdash; contribute to the disappointment, lack of self-worth and hopelessness that many people feel when they seek real employment and are offered these jobs which, in reality, do not exist.  Many of them feel they are pawns in a game to massage the employment figures.</P>
    <P>I was in the House when the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, made his speech on the budget.  It was an interesting speech which underpinned the Government's philosophy and certainly outlined what Deputy Gilmore believed to be the Government's philosophy. One sentence of his speech summed up the philosophy of Democratic Left and the philosophy of this Government.  He said: &ldquo;Extra disposable income does little to improve the quality of our lives&rdquo;.  It is an extraordinary statement.  The view of Deputy Gilmore and Democratic Left and, I take it, the Government, is that the people do not have the ability to make decisions for themselves as to how to spend their income.  The inference, of course, is that only the State has the capacity to make such decisions.  It is an extraordinary statement and I was stunned by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It stopped me in my tracks.  The Minister of State went on to say that if one gives people extra income they will have to spend it on private insurance schemes, private security and so forth.  Why should people not have the right to make those <Col N="1808" /> choices?  Is the Minister of State saying that the State is the only body that can make those choices for everybody?</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that such statements are emanating from Deputy Gilmore and Democratic Left although I am, perhaps, surprised that he put it in print.  However, what really made me think is that this underpins the philosophy of the Government.  This is the influence of the Democratic Left on fiscal policy.  What that party believes in materialised in the budget.  It encapsulates everything I oppose.  It encapsulates everything that has collapsed in eastern Europe and shows the outdated, left wing, socialist philosophy &mdash; that has contributed nothing to any country except broken the backs of the people who lived in those countries &mdash; which still pervades Democratic Left today and which is the philosophy of the Government.  &ldquo;Extra disposable income does little to improve the quality of our lives" expresses more eloquently than I could, the philosophy of this Government.</P>
      <P>We have seen with absolute clarity that the view of the Government is not to increase net take home pay, not to allow people to think for themselves and not to give people the ability to make decisions.  Its view is the opposite &mdash; it says that the State is the only body that can provide the funds, make the decisions and know what is best for people.  It is a little like the syndrome described in "Animal Farm" by George Orwell.  It is extraordinary but we should be alert to it.  This is the sort of nonsense that ruined the country ten years ago, even though Democratic Left was not part of it.  During a binge in the mid-1980s Fine Gael and Labour decided to spend and borrow their way to heaven and as a result the country went bankrupt in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the events of 1977 did not help and I did not agree with them.  However, what Fine Gael suggested it would do to get into power at the beginning of the 1980s was unacceptable.  The Labour Party destroyed the Fine Gael Party at that time.  It is interesting that history is repeating itself, but on this occasion Fine Gael had the foresight not to allow itself be blamed for the Government's financial policies by allocating responsibility for the Department of Finance to the Labour Party.  However, the public look to the Fine Gael Party, the largest party in Government, to maintain sanity.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a point, with which I am sure Deputy Ferris will agree, to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. I will not accept the downgrading of the south east region by the IDA.  To have the effrontery to suggest that combining the south east and south west regions with a headquarters in Cork is an improvement, is to stand logic on its head.  Cork will look after itself and will then look to the west.  It has never looked to the east.  There are two major components of the economy, the ports of Rosslare and Waterford, located in the south east region.  The chambers of commerce and major industries in the region are flabbergasted at this decision. They will not accept it and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, must be made aware of that.</P>

      <P>The only point in Deputy Cullen's speech with which I could agree is his final one.  There is general consensus in the south east region on this matter.  Those in the western part of south Tipperary, in particular, feel neglected by the proposed revision.  The <Col N="1810" /> Minister informed us that it is not a ministerial decision and he has been requested to ask the IDA to explain its decision.  South Tipperary, Wexford and Waterford would have a better chance of being serviced from Dublin than from Cork.</P>
      <P>We are proud that for the first time in the history of the State the Minister for Finance is a member of the Labour Party.  He is an excellent Minister, one of the best, and his balanced budget will retain a strict control on public finances and out-perform budgets in recent years.  I am sure, because of the decisions he inherited from his predecessor, he had little input to his first budget.  However, this budget was stamped with expertise, caution and, as the Tánaiste requested, was one without gimmicks about which the media could have a field day.  It was planned to take account of what is happening in the economy.  However, irrespective of the type of budget it will present difficulties for the Opposition and some of their comments were amusing.</P>
      <P>The increase in public expenditure announced in the Estimates last year proved that we have had the lowest level of public expenditure for many years.  Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is among the lowest in Europe and is lower than that which pertained when the Progressive Democrat Party was in Government in 1991 and 1992.  As Deputy Cullen left that party to join Fianna Fáil it is difficult to know from where he gets his ideology. What annoys most Members of the Opposition is that these figures were achieved while the standard of services provided by the State were improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, disposable income is important for those who have it and for those who aspire to have more of it, but in controlling public expenditure under the Maastricht guidelines it is imperative that the State not only regulates the economy but provides for the underprivileged and those on the margins. The Labour Party is proud of its performance in the Education portfolio. The State must be involved in areas <Col N="1811" /> such as health services, housing and local authority matters.  Those services have been improved and are essential for an acceptable standard of living. While the Opposition's frustration is understandable, it is pointless achieving record levels of growth if it cannot be used to improve essential services, particularly for senior citizens.</P>
    <P>As the 1994 labour survey indicates, we have at last broken free of the cycle of growth without employment.  Last year the IDA produced figures of approximately 40,000 new jobs and the latest predictions indicate this trend will continue for the next two years.  The number of people entering our labour force each year is higher than in any other European country.  In the past the economy has had to grow for employment levels to even remain static. However, we accept that the level of long-term unemployment remains unacceptably high.  There is a cancer of long-term unemployment in my constituency, particularly in my home town.  We recently lost a US service industry which exacerbated the problem.  Areas where advance factories are located but which have not benefited from the economic boom should be given preference by the IDA when industry is locating here.</P>
    <P>The Government is concerned about long-term unemployment and has correctly identified that employers respond to incentives.  It is amazing that any Member should claim that employers do not welcome incentives.  The Government expanded the back-to-work allowance scheme and there has been a further reduction in employers' PRSI, as the Opposition requested.</P>
    <P>It has also increased the PRSI allowances for employees in a measure that is unlikely to be called anything but a form of tax reform &mdash; any tax reform introduced by either Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats made no money available to the lower paid in particular, nor did it address any of the poverty traps referred to by Deputy Cullen.  The <Col N="1812" /> decision to allow the long-term unemployed to retain some of their secondary benefits is essential.  The medical card can be retained for three years after taking up a job and I am pleased that the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, has improved the guidelines for medical cards and announced them in the House in reply to a question I asked yesterday.  There is a continuation of understanding by the Government of the essentials if we are to make sure there are no disincentives to returning to the workplace.  It is also important that dependent allowances paid to social welfare recipients will continue to be paid for a number of weeks after they take up a job.  All these measures will prove effective because they have been identified as being necessary by people in the Combat Poverty Agency and the Conference of Religious of Ireland etc.</P>
    <P>For years we have had evidence that educational achievements are central to the employment prospects of individuals. I am delighted that the vocational training opportunities scheme has been expanded by another 1,000 places in conjunction with the continued priority assigned to schools in disadvantaged areas by the Minister for Education, Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach.  We are getting to grips with this problem in a way that was not done before.</P>
    <P>Another bar to people entering the workplace, which we have acted on, is lack of work experience.  The community employment programme, which is often denigrated by people in Opposition and by trade unionists on the ground, has played an important role in getting people off the unemployment register and giving them experience in the workplace where they can have a level of camaraderie with people and feel they are doing something in their community which is of benefit.  The number of places in this category has been increased by 1,000 and the people taking part in community employment schemes are treated as properly employed people because class A contributions are applied to them.  This <Col N="1813" /> means that when the scheme is completed in a year, or two or three years in some instances, they can go back into benefit and not just sign for the dole, go into community employment, and back onto the dole again.  This was frustrating and also a disincentive because they lost some of their benefits by taking part in employment schemes and subsequently were treated as long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I commend the number of small businesses that have been involved in trying to ensure that people get employment. Last year was a particularly good year. Such businesses will have their tax bills reduced this year by almost £4,000 under a proposal in the budget.  The battle against long-term unemployment will not be won in one budget, but I am happy that we have made a start. Neither have we succumbed to the notion that people must be penalised to encourage them to work.  Some commentators, particularly on the right, have suggested that we should threaten withdrawal of benefits to get people back to work.  My experience as a public representative is to the contrary, that people will work for a very small amount of money over and above the social welfare limits if they are given the opportunity and privilege of working. The British Tory Party in particular believes that people will only look for work if they are penalised or threatened with withdrawal of their allowances, but we have adopted a different approach.</P>
    <P>The increased benefits are important. The Minister for Social Welfare was criticised by the Opposition because he fought, as a Cabinet Minister, to ensure that he got as much as possible for people at the margins.  I have no doubt that the people he took into account will appreciate the fact that he has given an increase of 3 per cent in general payments in particular areas over and above the rate of inflation.  The people who will benefit from this are the people we should be concerned about. We should not worry about calls for public expenditure control from members of the Opposition who then, in Private Members' motions and on every <Col N="1814" /> county council, urban council and corporation in the country call for additional expenditure.  We have a problem, but the Opposition has a bigger problem than anybody else because of its attitude to public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I commened the Minister for Defence. In my constituency he has been subject to the criticism that the voluntary retirement package for the Defence Forces will be the death-knell of the Army.  I am glad the Minister confirmed this morning that this voluntary redundancy package will be of benefit to older serving members of the Defence Forces and it includes a scheme of recruitment.  This should dispel any doubts that the Government is committed to having a new, younger Defence Force, properly equipped and retaining the Army barracks in Clonmel and other areas.  I hope the people who purport to represent the Army and the serving members of the Defence Forces will realise that we are serious in what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I will not take up much more time because I must share with my colleague, Deputy Costello, but there are many other things I would like to say, particularly about the performance of the Opposition.  The record will show that on this matter, the Opposition are on a twin-track approach &mdash; they complain about spending and then they want more of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on delivering a budget which is fair and balanced.  The focus of the budget is on long-term unemployment in terms of extra spending and in broader terms also.  The Opposition have not appreciated this.  They are being hypocritical.  In the past they castigated the Government for not doing enough about long-term unemployment, but now that there is a central message in the budget about long-term unemployment they are not prepared to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> The proposals on long-term unemployment constitute a firm and focused strategy.  In the first instance, there are incentives to employers to take on long-term unemployed people.  It is trite to say that incentives are not needed.  Who will employ somebody who has been unemployed for three years or more when they can take on somebody who has just come out of school or college? They do need an incentive.  We must winkle out and reduce the large numbers of long-term unemployed, and the subsidy of £80 is an essential incentive. We could go down the road of looking for a <i>pro rata</i> return from the employer in terms of the remuneration given to that employee, and I would like to see a development in that direction.  The reduction of employers' PRSI in the case of the low paid and in employees' PRSI will lead to an increase in the number of people employed.</P>
    <P>Secondary benefits may be retained for three years.  People who have been out of work for over three years will retain their medical cards for a further three years after obtaining employment. This is an extremely important incentive because a medical card is a major financial bonus for those working and who have families.  The reduction in PRSI is an added bonus.</P>
    <P>The budget focuses on young people who are at risk of drifting into long-term unemployment.  After six month's unemployment they are to be given a five weeks' course during which their situation will be reassessed.  Both long-term unemployment and the risk of drifting into such unemployment are being tackled.</P>
    <P>The local employment services, which were introduced in last year's budget, are extremely important.  They are now coming on stream and providing a coal face approach and direct intervention between those on the long-term unemployment lists and the business community. This is one of the critical ways of dealing with long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> The 1,000 permanent jobs in the community employment schemes have been sought by the 40,000 people who have been on them.  They wanted recognition to be given to the schemes and jobs to result from them.  The 1,000 permanent jobs are the first step in that direction. The social insurance benefits which are to be given to people when they complete schemes will be a tremendous bonus to them.</P>
    <P>We must consider the budget in the prevailing economic context.  Some ten years ago people would have been laughed at if they said Ireland would be preparing to enter the 21st century with one of the most buoyant economies in Europe.  However, this is the enviable situation in which we now find ourselves and this is due in no small measure to the presence of the Labour Party in Government since 1992.  Any comments on the budget which do not recognise the Government's obligation to introduce a budget which would not undermine our current economic situation are devoid of credibility.</P>
    <P>This budget reaffirms all for which the Government stands.  It reaffirms the three main objectives of last year's budget and is, therefore, continuing that direction.  These objectives are to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  These are hardly anti-business and anti-wealth creation principles, as Deputy McCreevy claims.  The Government is and always has been pro-employment. The budget is an illustration of its ongoing commitment to this principle. The Minister for Finance delivered a budget which was aimed at underpinning the distribution of the benefits of economic growth, notwithstanding the criticism the Opposition has laid at the door of the Government over the past week.</P>
    <P>As a result of sound financial management, the economy has the confidence of foreign and domestic investment. During 1995 45,000 new jobs were created.  Some four times more jobs have been created over the past five years than over the preceding 30 years. <Col N="1817" /> Employment has grown four times faster in Ireland than in the rest of the EU in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Government has also arrested the level of public spending, which absorbs the benefits of growth, thus ensuring that these benefits are instead distributed throughout society.  The 2.5 per cent real increase in spending for 1996 contrasts with an annual average increase of 5.5 per cent over the preceding five years.  During the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition, public spending increased annually by approximately 6.5 per cent.  Deputy Cullen might have something to say about this, having crossed the divide between the two parties.  The budget is hardly a basis for saying the Government was remiss because the figures are exceptionally good.</P>
    <P>The budget is pro-business and pro-employment. It is an important component of the Government's ongoing approach of encouraging business, generating employment and tackling unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. The Minister for Finance included measures in the budget designed to address all these important issues.  By improving the benefits of work and easing the transition from unemployment to work, more people will be encouraged to accept employment.</P>
    <P>The central tenet of the budget is tackling long-term unemployment.  By supporting employers who recruit people who have been unemployed for a long time and by easing the transition back to work for those on social welfare, the Government aims to ensure that the benefits of our recent economic buoyancy are distributed widely throughout society.  In rewarding those at work, the Minister has increased the gains from working.  The increase in the employee PRSI exemption limit from £50 to £80 per week is an integral part of our pro-employment strategy.  The new £80 per week recruitment subsidy will encourage employers to take on people who <Col N="1818" /> have been unemployed for a considerable time.  Measures such as the retention of child benefit allowance for 13 weeks and of medical cards for three years by unemployed people after they take up work will be enormously helpful in tackling long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>All these measures are aimed at impacting on this pressing problem. Ireland has one of the most severe long-term unemployment problems in Europe and this needs special intervention, as stated in the conclusion of the report of the task force on long-term unemployment, which is based on the proposals of the National Economic and Social Forum, which gave rise to the measures in the budget and the local employment service which was introduced in the previous budget.</P>
    <P>These measures also form a major component of the Minister's promotion of social solidarity.  This side of the House does not support the promotion of purely individualistic principles, which are supported by many on the Opposition benches.  We believe in sharing the fruits of economic growth throughout society and not just among a chosen few, as the Progressive Democrats wish us to do.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats would have us believe that the budget is a failure because it did not include its policy of large scale tax cuts.  However, they failed to inform the public that such cuts would have to be paid for by wholesale spending cuts.  This is the type of society they would inflict on the people, one based on inequity and élitism, where the few are rewarded at the cost of the many.  This is nothing short of a recipe for social suicide.  To go down this path would lead to social disintegration and increasing greed and naked individualism. As the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, pointed out, it is natural for people to wish for lower taxes. However, this should not be pursued at any cost.  The Labour Party is committed to ensuring that all members of society share in the fruits of the economic buoyancy which Ireland has enjoyed in recent times. <Col N="1819" /> The Government has succeeded where many Governments failed miserably.  I include in this category the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition.  Economic management under the Minister for Finance is not only exemplary but unprecedented in recent times and this is an embarrassment to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The Government created 45,000 new jobs in 1995.  In recent years employment has increased four times faster in Ireland than in the rest of the EU.  Mortgage and inflation rates are at an historic low.  The Government has managed to gain control over public spending, which absorbs the benefits of growth.  The real increase in current spending in 1996 will be only 2.5 per cent.  This contrasts with average annual increases of 6.5 per cent during the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition.  Notwithstanding restraining growth in expenditure, the Government introduced free third level education, approved the largest programme of capital spending in health and introduced a comprehensive programme for women's health.  The Minister for Justice announced measures yesterday concerning the expenditure on prisons as well as other spending in the Justice domain.</P>
    <P>This budget is well balanced and fair, its overall aim is to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment while rewarding those at work.  Another objective is to promote social solidarity while recognising the individual input of every citizen.  The criticism levelled at the Government in general and the Minister Deputy Quinn in particular rings hollow, particularly when it is juxtapositioned with the achievements of the Government and the budget the Minister has presented.  Ireland has a steady economy which is currently one of the best in Europe.  We have low inflation and mortgage rates and have introduced measures to deal with the outstanding problem of long-term <Col N="1820" /> unemployment, which no Government in the past seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>This is the first time the long-term unemployment problem has been the main focus of a budget.  I am delighted to support the measures announced in the budget to tackle it.  They arose out of consultations with the National Economic and Social Forum, which represents the social partners, representatives of the Government and Opposition parties as well as various organisations representing the unemployed, women, travellers and the disabled &mdash; all the people who had been consigned to the long-term unemployment heap.</P>
    <P>These measures will make a substantial dent this year in the number of people who are long-term unemployed. I look forward to further proposals from the National Economic and Social Forum in the coming year and I hope the Minister, Deputy Quinn, will include them in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I listened with interest to the various contributions from Deputies this morning, particularly Members from the Government benches who are doing their utmost to defend a budget which has done little for any section of the community.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's budget speech last week, we were not surprised because for three weeks prior to budget day there were inspired leaks from the three Government parties, all of whom were trying to claim the high ground. Democratic Left got credit for this, Labour got credit for that and Fine Gael seemed to get very little credit for the measures introduced in the budget.  The two parties of the left appeared to be stealing what Fine Gael perceived to be the good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government parties trying to upstage each other do not fool the public <Col N="1821" /> which is discerning, well educated and capable of assessing measures announced in a budget.  Everybody knows that the country's finances are in a reasonably good condition.  As a result people expected the Minister to introduce a positive budget which would include measures to reform the tax system, generous social welfare increases and an onslaught on the problem of unemployment.  Many people looked forward to changes in the PRSI system as well as to incentives to help employers create more jobs and get people back to work.  Unfortunately, this budget cannot be described as radical or of major benefit to any section of the community.  It contains some welcome measures but in general it has done little to address any of the problems currently facing the country.</P>
    <P>Crime is one of our major problems but we cannot over-hype it because we may generate further fear in our communities. I welcome some of the measures announced by the Minister for Justice yesterday but I become concerned when I hear about measures involving additional appointments at the top level of an organisation.  If there is a problem in the health service, for example, additional administrators, chief executives or nursing officers are appointed in an effort to deal with it. The measure announced by the Minister for Justice yesterday involving the appointment of additional assistant commissioners will probably result in additional chief superintendents and superintendents being appointed.</P>
    <P>I am a little cynical of that whole exercise because it will make our police force top heavy and it will not create one extra garda vacancy in rural areas. Various reports to the present and previous Ministers for Justice indicate that what is needed to address the problem of crime is more gardaí on the beat in our communities and more gardaí working with young people and various organisations.  In that way they can keep in touch with the people in their communities and allay the fears, particularly of those living in rural communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> I appreciate the Minister is trying to reorganise the Force but I cannot understand how the appointment of additional assistant commissioners will do anything to allay the fears of people living in rural communities.  The Minister must seriously examine how the Garda operates, the number of additional gardaí required to deal with this problem and how those who are doing less meaningful work can be redeployed in the community.  It is not good enough to use gardaí to serve summonses on people who do not have dog licences when they could be engaged in far more important work.</P>
    <P>The lack of action in regard to the building of Castlerea prison has been highlighted over the years.  One could almost describe Castlerea as a lego prison. It is being built bit by bit just as children playing with lego make toys bit by bit.  The wall of Castlerea prison was built two years ago and prison spaces are now to be provided, according to the Minister's announcement yesterday. Perhaps in a few years, another part of the prison will be built.  Eventually we may have a prison in Castlerea but people are not willing to wait another two or three years to have it built.</P>
    <P>There are many large building contractors both here and in the UK with whom the Minister could enter into negotiations to have this prison built and leased to the Department of Justice over a number of years.  Such a system has operated in other Government Departments and it is common in other EU countries.  In that way.  Castlerea prison could be built within the next year or 18 months and I am sure there is sufficient ingenuity in the Department of Justice to negotiate such a contract thereby enabling the building of this prison go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The announcement in the budget of tax relief to enable people over the age of 65 purchase an alarm indicates how out of touch this Government is with the real Ireland.  If the problems facing old people living in rural communities were not so serious, this measure could be described as the joke of the year. <Col N="1823" /> However, 95 per cent of old age pensioners will not be able to avail of the tax relief announced in the budget because they are not in the tax net.  It is hard to believe that not one member of Cabinet was prepared to question this proposal when the Taoiseach and his 14 Cabinet Ministers discussed the budget on the eve of budget day.  This is a cynical exercise at the expense of old age pensioners.  It is farcical that three to four days later the Minister for Social Welfare should advertise in all the weekend newspapers requesting community groups and organisations to put forward ideas on a proper security system for old age pensioners.  In many towns and villages there are already security systems in operation.</P>
    <P>In Enniscorthy for the past 20 years they have a simple alarm system which works very well and probably does not cost more than £100 to install.  Recently I visited an old age pensioner near my home who has had the simple bell alarm system installed by the local community services council.  If she is in the kitchen, sitting room or bedroom she can ring the bell which tingles in the next door neighbour's house and the people there can come immediately to her assistance. The Minister for Social Welfare could have asked any community services council how its system operated without going to the expense of advertising in the newspapers.  Usually when a task force or review committee is set up, there is a long lead in time before action is taken by the Department.  This badly thought out exercise is very cynical and shows how out of touch the Government is with the general public.</P>
    <P>This year's 3 per cent increase in social welfare is certainly better than the 2.5 per cent derisory increase last year, the lowest for 30 years.  One would expect at a time of high growth, low inflation and low interest rates &mdash; buoyant times as described by the Minister for Finance &mdash; that widows, pensioners and other social welfare recipients would be better looked after.  The 3 per cent increase is not 3 per cent in real <Col N="1824" /> terms if one takes into account that the Government is already talking about an increase in ESB charges and the TV licence fee.  As Deputies know, if social welfare payments increase, local authority rents increase also.  By the time social welfare recipients get the increase next June, the 3 per cent will practically be written off and they will have no increase in real terms.</P>
    <P>During the middle to late 1980s and the early 1990s people in this category were told they would have to make sacrifices because of the Government's decision to balance the books to create a buoyant economy and that things would get better when the good times come.  I listened to Deputies on the far side saying our economy is the best in Europe.  We may have the best economy in Europe, but what does that mean?  If we have the best economy in Europe, social welfare recipients should get higher increases, there should be greater incentives for job creation and better work incentives right across the board.  This Government obviously does not believe in that philosophy, given that this is a &ldquo;give a little, take a little&rdquo; budget.  There is nothing radical in it that will change the direction in which we are going.</P>
    <P>Many of the 250,000 people who are unemployed have been unemployed for many years.  The Government introduced an £80 employment subsidy which I welcome but it must be strictly monitored.  In the past a certain number of employers abused the subsidy system. They laid people off who had been in employment with them long-term, replaced them with young people for whom they got a subsidy, and when the two year or three year period was up they were let go and others were employed.  The subsidies paid to employers, to employ young people or those who have been unemployed for three years must be strictly monitored. It is not good enough that an employer should decide to let someone go and then three months later recruit a new employee for whom he will receive an £80 subsidy.  There should be strict <Col N="1825" /> monitoring of employers availing of this scheme so that the number employed at the end of January in one year will have to be static for the firm to be eligible for a subsidy for new staff.</P>
    <P>The IDA has shown no interest in creating jobs in County Wexford.  Daily I read denials that the IDA south east region will be amalgamated with the south west region, although I have had the amalgamation confirmed by my investigation.  If this continues the south east region will be totally isolated and written off by the IDA.  This is an outrageous decision by IDA management with the support of the Minister.  It may put one or two persons in the office in Waterford but there will be no one capable of making a definite decision on industries in Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Waterford.  That is an issue I will continue to raise until we in County Wexford get satisfaction from the IDA.</P>
    <P>The budget is not inspiring and will not do anything for the thousands who are unemployed or on social welfare. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, had a tremendous opportunity, when one considers the state the finances were in, to change direction in those areas but he has failed to do that. The people will have to wait patiently until Fianna Fáil is returned to Government at the next election to battle on their behalf.</P>

    <P>Those signing on the dole and available for work awaited the budget with great expectation.  Following last year's budget when the Government declared that children would benefit from a system of revised allowances, a move heralded as an interim step towards a full guaranteed basic income for adults and children, many expected this budget to further develop the idea.  Unfortunately that did not happen.  It was reasonable to expect that something along those lines would be developed especially as the ESRI analysed and reported on the feasibility of a completely revised scheme of support which the guaranteed basic income scheme represents.  That was before there was any mention of shifting taxation from labour to finite resources, which must occur if the incentive to work is to be maintained and increased.</P>
    <P>It was reasonable for people to await the budget with great expectation when we consider the individual policies of the Government parties.  I took great interest in Fine Gael policy when that party espoused the guaranteed basic income scheme and saw it as a feasible and timely change in our economic support systems.  Democratic Left continues, at least in the back rooms, to espouse such a policy.  Leading members of the Labour Party attended conferences on this matter at which I was also present and have shown great interest in such a concept.  I am baffled that nothing in the budget reflects the vision, imagination or declared policies of the parties.</P>
    <P>When will the Government realise that society is changing rapidly?  GNP based economics benefit the few and many are left high and dry, unable to benefit from the so called &ldquo;good&rdquo; indicators. We do not have an indigenous enterprising society but depend on transnational corporations, which are reducing their workforces worldwide, to play an important role in providing employment.  Much work is left undone as it would not pay anyone to do it and <Col N="1827" /> people do not have time to do it on a voluntary basis.  Many children are neglected &mdash; I refer to those &ldquo;latchkey&rdquo; children who come home from school and fend for themselves until their parents come home from work.  Many elderly people live alone and are vulnerable to horrific attacks by ruthless criminals.  The urban drift continues unabated and people in rural areas are often lonely and isolated.  All these issues can be related to the economic policy we pursue.</P>
    <P>Dependency on private transport contributes to the imbalance in the balance of payments and to the fact that public transport is not viable.  The low usage of public transport increases the risk of attack on drivers.  Long-term unemployment places unimaginable strains on relationships as was highlighted in the recent divorce debate. Desperation silences concern about many international moral dilemmas. The arms trade provides employment but sales have reduced by half.  How will the Minister for Foreign Affairs respond when our EU partners call for increased arm sales to boost their employment figures? Lack of security of income resulting from short-term insecure work is becoming commonplace.  We have a wasteful consumer society.  Disposable goods are bought in preference to ones that last because they are cheaper. People do not insulate their homes and this results in heat loss and waste.</P>
    <P>Every Member is spared the desolation the Government failed to address in the budget.  I did not seek a rise and I was surprised to read about it on the back page of the <i>Irish Independent.</i> The Minister did not mention it in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that it was a general rise.  Neither I nor my party are prepared to sentence the unemployed to a Government economic regime that flies <Col N="1828" /> the flag of schemes, incentives and concern while it and its Progressive Democrat-Fianna Fáil look-a-likes know that all it is prepared to do is minimally reduce the unemployment figures in advance of the next inevitable recession.</P>
      <P>I hoped this Government would rise to the vision and challenge of revising the rights of citizens.  Our social welfare system is an amended form of the English poor law system from famine times.  We must face up to the need for radical change such as the guaranteed income scheme would bring about.  I agree it will not be a panacea until the tax burden is shifted from labour and part-time work is afforded the statutory protection given to traditional full-time work.  More and more people are forced to take up part-time employment. Sometimes it is a suitable form of employment, particularly for those rearing a family.</P>
      <P>In the Netherlands, Finland and Germany the guaranteed basic income is known as citizen's dividend or citizen's income.  In Finland a study found it to be revenue neutral.  Such a concept could be introduced quickly and would revolutionise our perception of ourselves and our fellow citizens.  Unlike the dole, with a guaranteed basic income the unemployed person is free to work.  As was stated in a recent issue of <i>The Big Issues</i> magazine what the unemployed need is a hand up not a hand out.  It is a right and not charitable assistance.  It would replace the tax allowance for those in employment and the bulging plethora of benefits which continue to confuse the unemployed. The battle lines between those who are overworked and overtaxed and the unemployed, poverty stricken dole claimants could be erased through such a scheme that would reveal the real gremlins in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a failure to shift tax from plentiful resources, such as human labour, to reduce the working week, fix minimum wages, particularly for less attractive work, to protect the rights of part-time and seasonal workers, and to renegotiate the chronic debt &mdash; £10,000 <Col N="1829" /> is owed by the Government for every man, woman and child.  This budget leaves in place the fundamentals of a divided society.  It concentrates power in the hands of an authoritarian State apparatus which trickles down a few pounds here and a few pence there.  No amount of tinkering with the social welfare system will stop its affront to the dignity of those who have recourse to it, particularly in its means tested elements.  Only a commitment to guaranteed basic income will assure people that their dignity, in employment, sickness and old age, is respected by the State.</P>
    <P>If this is the Minister for Social Welfare's budget, as many Fine Gael backbenchers say it is, it falls short of an achievement worth celebrating.  It falls short of replacing the intrusive social welfare assistance system and the tottering social insurance system with a single integrative guaranteed basic income for those who constitute the fabric of our society.  That is a move with which I expected Deputy De Rossa would agree.  This is a budget that will keep the information industry occupied and the poor atomised, individuated, incohesive and confused.</P>
    <P>This is a technically written, politically multi-faceted budget, which should be welcomed, but its lack of vision is unfortunate in that it offers no great hope.  The budget fails to tackle the root causes of division and strife in society. It fails to tackle centralisation &mdash; it adds to it &mdash; and it fails to simplify the State's services &mdash; it creates further layers of complexity.  Post offices are now seen as dole offices and very often social welfare offices are demeaning.  The budget fails to recognise that the State should have a certain humility as well as responsibility.  In that regard it is important to recall the comments about the awful measure to encourage people to install alarms in their houses when they are so poor that they are not even in the tax net.</P>
    <P>I wonder if any farmer was consulted about the number of tomato growers who will be unemployed and left on the <Col N="1830" /> human scrapheap as a result of our unwillingness to help, as the Belgians have done, in terms of the exchange rate debacle with the Spaniards.  Will the Government lay down the law to ensure banks help rather than hinder small and medium enterprise who, according to the Small Firms Association, even though they provide much employment, get a much tougher deal than the big operators?</P>
    <P>The scale of the challenge facing Irish society is not appreciated.  Almost one-third of the population lives below the poverty line.  Based on the labour force survey, if unemployment is to be eliminated by the year 2000 we need a net gain of 412,000 on the present number of jobs available.  Job numbers must therefore increase by 33 per cent in the next four years if unemployment is to be eliminated.  This budget predicts that jobs will increase by 31,000 this year, and the Government is boasting about that.  A more radical response is necessary.</P>

      <P>In the past week I was amused by the contradictory statements from a number of speakers, particularly in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Depending on whether they are addressing the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, speaking to the <i>Business and Finance</i> magazine or a community group in Ballymun, their attitude to the budget varies.  On the one hand they say the Government is spending too much money while on the other it is not spending enough on social welfare, health, education and so on.  I would like Deputy O'Dea, an honest, straightforward man, to spell out clearly where Fianna Fáil stands in terms of public spending.  As his leader Deputy Ahern said, we have identified savings in many areas, but when asked to spell <Col N="1831" /> them out he said that would be a hornet's nest.  People will want to know before the next election exactly where Fianna Fáil stands on his issue.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of low inflation and low interest rates is the cornerstone of the Government's policy.  Mortgage rates are at their lowest sustained level for almost 30 years, which is a major achievement, and short-term interest rates are at their lowest levels for 20 years.  If, for example, mortgage rates were at 12 per cent, as they were in January 1991 when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government was in power, the cost of a £50,000 mortgage would be £2,000 per annum or £38 per week more expensive that it is today.  Such low rates are of real benefit to taxpayers and outweigh any tax relief contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation was 2.5 per cent in 1995 while the EU average for the past five years was 4.1 per cent.  Inflation is expected to remain at about 2.25 per cent for 1996.  Low inflation and low interest rates provide a platform for economic growth.  The economy grew by 7.75 per cent last year, the highest in Europe.  The EU average has been 1.5 per cent per annum during the past five <Col N="1832" /> years.  It is expected that GDP will increase by 5.7 per cent during 1996, well ahead of the EU average.  The Irish economy has grown at a faster rate than the economy of any other OECD country. <i>Per capita</i> consumption has increased by 11 per cent, twice that of our fellow EU citizens, in the last five years.</P>
    <P>Let us analyse the fruits of our economic growth.  As a result of sound financial management the economy has the confidence of foreign and domestic investors.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, people who come here to consider opportunities for investment are very impressed with the way we are handling our financial affairs.  When I was in Opposition I always pointed out the positive indicators in the economy, but the present Opposition has not the generosity to accept that the economy is going well.  While it is the Opposition's duty to identify weaknesses in the economy, its attitude that everything the Government does is wrong is unacceptable.  I would like to hear a more positive approach from Deputy O'Dea today.</P>
    <P>As a result of sound financial management of the Irish economy, foreign and domestic investors have confidence in it.  During 1995, 45,000 jobs were created.  Four times more jobs were created during the past five years than during the preceding 30 years.  I recognise Fianna Fáil's contribution to that achievement and the contribution of the Progressive Democrats and Labour when in power with it.  We also made a substantial contribution to it last year. Employment has grown four times faster in Ireland than in other EU countries in recent years.  The Government has arrested the level of public spending which absorbs the benefit of growth and statistics are proof of that achievement. The real increase in public spending in 1996 will be 2.5 per cent which contrasts with an annual average of 5.5 per cent during the proceeding five years.</P>
    <P>During the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition public spending <Col N="1833" /> grew annually by approximately 6.5 per cent in real terms.  While succeeding in controlling public spending we were able to introduce free third level fees for the first time.  That proposal was promised by Fianna Fáil before the last election and Deputy Brennan presented a paper on it, but that party did not deliver.  We, together with the Labour Party, have delivered on it.</P>
    <P>We have also approved the largest programme ever of capital spending in the health area.  Secured through investment in education the highest numbers of pupils ever now remain in school until leaving certificate level.  We have also introduced for the first time a comprehensive programme for women's health.</P>
    <P>In the budget we introduced a cohesive plan targeted at releasing people from long-term unemployment to which I am sure nobody would object.  It is cynical to hear people question the feasibility of spending such a large sum on releasing people from the trap of unemployment.  I welcome the proposals in the budget to break the vicious circle of unemployment.  I hope these measures will enable some of the unemployed to get back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget, a further 18,000 people will be taken out of the tax net.  That measure will benefit the lower paid in particular and the majority of taxpayers will pay less tax.</P>
    <P>Overall, the budget is a comprehensive effort by the Government to address a multitude of problems which we are tackling in a positive way.</P>
    <P>In September 1995 our unemployment rate was 12.9 per cent compared with an average 10.6 per cent for the EU as a whole, a difference of more than 2 per cent.  Given that the gap in unemployment figures between Ireland and the EU in 1992 was 6.1 per cent, we are winning the battle and, hopefully, we can sustain this effort.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the agri-food sector which falls within my area of responsibility.  The budget has been framed in a way that improves work <Col N="1834" /> incentives for the long-term unemployed and promotes enterprise and the competitiveness of indigenous industries. There has been considerable growth in the economy in recent years but long-term unemployment has remained at unacceptably high levels. The budget measures aimed at improving the work incentives for the unemployed will have an impact on the uptake of employment opportunities as they arise.  The measures that provide for the retention of the medical card, the increase in the threshold of the family income supplement as well as the retention of the child dependant allowance will make a considerable contribution to job take up in rural areas, particularly in the agriculture and horticulture sectors.</P>
    <P>The taxation and other measures in the budget are intended to enhance the cost competitiveness of indigenous industries.  Measures designed to improve the cost base of the agri-food sector include an increase from £12,000 to £13,000 in the income threshold for employer's PRSI, a reduction from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent in the standard employer's PRSI rate and a decrease from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent in the lower employer's PRSI rate.  Those changes will benefit in particular labour intensive prepared consumer food companies and will dovetail the existing measures in place in the national food strategy to promote this important subsector of our food industry.</P>
    <P>Small indigenous service companies in the agriculture and food sectors will further benefit from the targeted reduction in corporation tax from 38 per cent to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of income.  By releasing additional funds for reinvestment in these companies this measure should assist enterprise development in rural areas.</P>
    <P>On structural reform, one of the impediments to the development of a more competitive agriculture sector is the age profile of farmers and farm size. The early retirement scheme is one of the measures that will improve farm structures.  That scheme is designed to <Col N="1835" /> encourage the transfer of holdings by older to younger farmers, especially dynamic young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>The budget introduced a series of changes to the taxation regime that should encourage early transfer of land to younger farmers by way of gift, inheritance or under leasing arrangements. The tax exemption on income from land leasing was increased from £3,000 to £4,000 for five and six year leases and from £4,000 to £6,000 for leases of seven years or more.  Those changes should encourage longer-term leases and come at a time when the purchase price of agricultural land is becoming costly for new entrants and existing farmers wanting to enlarge their holdings.  As part of the land policy we will be introducing shortly, we are encouraging people to lease land to younger participants.  We are also assuring farmers that from a social welfare or taxation viewpoint they should not be fearful about leasing land.  That measure is very much a part of Fine Gael's land use policy.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the standard business relief for capital acquisitions tax.  Farmers subject to gift and inheritance tax on the transfer of land, buildings, livestock and machinery should benefit as a result of this concession. The new arrangements will not replace the existing generous ones that apply to gift transfers for farmers.  The removal of the anomaly whereby farmers transferring their assets on retirement could become liable for tax on paper profits on the difference between the written down and market value of the transferred stock is welcome.  That change should further encourage land transfer, especially under the early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>The fact that income from REPS of up to £2,000 will now be ignored for the purpose of means testing for agricultural assistance should help a large number of farmers, especially those along the western seaboard.  It removes a barrier which prevented farmers participating in that scheme.  I am delighted the <Col N="1836" /> Minister for Finance accepted this proposal and I thank him for doing so.  It should benefit smaller farmers in the west of Ireland, on islands and throughout the country as it removes a significant barrier to participation in that scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding reduced excise duty on LPG, pig and poultry farmers, in particular, have benefited from this provision in the budget.  The reduction by 2p per gallon in the excise duty on nonautomotive LPG should go some way towards improving the competitiveness of these sectors and should ease the competitive pressure from Northern Ireland and the UK which has intensified during recent years as a result of lower wage costs and exchange rate differences.</P>
    <P>The increase in the VAT refund rate for farmers from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent will be significant for those farmers not currently registered for VAT but who are required to pay VAT on their inputs.  The cost of this concession will be £6.3 million this year and £9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the farm leaders decided to ignore that very positive provision when commenting on the budget.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Votes for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have been combined in line with Government policy to develop an integrated approach to rural development, thus maximising the potential and productive capacity of rural resources while having regard to the importance of protecting our rural environment.</P>
    <P>The prospects for agriculture generally in 1996 appear to be quite promising in the dairy and sheep sectors and I hope the present problems in the beef sector will be overcome.  In addition, in 1995 indications were that the rate of decline in agricultural employment slowed considerably, total employment in that sector between the years 1994 and 1995 fell by only 1,000, a creditable performance, and reflecting the range of policies put in place to support rural enterprise and the farming community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> Overall this is a very good budget, with many positive provisions to help agriculture and rural communities in general which should be recognised by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Many Members interested in economics eagerly awaited the Progressive Democrats's document entitled &ldquo;An End to Tax and Spend&rdquo; which transpired to be a very flimsy Doheny and Nesbitt school of economics production that did not address the central problems of tax equity and reduction within our economy.  There are many objectives in that document with which I agree &mdash; it is insane that someone with a salary as low as £250 weekly should be subjected to a marginal tax rate of 57 per cent.  In addition, clearly it is wrong that ordinary workers should support up to five different levels of tax on their salaries.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the basic sums in the Progressive Democrats' document simply do not add up.  Deputy Michael McDowell either is a dunce or, in some future Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government, is prepared to ruthlessly wield the knife, perhaps as a &ldquo;Mac the Knife&rdquo; Progressive Democrats Minister for Finance, causing devastation for the weakest sections of our society.  In recent days I have begun to wonder whether Deputy McDowell is not the Steven Forbes of Irish politics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sums in this Document <i>An End to Tax and Spend</i> simply do not add up.  They clearly imply ruthless cuts in health, education and welfare, these being the prescription of any Government that would seek to adhere to the figures outlined in it up to the year 2000. <Col N="1838" /> Undoubtedly the Progressive Democrats also fully intend to implement a remorseless programme of privatisation, not only of our commercial semi-State bodies but of a significant proportion of our Civil Service by contracting out at all levels within those sectors to find their planned budget figures.</P>
    <P>On page 23 of that document I notice a sanctimonious reference to the electricity and water industries being unsuitable for privatisation, no doubt based on the fact that everybody will have witnessed its disastrous consequences in Britain.</P>
    <P>The old Progressive Democrats' tax mantra is also just not true.  For example, in terms of tax-GDP ours is a medium-level tax country.  In <i>The Revenue Statistics of OECD Member States</i> some years ago, ours was 13th out of its 24 member states in terms of tax to gross domestic product.  In terms of the ratio of tax to gross domestic product we observe that the 1996 £12.5 billion budget has been drawn out of a gross domestic product of £36 billion, thus maintaining that ratio.</P>
    <P>In coming months, right up to the next general election, Fianna Fáil has the fundamental choice of either travelling the harsh Progressive Democrats road &mdash; of course, when many members of the Progressive Democrats left the Fianna Fáil Party there were rumours that other, now prominent, Fianna Fáil front benchers would also become Progressive Democrats &mdash; and support this policy or supporting social solidarity. Let the electorate beware after the next election, the smiling poster face of Deputy Bertie Ahern will be transformed into the harsh unforgiving features of Deputy Michael McDowell, if current trends continue.  That is the reality and the electorate had better face it.</P>
    <P>In regard to macroeconomic and fiscal policy, the Minister for Finance deserves enormous congratulations on his first year in office as the first Labour Minister for Finance.  The figures he presented to the House, with one exception, represent the best performance in <Col N="1839" /> our economy since 1922, with employment rising by 45,000 and, by the end of this year, forecast to be just in excess of 1.25 million people which, if my memory serves me correctly, would represent the highest number of citizens at work in the history of the Republic. Like the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, I hope the Government will aim at our second All Ireland in a year or one and a half years' time because Government performance, in particular that of the Minister for Finance, has been remarkable and is deserving of congratulation.</P>
    <P>Also to be borne in mind are the advantages, our lowest ever level of interest rates afford householders and small businesses and our low inflation rate, well below the European Union average, in respect of which the Minister for Finance has performed creditably and in which his party and Government take pride.</P>
    <P>One of our newspapers characterised this budget as a Maastricht budget. Indeed the overall Maastricht fiscal parameters are very tight for any Minister for Finance.  If the Maastricht criteria develop and we adopt the euro, we must ensure that compensatory mechanisms are in place for us as a peripheral member state; in other words, full economic union which would be disastrous for us. Indeed, the example of many other countries in terms of social solidarity should be examined by Irish policy makers.</P>
    <P>Many Members have been struck by a new book on Japan entitled &ldquo;Blindside&rdquo; which appears to imply that the regrouping Japanese economy is based on the fundamental solidarity of all classes and sections of Japanese society who ruthlessly support &ldquo;Japan Incorporated&rdquo;, the pay-off being a job for everybody. Likewise is the case of our Labour counterparts in Australia over the past ten or 12 years, Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Bob Hawke.  Australian Labour invented the famous job contract. The Australian White Paper of <Col N="1840" /> the mid-1980s, drafted largely by Paul Keating, specified that every long-term unemployed person, through co-operation between the Government and private sector, should be given a job. That is another proposition the Minister for Finance, his Opposition counterpart, Deputies McCreevy and Mr. Michael McDowell might examine for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the positive measures taken by the Minister and Government to alleviate the huge problem of unemployment, such as raising the £50 exemption in the calculation of PRSI contributions to £80 per week and raising the threshold of employers' PRSI to £13,000 per annum in terms of employees' weekly earnings.  Many businessmen in my constituency have informed me that that will be of considerable assistance to them.</P>
    <P>In addition I welcome the extension of the community employment scheme and the reservation of a quarter of its places for the long-term unemployed.  I also hope that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will speedily implement the £80 subsidy scheme and request him to invite some key, private employers &mdash; for example, within my constituency, Cadbury's &mdash; to participate, thus deliberately targeting the older, long-term unemployed.  All Members will have met people who have been unemployed over a six to ten year period who, if given some hope, would constitute a major step forward.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposed improvements in the personal tax regime.  Next year perhaps the Minister for Finance will examine an even more fundamental, radical step in this area. For example, a basic rate of 25 per cent and a top rate of 45 per cent could be achieved for a cost of £280 million.  Of course, in the 1970s the Labour Party invented the 20 per cent rate.  Long before the Progressive Democrats ever thought or spoke of such a basic rate. One of my predecessors, former Deputy Michael O'Leary advocated and helped implement it, another proposal worthy of examination for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> I note the local employment service will again receive approximately £6 million under this budget.  I ask the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment to examine any methods by which the amount of money available for this purpose could be increased.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum advocated a sum of £30 million for the local job placement service a number of years ago.  In my constituency of Dublin North-East &mdash; Coolock, Kilbarrack, Donaghmede, Raheny &mdash; many of my constituents hope the funding of £4 million currently allocated to the Northside Partnership for the five years, 1995-2000, will be significantly increased.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell and the Taoiseach.  The Northside Partnership was the model.  The local employment service, with which I am proud to have been involved, was stablished as a result of intense efforts by local businesses, trade unions and community groups during the past eight or ten years.  The Northside Partnership now deals with an area inhabited by 108,000 people.  The programme which the Northside Partnership board want to implement would cost about £10 million so I would ask Ministers to re-examine this allocation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new measures for the development of enterprise, in particular the measures on corporation tax which will certainly be of great assistance to smaller service companies.  I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, on his continued reforms and developments in the social welfare area.  I welcome the child benefit initiatives and that resources are being directed towards children in poverty.  Deputies have always had difficulty in dealing with the calculations for unemployment assistance for those in part-time employment.  A few years ago, at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts with the Secretary of the Department, Deputy Rabbitte and I found it difficult to explain the operation of certain disregards.  I notice the <Col N="1842" /> Minister for Social Welfare is at long last modernising this and making it a weekly rather than a daily system.  I welcome also the proposal to allow unemployed people returning to work retain medical cards for three years.  These are all great initiatives.</P>
    <P>As I have said three years running in my budget debate contribution to this House the absolute levels of social welfare payments are still sadly low.  The basic £64.50 rate for a single person, or just over £100 for a couple is unacceptably low.  In its budget submission, the Conference of Religious in Ireland criticised all parties in the House in respect of the levels of social welfare payments.  Even an increase of 3 per cent does not make that much difference to those rates.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has set up a new national poverty strategy. The total social welfare budget of just over £4 billion now supports a population of more than one million people, but there are 3.5 million people in the State.  We earn £36 billion which means we give the poorest, comprising more than one-third of the population less than a ninth of our national income. That is disgraceful.  Governments, through employment and other initiatives should ensure as few people as possible are on the lowest levels of social welfare.  I agree with Deputy Sargent that this is an area we have to address.  Obviously, the demographic factors which have hindered us in the past will improve and I hope we will be able to allocate more resources to the poorest people in society.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the achievements of the Government in the areas of health, the environment and in education where pre-schools, primary schools and the introduction of free third level education benefits &mdash; despite what the Opposition have said &mdash; many poorer and working class parents.  I notice, on the capital side, the Government is borrowing £647 million.  My rural colleagues will be pleased that some of that <Col N="1843" /> will be allocated at long last to improve the road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on the budget.  His ideas on multi-annual budgets are also valuable and should be progressed.  To some extent, this Minister for Finance has demythified the budget process.  I look forward to his vision of 2010 and our society being as wealthy and as developed as the rest of Europe.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because this budget and its accompanying hype is nothing other than a series of loosely connected frauds which the Government is attempting to perpetrate on the electorate. I will deal with them separately. There is a double fraud relating to taxation. The first fraud is a minor one, a summary offence which would only result in the Government being fined or <Col N="1844" /> serving a short term but the second is much more serious.  The first fraud relates to the figures in the Principal Features of the Budget which tell us that in terms of a reduction in net income, people on various amounts of gross income will be 1.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent, 2 per cent etc. better off.  Those tables are fraudulent because they deal with a rare individual or couple.  They point out the changes in gross income for a person who does not pay a mortgage, does not pay VHI, does not smoke, does not use ATM cards, does not drive or engage in any other form of activity that would attract increased indirect taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Even leaving out those factors, the net gains, as outlined in the Principal Features of the Budget, are 0.7 per cent, 0.6 per cent, 2 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.8 per cent, 1.7 per cent, 1.5 per cent and back to 0.8 per cent and so on. A number of accountancy firms and financial journalists who have factored in the mortgage and VHI changes arrived at figures such as 0.25 per cent, 0.2 per cent, 0.1 per cent.  That is the reality.  As the Minister will be aware it is not mathematically possible to factor in the indirect tax changes.  I am afraid the net result of the tax changes, as opposed to the tax give aways, leaves the taxpayer, in net terms, roughly where he or she was prior to the budget being introduced.</P>
      <P>The more serious fraud in the taxation provisions of the budget lies in the Government propaganda that all forms of tax, including income tax would be reduced.  Even factoring in the changes to which I have referred there would be the minimalist reduction in the total tax take if income stood still, but it will not. We estimate income will increase to the rate of inflation by 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent.  The reality is that income will increase and the tax yield will increase, in percentage terms, by much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> By its own admission, the Government plans to extract £730 million more in taxation this year from the people than in 1995.  I am not asking members of the Government side to take my word; it is clear from the Budget Statement. That is £2 million more in taxation for every single day of the year.  If we assume there are one million taxpayers, that amounts to £14 per week more tax for every taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The international body produced a report which deals in a particularly effective, succinct and balanced way with the remit given to it.  I wish to add to those tributes made in this House last week my appreciation of Senator Mitchell and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe last week, the body has set out a strikingly clear set of principles.  The trust that would be created, through the full and unequivocal acceptance of these principles, could get all parties together in negotiations.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck, in this connection, by the validity and forthright expression of the international body's call for the decommissioning of mindsets, at its demand that we put aside the past inventories of historical recrimination and especially at its call on parties to take effective steps to prevent &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; killings and beatings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it was such a good report, I was disappointed at the response of the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons on Wednesday last.  In all recent contact with the Prime Minister and with the British Government, at <Col N="1847" /> both political and official levels, the Irish Government viewpoint has been put clearly and consistently.  An elective process in Northern Ireland should flow from all party talks, not <i>vice versa,</i> and it could only work if it had widespread support.  As succinctly put in the Mitchell report, the conditions of being broadly acceptable, of having an appropriate mandate and of respecting the three strands are essential.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister was fully aware of our viewpoint on this matter when he spoke in the House of Commons last Wednesday.  Since then I have been in direct contact with him by letter on two occasions.  In the first letter I set out the position that I put to him on Tuesday night last week that an elective process should flow from talks and not <i>vice versa</i> and that any such process should be grounded on the Mitchell Report conditions and, furthermore, that the joint firm aim of all party talks by end February remained in place so far as the Irish Government was concerned.</P>
    <P>In the second letter I made clear our view that first, both Governments should now use the intensified political track to put the principles of the Mitchell report, and the report's approach to decommissioning, to all the parties, and ask them to agree to accept and to honour them.  Acceptance would form the basis of a move to all party talks by end February, which is our joint firm aim as agreed in the communiqué of 28 November; and, second, the issue of a possible elective process should be discussed on an intensive basis in the political track to see if there are any proposals in this area which can meet the Mitchell report's three tests.  The Irish Government's position is that it is premature to reach a conclusion on whether such proposals can be arrived at until the discussion in the political track has been brought to a conclusion. If the criterion of broad acceptability is to be met the Unionist parties must persuade the Nationalists parties that their fears are unfounded.  The political track <Col N="1848" /> is there precisely to allow that sort of exercise to take place.</P>
    <P>No further purpose is served by adding to historical recrimination on this matter.  The two Governments should resume close co-operation on the basis of steps to be agreed between us &mdash; a process which has served us well over time.  I will, therefore, meet the British Prime Minister as planned in February to review progress in the preparatory talks for all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>Other important steps in that context will be the meeting between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State tomorrow and a series of meetings with the Irish Government at party leader level over the next number of weeks to which we have issued invitations to the leaders of the various Northern political parties.  One such invitation has been issued to Mr. David Trimble, the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, with whom there has been contact recently.</P>
    <P>I have written to President Clinton to set out our position on the way ahead &mdash; as I have given it in this reply &mdash; and to ask for his continuing support.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the British strategy changed following the leak of the report to the <i>Irish Independent</i>?  Did Irish diplomats attached to the Embassy in London lobby support for the commission's report on Tuesday evening before it was published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a lunch took place on Tuesday in the Irish Embassy for a party of British Conservative MPs who are coming to Ireland.  In the course of discussions <Col N="1849" /> questions were asked by the MPs about the Irish Government's position on the reported content of the Mitchell report. I understand that in replying to those questions our ambassador, quite properly, gave his best assessment of the Irish Government's view on those matters. This is a perfectly normal process of briefing which occurs daily by the Irish Embassy of British MPs and, I have no doubt, by the British Embassy in Ireland of Members of the Dáil. There is nothing unusual about it and any suggestion that it provided a pretext for any change of position on the part of the British Government in this matter is ludicrous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Mitchell report represented a real breakthrough and it should have been accepted by both Governments as a way of moving towards all-party talks by the end of February, the firm date set?  Does he further agree that the real tragedy of the events which took place last week and the attitude adopted by the British Government was that they prevented all parties taking a careful and considered view of the contents of the Mitchell report, particularly the six principles?  In view of the attitude of the British Government and the way in which it betrayed the Taoiseach's trust &mdash; he has the full support of Members on this side of the House in rejecting its unilateral action &mdash; does he think the opportunity is lost to make early progress on the political talks and decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with Deputy Ahern that the entirely unnecessary controversy which has been created by what was said in the House of Commons about an elected body has diverted attention from the detail of the excellent Mitchell report.  It is important to stress that the report not only calls for the decommissioning of mindsets and suggests that we should not look in a distrustful way at what others are suggesting but rather in a way which indicates a desire to move forward but it <Col N="1850" /> also contains in paragraph 20 the six principles.</P>
      <P>All participants in the talks should be satisfied that the other participants are committed, not only verbally but in reality, to those six principles.  The only way that Unionists can satisfy themselves of Sinn Féin's commitment to the six principles is if they are willing to sit in the same room with Sinn Féin, go through those principles one by one and put all their questions, doubts and worries about Sinn Féin's commitment to those principles directly to its representatives and get answers.  Trust is built through dialogue.  It is not achieved by refusing to talk to one another.  That is why I laid much stress in my address to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the need for Unionists to be willing, after 17 months of peace, to sit down with Sinn Féin. They should not cast their worries or suspicions aside or leave them at the door &mdash; they should bring them in &mdash; but they should put them to Sinn Féin across the table and seek to get satisfactory answers.</P>
      <P>There are many challenges in this report which the recent controversy has prevented from being put appropriately to those to whom they should be made. Paragraph 38 of the report sets out detailed views about how decommissioning might take place.  It says that decommissioning should have a high priority in talks and take place during talks.  All those aspects of the report should be put to those parties associated with those who hold arms and they ought to be asked if they accept each part of the report.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Ahern rightly said, the unnecessary and premature controversy generated about the election has prevented those questions from being put to those relevant people who could give the appropriate answers.</P>

      <P>The DUP has not cooperated with the twin track approach in any way while the UUP has only partly done so.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is strange that the British <Col N="1851" /> Government has rewarded their non co-operation by adopting their position hook, line and sinker?  Can the Taoiseach explain how the Ulster Unionists believe they can win both his and the Government's support by refusing to talk to him, which they have done since Christmas, especially as no one has explained how an elected body charged with negotiations is compatible with the three strand approach?</P>
      <P>The Unionists say the Taoiseach needs a mandate to talk to Sinn Féin. Is the Taoiseach aware of any Unionist commitments to seek an electoral mandate to enter direct all party talks with Sinn Féin without preconditions on a three-stranded basis organised by the two Governments?  Even if we tried to understand their logic, which I do not, would he agree that such a commitment is essential if the proposal is even to be discussed in any forum?</P>

      <P>It is essential that the Unionist parties should meet with the Government with a view to putting their point of view on these matters and allowing the Government to put its questions and concerns, and there are many of them, about an elective process in terms of the way in which it might be divisive and might not fully or adequately respect the three stranded, and especially the North-South, dimension of the problem.  All these questions need to be discussed.</P>
      <P>The British and Irish Governments agreed to have a political track for discussing these matters.  The British Government is one of the parties to the agreement which set up the political track.  An unwillingness by Unionists to participate in that track creates a difficulty in establishing what exactly the Unionist view is in accepting the views of their Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred in his response to the unnecessary controversy that followed the House of Commons speech and &ldquo;the premature controversy about the election&rdquo;.  I am <Col N="1852" /> surprised at those comments.  What happened in the House of Commons last week has been very damaging to the process and it will be difficult to get the talks back on the rails again.</P>
      <P>Why did the British Government strategy change between the time the Taoiseach spoke to the British Prime Minister and the time the latter spoke in the House of Commons?  I am not only talking about who delivered the speech. Is it the case that the British approach to the Mitchell Commission report changed between Tuesday evening and Wednesday afternoon?</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern has asked me to explain the Unionist position. I feel no more qualified to do that than to explain the British Government's position to Deputy Harney.  I am required to explain the Irish Government's position.</P>
      <P>In so far as the position adopted by the British Prime Minister is concerned, nobody, including myself, would have been surprised at his making in his speech favourable references to the role an election might play in solving the problem.  It has been well known for some time that the British Government sees &mdash; it is not alone in this &mdash; an elective process as being helpful in moving forward.  The problem arose at the end of his speech when he said there were only two ways in which all party negotiations could be taken forward &mdash; either an election or prior decommissioning. We have not reached the point where we can make categorical and closed statements of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three and a half weeks of the political track still to run and no participant in that track, whether it be a Government or a political party, should say there are only a few ways of going forward at this stage.  The whole purpose of the political track is to allow for discussion and above all, listening.  If people adopt pre-emptive positions which appear to close off the possibility of further dialogue on other options &mdash; unfortunately this seems to have happened with one interpretation of part of <Col N="1853" /> the Prime Minister's script &mdash; one is not open to the sort of dialogue proper to the political track.</P>
    <P>Any initiative taken by Governments should be taken jointly.  The approach that has yielded the best results in Anglo-Irish relations under successive Governments in this House and in Britain has been of moving together after proper consultation on the basis of verifiable agreements, not in moving unilaterally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Our difficulties last week were caused by the pre-emptive and unilateral response of the British Government.  We, on this side of the House, have always tried to understand our Unionist friends in the North, but they are seeking an election to an <Col N="1854" /> assembly without entering into an agreement to take part in all-party talks immediately thereafter.  If the British Government supports such a proposal, it is only proper that we should understand what it entails.  I have listened to and studied very carefully what Mr. Trimble has said.  He is endeavouring to tie people into that proposal.</P>
      <P>At Question Time on the day after the communiqué was issued on 28 November I asked the Taoiseach if he would accept that it would be dangerous for the Government to give so much encouragement and credence to the idea of an assembly as a means of securing all-party talks, particularly given Mr. Trimble's apparent rejection of strand II of the talks process, and he replied &ldquo;not at all&rdquo;.  I raised that question because of the changes which had been made between September when its publication was postponed and 28 November when it was finally issued.  When was the Taoiseach informed that the British Government would support the proposal that an election to an assembly be held and was he informed of this by the British Prime Minister?  Did he explain what the reaction here would be to such a proposal?</P>
      <P>At the Forum on the previous Friday Government officials actively suggested to the representatives of this side of the House, Sinn Féin and the SDLP that the idea of an assembly should not be rejected out of hand.  Why were they doing so?  Was the Taoiseach sympathetic to the idea, as I suggested in the House in early December?  I further suggest that he was taken by surprise by the way the British Government so openly and bluntly accepted this proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We set out in the communiqué the content of the political track and acknowledged that there were ideas emanating from the Unionist community, such as the role of an election to an assembly.  If the political track is to work, it is important that we do everything possible to encourage them to participate, put forward their ideas <Col N="1855" /> and test their acceptability to Nationalists. In order to encourage them to discuss their ideas with a view to reaching agreement, rather than proceed on their own, a specific reference was made in the communiqué to the effect that &ldquo;both Governments acknowledge that there is space for you here to discuss your ideas within the political track&rdquo;.  That was a reasonable approach to adopt.  As the Deputy said, we must show that we are willing to give a hearing to and have room for the views of those with whom we may not traditionally have agreed.</P>
      <P>As I have said many times, including today in response to both Deputy Harney and the Deputy, there was no surprise on my part nor anywhere in the House at the British Prime Minister making a favourable reference in his contribution in the House of Commons to the role an election might play.  It would have been surprising if he had not, given that paragraph 56 of the Mitchell report specifically refers to an election and sets down three conditions upon which an election could be helpful.</P>
      <P>As I explained to Deputy Harney, what was unexpected and unhelpful was not the reference to the role an election might play but the statement that there were effectively only two ways forward towards talks, an election before talks, not following from talks, and prior decommissioning.  This was both pre-emptive of the political track and unacceptable in the way it was presented to the Nationalist community. I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Deputy bringing into the House a version of a conversation in which he did not participate. That conversation took place at the initiative of Dr. Martin Mansergh of Fianna Fáil with Mr. Shane Kenny who in the privacy and informality of the Forum expressed views in favour of allowing openness towards the possible role an election might play in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the forum I expressed the hope that not only would we benefit <Col N="1856" /> from the public sessions but also that there would be an opportunity for those who supported various points of view and parties to have private and informal discussions with one another in the corridors of the Forum.  This is not helped if people of the standing of the Leader of Fianna Fáil introduce second-hand accounts of conversations in which they did not take part which are designed to make a political point and, in this instance, are entirely inaccurate as to who initiated the conversation.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the approach the Deputy is adopting in this matter, but I hope he will not pursue every private conversation which might have taken place at the Forum between members of his party and my own because, if we want to create an inventory of conversations, more than one party could participate usefully in that process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have an open mind about every option, but what happened last week in the House of Commons has proved damaging to the process and it will be difficult to put it back on the rails again.  There was a selective leaking of information from Washington published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday and the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Wednesday.  The well-intentioned lobbying of backbenchers in the House of Commons put pressure on the British Prime Minister who was forced to give that response last week.  If we do not understand why things happen we will not be able to find a way around them. Will the Taoiseach accept what I am saying and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he accept that the British Government has now effectively and officially relegated the Mitchell Commission and the twin track approach to a secondary role behind the holding of elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Deputy's assumptions about the reasons for the approach adopted by the Prime <Col N="1857" /> Minister and the idea that anybody would react in pique over a matter of that nature.  I do not believe the leaks to which the Deputy referred occurred in this jurisdiction; they did not occur in this jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not occur in this jurisdiction and were not, as far as I am concerned, from Irish sources.  The Deputy's suggestion whereby she is implicitly accepting that the leaks came from Irish sources &mdash; which I do not accept &mdash; is not tenable.</P>
      <P>It would not be productive for me to engage in speculation about the reasons for what was done in the House of Commons on Wednesday and I do not wish to add to the differences and disagreements over the events of the last week.  At this juncture I have an obligation to express my views.  However, having done that, it is time to work in a constructive way with the British Government to restore a joint approach to these matters in accordance with our agreements.  We have made clear agreements with the British Government. The communiqué of 28 November was not easy to negotiate; it took a long time and much work went into it.  It was a finely balanced communiqué.  If one makes such an agreement one works with it in conjunction with one's partner.</P>
      <P>In so far as the peace process is concerned, we intend to work in partnership with the British Government.  That is the best way forward.  While we will, occasionally, have differences with the British Government as we had last week, that does not take from my determination or the determination of the Tánaiste and the Government to work in a concerted way to bring the peace process forward in co-operation with the British Government.  That is the way we should work henceforth.  The approach of both Opposition parties today has been helpful in that regard.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to pursue what went on over lunch hour at the forum because it is a useful process for the Taoiseach.  However, I cannot leave something that is not factual on the record.  During the day two senior officials of the Taoiseach's office canvassed the senior co-ordinators and advisers of three parties on a particular line.  That evening we all wondered what the Taoiseach and his advisers were at, as it was not just one question put by somebody in one place.  The Taoiseach might tell the House whether he agreed with the version put forward by the named official.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach did not answer a more important question.  Did the Prime Minister, John Major, inform the Taoiseach that he would tell the House of Commons he was moving towards the Assembly idea?</P>

      <P>The thesis the Deputy is trying to advance has little ballast underpinning it because his assistant failed to recognise one of the people to whom he was talking.  That said, I have a full report of the conversation from Mr. Shane Kenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Kenny was approached by a member of Sinn Féin and by a Fianna <Col N="1859" /> Fáil adviser separately in the course of normal contacts at the forum.  During separate conversations, Mr. Kenny gave assurances that the Government's view was that a proposal for an elective body should be considered in the political track under the terms of the November communiqué.  He also said that the Government would insist that any such proposal would have to be firmly anchored in the three stranded approach and that the Irish Government would not countenance the return of a Stormont type assembly.  He expressed the view that we should be open to discussing the proposal since it was put forward by Unionist parties and this was specifically provided for in the terms of the communiqué.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil adviser made it clear that his party would reject the Mitchell body report if it proposed such an elective body as it was outside the international body's remit.  These conversations and exchanges of views, for which the forum is most useful, were not based on anything other than publicly known information at that time.</P>

That will cause problems from the point of view of others having conversations with Dr. Mansergh in future because there will be the fear that any such conversations could be introduced into the public domain by Deputy Ahern.  That is not good from the point of view of the work of Dr. Mansergh. He has a useful contribution to make to public affairs even though he is employed by the party in Opposition.  It is not fair to him that his conversation should be repeated in this manner by Deputy Ahern.  I ask the Deputy to repent of the mistake he made in this instance.</P>

      <P>I support the Taoiseach's remarks about the need for all-party talks.  Does he agree that the two Governments have a crucial leadership role to play in that regard and that it is not appropriate that either Government should stand by as helpless onlookers?  Rather, they should encourage those over whom they have influence to participate in the talks and not merely wash their hands of their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the two Governments have a leadership role to play in regard to this matter.  Given the divided nature of society in Northern Ireland, most of the initiative must come from the two Governments, but if the leadership is to be effective the two Governments must act together.  They cannot act unilaterally and for that reason I put great store on acting in accordance with agreements I have with the British Government.  That is the way forward and the way in which we can exercise the type of leadership which the Deputy correctly stated is necessary from the two Governments.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was told in a telephone call from the British Prime Minister that he intended to refer to an assembly, did it not occur to him to contact the Prime Minister later that evening about the matter?  Did the importance of getting across to the Prime Minister the view of Nationalist Ireland on this matter or the fact that he was reneging on the Mitchell Commission not occur to the Taoiseach? How does this square with the meeting the Taoiseach proposes to have with the Prime Minister in mid-February?  Is the Taoiseach not deluding himself in <Col N="1864" /> believing that that meeting will be a review of progress towards the aims agreed on 29 November?  Those aims have been cynically blown out of the water by the British Prime Minister and the Northern Secretary who stated that they are committed to an elected assembly and do not propose going down the track agreed between the two Governments on 29 November.</P>

      <P>In my discussions with the British Prime Minister I made it clear that the question of an election should flow from all-party talks and not <i>vice versa.</i> I outlined to him my informed view that the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland are strongly opposed to his approach.  I also outlined their concern about the need to maintain the three stranded context and their rooted opposition to anything that could be construed as a return to Stormont.  I also counselled the Prime Minister against saying anything that would put others on the spot and require them to react negatively in view of their known positions.  I asked him to ensure that there would be adequate consultation the following day on the detailed texts of what might be said.  That did not occur because the text of what the Prime Minister said was not furnished to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On many occasions over recent months the Taoiseach made great play of the fact that he does not see himself as the leader of Nationalist Ireland but as representing a broader view of the traditions on this island.  In view of what has happened over the last week or so, does he now accept that was the wrong approach to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that, in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, I have a responsibility for all the people who live on this island whatever political ideology or viewpoint they have.  That means that I have a responsibility to be concerned about the views and interests of the Irish Unionist people living in Northern Ireland and with those of the Nationalist tradition living in Northern Ireland.  I am bound to do that under Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Our Constitution does not say that the only people who are Irish are those who are Catholic or who live in Northern Ireland and happen to be Catholic.  Our Constitution is an inclusive Constitution, and it seeks to protect the interests of people of both traditions in Northern Ireland.  It is time those who promote the merits of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution recognised that those Articles require me &mdash; it is not an option &mdash; to be concerned about Unionist views, because Unionists who live in Northern Ireland, who live on this island, live within the area to which that constitutional provision refers.  I do not see myself, therefore, as leader of any part of the Irish <Col N="1867" /> people or any section of the Irish people who happen to agree with a particular ideological viewpoint about national development.  I have to have a concern for the views and concerns of all who live on this island whether or not they feel any sense of allegiance to this House, because that is what is provided in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. That is something to which the Deputy and his party might address their attention.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the lecture on Articles 2 and 3, but coming from that side of the House in relation to this side of the House who have been party to all the negotiations on the peace process it is a bit much to take.  Mr. Trimble wrote recently to the Tánaiste in fairly trenchant terms saying that the two Governments were distinct parties and could not, with integrity, portray each other as dealing with identical views.  That was mirrored in what Mr. Taylor said in the last few days when he refused any offer of talks with the Government on the basis that we were a foreign Government.  Can the Taoiseach reconcile that with what he said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is clear. The Irish Government has an obligation under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to look particularly to the interests of the Nationalist community, but under our Constitution we have an obligation to concern ourselves with all the people who live on this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something the Deputy and his party should reflect upon occasionally.  We do have that obligation to be concerned with the viewpoints of both sides in Northern Ireland.  Even if the Constitution did not provide that we should, common sense would require that we do, because there will be no settlement unless there is <Col N="1868" /> agreement, and there will be no agreement until one side attempts to understand the concerns of the other.  If the Irish Government simply sets out to understand the concerns and views of one side of the community in Northern Ireland, there would be no prospect of agreement.  Of course the Irish and British Governments have differing perspectives on the matter.  That is normal. However, at the same time we are working towards a common objective, and that common objective requires each to be concerned about the views of the other and of both communities.  In the case of the British Government, in particular in the last week, it ought perhaps to have paid a little more attention to the concerns and views of the Nationalist community before making proposals that appeared to present just two alternative routes forward towards all-party talks.</P>

      <P>The decommissioning issue has caused an impasse in the peace process for some considerable time.  The Mitchell Commission, therefore, was brought in to resolve the differences between the two Governments.  After his telephone call with the British Prime Minister relating to the Mitchell Commission, was it the Taoiseach's view that the commission's report found favour with the British Government and was generally acceptable to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my view that the British Prime Minister was of the opinion that the Mitchell Commission produced a good report, well written and clear, that there were certain parts of it that caused him some discomfort but that the report was considered to be a good one and a good basis for moving forward.  In particular my understanding was that he fully accepts, and accepted, the six principles contained in the report.  We should now return to the six <Col N="1869" /> principles and the other recommendations contained in the report, for example, the recommendations that decommissioning should take place during all-party negotiations, that it should receive a high priority in all-party negotiations, that it should suggest neither victory nor defeat, that the decommissioning process should take place to the satisfaction of an independent commission, that it should result in the complete destruction of armaments in a manner that contributes to public safety, that it should be fully verifiable, that it should not expose individuals to prosecution, that it should be mutual and that there should be the early termination of paramilitary activities, including surveillance and targeting.  If that happened it would demonstrate a commitment to peaceful methods, build trust among other parties and alleviate the fears of the general population.</P>
      <P>Those specific recommendations of the Mitchell body, not just principles but specific and detailed recommendations about how we could go about decommissioning, provide a very valuable agenda.  I would like to see the representatives of those who fear that arms might be used against them, namely, the Unionist community, sitting down with Sinn Féin and going through each one of the six principles and then going through each of the seven or eight further recommendations of the body and asking Sinn Féin hard questions. That can only be done if Unionists are willing to sit in the same room with Sinn Féin.  Unionists cannot put those questions to Sinn Féin over the airwaves or through a megaphone.  They can only put them if they are willing to sit in the same room with Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After 16 or 17 months of peace, the time has come for Unionists to be willing to sit and ask those hard questions and be as tough as they like in asking them, but to ask those hard questions of Sinn Féin in the same room.  Equally, the SDLP and Sinn Féin should be given the opportunity which they, in fairness to them, are willing to take to put those same questions in turn to the <Col N="1870" /> two political parties representing the Loyalist paramilitaries.  It is only by going through the Mitchell report paragraph by paragraph and putting the questions one by one to the parties associated with paramilitary organisations that we will get the answers which will provide trust.  Staying apart is not the way forward.  Getting together, asking the hard questions, having arguments and getting answers is the way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The Telecom Éireann alliance is one of the most complex transactions ever undertaken in the State sector.  It will involve the consideration of a complex series of interrelated issues, not just the sale of a minority stake in the company but also the future regulation of the telecommunications sector, the future development of the sector and the financial and operational strengthening of Telecom Éireann in preparation for competitive markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alliance fundamentally is not driven by financial considerations.  The process is concerned with finding a partner prepared to make a long-term commitment to the transformation of the <Col N="1871" /> company to prepare it to compete successfully in the competitive market just around the corner.  To ensure a successful conclusion to the alliance process, it is essential that the shareholder and, ultimately, the taxpayer, gets top quality advice on all the issues involved as a basis for negotiating and concluding the best deal possible.</P>
    <P>During the summer of last year, a tender for competition was held under EC procurement procedures and as a result an international consortium of consultants was chosen and the fee terms were agreed and fixed at that time.</P>
    <P>The consortium is led by investment bankers Morgan Stanley.  It also includes legal advisers Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom and telecommunications strategic advisers Arthur D. Little.  This consortium provides excellent coverage for all the strategic, financial and legal issues likely to arise in the course of the alliance process.</P>
    <P>The strength of the experience of the consortium is emphasised by the fact that Morgan Stanley took the lead advisory role in the recent successfully concluded alliance process in Belgium. Arthur D. Little was also involved in that process.  The legal element of the consortium has arguably one of the finest track records in similar transactions in global terms.  It should be noted that the Belgian process was the first time that an equity based strategic alliance had been put in place for an EU public telephone operator.</P>
    <P>The fee agreed with the advisers at the time of appointment represents the best value available as a result of the tender competition in an increasingly competitive market.  I am satisfied that, given the range of expertise offered, the major issues to be considered and the benefits likely to accrue both to the shareholder and the economy as a whole, the fee represents excellent value for money.</P>
    <P>While the consultancy fee looks high, it is anticipated that it will represent less than 1 per cent of the proceeds likely to <Col N="1872" /> arise from this transaction.  This is significantly lower than the charge likely to arise from a more straightforward flotation or placement.  In addition the alliance process involves considerably more work than either of these transactions. Very importantly, the consultants are also assisting the company, thereby avoiding the very significant expenses involved in the retention of separate advisers by the shareholder and the company.  Put simply, we are getting more for less &mdash; a fact which is obvious to any informed commentator on the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister genuinely think he should not have demanded a lower figure than £3.7 million? On reflection does he think this is an extravagant fee for selecting one company from among five bidders, which is quite simple work?  The number of bidders may even be reduced to two or three before the process finishes. I would not have agreed to pay a fee of £3.7 million for this type of work.  Does the Minister think this is good value for money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>We went through the proper procedures and made a decision after the competitive process had been observed.  I am reliably informed that the fee involved in this process is less than 1 per cent of the likely proceeds of the transaction, which is lower than the norm for transactions of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister.  He knows my view that we have not fully discussed the strategic alliance process.  It now seems to be running into trouble.  There were originally seven or eight bidders but their number seems to have been halved.  The number of bidders is likely to decrease and I <Col N="1873" /> predict that more will pull out and there may only be one bidder in the end. Nobody will pay £500 million or £600 million to be locked into a State company. They will want control of the company before they pay this amount.  No persons in their right senses would take the kind of deal on offer.</P>
      <P>The Estimates do not provide for a penny being received on this deal during 1996; this will not happen until 1997.  I do not expect the Minister to agree with me at this stage, that this process is unravelling quickly and will not work. Will the Minister consider giving Irish pension funds, which consist of workers' money, the opportunity to buy some or all of the 35 per cent of the shares?  Will he consider putting these shares on the Irish Stock Exchange so that pension funds can be invested in this fine company, rather than this money going overseas as it is at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>This process is on target and will deliver the required results.  I took over this process more than a year ago.  It was obvious at that stage that the company was not in a position to undertake this process without the necessary accompanying corporate policy and regulatory changes being put in place. The previous Government, of which the Deputy's party was part, sat on this process, opted for the maximum derogation from competition and ignored the issue, hoping it would go away.  Nothing was done to bring about the policy changes necessary for the alliance.  There was no negotiating mandate in place when I came into office.  There were no Government advisers and no step had been taken to appoint an independent regulator.  Action had not been taken on preparing the necessary legislation to allow an alliance to proceed and there had not been decisions on tariff regimes, on interconnect, on universal service obligations or quality of service issues.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that nobody in this House is questioning anybody's integrity and the Minister should not have included that word in his reply.  Is the Minister aware of the views of the unsuccessful tenderers, and has he found any mechanism for dealing with those views?  In awarding the contract, the Minister knows I am one of the few people in this House who supported him in accepting a lower rather than an inflated price for this tender. I did that because I believed the competition would be based on the price charged to the consumer &mdash; the cost of the telephone call.  Did the competition take place on that basis?  Does the Minister have assurances that there will be genuine competition in regard to the cost of calls between the new entrant and the existing player in the field?  Can we expect real competition because of the conditions the Minister laid down in determining that this contest should take place?  In other words, was there a real contest on charges or are we likely to have no competition on charges?</P>

      <P>The objective of the exercise in licensing a second mobile telephone operator was to introduce competition to this sector.  By placing a cap on the entry fee we ensured the emphasis was on the business plan.  The great interest in the contest resulted in competition in the key areas of that plan and I was anxious to ensure that the price of telephone hardware and tariff charges would be reduced.  I am satisfied that there will be a large reduction in tariff charges in the very near future.</P>

      <QRef>[2183/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost and competitiveness review in the ESB is now <Col N="1878" /> almost complete.  The average cost per redundancy under the CCR will be approximately £100,000.  This is made up of lump sums of about £20,000 and reducing ongoing payments, with contributions to the ESB superannuation fund making up the balance.</P>
      <P>The CCR is undoubtedly a costly deal.  However, the issues involved are complex.  For the past 70 years the ESB had a monopoly in the generation, transmission and supply of electricity in this country.  It has a highly skilled and well paid workforce.  Its cost base, as shown by independent consultants, McKinsey's, is seriously out of line with best practice elsewhere.  Against that background, the job of tackling the excess costs was never going to be easy. Successive Governments have ruled out the option of compulsory redundancy. Therefore, to achieve a reduction in numbers of 2,000, intensive negotiations were required and attractive terms have had to be offered both to those electing to leave on a voluntary basis, and to encourage those remaining to accept modern, more flexible and more productive work practices.  There was no practical alternative to this tripartite process and the outcome was the best that could be achieved in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>In overall cash terms, the bulk of the CCR costs will be incurred in the first few years with the ongoing costs reducing to a more modest level thereafter. Over a four year period, the total cost of the rationalisation package is estimated to be in the order of £270 million and this cost is likely to be provided for in the 1995 accounts.  Gross savings over the same period are expected to amount to some £260 million, thus giving a payback on the investment of about four and a half years.  The annual net savings are expected to be approximately £60 million by year four and will rise gradually thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB application for a price increase was rigorously examined in my Department and a subsequent proposal was put to Government seeking approval for an overall average price <Col N="1879" /> increase for the ESB of 2 per cent in 1996, 1.5 per cent in 1997 and 3 per cent in 1998.  Government approval of these increases was announced on 19 January 1996.</P>
    <P>The 1996 price increases will be effective from the April-May billing period at the earliest.  Detailed tariff changes will be published by the ESB in advance of the increases coming into effect and the precise impact on the various categories of consumers will then be clear. With regard to the industrial sector, the average increase this year will be 2 per cent.  However, small and medium sized enterprises will be subject to an average increase of only 0.7 per cent.  The bulk of small firms will not incur any increase and many will see reductions.</P>
    <P>The agreement to these price increases is conditional on the acceptance of the CCR by the unions and the ESB, and for 1997 and 1998 on its satisfactory implementation.</P>
    <P>I wish to state categorically that consumers are not being asked to fund the incentive package being given to ESB workers under the CCR.  The ESB has agreed with my Department that the CCR should pay for itself over a period of four and a half years.  Its application for a price increase has been examined in my Department on its own merits.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the price adjustments are fair and balanced.  They are needed to finance the very significant capital investment programme planned by the ESB over the next four years.</P>
    <P>I should point out that electricity prices in Ireland compare favourably with charges in European Union countries. Domestic electricity prices are currently 24 per cent below the European average and Ireland has lower prices than ten of the EU member states including the UK, for this sector.  Prices for householders in Northern Ireland were 25 per cent higher than in the Republic last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that most people in this country will be scandalised to hear of the Government's <Col N="1880" /> agreement to the payment of redundancy sums which average out at approximately £100,000 per individual and which means that some people will receive redundancy payments greatly in excess of that figure?  Surely the Minister agrees that the Government is setting a dangerous precedent for redundancy settlements in the public sector which are, in this case, grossly in excess of settlements in the private industrial sector.  I have not fully recovered from the shock of what the Minister has just informed the House, but did he not say at the outset that, following the report of two consultants that there was a need for 3,000 redundancies in the ESB, he was seeking reductions of £100 million per year in cost efficiencies?  Is he saying that because he has not achieved his proposed number of redundancies and annual savings the ESB will continue to be an inefficient company and this will interfere with its ability to compete with the private sector when there is open competition in the generation of electricity? What is the Government's policy on future public sector redundancies, now that the ESB is setting the norm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The McKinsey report, commissioned by the management and unions in the ESB, was sponsored by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  Obviously, the McKinsey report was not precise on the numbers who should be disemployed or the annual savings required but gave indicative figures.  Arising from the McKinsey report the CCR process was put in place and the negotiations were conducted for a prolonged period.  Very complex and sensitive issues were addressed at that forum and the outcome was that the CCR, which is being finalised, will be put to a ballot of the members of the unions in February and March.  We have a conclusion to the process which indicates that there is a need to disemploy approximately 2,000 workers and that savings of £60 million per annum will accrue from that rationalisation programme.  That will give the <Col N="1881" /> ESB a cost base that is in line with its European counterparts and as a result of its price structure, the company will be in a position to be competitive.</P>
      <P>The CCR embodies the type of response which was identified in the Culliton and Moriarty reports and which focuses on the importance of minimising costs in the economy in order to support industrial growth and job creation.  Cost savings in energy utilities such as the ESB should generate increased employment in other sectors and firms in the trading sector will take advantage of improved competitiveness to increase output and employment consequent on the growth in GNP which will generally benefit consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not reply to my point, that he stated publicly he was seeking 3,000 redundancies and annual savings of £100 million.  He has not achieved that level of savings or number of redundancies in the operation of the ESB as we know it.  That point was ignored by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In view of the annual ongoing savings of £60 million a year, surely the Minister will agree that justification for an electricity price increase is questionable when the annual cost of running the ESB will be reduced?  The savings would have been much greater if the Minister had achieved his target saving of £100 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the CCR will be met from within the ESB.  The price increase which is fair, reasonable and balanced is necessary because the ESB has a major capital investment programme which must be funded.  For example it is absolutely essential to improve the quality and reliability of the electricity supply in rural areas and we have to meet increased demand for electricity, which since the last price increase ten years ago has grown by approximately 50 per cent.  We need to provide generation capacity to meet increased growth and the ESB needs <Col N="1882" /> substantial funds to refurbish and modernise existing generation plants, especially in the midlands.</P>

      <P>The report of the national minerals policy review group, which was published in May 1995, was the first indepth review of minerals policy since the 1981 NESC report.  The review group made 52 recommendations for action, by Government and the minerals industry, in relation to a wide range of matters and with considerable variations in costs and timescales for their implementation.</P>
      <P>The most important of the review group's recommendations seek major changes in fiscal, land use and industrial policies as well as new primary legislation and new administrative arrangements at Government level for dealing with minerals matters.  Those recommendations must, therefore, be carefully considered by me and my Government colleagues in a strategic way.  That is being done and decisions will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of the review group's report is a strong endorsement of the <Col N="1883" /> responsible development of the minerals resources of the country.  That is fully in accord with my own very active and sustained support for more focused and intensive minerals exploration throughout the country.  I am anxious to encourage the development of further commercially viable deposits in such a way as to maximise the return to the Exchequer and to the economy generally while protecting the environment and allowing a fair return to investors. I am committed to keeping policy and procedures under review to ensure that they meet our needs.</P>
    <P>I have already taken a number of initiatives which are proving very successful. I mention in particular the 1995 guidelines I issued to facilitate aerial geophysical surveying for minerals.  This has resulted in the first such surveys after more than 12 years and more frequent prospecting licence competitions so as to allow quicker access to areas becoming available for prospecting.  My proactive approach is clearly yielding significant results, judging by the additional millions of pounds now going into minerals exploration in Ireland and the fact that further major international minerals firms are indicating their intention to engage in minerals exploration in Ireland.  I am committed to having a far greater level of minerals exploration in the country and I am pleased to record the very good progress to date.</P>

This applies to the detailed assessment of two mining projects at Lisheen and Kilbreckan, currently requiring permits and, of course, the 1996 budget provision of a tax allowance for mine rehabilitation expenditure and a reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 30 per cent for the first £50,000 of profits both of which will be included in the 1996 Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The 52 recommendations, which the review group did not rank in order of priority, cover a wide range of matters and there are considerable variations in costs and time-scales for their implementation. Priorities must be established for examining the recommendations, as has been done, while ensuring that as much as possible responsible minerals exploration and development can proceed without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I made the point that the net effect of the budgetary measures will be to extract £730 million from the taxpayer in 1996 over and above what was extracted in 1995.  The budget was presented as a tax give-away but if that is a give-away I would like to know the Government's definition of a tax increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the taxation yield for 1996 over 1995 represents an 8.2 per <Col N="1962" /> cent increase in the total volume of taxation and is on top of a 7.5 per cent increase in 1995, in other words, in two years of high economic growth, this year and next year, the tax take will have increased by 16 per cent.  That money has been and is being frittered away in public expenditure and is the reason record rates of economic growth do not translate into meaningful employment.</P>
    <P>The only effect of the budgetary taxation and the so called PRSI concessions was to slow the rate of increase in taxation yield.  The reality is the average taxpayer will pay substantially more in taxation this year than he or she did last year.  The figure is £730 million in a full year, in other words, £2 million per day or £14 per week for each of the one million taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In his speech this morning Deputy Shatter sought to take a warm bath in his own prejudices and rewrite the history of the revolving door.  I wish to disabuse him of the notion that the revolving door syndrome became evident as a problem in 1987.  It was evident in the 90s when the number of custodial sentences was such that we did not have sufficient prison places to accommodate offenders.  The inevitable result was that offenders served a shorter proportion of their sentence.  Those who were violent and dangerous often had to be released into the community in order to make places available.  In 1993 the then Government decided to include a provision in the 1994 Estimates for £25 million to create 210 extra prison spaces.  On coming to office the first act of the rainbow warriors was to cancel this provision.  The Government that has added £1 billion to the national debt has failed, after 14 months in office, to find £25 million to honour the commitment given to the electorate by the outgoing Government.  The revolving door phenomenon became evident as a problem in the early 90s and immediate action was taken to deal with it.  The incoming Government cancelled the provision and 14 months later it grudingly admits the need for extra prison places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> The Taoiseach sought to put the idea across that because it delayed for 14 months the prison spaces will be available earlier.  Such nonsense flies in the face of common sense.  This must be the only time in recorded history when a decision to postpone action for 14 months will result in the action being taken earlier than would otherwise have been the case.  Regardless of whatever spin the media machine in the Government press office wish to put on it that is the reality.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach accused Fianna Fáil of delaying the bail issue by referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission.  If he believes the commission does not have any validity or that there is no need for it he should say so clearly.  As far as I recall a Fine Gaelled Government established the Law Reform Commission.  It has been the practice for successive Governments of whatever hue to refer intractable legal problems to the commission.  It is ironic that the Taoiseach makes such an excuse when he and the Minister for Justice justified delays in deciding on the issue of bail by saying the matter was with the Law Reform Commission. If the Taoiseach does not believe it is of use in this area or believes that the previous Government delayed matters by referring them to the Law Reform Commission why did he not take action on coming to office?</P>
    <P>The Government's package on crime is belated, grudging, meagre and minimalist. It is badly thought out and funks the major issues such as bail, the right to silence, the move to an inquisitorial system of trying criminal cases and the introduction of different policing method used in the US for the last quarter of a century.  As it is largely an instant knee-jerk reaction to get the public off the Government's back it will prove to be ineffective.  Deputy Owen's term as Minister for Justice has been, is and will continue to be a smash flop. She will go down the annals of Irish history as the Minister with the &ldquo;unMidas touch&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> The Government announced a number of indirect tax changes that will push up the inflation rate, for example, excise duties on petrol and tobacco will be raised and stamp duty on ATM cards will be increased.  While the reduction in employers' PRSI should boost profit margins in some sectors and act as a buffer against inflationary pressures, the recent announcement of an 8 per cent rise in ESB charges over the next three years could have a knock-on effect on inflation.  That price increase will occur despite the Government's plans for the ESB which will enable it save £60 million per year.</P>
    <P>The decision to raise excise duty on petrol will extract an extra £20 million and recreates the differential in price between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The price of petrol in Northern Ireland has been affected by a price war in the United Kingdom where hyper-markets are involved in selling petrol. That has spilled over to Northern Ireland, specifically Belfast.  I am informed by the experts that it will create a marginal difference between petrol prices here and Northern Ireland, but that will be directly affected by the budget.  I do not understand how this measure falls into the Government's grand strategy for managing the economy. It is simply a device to fill a gap and justify the increase in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The corporation tax reduction from 38 to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of a company's income is welcome, but it is a scatterbrain approach.  It is very poorly thought out and represents a gross waste of taxpayers' money.  The maximum tax saving from this measure will be £4,000.  Part of the effect of the measure will be that companies such as those I picked from the Stock Market report in alphabetical order, AIB, Avonmore, Abbey, Adare, Anglo-Irish, Bank of Ireland, Cement Roadstone, Elan Corporation and Fyffes, will benefit. Is the Minister for Finance aware that the directors of some of those companies are paid that amount every week?  What will be the net effect of this <Col N="1965" /> measure?  How will this expenditure of taxpayers' money help Irish business and industry?</P>
    <P>This measure will cost the taxpayer £23 million, not an inconsiderable sum of money.  Instead of giving £4,000 to all and sundry, including those who least need it, the measure should have been focused on the small business sector so that the amount of tax foregone would be greater and of most use in terms of maintaining and creating employment.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; financial journalists and economists have made this case very well &mdash; that the overall rate of corporation tax must be steadily reduced.  The net result of the budgetary measures is that our corporation tax rate is still significantly higher than that of the main overseas territories in which Ireland invests, and that creates a major disincentive. Further evidence that this is a once-off, &ldquo;top-of-the-head&rdquo; measure and that it has been very poorly thought out is that it is limited in ways which conflict with the reduction from 38 to 30 per cent.  For example, the 40 per cent rate of capital gains tax remains in place as does the 20 per cent surcharge on undistributed investment or rental income of companies.  That conflicts directly with the change in the rate from 38 to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of income.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of employers' PRSI is being reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.  That is, however, largely clawed back by increasing the ceiling on employers' PRSI from £25,800 to £26,800.  The Government is giving money away with one hand and taking it back with the other.  The reduction in the lower rate of employers' PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent will yield a net benefit of, for example, only about £2,500 to a clothing manufacturer employing 50 people.  It will be worth about £4,500 to a company employing 100 workers.  It is no exaggeration to say that corporate cash flow will not be significantly affected.</P>
    <P>Worse still &mdash; this measure has also been badly thought out &mdash; the impact is uneven depending on the income of the <Col N="1966" /> employee.  For example, an employer will save £50 per year in PRSI on a gross wage of £10,000 and £30 per year on a gross wage of £15,000, but on a gross wage of £30,000 per year PRSI will cost the employer an additional £68.  In addition, there are no transitional arrangements or marginal relief.  This leads to the anomaly that even if a £1 pay rise is given to an employee earning £13,000 it will cost the employer £456. The net effect of the changes announced by the Minister on employers' PRSI is that higher earning employees will pay more PRSI and taxation because the PRSI allowance is being abolished &mdash; the cost to a person on the 48 per cent rate will be £67 per year.</P>
    <P>The second fraud perpetrated by the Government is the implication that the budget is designed to have a significant effect on long-term unemployment.  The main weapon in the Government's arsenal to deal with long-term unemployment is the infamous £80 per week subsidy designed to take 5,000 people out of the ranks of the long-term unemployed. A sum of £80 per week amounts to £4,000 per annum, yet the Government has provided £1 million to operate this subsidy, which will take 250 people out of the ranks of the long-term unemployed. If all 5,000 people whom the Government hope will be enabled to return to the labour force again apply together, the money would run out in less than a fortnight.  It would cost the Exchequer £20 million to take 5,000 people out of the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  Yet there is provision of only £1 million for this subsidy.</P>
    <P>This is further financial conjuring to give the illusion that the Government is keeping within a pre-arranged spending target.  If the Government is serious about this measure &mdash; I assume it is because it is the main measure to reduce long-term unemployment &mdash; it will have to add a further £19 million to current public expenditure, on top of the 6.2 per cent by which it grudgingly admits it is increasing it.  It has been shown that subsidies are an abject failure.  This proposal, rather than achieving an overall <Col N="1967" /> increase in the level of demand for workers, will probably result in a relative reduction in the cost of hiring one type of potential employee.  In that case, much of the effect of the subsidy will be to increase job offers to long-term unemployed at the expense of offers to new entrants to the labour market and the short-term unemployed.  That will merely shift the burden of unemployment; it will not reduce its incidence.</P>
    <P>A further 1,000 people are to be recruited to the new pilot community employment scheme proposed by the task force on long-term unemployment. That scheme will be evaluated at the end of the three years to see if the 1,000 jobs are sustainable and if the scheme should be extended.  By definition it will not be possible to establish the viability of those jobs in the short-term.  Another 1,000 jobs are to go to people entering the VTOS scheme run by the Department of Education.  That scheme provides second chance education, not jobs. Because it simply replaces the 1,000 places by which the VTOS scheme was reduced last year, it could be argued that it does not constitute an increase.</P>
    <P>According to the labour force survey, if unemployment were to be eliminated by the year 2000 we would need a net gain of 412,000 jobs, in the region of 100,000 jobs per annum.  The Minister for Finance predicted that jobs will increase by 31,000 in 1996, but that modest target will depend on continued growth in the economy.  Even if it is reached, as the Minister admitted, unemployment will fall by only 9,000.  It is, therefore, fair to conclude that the vast majority of long-term unemployed people will still be unemployed when next year's budget is presented.  Nobody was surprised that the immediate reaction to the budget of the national organisation representing the unemployed, reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Wednesday, 24 January 1996, was that, with economic growth surpassing that of all our EU counterparts, it is an utter shame that the Government did not make a genuine effort to tackle the <Col N="1968" /> problem of the long-term unemployed. That is a damning indictment.</P>
    <P>Another fraud was perpetrated by the Minister who sought to create the illusion that the Government was reducing public expenditure.  The process of reducing public expenditure was begun by the previous Government.  For the first time in more than a quarter of a century the then Minister for Finance, if he had continued in office, would have started with a current budget surplus in 1994, but that was immediately turned into a deficit by his successor.  After the mammoth task of eventually making ends meet the rainbow Coalition changed the ends.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy appears to be to add a stimulus to the economy at a time when it is growing at a higher rate than at any time in our history.  The Minister has provided for the Government to borrow £730 million this year. Current expenditure will increase by 6.2 per cent &mdash; a figure far removed from the 2 per cent target set by the Minister when the Government was formed.  The general Government deficit which has fluctuated between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent since 1990 is now at its highest level ever, 2.6 per cent.  The 6.2 per cent increase in current public expenditure this year comes on top of a net increase in the order of 10 per cent last year. That does not take account of the creative accounting by which £60 million was slotted into last year's accounts to allow a tribunal to allocate payments to those affected by hepatitis C.  If that £60 million is counted, the real net growth in public spending this year is likely to be in the region of 7 per cent. The increase in the deficit is 2.6 per cent of GDP compared to a little more than 2 per cent in 1995.</P>
    <P>Another indication of the deterioration in the underlying public finances is the fall in the primary surplus, the surplus of Government revenues over spending before interest payments on the national debt are taken into account, from 4.2 per cent of GDP in 1993 to 2.6 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and his <Col N="1969" /> Government colleagues insist on continuing to make a virtue of the fact that they are keeping, if only barely, within the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.  That demonstration of financial virility is no more than a delusion.  As my colleague Deputy McCreevy said on budget day, even if we qualify technically to become part of a single currency, we will be dangerously near the margins and there will be no room for slippage.  If we were to qualify, that would only be the beginning. What is at issue is not only a matter of qualifying to participate in a single currency but being able to live with the economic consequences that would require us to take the opportunity to achieve unprecedented rates of economic growth and secure unprecedented financial assistance from Europe to reduce taxation and create real jobs to strengthen the economic base of this country.  That can only be done by reducing public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The left's participation, indeed at present it appears dominance, in Government will ensure that Ireland will continue to live far beyond its means.  The left generally is irrevocably wedded to fiscal incontinence.  It has no choice; it must adhere to its mandate.  It is its <i>raison d'être.</i> In practice that means that while the Government remains in office the Irish people will continue to have inflicted on them a policy of unsustainable public spending leading inevitably to high tax and high unemployment.</P>
    <P>Economic policy is being dictated by a party which got less than 3 per cent of the vote in the last general election and, I suspect, would get considerably less if one were held now.  Presumably the 97 per cent of the electorate who did not vote for Democratic Left do not support its economic policies, but those are the policies being implemented.  That is an abuse of democracy.  If those policies were put before the people in a referendum they would be overwhelmingly rejected.</P>
    <P>I have said very little about Fine Gael.  The reality is that the left is in charge.  It will continue to spend with all <Col N="1970" /> the gay abandon of the French aristocracy before the revolution.  Fine Gael has been neutered.  Members should not take my word on that.  One of its prominent members, with whom many party colleagues agree, stated that Fine Gael has been castrated.  Those who represent 3 per cent of the electorate are in charge.  To use Marxist jargon, they have seized the commanding heights of the economy.  Never since the Bolsheviks seized control of the Soviet economy in the aftermath of the 1971 revolution has so much been inflicted on so many by so few.</P>
    <P>The budget is lack-lustre, it is directionless and downright fraudulent.  The late George Orwell said that political language was designed to make lies sound truthful, murder respectable and give the appearance of solidity to wind. As a result of the difference between the rhetoric the Government used when in Opposition and its performance in Government, nobody takes politicians seriously today.  All the Government has achieved in the 14 months since it came to power is the institutionalisation of cynicism about the Irish political system and process.</P>

      <P>As a Democratic Left Minister of State, I warmly welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget debate.  The debate shows the difference between parties opposite and those on this side of the House.  On this side we share a common view of society where every individual matters, people are equal, have equal rights and responsibilities and should have an equal chance to contribute to society and the community to which they belong.  The other <Col N="1971" /> approach most clearly articulated by the Progressive Democrats is based on an outworn and discredited world view that the rich must be rewarded while social supports for the poor collapse.  The Fianna Fáil view is very confused and I will deal with that later.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea referred to our support.  I wish to refer to the budget report of Davy Stockbrokers, a group not renowned as Democratic Left supporters. They made an important point which will not be lost on the electorate when they come to consider the alternative to the present Government, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats alliance.  Davy's analysis of the budget states that the tax packages announced in the budgets of 1990-92 positively discriminated in favour of higher earners. The higher one's gross income the bigger by a wide margin the benefits one derived from income tax changes implemented over that period.  That is an indication of where the alliance developing on the other side would lead us.  The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also deal with that document.  Davy's go on to commend the current budget which allows for a pattern of discrimination in favour of the low paid which has become more pronounced.  They, and I, acknowledge that there was a change in the last Government's approach which began the process of arriving at a fairer system. That pattern has become more pronounced as a result of this budget and is to be commended from a labour market point of view.  Fianna Fáil should note the contents of that report.  That party has not made a clear statement as to where it stands, but it is worth pointing out that the budget is not a victory for Democratic Left, the Labour Party or Fine Gael.  It is a victory for the dispossessed in our society, the long-term <Col N="1972" /> unemployed, carers, low income families and those who have been struggling for years to come out of the poverty trap.  They are the real winners and it is a pity there has been such an incoherent response from Fianna Fáil.  I have listened for quite some time now to speeches here and on television.  I suppose it would be fair to distil the two basic tenets of the Fianna Fáil position on this budget, the first that the Government is not controlling spending and, the other, that the Government is not spending enough.  At present logic is not one of Fianna Fáil's strongest points because we all know the Government is maintaining a tight control on public spending and borrowing and complying fully with the Maastricht criteria.  Rather than tinkering round the edges and applying a bit of sticking plaster here and there, this Government has provided for work, workers and families.  I make no apologies for that.  For too long social solidarity has taken a back seat to the politics of selfishness.</P>
      <P>It would be fair to say that Deputy Michael McDowell is of the Tory-twit school of economics.  He would have us believe that high and middle earners are a neglected minority.  No doubt if his party is returned to power, courtesy of Fianna Fáil, he will put that attitude into practice.  He would have us subscribe to the notion that tax and spending cuts equal jobs, a crude simple equation, not even new, but tried in Thatcher's Britain and Reagan's America with the consequences of which they still live, paying the price in terms of poverty, social exclusion, crime and run-down public services.  I am sure Deputy Michael McDowell is not unfamiliar with research findings in the United Kingdom, showing that poverty levels spiralled since the Tories came into power and were able to implement these neo-liberal policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For decades, social and economic policy has failed to address the needs of two groups in society, those without work and those in low paid jobs.  For example, to date, a person coming off the live register to work lost a variety of <Col N="1973" /> benefits.  If they entered low-paid work, which was the norm, they could find themselves significantly financially worse off.  This has been recognised as a problem over many years but this is the first Administration to address the issue in a practical, meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats advocate tax reductions; it is still not clear what Fianna Fáil advocates.  We in Democratic Left advocate tax reform.  We see no reason to reduce the tax burden on the well off in society who can well afford to pay their way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Compared with other OECD member states, the better off in our society carry a relatively light burden. We are working to reduce the burden on low paid PAYE workers who have been carrying the financial can over too many years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance said of this budget, it is a step along that way, it is not the end of the story; it is not a spectacular budget nor does it aim to be. We have had sufficient spectacles from past Governments.  What people now want is security, equality and opportunity, the hallmarks of a good Government. That is what this budget represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere is this commonsense approach being realised more effectively than in the housing sector.  Provisional housing completion figures recently made available to me show that some 30,500 new houses were built in 1995, the highest on record and not far short double the number of new houses built in 1988.  A particularly important aspect of last year's record housing completions is the fact that all elements which go to make up the total &mdash; private, local authority and voluntary housing &mdash; performed extremely well.  A record level of housing completions does not happen by accident.  Prudent management of the economy and public sector finances by the Government contributed to low, stable interest rates <Col N="1974" /> which gave people confidence to undertake a long-term borrowing.  Interest rates are at their lowest level for more than 30 years and have given a major boost to the private housing sector.  In addition, the Government directly finances the local authority and voluntary housing sector programmes, having significantly expanded both over recent years.</P>
    <P>All these factors have been brought together in recent years and, under the provisions of the budget, will continue in 1996.  It does not necessarily mean that the record level of new house completions will again be broken in 1996 but it means that new house completions should remain around their current record.</P>
    <P>One of the key conclusions of the recently published ESRI study is that, for demographic and other reasons, demand for social housing is likely to remain at a high level.  Therefore, it is essential that we maintain our support for the national housing programme, in particular to support a significant, sustainable local authority and voluntary housing programme.  I am glad that the high priority given in the programme, A Government of Renewal, to social housing has been again reflected in the 1996 housing capital provision which amounts to almost £360 million, an increase of 11 per cent on the 1995 outturn figures.</P>
    <P>We have now built the local authority housing programme back up to a sustainable, appropriate level from its very low levels of the early 1990s.  Therefore, it is not necessary to repeat in 1996 the massive increase in the Estimates provision for local authority housing. However, the overall provision for the programme is being increased in 1996, by 2 per cent, to £158.58 million which will sustain it and even allow for a small increase to 3,950 in the number of new starts.</P>
    <P>As recently as 1992 total capital expenditure on the programme amounted to £42 million only.  At a time when the rich disproportionately benefited from the budget provisions, social <Col N="1975" /> housing was at an all time low.  There has been an increase from those days &mdash; when provision was made for 1,300 starts &mdash; as the present programme allows for 3,950 new houses this year. There used be an adage that Fianna Fáil was good for the building industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point in relation to an initiative I launched just before Christmas &mdash; of targeting the homeless within the Eastern Health Board area, in particular &mdash; where tremendous work is being done by the voluntary sector.  My initiative very much supports that work and these new arrangements are designed to represent an effective, co-ordinated approach to the provision of accommodation and related resettlement services for homeless people in that area with the full involvement of the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stressed that these new arrangements are intended to work with and encourage the voluntary sector because, in one response to the budget, there was a misunderstanding in relation to this initiative.  It will be an essential feature of these new arrangements that services already being provided by a voluntary body will be supported and improved.  There is no question of the statutory agencies displacing any effort or service at present being provided by the voluntary sector. I have always acknowledged the crucial work and service of the voluntary sector in the interests of the homeless and am delighted to again avail of that opportunity today.  We should not forget that <Col N="1976" /> homelessness is and often can be the result of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The social solidarity underpinning this budget provides not just for individuals but for society as a whole.  The negative effects of pure market forces are to atomise, criminalise and marginalise. Deputy Michael McDowell and Fianna Fáil may not either accept or understand this but I welcome the fact that the people have shown greater maturity, understanding and generousity than they have.</P>
    <P>The general acceptance of the underlying philosophy of this budget is a positive sign for the future.  We live in a changing world where problems exist that have no easy solutions.  The recent horrific crimes are a grim reminder of the fact that social cohesion and the strength of community life are important bulwarks against crime and depravation.  This budget is playing a vital part in building on those strengths and I warmly support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to sound public finances in general and the Maastricht criteria in particular has added greatly to the confidence in the management of the economy. Good housekeeping by this Government has brought about this position.  This, along with our excellent inflation performance as well as favourable international developments, has contributed to historically low interest rates that in turn have encouraged more investment here.  It also has helped to sustain continued growth in domestic demand which has encouraged business to expand employment considerably. <Col N="1977" /> The tax initiatives in the past two budgets have improved both incentives for employers to offer jobs and for employees to accept those jobs.  <i>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> which has delivered wage moderation, has been central to international competitiveness in recent years and the low inflation which has transferred wage increases and tax reductions into real income growth for all workers.</P>
      <P>While this budget will ensure that the climate for expansion in employment remains favourable, additional actions are required to ensure that the price and quality of service provided by the State sector and its costs structures compare with the best international standards. The policies and jobs now in place are at the heart of Ireland's current favourable performance.  In preparation for economic and monetary union, we need to ensure that our competitiveness is maintained and improved through continued wage moderation in the context of low inflation as well as through other actions.  They make all parts of the economy more efficient and the budgetary strategy continues to conform to the Maastricht criteria.  This in turn will promote an economy which will maximise growth and sustain employment and social progress.  From now on flexibility across the economy in both the private and public sectors will be even more critical than it has been up to now.  It is in the interests of all concerned, to ensure that competitiveness and profitability are maintained, to protect the maximum number of jobs and to ensure there is an increase in the number of jobs on offer.</P>
      <P>The year 1995 was fabulous for rapid growth in the economy, with GNP increasing by 7.25 per cent, the fastest rate of growth in the industrialised world.  This is a major tribute to a Government that has been in office only 12 months and has contributed so much to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in domestic demand was reflected in a large increase in total employment estimated at 45,000 extra <Col N="1978" /> jobs on average and a fall in unemployment, on our labour force survey, of 25,000.  Despite this strong output and employment growth, the rate of inflation remains comparatively low at 2.5 per cent for the year.  Exports of goods and services are estimated to have risen by 13.5 per cent in volume terms during the past year.  Merchandise exports increased by over 14 per cent and industrial exports increased while agricultural exports were also buoyant. Service exports increased by about 7 per cent, helped by a good tourism performance. All those achievements bear the hallmarks of good housekeeping by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The economic prospects are that 1996 is likely to be another good year for the economy.  With a consolidation of progress made over the last two years, output is likely to grow by 5.75 per cent with a further increase of over 30,000 in the numbers at work.  This means that over the three-year period 1994-96, inclusive, the economy will have grown by more than one-fifth with an extra 11,5000 people at work and over the same period the average inflation rate will be less than 2.5 per cent.  The current account on the balance of payments will have remained in substantial surplus and Government borrowings will be kept within moderate limits.</P>
    <P>This Government has taken the right steps to curb the crime epidemic.  It is clearly evident from the statement issued last evening by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, to provide 278 prison places over the next 18 months that that is a step in the right direction to curb the crime epidemic which this country has experienced over the past decade or more.</P>
    <P>The changing face of Irish life brought into stark focus by the recent tragic deaths and vicious attacks requires measures such as these as well as a wider response from the community and all agencies of the State.  I congratulate the Minister on her wisdom in making those extra places available in Castlerea, Portlaoise, Curragh Detention Centre, St. Patrick's Institution, <Col N="1979" /> Limerick and Mountjoy.  This move is a firm commitment by the Government to stamp out crime throughout the country. That, coupled with the Minister's announcement to step up the policing of all rural areas is a major breakthrough in this very important matter.</P>
    <P>As a society we need a reawakening of our tradition of caring for those around us, our neighbours who are alone, the infirm and the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice must be congratulated on her proposal to appoint four new Assistant Commissioners who will be in charge of four divisional areas. She also proposes to appoint an additional three Supreme Court judges, two High Court judges, seven Circuit Court judges and three District Court judges.  This is an outstanding achievement by a Minister who has been in office for such a short time.</P>

The problems relating to crime and drugs must be tackled immediately and every effort must be made to ensure that criminal activity is reduced to a very low level &mdash; it would be foolish of me to state that crime can be completely stamped out.  There has been crime since the beginning of time, since Cain killed his brother Abel, and it will probably be a problem until the end of time. However, it is important to ensure that it is not allowed to escalate.  We must do everything possible to reduce the number of incidents to the lowest level possible.</P>

      <P>In recent months Ministers repeatedly reminded us that while the economy was never in better shape we should not expect too much in terms of tax and other concessions. However, it was discovered at the last minute that there was a pile of surplus money in the kitty.  We were then treated to a daily display of the three-way tug of war between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left.  Most of the pulling was inevitably done by the so-called junior partners in this three-hand reel, who threatened dire consequences if they did not get what they were demanding.  The man with the biggest pull was the most junior partner who gave regular press releases to tell us what he demanded in the budget. However, he was not to be outdone by the Labour Party Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who was reported to have virtually placed his resignation on the table as part of his argument for extra funding.  In the middle of all this there was the unfortunate Taoiseach who, as Deputy O'Donoghue rightly said last night, was trying to stand on two left feet.  We all know that a man with two left feet is a very poor dancer whether it is in a three-hand reel or any other dance, except perhaps in a toeing the line dance.</P>

      <P>The Government is correct when it refers to the healthy state of the economy, but it failed to remind us that this was handed to it on a plate 12 months ago by my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who before he left office, had produced the first balanced budget for more than a quarter of a century.  This happy state of affairs <Col N="1983" /> came about as a result of Fianna Fáil returning to Government in 1987 when it immediately tackled the worst financial situation in the history of the State. From a position of almost certain national bankruptcy and a national debt which had more than doubled from £12 billion in 1982 to £24 billion in four years, thanks to the Fine Gael and Labour parties, Fianna Fáil turned the economy around to such an extent that we are now only one of two countries that would qualify for membership of a European monetary union if it was to be set up now.</P>
      <P>After the 1992 election, the Labour Party joined Fianna Fáil in Government. This was an excellent opportunity for it to serve a useful apprenticeship in Government.  Apprentices are never given the job of financial controller and this was the case in that Government. However, when Deputy Bruton suddenly found himself with a chance of becoming Taoiseach, he was so determined to avail of this once in a lifetime opportunity that he gladly handed over the control of virtually every high spending Department, including the most important, to his two left wing partners.  This was an unprecedented surrender by a majority partner in Government.</P>

      <P>The result is a budget far removed from what a sensible and prudent Minister for Finance <Col N="1984" /> would have devised.  We have already witnessed signs of revolt from Fine Gael backbenchers, which does not surprise anybody.</P>
      <P>The budget has produced some strange results.  First, the Minister made an announcement in his budget speech that elderly people living alone would receive an £800 tax allowance towards installing an alarm system in their homes.  This would, of course, be regarded as hilarious if it was not such a slap in the face to senior citizens whose income is so low that they are not in the tax net and, therefore, would not benefit from this so-called imaginative gesture.</P>
      <P>Any thoughts about the Minister's proposals being laughable vanished when we witnessed last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, which showed an old man bursting into tears as he described the torture he suffered at the hands of thugs who broke into his home.  When it was eventually realised by the Government that less than half of one per cent of the elderly qualify for the ill-judged allowance, the Minister's opponent, the Minister for Social Welfare, announced that he was setting up yet another task force to study how they could implement a proper scheme to protect elderly people.  On this occasion, I presume that candidates for inclusion in that task force will be required to apply to the head office of Democratic Left.</P>
      <P>Another laughable incident was the performance of the Minister for Finance in answering questions about the budget on RTE radio.  When he was asked about his PRSI allowance and about whether a person earning £89 a week would only pay PRSI on £9 and not on £80, he was reported as saying: &ldquo;yes, as far as I understand it&rdquo;.  Are we to take it that the Minister does not understand his own budget and that everybody, including the highest earners in the land, are exempt from paying PRSI on the first £80 of their earnings per week? Many people are confused by this, including the Minister, it seems, and we would like it to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sacrificial lamb in this budget is the middle income sector.  If any group <Col N="1985" /> had reservations about this budget, it is this one.  What was given to it in one hand was more than taken away with the other.  The Minister has removed mortgage interest relief, adding £200 to the annual cost of an average mortgage and has eroded an £80 VHI tax relief. When one considers the £100 increase levied by the VHI on its premiums, one will see that anything given to that sector was more than taken away by other measures.  When the imminent increase in ESB, CIE and petrol charges are taken into account, that group have again been the real losers and they must feel frustrated.</P>
    <P>If a person earns £12,050 per annum or £230 per week &mdash; this is a little below the national average wage &mdash; after the budget, the marginal tax rate of 55.75 per cent, allowing for income tax, PRSI and the various levies and if an employer is kind enough to offer a person an extra £100 per week, the employee will get £44 and it will cost the employer £112, out of which the Government gets £68.  This situation still pertains after two budgets from a Government that seeks to trumpet itself as offering tax reliefs.</P>

      <P>Lack of performance would be more appropriate in this instance.

They are especially disconcerted when they realise that an <Col N="1986" /> additional £160 million in tax is to be raised this year, the vast majority of which will come from them.</P>

      <P>We will not succeed <Col N="1987" /> in increasing job numbers through schemes, but through enterprise.  In this context, the reductions in PRSI are not significant.  For example, the standard rate of employers' PRSI is to be reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan rightly mentioned that exports have increased.  However, because of the strength of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling our exporters will be in major difficulty during the next 12 months.  When in Government my party introduced alleviation measures to assist indigenous companies seen to be in danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the case.  In reducing PRSI the Government could have been more selective.  Given that the reductions are negligible it would have been far better if it had targeted export companies, particularly to the UK market with the assistance of Forbairt, to protect and maintain employment.  If they lose market share, they will find themselves in serious difficulty before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>There are 40,000 participants in various schemes, the equivalent of full-time State jobs.  While these schemes provide a valuable outlet in that they boost participants' self-confidence, the emphasis should be placed on reducing employers' PRSI to create employment.</P>
      <P>The proposal to provide 5,000 places on the jobs placement scheme is a source of concern when taken with the decision to increase the employees' PRSI allowance to £80 per week.  Under the scheme, persons who are long-term unemployed will be allowed to retain secondary benefits such as their medical cards for three years.  This will place employees currently in low paid employment in an invidious position. The Government will find itself in difficulty if the scheme proves successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan welcomed the measures announced by the Minister for <Col N="1988" /> Justice to tackle crime, but no thanks are due to her.  Despite the efforts of the two left wing parties in Government, it was eventually forced to introduce these measures because of public pressure, brought to bear in both radio and television programmes in which it was made clear that people were living in misery and fear.</P>

      <P>I wish to touch on an issue which has not been mentioned so far in this debate, that is health.  Provision was made for a 0.7 per cent reduction, on the 1995 outturn, in the allocations notified to health boards for this year.  It appears the Minister for Health and the Government is asking the eight health boards to reduce their operating costs by in excess of £12 million. This will have adverse consequences for the acute hospitals in particular. This is one of the few sectors where savings can be made, given that decisions on various schemes, in the community care area for example, are made centrally.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has been asked to reduce its costs by £1.5 million. There was a budgetary overrun of £1 million last year.  This means the board will have to make savings of £2.5 million. This has implications for the various initiatives announced to reduce waiting lists.  It also means that another Fine Gael Minister has succumbed to the pressure exerted by both the Labour Party and Democratic Left to agree to major cutbacks which will have an effect on services for the elderly and the sick. Before the year is out there will be a severe shortage of beds and there will be queues at outpatient departments. This should not be allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, said last week that if there was a Nobel Prize for economic performance, Ireland would win it.  If there was an Oscar for huffing and puffing and making nothing more than <Col N="1989" /> slight adjustments instead of reforming the taxation system and investment strategies to create more jobs and wealth, the Minister would win it by a mile.  He had little cash to play with because it had already been spent.</P>
      <P>The Government has been on a spending spree since it took office and we are paying for it now.  The public sector pay and pension bill is set to increase by 5.5 per cent, an increase of 3 per cent in real terms as the insatiable appetite for big spending continues.  There was little good news for middle income families in the budget and, because of that, most people have forgotten what the Minister promised.  What the Government gave with one hand, it took back with the other.  The further cuts in mortgage interest and VHI relief cancel out the PRSI and income tax give-aways. Irrespective of the income tax concessions, in reality the Department of Finance expects the income tax haul to increase by £160 million this year.  The Minister made a song and dance of reducing corporation tax from 38 per cent to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income.  Despite this concession, corporation tax revenues are budgeted to increase by £150 million in 1996.</P>
      <P>We are constantly told we are among the most successful economies in Europe, with a growth rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent of GNP per annum.  We do not hear anything about the fact that under current EU Structural Funds we enjoy one of the largest ever injection of funds to a country, at about 5 per cent of GNP.  How much of the present growth rate was attributed to that injection, negotiated by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the PAYE sector fared poorly last week, the farmers fared no better.  I am particularly disappointed that the budget did little to encourage investment and competition in our most basic indigenous industry.  The present income tax code is hostile to reinvestment of retained earnings in farm business.  Stock relief, free depreciation on machinery and accelerated write-offs <Col N="1990" /> on farm buildings are only some of the incentives that have been withdrawn from farmers or changed in recent years.  What has been the result?  Successful farmers have been steered into higher risk investments, such as section 35 films, Dublin flats or the BES.  Vital funds have been siphoned out of investment in primary agriculture.</P>
    <P>The greater part of investment in commercial farms is no longer eligible for Government or EU investment aid. The farm improvement programme has been suspended since January 1995, the control of farmyard pollution scheme has been closed to new applicants since last April and we hear that the REPS may go bust before April.  Who in Government is helping those in agriculture to plan and prepare for a more competitive future that is less than five years away?  Farming organisations have argued for the option of being allowed to claim normal capital allowances at 15 per cent per annum or a tax credit on retained profits reinvested in farms. This would be a more logical and productive way to use farmers' resources than encouraging them to invest in Dublin flats or to support the Mel Gibsons and Marlon Brandos of this world, irrespective of how artistically talented they may be.  All farms need productive investment to keep pace with the continuing need for increased productivity, but last week the Minister increased the flat rate VAT rebate from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent, a measure already well justified by the increase in the prices of animal feeds, fertilisers, electricity and diesel.</P>
    <P>This tiny concession comes at a time when cattle prices are reducing, reaching a flat 98p per pound this week, and milk in danger of decreasing by 7p per gallon or more from next April.  It also comes at a time when a rift is developing between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the European Commission.  As my colleague, Mark Killilea, pointed out, the Minister has been using undiplomatic language in Brussels in his efforts to restore cuts in beef export refunds.  He <Col N="1991" /> has been quoted as saying, &ldquo;If we start dumping our beef on the European market everyone will get it in the neck&rdquo;. That type of talk only serves to further sour relations with the Commission. The Minister may be displeased with the Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler and we know from the Commission's reaction and its failure to restore beef export cuts that the Commission is also most displeased with the Minister and his PR antics.</P>
    <P>The food industry, which underpins many jobs in rural areas, did not benefit from the budget.  In the past two years the Irish pound strengthened by 7 per cent against the British currency, our most important market and competitor. Consquently, our meat factories import British beef for further processing here, our major mushroom companies are setting up production units in Britain and our food exports to the continent are being undercut by more competitively priced products from Britain.  The budget did not recognise the problems that exist in this area.  The meagre PRSI changes were no more than an acknowledgment that some influential voices had drawn attention to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced the provision of £13 million for a voluntary early retirement package for the Defence Forces.  This package has been promised for more than 12 months and, while I welcome the announcement, I have grave concerns about the amount provided.  The need for reform in the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces is well recognised but, unfortunately, that will not be possible with only £13 million. Central to reform is a voluntary early retirement package but progress will not be possible with an underfunded scheme.</P>
    <P>The age profile of the Defence Forces is one of the more serious problems confronting the organisation.  The average age of personnel is 32, a European record of which we cannot be proud.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> Our only hope of dealing with the problem is to open up recruitment and ensure that the terms of the voluntary early retirement package are attractive to older troops.  As the scheme is underfunded, the aim of creating a younger, fitter and fighting force will remain but a dream.</P>
    <P>The Government has neglected our Defence Forces, its record in that regard makes poor reading.  It spent £500,000 on the Price Waterhouse review and accepted in principle its conclusions on the need for reform in the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  The then Minister, Deputy Coveney, announced on radio that there would be barrack closures, but within 48 hours he changed his mind and stated that there would not be barrack closures during his Government's term in office.  Deputy Barrett took over the Defence portfolio and the same rhetoric continued.  He continued to tell us what he thought we wanted to hear.  Promises were made to open up recruitment, but that did not happen.  Promises were made to introduce a voluntary early retirement package last year, but that did not happen. The Government does not have the will to carry out the much needed reforms in that area.</P>
    <P>In the past Ministers frequently refused to make difficult decisions.  It is time they accepted full responsibility for their portfolios, which include making unpopular as well as popular decisions. While the Price Waterhouse report was over-critical of the Defence Forces, we all accept that reform of the forces would mean taking tough decisions. Members of the forces understand the need for change, but they do not want the process to become a penny pinching exercise, resulting in a smaller force, starved of necessary funds to remain an efficient, effective and fighting force.</P>
    <P>The modernising of our Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is vital.  This process will require major changes affecting personnel and their families. The Defence Forces have been great ambassadors for this country and we are proud of the way they have carried out <Col N="1993" /> their overseas duties.  The least they deserve is to be told where their future lies and the Minister should spell out clearly their future role.</P>

Bhí ráflaí uafásacha le cloisint agus le léamh maidir leis na deacrachtaí a bhí aige.  Bhí daoine ag rá go mbeadh an caiteachas ró-ard agus tá cuid de na daoine céanna sin ag rá anois nar chaith sé go leor.  Fiú amháin bhí daoine ag rá go mbeadh toghchán ann go luath.  Ach ní mar a shíltear bítear buíochas mór le Dia.</P>
      <P>When I listened to the debate on the budget I wondered was it time the whole thing was changed and a task force set up to study the insanity that seems to creep in when people are awaiting the budget.  That holds for the Opposition who go out of their way to pretend that Democratic Left is a dangerous species to have in government, and that poor Deputy John Bruton is being thrown around because he has views that any normal politician should have.  It holds also for the self-appointed experts who write such colourful pieces in the Sunday papers &mdash; I am not referring to the genuine political contributors but to those who write special articles.  Some of what they write is unbelievable.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 21 January was an article headed by, of all headlines, &ldquo;The Castration of Fine Gael&rdquo;, which surely must have been the unkindest cut of all, surreptitious, without anaesthetic.</P>
      <P>The article stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four weeks ago the battle of the Estimates was fought between two Ministers of the left &mdash; Mr. Quinn and <Col N="1994" /> Mr. De Rossa.  Fine Gael Ministers were hardly involved, merely irrelevant onlookers.  De Rossa won.  Fine Gael complied.  Its single boast, that of being the only party in Government which restricted public spending, was exposed as a sham, a piece of shallow rhetoric.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The word &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; is a very important word and it applies to the whole article, not just this quotation.  It says &ldquo;Fine Gael is denying its traditional instincts for the sole purpose of sitting in power&rdquo;. As a member of the party of the just society I would like to think there is no politician worthy of the name, who would think giving a 3 per cent increase to a widow or to a person on disability benefit living on about £64.50 without a living alone allowance, was anything other than common sense.  The pity is that we cannot give much more than 3 per cent, but to accuse parties of the left of going wild in giving a 3 per cent increase to social welfare recipients is so absurd that I do not know why people are not embarrassed to say it and, more important, to be paid for writing it.  It is incredible.  The article continues:</P>
      <P>He (John Bruton) placed long-term unemployment before tax cuts. Decoded, he means that the taxpayer will again subsidise unemployment.  In turn, this means smaller Budget reductions in taxation on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who spoke more eloquently than Deputy John Bruton in Opposition, about the way we taxed work and did everything to ensure that employers did not take people on?  Surely it is the consistency of the Taoiseach that should be written about.  The Opposition said that the tail was wagging the dog.  The article continues: &ldquo;Fine Gael ministers at cabinet will look on hopelessly, political eunuchs caught in the arm lock of the double left wing veto&rdquo;.  Perhaps it is a question of half a loaf being better than <Col N="1995" /> no bread &mdash; the writer is improving as he goes along.  On the following Sunday when the same writer had a chance of saying he had made a hames of it, had got it wrong and was out of touch on how the money was to be spent, he blamed it on the fact that he got two diaries.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare diaries are very useful.  They contain much information and all the telephone numbers people might want.  I am quite sure it is a good investment for the Department of Social Welfare because people do not have to ring it looking for information.  The writer goes on to talk about the moral high ground etc.  In an article in the same Sunday paper on 28 January he said:</P>
    <P>The Department of Waste and Welfare and the sanctimonious Left is doing far too LITTLE for the poor &mdash; the mentally handicapped, the blind, the old, the disabled, the genuinely sick and those incapable of participation in society.  These groups are treated to derisory sums of money by the conscience-stricken Left.  Why? Because there are not enough of them to muster many seats at a general election.</P>
    <P>How can he have it two ways?  Surely looking after the mentally handicapped and the blind is a job we should all do. Now they do not seem to have got enough.  The Sunday before the budget the tail was wagging the dog and we were madly spending money.  He writes also about bleeding hearts and so on.  It is desperate rubbish.  He goes on to say: &ldquo;There is an alternative.  We could cut Corporation Taxes, Income Taxes, abolish Residential Property Tax, Capital Gains Taxes etc.&rdquo;  The people affected by those taxes would be happy.  While the left are accused of buying votes I suppose the right would not be accused of buying votes by cutting all those taxes.  It would be a marvellous world if we could cut taxes.  Obivously the people paying taxes are paying too <Col N="1996" /> much, but we have to try to get a balance. He says he knows healthy people drawing sickness benefit, employed people drawing the dole, able bodied people taking disability benefit, people working in the black economy receiving rent subsidies, etc.  and that the Department of Social Welfare had let him down because when he reported these abuses it did nothing about it.  I expected the next article on the following Sunday to explain how the Department of Social Welfare did not deal with people who were reported.  It is so easy to exaggerate.  The people who abuse the system do no credit to the system or to those of us who have a genuine care for people in need.  If someone who is an expert knows these people he has a duty as a decent citizen, to report them.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> dated 21 January, the most vicious of all that I have seen, it is stated:</P>
    <P>One would like to imagine that Mr. Bruton conceded powers to the Left only after a stuggle, that he is lying wounded but vengeful in some corner of Government Buildings plotting a counter coup.  But no, there is no evidence of that.  Mr. Bruton is grinning and content to say whatever the socialists thinks he ought to say: though every syllable is a perversion of what Fine Gael ought to stand for.</P>
    <P>There is the criticism of spending, of the financial arrangements of the budget, of giving 3 per cent to social welfare recipients and it is suggested that Deputy Bruton, as Taoiseach, should oppose that.  I am glad he did not.  I am sorry we could not give more.  The column continues:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael... has no reason to be in public life except to fight socialism. Fine Gael exists &mdash; if it is to exist with a moral purpose &mdash; to represent business interests.</P>
    <P>Would that not be a nice party to be a member of, representing one group of society only?  I could read much more. One lecturer who wrote in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 28 January said that <Col N="1997" /> Ministers like to claim credit for the GNP growth in the Irish economy as if they caused it, that they like to claim credit for keeping borrowing within the Maastricht guidelines as if they had also caused this.  Is it not strange that if the budget had spent more than we could afford, the Minister for Finance would be blamed for upsetting the balance.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Deputy Michael McDowell gave us a laugh when he, in good humour, welcomed an absentee Deputy to the House for the occasion of the budget.  Deputy McDowell is not altogether in the first line of attenders himself. He said in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of January 28 that the see-through budget, despite all the hype and the credulous media reaction to it, was a transparent rip-off.  He has the advantage of being able to write things in the newspapers if he does not get a chance to say them here.  He seems to think that the media are being fooled.  Mr. Paul Tansey wrote in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> on 28 January that the Minister for Finance did not do a bad job and that the initiatives on PRSI, corporation tax for small companies and long-term unemployment, while thin, at least pointed in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise budgets.  There is no budget that cannot be criticised because people will never be given enough, no matter what tax or social welfare breaks are introduced.  Those who are paid to write in newspapers should try to present common sense. While beautiful English reads well, content is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, as a west of Ireland Deputy, to speak on the budget. In my constituency last weekend people did not say the budget was great but neither did they say it was bad; they described it as neutral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government cares for those who do not have jobs and depend on social welfare.  I will make no apologies to Deputy Michael McDowell or anybody else who would be critical of any Minister who makes just payments to those who need them.  Every scheme which <Col N="1998" /> has been introduced since the foundation of the State has probably been abused by a small number of people and Deputies will highlight this abuse.  If Deputy McDowell and journalists in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> know people who are paid money to which they are not entitled, they should inform the Department of Social Welfare, which will deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to address my remarks to the Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Durkan.  In the west we have many dealings with the Department.  It is caring, has learned a great deal about PR and is well equipped to deal with people's problems. I hope the Taoiseach and the Government will attempt to ensure that the same applies in other Departments. Some Departments have a great deal to learn about PR and dealings with people's problems.</P>
    <P>Two provisions in the budget upset me.  One of them relates to the carer's allowance and I have spoken about this in my constituency and at length in the Dáil on one occasion.  What the Taoiseach, the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare are doing to people looking after elderly relatives is not fair. There should be no means test for people looking after elderly people at home for payments of up to £50, £60 or £70 a week.  If sufficient resources were available, this limit should be a great deal more.  People who care for elderly relatives save the State a great deal of money.  If these relatives had to go into a home or a hospital, it would cost much more than £50 a week to maintain them; in some cases it could cost up to £300 a week.</P>
    <P>A lady came to my clinic a few weeks ago.  She had to leave her husband and family in England to come home to look after her elderly mother.  Her application for the carer's allowance was refused on the basis of the means test. Her husband's income was taken into consideration because he lived outside <Col N="1999" /> the State, but he is providing for an elderly person in this country.  The Government will have to deal with this and I will raise it at every opportunity.  It is time something was done about this injustice.  We should look after our old people and sons or daughters who care for them should be rewarded in a small way for this.</P>
    <P>Ministers and the Civil Service should realise that the west is experiencing depopulation.  The same criteria which are applied in Dublin, Galway, Waterford or Cork should not be applied in the rural west of Ireland.  I never hear Members criticise the subsidies paid to the DART or the new rail link which was announced a few weeks ago.  The people of the west do not begrudge these to the people in Dublin.  However, there seems to be begrudgery in Dublin 4 towards the west.  It is felt that people in the west are always drawing off the State.  This is incorrect.  Some 1,000 people in Westport are employed in manufacturing.  They pay taxes and PRSI and are entitled to the same standard of living as anybody else.</P>
    <P>A relative of mine who is seriously ill has to travel to Dublin by train to attend St. Luke's Hospital.  A constituent from Rossport visited my clinic last week. There are probably people in Dublin who never heard of this place which is near Belmullet.  People from there who have to travel to Dublin must first go to Ballina, a journey of 60 to 70 miles, to catch a train to Dublin.  They have to leave home at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. to be on time for the train.  They cannot be sure if the train journey will take four or five hours.  On a few occasions during Christmas it took five hours.  When they arrive in Dublin they must travel by taxi to whatever hospitals they are attending.  This is wrong and these people should be looked after.  Another constituent had to travel to St. Luke's Hospital.  He is entitled to free travel. At Ballina railway station he was given a single ticket.  He received treatment in hospital during the day.  Any illness for which people must attend St. Luke's <Col N="2000" /> must be serious.  That evening he had to queue for nearly an hour at Heuston Station for a single ticket back to Ballina. He became nervous because he thought he would miss the train.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister to ask why such people cannot be given return tickets.  I am asking him this again now. I rang Iarnród Éireann in my constituency to find out how much it was to travel to Dublin on the day in question.  A return ticket was £14 and a single was £16.  Iarnród Éireann are paid by the State for two single fares instead of for a return fare.  It is sufficiently subsidised by the taxpayers without being subsidised further.  The Minister should not talk to Iarnród Éireann, he should direct it to issue a return ticket to people from the west and other areas of the country.  That is not too much to ask and if there are any complaints he can instruct it to deduct the cost from the subsidy it is already getting from the State.  I call on the Minister to deal with this problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference to the elderly in the budget and the need for house alarms.  I highlighted this problem in my constituency in the past few months and, therefore, I was disappointed with the measure giving tax relief up to £800 for people over the age of 65 who wish to install an alarm.  We all know that most people of that age do not pay tax. I am sure the person who came up with this idea had good intentions but he or she obviously knows nothing about rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for Social Welfare to consider this matter and I have some suggestions in that regard. He should consider giving the £800 tax relief to a son, daughter or other relative of an elderly person.  Ideally everybody over the age of 65 should be given an alarm free of charge but I realise that would not be practical because the money would have to be paid by the taxpayer, but in the past we had grants for houses, hotels and industry and I do not see why we cannot give elderly people over the age of 65 a grant of £250 or £300 to install alarms in their homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter and put a proposal before the House which will benefit all elderly people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the allocation to the Department of Justice and the measures announced yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Owen.  Last year in this House I spoke about the problem of crime and I called on the Minister to return power to the provinces.  Every country should have its own police authority &mdash; the county police authority like the county health authority &mdash; which would give back power to the people rather than having all the power based in Dublin.  A chief superintendent or superintendent should be based in Mayo to deal with crime in that area. That person could be asked to attend county council meetings so that councillors could outline the action they would like to see in the fight against crime. There is little point in such a person, who has probably never been in the west other than for a month by way of promotion, being based in the Phoenix Park.  In my own town of Westport we have had three superintendents in the past 15 months, all of whom have now been transferred back to the Phoenix Park.  I welcome the initiative to transfer personnel to the regions and Assistant Commissioner Joe Long, who will be in charge of the western region, has my full support and that of the people of the west.  I hope he will be able to tackle the serious crime we have been experiencing in the past number of months.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of a question I tabled last year calling for checkpoints to be set up in the west &mdash; and I received the usual Civil Service servant reply to the effect that it could not and will not be done.  They have now been set up so somebody must have listened to me.  Those checkpoints have two objectives: first, they give elderly people in the west a sense of security which enables them to go to bed at night feeling safe and, second, they enable the gardaí to monitor people travelling to and from the province.  I welcome this move and I am glad I played a small <Col N="2002" /> part in relation to it.  Now that these checkpoints have been set up I hope they will remain in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is a caring person and a very good Minister.  She has been severely criticised in the media in the past few weeks.  Deputies referred to the media in relation to the budget and certain Sunday newspapers having a go at the left and the right.  This was a balanced budget and the measures announced yesterday by the Minister for Justice are an appropriate response to the problem of crime.  I and the people in the west have confidence in this Minister.  The media has a lot to answer for because it went overboard in the past few weeks in relation to the level of crime which resulted in people becoming even more frightened.  We do have a crime problem &mdash; I cannot deny that &mdash; and people will continue to be concerned until the people carrying out these crimes are put behind bars.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Garda Síochána who have responded well to this problem in the past number of months.  I have no doubt the current crime wave can and will be got under control.  It is not a problem that arose yesterday or today; it has been building up for the past ten years but it is being dealt with and I welcome the move on the part of the Minister of Justice to appoint an assistant commissioner in the region. However, there is little point in appointing assistant commissioners to the regions if they do not intend to reside there.  They must be based in the regions and I hope that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the grant to parents of twins.  I dealt with a constituent of mine who had a problem in this regard last week.  We would welcome many twins in the west because of our declining population.  This measure will be an incentive to people to increase the population and I am glad the Minister, in his wisdom, was in a position to provide such a grant.</P>

      <P>I welcome the budget and I am happy to be part of a caring Government.  The social welfare increase of 3 per cent is welcome because it is in line with inflation and social welfare recipients need such an increase to keep them in line with the cost of living.  The Government is working well and, judging by its reaction to the Minister's Budget Statement, the Opposition realises this was a good budget.  It is the job of the Opposition to oppose but there was not any major disturbance in the House following Minister Quinn's announcement.  I believe the Minister said we will have two more budgets before a general election and that is to be welcomed.  Other issues will have to be addressed in those budgets such as the problems being experienced by PAYE workers but that will be done in time.  The economy is healthy, there have been major decreases in mortgage payments and people are happy.  The one issue which must and is being dealt with is crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne outlined some of the writings of our colleague from the other House, Senator Shane Ross, in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> I assure Deputy Browne that this side of the House does not subscribe to Senator Ross's economic philosophy.  If we were to implement his policies there would be a revolution because he is concerned exclusively with one particular sector at the expense of other sectors in a zero sum game.  We need not be too concerned, therefore, about his rantings in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> because he is playing a completely different game.  I assure Deputy Ring also that not all Dublin people subscribe to the Dublin 4 philosophy, there are different types of people in Dublin.  I subscribe to the Dublin 5 philosophy which is different from the Dublin 4 philosophy.  Many Dublin people have a great affinity with people in the west.  It is not a zero sum game and Fianna Fáil takes a national <Col N="2004" /> approach with which I am sure Deputy Ring agrees.</P>
      <P>This budget has not been greeted enthusiastically by many people.  It has been described as a neutral, unimaginative budget giving a little here and there and tinkering with the system, similar to using a watering can around the place in the hope that something will grow.  These words have rightly been used to describe the budget.</P>
      <P>The budget was a non event, a steady as you go budget.  That was unfortunate because on this occasion the Minister had opportunities which former Ministers for Finance had not, but he opted for the cautious approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in social partnership.  Social partnership has been responsible for the transformation of this economy particularly since 1987 and consensus building in terms of our economic affairs has served this country extremely well.  The Fianna Fáil Party pioneered successive partnership programmes, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work </i> were all Fianna Fáil led initiatives.  The economy was pulled from the brink of disaster by engaging in social partnership and pay agreements and the bringing together of all the social partners in a national effort to bring about economic recovery.  That has been the case certainly since 1987. Ireland could be held up as an example of social consensus and partnership between Government, the trade unions, business and farmers.  That is the key to our success.  Social partnership and social consensus have been applied in other countries in the European Union. I met recently with the Prime Minister of Finland as part of a European Union delegation.  The Finnish Prime Minister has brought together all the parties in a very ambitious programme to bring Finland forward in terms of economic development.  How not to do things can be seen from what has been happening in Paris, where confrontation was the <Col N="2005" /> order of the day and there was no consultation or discussion.  There is no tradition of social consensus and partnership in the United Kingdom where it always seems to be one sector trying to outdo another in a zero sum game.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Leader, Deputy John Bruton, did not always subscribe to this economic philosophy before he became Taoiseach but it remains to be seen as we come to the end of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> if his attitude has changed.  The Taoiseach probably has done a U-turn on that issue and sees the benefit of pay agreements and social consensus.  It would be one of the biggest political changes in the country if the Fine Gael Party were to come to that view.</P>
    <P>This budget is the first step in the unravelling of the social partnership, painstakingly built up over so many years, particularly since 1987.  This is evident from recent statements by the national executive council of SIPTU which has issued warnings that future pay deals are in jeopardy and that key commitments have been reneged on, with particular reference to the 1996 budget.  The national executive council has more or less suggested that partnership has been sabotaged.  That is very serious and unless rectified will manifest itself during the final year of this Government and in the years to come. In its statement, SIPTU referred, in particular, to the levels of personal taxation levied on low paid workers.  It stated that after this budget workers on modest rates of income will be paying the top rate of tax.  They have arrived at the view that partnership is coming to an end as they believe key commitments in regard to income tax have been reneged on.  The three parties in Government should seek to address this before engaging in further economic planning.</P>
    <P>One would have expected that a Government comprising three parties from across the political spectrum would get the balance right, but unfortunately in this budget this was not the case.  It is generally accepted by all concerned, not only by Senator Shane Ross, <Col N="2006" /> that the budget was a triumph of Democratic Left over the Fine Gael Party and I suggest the Labour Party was left in the middle twiddling its thumbs.  The Fine Gael Party has caved in on many issues, in particular on income tax cuts. The economy is booming and there was a very real expectation of income tax cuts.  Many people have been waiting for such cuts but in the national interest they were prepared to wait until the economy was put right and the economic indicators were good.  For the first time ever the Minister for Finance had a real opportunity to tackle income tax bands but alas he tinkered with the system and engaged in tokenism and nothing happened in this regard.</P>
    <P>This budget will be remembered as one that did not do anything for middle income families, the so-called coping class.  There was no reference to tax reform, property tax, VHI or mortgage interest relief in the Minister's speech. That was not surprising as it has been estimated that the budget will add £200 to the annual cost of an average mortgage by chipping away further at interest relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in tax relief on VHI will result in an extra £80 being extracted from the average income earner.  When one considers the proposed increased electricity charges, ATM charges and television licence fee together with the reduction in tax relief the middle class did not gain anything. The Department of Finance stated that income tax for this year will increase by £160 million.  One commentator stated that a person earning £30,000 with mortgage and VHI commitments will be better off by £1 per week.  It is a shame the budget introduced low reward for work. The Government's strategy should be to widen the gap between a worker's take home pay and the benefit he or she will receive if unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable to cut back on <Col N="2007" /> benefits.  This Government must look after the old, sick and handicapped as did previous Governments.  However, there must be an incentive to work and it could have been achieved through taxation cuts but unfortunately that did not happen.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned the tax relief for installing burglar alarms.  That measure was rightly criticised.  A few years ago I suggested that fitting an approved alarm system should be tax deductible regardless of all other home improvement tax allowances.  The provision falls far short of that and is tokenism. As it applies only to single people it discriminates against married couples. In any event the people affected probably do not pay income tax so it will not be of any benefit to them.</P>
    <P>At a time of escalating crime a miserable £3.75 million extra is provided for prisons.  The cost of building Castlerea prison as originally envisaged is £20 million.  The negligible provision in the budget might build a palisade fence around that prison.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that a properly installed burglar alarm considerably reduces the risk of a break in.  Given the serious spate of attacks on the elderly the Minister should have introduced a grant to enable people install a burglar alarm system.  There have been many home improvement grants over the years.  I understand the incoming Government in 1987 faced a bill of £200 million for home improvement grants on foot of commitments given by the outgoing Government.  Perhaps the Minister will consider such a measure when introducing the Finance Bill.  We will table an amendment to enable grants to be made instead of allowing tax relief.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the ranting and raving of Senator Ross on community employment schemes.  Those who subscribe to his philosophy do not believe in them and say they do not create wealth.  However, I believe they contribute a vast amount to local communities. At a time when we are trying <Col N="2008" /> to foster community development and a sense of neighbourliness the scheme should be encouraged and I welcome the provisions in the budget in that regard.  I do not know the original objectives of the scheme but from the point of view of fostering community development and participation by young people, it should be part and parcel of the fight against unemployment.</P>
    <P>A proposal was made recently on unemployment assistance for those aged 18 and 19 by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I do not know the status of that high flying exercise, but it was badly greeted in some Dublin working areas, particularly in the Minister's constituency of Dublin North Central. A group of people who are probably most under pressure and in need of assistance were callously disregarded. The social welfare system needs to be reformed but the Government should not zone in on one group.  He should reassure his constituents and those involved in employment action groups.</P>
    <P>In 1991 area partnerships were set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> operational programme for local, urban and rural development.  The north side partnership is an employment organisation on the north side of the city.  It does tremendous work tackling unemployment in many different ways.  Recently it was allocated £2.9 million by the area development management company but that fell far short of what was envisaged. The area has expanded into Dublin North East, presumably because there are two Labour Deputies there.  As the cost of its new action plan is £9.8 million, the sum of £2.9 million is hopelessly inadequate.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, who, in association with the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, oversees this area, to reassess the role of partnership boards and adequately fund them. It would not be throwing money into a bottomless pit.  The statistics are there to show that educational qualifications are improving and much community <Col N="2009" /> activity and development has been fostered by the boards.  It is a shame that finance is not adequate in this area.</P>
    <P>The budget has not received a very warm welcome.  From the point of view of the economy as a whole the emphasis in the budget was misplaced.  We are going back to a budget deficit, which probably would not be necessary if there was a better balance of priorities. We are coming to the end of European Structural and Cohesion Funds, and future growth in the economy may slow down.  We have not been particularly prudent regarding the overall macro-economic position.  Since times are good, measures such as income tax cuts should have been introduced.  They would be self-financing and would boost the economy.</P>
    <P>We are not looking to the future in terms of a long-term economic strategy. it is evident to everyone that the reason for that is the need to keep the Coalition partners satisfied.  The question of income tax cuts was put aside because it probably was not the priority of some of the parties in Government.  I hope we will not suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>There is no measure in the budget to tackle the currency crisis which seriously affects business and jobs. Many businesses who are struggling because of the ongoing currency difficulties are disappointed that nothing was done to help them.</P>
    <P>Despite all the Government's talk about long-term unemployment, the average monthly long-term unemployment figure is £12,000 more than last year's budget target and £5,000 more than that at the end of the previous year.  The budget makes no serious impact on long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The budget was not particularly welcomed by anyone.  The adjectives used include neutral, unimaginative, a little bit here and a little bit there, opportunities missed, tinkering, tokenism and the watering can effect.  That is not good enough in 1996 when the economy is booming.  Everybody hoped for a little more imagination.  The Minister for <Col N="2010" /> Finance was envied by many of his predecessors who believed that were they in that position they could have done much more.  While the social welfare increase of 3 per cent across the board &mdash; our party has been pursuing a similar policy for many years &mdash; is welcome, many other measures could have been introduced which would have had a greater impact in that area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately income tax cuts in the budget are negligible.  The coping classes, who were prepared to wait for several years, believed that some measure would be introduced in the budget to assist them, but unfortunately that was not the case, and that is the tragedy of the budget.</P>

      <P>I am a great believer in remembering where you came from and being realistic about your background and history.  I find it very difficult therefore to listen to Opposition Deputies, particularly the last speaker from Fianna Fáil, whose speeches have been along similar lines, mostly that the budget is a scatterbrain measure but the main theme being that Democratic Left was the driving force behind it.  Last year the thrust of their attack was that Democratic Left had absolutely nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of what Deputy Haughey and numerous journalists have called the coping classes.  However, when Deputy Haughey's party was in Government I found it extremely difficult to cope.  The slogan then was that we must all tighten our belts, and we did so to such an extent that we nearly killed ourselves.  There were health cuts, social welfare cuts and cuts in education &mdash; I travelled on buses to Athlone in the company of parents who were very concerned about their children's education. The same party now says that this is a terrible budget because we have not <Col N="2011" /> made sufficient tax cuts.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would make all the tax cuts possible, and it is very easy to reduce public spending and cut taxes, but what about the people who are suffering?  Are they to be ignored? Are people under the mistaken illusion that they never vote anyway and therefore it does not matter if they are ignored.  The people towards whom this budget is directed are those who have been neglected for more than 70 years under Fianna Fáil led Governments.  For the first time we have a Government of three parties which is concentrating financial resources on alleviating suffering for everybody.</P>
    <P>In the past two weeks Democratic Left has received much unpaid publicity. Last year we were told we made no input into the budget while this year we are supposed to have framed it entirely, neither of which is true.  One-third of Fianna Fáil budget broadcasts have been devoted to our party, to the extent that one of my children said she did not know that Deputy Charlie McCreevy is now a member of the Democratic Left and asked when had he joined.  He spoke about little else but our party.  Deputy Brennan informed us last night that Democratic Left is in the driving seat, but he is aware that there are three capable and determined parties in this Government.  That is probably what grates most.</P>
    <P>The economy is in sound hands.  That is reflected in the markets, of which I was never a great admirer.  It is also reflected in the economy and everyone recognises that to be the case.  That must also grate on Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Bringing the dispossessed in from the margins is a matter of simple morality, but it is also one of self-preservation, something else Fianna Fáil has not grasped.  No matter how cocooned or isolated one is from reality, one must realise that a society cannot carry the burden of permanent long-term unemployment and survive.</P>
    <P>The back to work budget announced last week will benefit all sections of <Col N="2012" /> society in the short and long-term.  That is why Democratic Left together with our coalition partners, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, made a deliberate decision to focus resources on the long-term unemployed and on those in work on the poverty line barely eking out a living.  That was a three party decision. No one, no matter how naive or foolish, could possibly believe that one small party in Government could be so overwhelming in its persuasive powers that it could bring Fine Gael, a party of very strong convictions, and the Labour Party, a party of equally strong convictions, along with it.  This Government is about consensus.  It is regrettable that there was not consensus in the last Government, otherwise it would probably be in office still.</P>
    <P>For years we have heard about poverty traps.  The Progressive Democrats more than any other party have spoken about disincentives to work and the difficulty of making the transition from the dole to the work place.  It was usually referred to in the context of social welfare expenditure being too high, not the way I would view the problem.  This Government is the first Administration to stop talking about that problem and to start acting.</P>
    <P>Last night my ministerial colleague, Deputy Gilmore, outlined some of the consequences of high unemployment over a long period.  They should be well known to all Members, but I am sure Deputies opposite benefited from the refresher course.  Those who have been long-term unemployed need to be re-educated for the world of work in the same way that we would need to be if we were out of this sphere for a long period.  At the same time employers need to be encouraged or cajoled to pick new staff from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  Fifteen thousand new places have been provided on three programmes, £5,000 for the back to work allowance, an £80 per week subsidy for employers and a new work trial scheme will be introduced.  It is generally recognised that the older the unemployed person and the longer he or she <Col N="2013" /> has been unemployed, the less chance he or she will have of making the transition back into the work place.  For this reason 1,000 places on community employment schemes are being reserved for people over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for five or more years.  I do not subscribe to the theory that once one is over 30 one is unemployable.  Any society that subscribes to that is on the slippery slope to self-destruction.</P>
    <P>These measures will help the long-term unemployed gain a toe hold back into the world of work from which I hope they will be able to make the transition into conventional employment. That transition is being made easier by the provisions in the budget.  Until now people coming off the dole to take up work sacrificed a variety of crucial benefits. In many cases they would have been worse off in employment than on social welfare.  Rather than promoting employment, for too long the system militated against work and workers.  The measures announced in last week's budget do not represent a magic wand which will instantly dispel unemployment. Unlike the parties opposite, we are not in the business of creating illusions.  The provisions in the budget are not a short-term solution to a long-term problem.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats keep forgetting that long-term unemployment did not become a problem overnight nor is it likely to be solved in that time.</P>
    <P>The budget is designed to lay solid foundations for job creation and job maintenance.  It is also designed to make work and to enable people take up work.  In future the long-term unemployed will be able to retain their medical cards for three years and their child dependant allowances for 13 weeks after taking up employment.  Those provisions will make a significant difference to those making the transition from dole to work and will ensure that people are not deterred from taking up employment because of financial constraints.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough simply to provide work; people in work must be <Col N="2014" /> assured of an income sufficient to maintain an adequate standard of living. Nothing must be as disheartening as being worse off financially having worked five or six days than while unemployed.  Unfortunately, many workers are trapped in low paid jobs and many women, in particular, are relegated to part-time work.  The numbers in part-time work have increased from 91,000 in 1990 to 134,000 in 1994. Twenty-two per cent of women at work are in part-time jobs compared to 5 per cent of their male colleagues.  That above all else highlights the changes taking place in relation to work in society and our need to adjust to them.</P>
    <P>In that regard I welcome the measures introduced in relation to job sharers as well as those geared towards the lower paid.  The family income supplement scheme designed for the low paid has been improved while the tax burden on the lower paid has been reduced.  Single people earning below £75 per week, which Members will agree is not an enormous salary, or married couples earning below £150 per week will no longer be liable for tax. PRSI will not be payable on the first £80 of weekly income.  Those measures are far from ideal, but they are a start in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the contributions from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the run-up to the budget and during the present debate. The Progressive Democrats have the merit of being consistent.  Their trickle down philosophy espouses tax cuts for the well off in society on the premise that the benefits will filter down at some unspecified future time.  Their naïve faith in the discredited theory of Reaganomics and Thatcherism is rather touching, surely the ultimate triumph of optimism over experience.  As my ministerial colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, pointed out in the House last week, at least the Progressive Democrats are consistent, while Fianna Fáil seems to be muddled.  If I understand that party correctly, which at times is difficult, it wants across the board tax cuts, <Col N="2015" /> increased public spending and more stringent spending curbs, although I do not know what that means.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left is committed to fundamental tax reform rather than arbitrary reductions for sectional interests. Job creation is crucial to tax reform. Until we have reduced the numbers on the live register and helped people to make the transition from a social welfare income to a waged income, our tax burden will remain unacceptably high.</P>
    <P>The muted howls of protest from the Opposition benches come as no surprise. It is not long since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats entered a temporary little arrangement, and that is most interesting.  According to an analysis in a report by Davy Stockbrokers, that Administration positively discriminated in favour of higher earners. That report is well worth reading. It states that the higher one's gross income the bigger, by a wide margin, the benefits one derives from income tax changes implemented during the period in which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government.  That report highlights the truth about what we heard during the past few weeks, that of 17 developed countries Ireland came second to America in terms of the gap between the rich and the poor. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats contributed to widening that gap. That is what they mean by tax reform. Democratic Left does not believe the politics of greed should be allowed triumph over the politics of solidarity.  I do not believe for one moment the majority of our working electorate agree with that philosophy.  Instead, they would much prefer to see a balanced society in which they could live in safety and comfort.</P>
    <P>In addition to aiming budgetary changes at the unwaged and low-waged this Government has consciously directed resources to families.  The family is the fundamental unit of society; that cannot be repeated too often or too loudly.  Its centrality was re-emphasised by all parties in the course of the recent <Col N="2016" /> referendum on reversing the prohibition on divorce.  Families and the need to protect them are given priority in our Constitution yet, in the past, we failed to cherish all of the children equally since unemployment, poverty and social exclusion often placed families under intolerable stress.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left is not in Government to apply illusory quick fixes but rather to develop and implement practical, cohesive responses to the very real problems confronting our society.  Last year my party colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, took a conscious, courageous decision to concentrate the bulk of the extra resources at his disposal on increasing child benefit, thus striking at the very heart of child poverty. He has consolidated that policy in this year's budget by increasing child benefit by an additional £2.  Child benefit is of very real benefit to those in low-paid jobs.  The Minister for Social Welfare made the correct decision and benefits of increased child benefit is now widely acknowledged.  Of course, there are different kinds of families. Many an elderly, sick or disabled relative is cared for by a family member. Whereas the role of such carers was ignored or played down in the past, I am delighted at the decision to reform and substantially increase the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>This budget is the second of three over the lifetime of this Government. Each budget will build on the previous year's budget.  Short-term policies have failed the State and, more importantly, those dependent on it for their well being.  In the course of a recent television debate it was put to me that this was not the real budget, and next year we were likely to see a give-away one in advance of a general election.  Rather than being rooted in the pre-election fantasies which dominate Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats responses, this budget is a very positive response to the problems of poverty, unemployment and education.  Next year's budget will consolidate the gains made during the life of this Government and, once again, <Col N="2017" /> help to bring those on the margins into the political centre where they should be.  If that is not done we shall all live to regret it.</P>

      <P>It is always refreshing to listen to Deputy Kathleen Lynch but it was rather strange to hear such soothing noises emanate from Democratic Left, reassuring the Fine Gael Party that it had had an influence in framing the budget, thus reassuring our party members nationwide.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch said she is always conscious of her roots.  That too is a fundamental of my political involvement.  I come from the north west of Dublin city, from a large, working class area where these budgetary provisions will impact significantly on the lives of all its inhabitants, an area in which there is a high level of dependence on social welfare, a great need for employment and for budgetary provisions offering a future.</P>
      <P>When I spoke last week on the Private Members' Bill providing votes for the disabled, I began from that premise also.  It is for those reasons I welcome this budget which, as other Members have said, is a &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; one; the ship of State floating steadily, performing very well within a European economy when other countries are not doing so well.  Recently I read of German economic difficulties resulting from budgetary demands arising from a high level of unemployment and discovered that our economy, almost alone within the European Union, is performing at a level easily permitting us to comply with the Maastricht criteria.  Why not adhere to the old adage: if something works why fix it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaints of those who argued for radical new departures must be viewed somewhat cautiously.  Steady progress on the lines of agreed policies, succeeding without radical changes in the world economy, does not justify radical shifts or dramatic changes.  The only dramatic shift in which I am interested is that advocated by the Conference of Religious in Ireland, a hugely radical <Col N="2018" /> one for debate in the future to which I will revert later.</P>
    <P>At present the future of this country is bright, underpinned by the policies of this Government.  Many of the fundamentally favourable factors &mdash; apart from economic ones and the huge growth in unemployment &mdash; experienced over the past decade continue to be favourable.  From next year the growth in new entrants to the labour force will reduce steadily, leading to a general improvement in employment. While the long-term unemployed will remain with us, I hope we shall not witness the levels of growth in unemployment that have been a feature of the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government were right to target employment in this budget.  One of my difficulties with the Progressive Democrats' analysis of our approach to economics, is their attitude to various forms of social spending and employment schemes.  It is all very fine for those within the high-earning, middle income bracket to bear the squeeze, perhaps for a short while scrapping their second annual holiday or acquiring a smaller second car but it must be remembered that many people in my constituency live in a flat in Ballymun or a terraced house in Finglas and have to survive on social welfare. Whereas the benefits of such a squeeze may be felt ten years hence, in the interim poor people will have reared their families in that ten years in excruciating difficulty and poverty.</P>
    <P>We need programmes targeted at the most needy in our society which is why the merits or demerits of the community employment, the VTOS or other schemes have been the subject of analysis and depending on where one stands within the political spectrum, some people support them and some oppose them.</P>
    <P>In the context of representing my constituency, I stress that community employment is enormously important in the short-term and since people have one life only, this intervention may be critical for them, giving them and their <Col N="2019" /> families their sole experience in a decade of having a family member in employment.  Because community employment schemes contain more developmental elements and last longer, often leading to people establishing contacts and finding more continuous employment, their impact on families where one or sometimes two breadwinners are involved can be very significant. Like the previous speaker, the politics I support would not encourage a society to turn their backs on those because they do not make economic sense and they will not gain from the boom.</P>
    <P>There are steady and measured changes in the tax and social welfare elements of the budget.  It would have been nice for me, as I represent a constituency which is largely dependent on social welfare, if I could have heralded a 5 per cent, 6 per cent or 7 per cent increase.  The biggest problem experienced by most of those people, other than pensioners who have completed their working life, is the trap of social welfare.  Even with the positive changes made in that area last year and this year, the poverty traps and disincentives still exist to a significant degree.</P>
    <P>Last Monday, after attending my advice centre in Ballymun, I sat around a table with a housewife in Ballymun who has one child and whose husband is long-term unemployed.  She examined the opportunities she might have for employment, what she could afford to take up, what she could not afford to take up and whether, if she took up employment, her family would lose all its benefits.  Because of the way in which our tax and welfare systems interact there is still a very real problem despite the reforms last year and this year. What are the elements in this budget, continuing from last year, that are most helpful and that need to be speeded up? We are moving towards child benefit for the support of all children.  One of the critical elements in trapping people in social welfare is the issue of payments for children.  Those in receipt of social <Col N="2020" /> welfare receive a payment for children whereas those at work do not.  Neither is there a tax allowance for those at work, there is a small allowance in respect of property tax if one is in the net but that is the only concession.  Support for children is a huge problem.  Therefore, the move towards child support being included in child benefit is welcome.</P>
    <P>The slow growth in social welfare incomes is essential if we are not to further exacerbate the poverty traps. They should not be allowed to increase at rates higher than wages or substantially higher than the rate of inflation as that would make it less attractive to work.  Like last year, the emphasis in this budget is correct in respect of the balance between tax improvements for employment, concentration on the lower tax area, and in the context of social welfare, the support for children being equal, regardless of whether people are at work.  Those are two very important related improvements.  We look forward to further developments as the various studies on the integration of tax and social welfare are made available amid the more radical changes.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Religious in Ireland was unhappy with this budget and rightly identified that we have a fairly well developed system of taxation and social welfare.  To change it radically would be revolutionary.  It has sought the most radical change: a basic income.  That would transform everything and to a degree would require something you never get in politics, a blank page as if one was starting from a new sheet.  That type of radical reform is not a realistic option.  Many of the elements of its approach, while valuable, remain to be tested in the economy. Short of that, our present reforms are moving steadily in a direction that tries to give us a basic income for children, which would be available regardless of whether people are at work.</P>
    <P>The next major reform the social welfare system needs to set itself &mdash; this is one of the reasons my constituent wondered whether she could take up employment and what effect it would <Col N="2021" /> have on her husband and child &mdash; relates to the concept of dependency on the social welfare system.  It would be hugely expensive to move away from that system but we should begin to plan for it as the numbers of unemployed are reducing and will reduce further over the next decade.  It would be much easier to reform our system, it would be much healthier for all involved and it would remove a number of major problems in social welfare.  There are problems in relation to persons living apart and joining up as a couple.  There is a disincentive to live together as man and wife.  Indeed, there are incentives in the opposite direction, to be deserted and to live on a one-parent allowance.  These incentives would be largely removed if every adult was entitled to a similar individual payment and children, on the basis of their maturity, equally so.  It would be very expensive but we should plan for it.  I look forward to debating this matter with the Minister on the Social Welfare Bill in the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  It is an argument that has yet to be won with the Department of Social Welfare but I hope it is one we will keep coming back to.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional places being provided in the VTOS.  I would have liked to see a commitment to a project in my constituency &mdash; a project with which the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, is familiar &mdash; the international swimming pool for the Dublin area and the country as a whole.  This is a project for which we in Dublin have been campaigning. Unfortunately, we have not got the good news yet but we are still making representations to the Minister for Finance on one of the unfortunate omissions from the budget.  I, too, would have liked more funds for the health area and I remain concerned about waiting lists despite a large improvement.</P>

However, I warn my colleagues in Fine Gael that some of their supporters on the ground would not express that view: they see it as a case of the tail wagging the dog.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred, somewhat critically, to Fianna Fáil-led Governments and particularly to the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987-89.  Of all Governments since I became a Member, that minority Government was the most successful and it did much for the economy. That is the reason this economy has had the outstanding performance it has had over the past number of years. That was handed on to a Government that was given a mandate to do much for the silent majority.</P>
      <P>It was anticipated that this budget would be a good one.  There were the usual leaks to the media and the various slants being put on the Government. Most of us looked forward to significant tax concessions in the budget and we were justified in expecting them. Certainly, a serious attempt should be made to reform the PAYE system. Unfortunately, the Government did not see fit to do this.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on bringing this Bill before the House.  Drugs and law and order are the present topics of conversation particularly in rural areas where people, especially old people in isolated areas, live in constant fear.  Drug-related crime has been indentified as accounting for approximately 80 per cent of all indictable offences during the last six months of 1995.  During that time the Garda made 2,835 drug seizures, a 9 per cent increase on the figure for the same period in 1994.</P>
      <P>In mid-1995 the Minister for Justice announced a legislative initiative against drug traffickers which would have given the Garda, under the supervision of the courts, the power to detain suspected drug traffickers for up to seven days.  It would also have given a Garda superintendent the power to issue search warrants in drugs-related cases and have given Customs and Excise officials the power to question persons arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking.  It is a major disappointment that this measure has not been introduced to date.  The delay in introducing the necessary legislation has ensured an open market for drug traffickers.  When giving details last October of the proposed legislation which she said was agreed by the Cabinet the Minister stated: &ldquo;The report on which my proposals are based also identifies certain deficiencies in the law as it stands as regards the power of the law enforcement agencies to take effective action against drug traffickers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay special tribute to the Garda drug squad which carries out <Col N="2024" /> excellent work with limited resources. At times it has been subjected to much criticism which is most unreasonable and unfair to the Garda force.  The Garda drug section is responsible for the detection of offences in relation to the importation, supply and possession of controlled drugs.  It is also responsible for co-ordinating the efforts of local drug units in various stations.  The drug squad combines the role of enforcement and detection with an equal emphasis on education and prevention which entail liaison with the various statutory and voluntary agencies involved in drug-related treatment and counselling.</P>
    <P>The drug squad maintains strong links with the Customs and Excise service in counteracting drug smuggling and enjoys good co-operation with foreign police forces.  It also participates in approximately 300 lectures and drug demonstrations annualy for community groups and schools.  It continues to address the drug problem in co-operation with other agencies and also enforces the law.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing increase in drugs relates to the use of heroin which is still mainly confined to Dublin city and county.  The very large increase in the use of ecstasy is attributable to cheap purchasing prices, over production abroad and the emergence of the rave disco dance scene in Dublin and venues in other areas.  The tough law enforcement policies pursued by the Garda in Dublin have resulted in the closure of three rave premises.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on bringing it forward.  The Government's tardiness in introducing measures to deal with crime has led to the introduction of Private Members' Bills to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, particularly in the past six months, there has been an increase in the number of crimes against old people.  Many of these people who are 70 and 80 years of age have been beaten, kicked, robbed, raped and terrorised; the criminals show how tough <Col N="2025" /> they are by kicking and beating them and tying them to chairs.  In one case they threatened a 78-years-old Galway man that they would burn his eyes with a red hot poker and went so far as to burn his eyebrows.  It is wrong to treat anyone like this and it is even worse to treat old people who have worked all their lives in this way.</P>
    <P>The Government has missed a glorious opportunity to go a long way in curbing some of this crime.  According to the Garda and prison officers, one of the major causes of crime is a lack of prison spaces.  When the Government came into power it inherited a plan which would have provided an extra 150 prison spaces.  However, it stopped work on the new prison after the wall was built.  Some members of the Government said the work was merely being postponed, not stopped.  In any event it missed a glorious opportunity to provide an additional 150 prison spaces. Yesterday the Minister said that 25 prison spaces would be made available in the Castlerea area for political prisoners. What will happen the Castlerea site when there are no more political prisoners, which we all hope will shortly be the case?  It is important to refer also to the jobs which would be created in the locality by the Castlerea project.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is one garda for every 200 people, if one disregards children and the elderly.  Given that this is a reasonable ratio one must ask if the maximum use is being made of resources and whether gardaí are being deployed in the most beneficial and effective way.  Transferring gardaí from stations in smaller towns and villages to bigger stations is not the way forward. Further consideration should be given to this issue.</P>
    <P>If a lack of gardaí is not the problem then what is?  Is it a lack of proper technology? In some cases the only technology needed is a car which can travel as fast as the one used by the criminals. The provision of phones in Garda cars would also be useful.  In some cases the gardaí giving chase do not have the wherewithal to alert the gardaí in the <Col N="2026" /> next town to set up a road block.  It is important to tackle the crime problem so that people cannot be terrorised in their homes.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that when Fianna Fáil was in office the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse, which was originally chaired by Deputy Noel Treacy and later by Deputy Chris Flood, met once or twice during a two year period.</P>
      <P>It fell into decay and was abandoned. Now that Fianna Fáil is in Opposition, it is treating the related issues of drugs and crime with the seriousness they deserve.  It is interesting and amazing how a period in Opposition refreshes the intellect.  Fianna Fáil is now attempting to present itself as a party that would implement the policies it long since abandoned when in Government. It should rest assured that this Government has every intention of cleaning up the raggedness it left behind in our society.  This will not be done overnight and it will be a slow process. However, with the determination of the three parties in Government, we will move forward collectively to bring about a more stable society which has been clearly destablised by the presence of Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> The link between drugs and crime is incontrovertible.  It is estimated that around 80 per cent of all so-called petty crime is committed by drug abusers. The measures in this Bill, if refined further, would undoubtedly make life more difficult for drug dealers who prey on our young in every city, town and village in Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, while well intentioned, certain sections of this Bill have not been fully thought through.  Some aspects may only be slightly constitutional.  That in itself is not an insurmountable obstacle; there are cases where the public good often demands constitutional change.  However, I am concerned that measures such as the proposed seven day detention and fast tracking of drugs related cases could militate against innocent people caught up in the system. The concept of innocent until proven guilty must remain a cornerstone of our justice system.  That is becoming increasingly blurred as justifiable public outrage at spiralling crime rates mounts. While I am not opposed in principle to Deputy O'Donoghue's proposals, I hope the debate on this Bill over the next fortnight will enable us to clarify some of the questions raised.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that comprehensive safeguards are built into whatever legislation finally emerges to ensure the fundamental rights of the individual are vindicated.  I welcome section 9 (1) which provides that &ldquo;persons convicted under the provisions of the Bill will not be granted temporary release save for exceptional humanitarian reasons.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Commentators have alleged over recent weeks that the left in general and Democratic Left in particular is soft on crime.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  While safeguarding the rights of the innocent, it is vital that persons convicted of a crime should serve the sentence handed down to them by the courts.  It is unacceptable that persons should be released on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis after only serving a few months of their sentences.</P>
    <P>Temporary releases were originally <Col N="2028" /> intended partly as a compassionate measure and partly to help rehabilitate prisoners back into the community.  In the past 36 years, temporary releases have become little more than a convenient instrument used by the Department of Justice to relieve the pressure on prison places.  This was never intended by the authors of the 1960 Criminal Justice Act.  There is an urgent need to review the whole operation of the system, not simply with regard to drug related crimes but also in connection with other serious offences.  In this regard, I urge the Minister to consider establishing a parole board, as proposed in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>We also need to stop viewing prisons simply as an instrument of containment but rather as one of rehabilitation. There needs to be a co-ordinated policy of sentence management devised for each prisoner so we can ensure that the pattern of offending and reoffending is broken.  With regard to drug related offences, we need to catch drug addicts at the beginning rather than the end of the drug abuse cycle and before they resort to crime.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with many issues concerning the supply of drugs but we also need to tackle the demand, which is where successive Governments have failed.  However, there are still long queues of people waiting for life saving treatment that could not only save the life of the addict but possibly save the lives, and reduce the suffering, of thousands of victims of drug abusers who resort to crime to feed their addiction.</P>
    <P>If these were ordinary patients suffering from some form of organic disease, there would be a national outcry. Instead, drug abusers are waiting for places on drug rehabilitation and methadone maintenance programmes and the political response to their plight from Dublin Fianna Fáil TDs and Senators, with the notable and honourable exception of Deputy Briscoe, is one of violent opposition to the opening of treatment centres.  Fianna Fáil should stop playing cheap politics with this <Col N="2029" /> issue.  Silence is only broken by the public outcry in an area where a drug treatment clinic is proposed and then the NIMBY factor comes into play.  An important task now faces community leaders, especially politicians in giving leadership; to convince the public that they are far safer with drug treatment centres than without them.</P>
    <P>Drugs, like any other product, are subject to the laws of the market. Ecstasy is currently available on the streets of Dublin for as little as £3 a tablet and its price is continuing to drop due to what can be termed as a glut in the market.  Ecstasy tablets, like heroin, are ideal contraband.  They are small, easily transported and, despite the drop in prices, are sold at enormous profits, attracting increasing numbers of people into this unsavoury dealing.  Sadly, many young people do not view ecstasy as a real drug until such time as they or their friends suffer from its side effects.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to legalising drugs in any form.  However, we have to deal with the reality of drug abuse and attempt to minimise its consequences. In this regard, we should be brave and look at Manchester, where the police, in co-operation with city officials have developed an innovative approach designed to minimise the dangers of, and demand for, esctasy.  Public information leaflets are handed out at nightclubs which while pointing out that ecstasy is illegal, explain how some of the health dangers posed by it can be averted.  Youth workers circulate in nightclubs, dance halls and other places where ecstasy is known to be available not only to point out the dangers but also to provide help where needed.</P>
    <P>It may be alleged that that is a drastic solution, but Manchester was confronted with a serious problem and Dublin, Cork and Limerick may soon be confronted with a problem of similar scale.  I hope the criminal procedures proposed in the Bill to tackle the supply of drugs will be refined in the coming weeks and months.  There are, however, other issues which need to be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> As we are all aware, drugs are not produced in this country.  Neither marijuana nor poppies are grown here. Thanks to the excellent work of the Garda Síochána the attempts to establish an ecstasy plant were foiled.  To eliminate the problem it must be tackled both in the countries of origin and at points of entry.  Ecstasy is imported into the European Union from Eastern European countries, such as the former Czechoslovakia and Romania; heroin and cannabis resin, in huge quantities, from North Africa, Central Asia and South America.</P>
    <P>It is known that Morocco is a major producer.  Diplomatic steps must be taken to curb the flow of drugs from the Atlas Mountains which are being dumped on the market in huge quantities. The Department of Foreign Affairs must make representations to the King of Morocco and those countries which have embassies here to ensure co-operation between the respective police forces with a view to bringing the massive trade in drugs to an end.</P>
    <P>This is the single greatest health issue facing society.  Because of the illicit nature of drug abuse, we do not know precisely how many people are affected, but it is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 7,000 drug addicts in Dublin.  This does not include those who take drugs occasionally.  If one accepts that the figure of 5,000 is accurate, less than 20 per cent are receiving treatment. It is estimated that 860 are being treated under a methadone programme and a further 100 are undergoing other forms of treatment.</P>
    <P>Detoxification was seen as the solution to drug addiction, but this has now been shown to be a myth.  Under this procedure drugs are flushed from the body.  This is the preferred option in our prisons where addicts undergo a five-day programme.  Detoxification should be the end result of a comprehensive treatment programme.  As the vast majority of detoxified addicts renew their addiction, the methadone maintenance programme is the key to resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> Severe difficulties are being experienced in the south inner city of Dublin, extending through the working class communities of Crumlin and Drimnagh. As a member of the Eastern Health Board, I am familiar with its attempts to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>We should never under-estimate the excellent contribution made by various groups in the voluntary sector, such as the Merchant's Quay Centre in Dublin, which should be welcomed with open arms by the statutory bodies as one complements the other.  The people involved in these groups deserve a medal for their efforts to curb what may be described as an unsavoury habit.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Ministers concerned to make the necessary arrangements for the implementation of the Protocol dealing with the prescription of methadone produced by the previous Government in March 1993.  It provides for the issue of treatment cards to addicts.  The public and politicians of all persuasions must accept that the establishment of treatment centres is the first step in the process of wooing addicts away from a life of crime.  Once chronic drug abusers have been stabilised they may be referred to their own general practitioners for further treatment.  To allow this to happen the Protocol to which I have referred must be enshrined in legislation and agreement reached with the IMO.  We must stop playing politics with this issue as it is a matter of life and death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for sharing his time with me.  Before I came into the Chamber I was watching a report on television in which the results were given of the inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of the unfortunate girl who died after taking a single ecstasy tablet in the United Kingdom.  Her name escapes me, but her parents recently appeared on television here.  The cause of death was swelling of the brain.  This tragedy brings home to us the need to do something drastic to curb the problem given <Col N="2032" /> that drugs such as ecstasy, which has become part of youth culture, are now freely available.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Donoghue on introducing this Bill and I am delighted the Minister has decided not to oppose it.  She is to introduce a Government Bill which I hope will not run the risk of being declared repugnant to the Constitution or encounter opposition from civil libertarians.  Deputy Byrne highlighted the problems being experienced in his constituency.  Until recently the problem was confined to Dublin, but drugs are now freely available in every town and village.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the measures which have already been taken.  These include the establishment of the new National Drugs Unit and a memorandum of understanding between the Garda Síochana and Customs Service, signed by the agency heads and endorsed by the Ministers concerned, the Ministers for Justice and Finance.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to make maximum use of the resources available to Customs officers to ensure drug traffickers are apprehended and their activities brought to an end.  Customs officers have unique powers, they can stop traffic to check fuel and so on.  They should also have the power to set up random checkpoints to search vehicles they suspect are carrying drugs.  Drugs are transported in vehicles from cities to small towns and villages around the country where there are pushers to distribute them.  Given the pressure on Garda resources, I urge the Minister to deploy Customs officers, who are no longer tied up in Border duties, in this manner.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement about additional prison spaces, which is particularly relevant to my constituency. I am delighted she acted speedily with the money she was allocated this year.  A total of 278 additional prison places will be provided in the next 18 months, 233 of which will be made available before the end of the year.  The Minister must be complimented on her initiative in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> As an initial step, 25 of those places will be located in Castlerea and I want to scotch the rumours and dispel the fears of Deputy Foxe and others about that project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">

      <P>Some of them are genuine, but others are mischievous.  I understand the project was the subject of a heated debate in the House last night and that serious misrepresentations were put forward.  I want to reasure Members in that regard.  The Minister stated that the Government has agreed the further expansion of prison accommodation, with immediate recommencement of planning and development &mdash; which means building &mdash; of the women's prison in Dublin and on the remainder of the site at Castlerea, for prison purposes.  Nothing could be more unequivocal.  We are all aware of the battle that took place in Cabinet about the Castlerea project which was postponed last year, but it is now back on the rails.</P>
      <P>In drawing up new plans for Castlerea, I appeal to the Minister to preserve the two architecturally significant buildings erected in the 1930s that make up St. Patricks's Hospital.  They were built on the site of a property and house once occupied by Sir William Wilde, a famous medical man and father of the famous Oscar Wilde.  Sir William's wife, who had long since been forgotten, is soon to be commemorated. Under the old plans it was proposed to destroy those two buildings but I hope that, as far as possible, they can be preserved. Even Mountjoy Prison has a certain architectural value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In developing the prison in Castlerea, we should at least retain the architectural aspect of the buildings that already exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to a great deal of nonsense here and in my constituency about the postponement of the Castlerea prison <Col N="2034" /> project.  As the site for the prison is still in the possession of the Western Health Board, it would not have been possible for the Minister to spend the money provided for it in the 1995 Estimates. There are 80 patients in the hospital who will not be removed until May. Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Bertie Ahern claimed credit for the provision of £1.5 million in the 1995 Estimates to build a wall.  If they were honest they would have said there should also have been a financial provision to provide alternative accommodation for the patients in St. Patrick's Hospital, but they did not provide that money.  It fell to the incoming Minister, Deputy Noonan, this time last year to provide £3.2 million for alternative accommodation for those patients.  Approximately £2 million is being spent in the town of Castlerea converting a hotel into a hospital to accomodate those patients.  The Minister could not have proceeded with the project in Castlerea in 1995 because there was not alternative accommodation for the geriatric and psychiatric patients in St. Patrick's Hospital.  I am pleased that an excellent facility is being built for them, but that will not be ready until the end of May. Only then can the Minister start the substantive building programme that will provide additional prison spaces.</P>
    <P>As additional prison spaces are fundamental in the battle against crime, if possible she should provide 200 spaces in Castlerea.  When the bail laws are reformed many more people will be on remand.  At present we have the lowest number of people on remand in Europe. When the law changes additional prison spaces will be required and the 278 proposed by the Minister will be quickly taken up.  At least 150 places are necessary in Castlerea.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to deal in depth with the drugs problem, but I am pleased to have had an opportunity to comment on the provision of prison spaces in Castlerea.</P>

      <P>On 26 July last the Minister introduced a package of proposals she proposed to implement.  We welcomed the package because we believe the issues of law and order and drug-related crime are above party politics and must be tackled.  We also welcomed the Minister's recognition of drug traffickers as subversives, something for which we have been calling for a long time.  We welcomed the Government's proposed action on crime.  However, I stated that it would probably be Christmas before the legislation came before the House, but I was wrong because it has not yet come before the House.  Consequently, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has been to the forefront in making proposals in this area, introduced a Bill.</P>
      <P>Nobody raised the question of Democratic Left being soft on crime, except Deputy Byrne.  One wonders about the reason for the delay in addressing this problem.  Was there conflict within the Cabinet?  Is the Government looking three ways on this matter?  Was there a veto on proceeding with the proposed prisons and on the crackdown on crime? Are we now witnessing a U-turn forced by Fianna Fáil and recent events?  It looks very much like that.  I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his work on this Bill and the whole issue of bail.  I assure the House that Fianna Fáil will be firm on crime and tackle its causes. We will put forward proposals while the Government is in office and implement them when we return to office.</P>
      <P>The crime wave, particularly the murders in the last month, have caused major disquiet in the community, striking fear into the elderly and those living alone, not only in Dublin city but throughout the country.  Violent crime, once confined to the major urban areas, has now spread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> People wonder what is causing fear.  It is people's deep concern about the major upsurge in vicious crime over the past year or two.  The quality of life, of which as a nation we were justifiably proud, has been undermined if not destroyed. The traditional security of life has been shattered, mistrust has been engendered and fear and suspicion have become the norm.  The lack of respect for life and bodily integrity is frightening, and if commentators say that this is exaggerating, I and many Deputies in this House could show them what is happening on the ground.  The nation cannot be expected to tolerate such a diminution in its lifestyle.  It is incumbent on politicians of all parties to examine the causes, find the solutions and create the conditions which will enable their implementation so that confidence and security can be restored.</P>
    <P>The most often cited cause for much of the present crime, particularly in Dublin, is the explosion in the use of drugs.  The hash smoking of the 1960s and 1970s was confined to the few and was not comparable to the present threat to society.  The advent of hard drugs has changed all that.  Drug abuse is now a major threat to society.  The increase in the number of dependent drug users has grown expotentially and with that increase has come a corresponding increase in drug related crime. Today's drug user typically has a habit which costs anything from £40 to £700 a day to satisfy.  This can only be financed by crime, handbag snatching, mugging, robbery and house breaking.  These are the common sources of finance for the strung-out drug addict.</P>
    <P>Some people engage in drug dealing to finance their own habit.  No matter what method the drug user employs to finance that habit, it needs urgent attention to curb the use of drugs and the associated crime wave.  There are a number of areas which could contribute to both these ends.  Excluding the importation of drugs, the current legislation concentrates on two major offences &mdash; possession of drugs for one's own use and possession for the purposes <Col N="2037" /> of supplying them to another person. There is a need to make the use of drugs an illegal act.  In addition to the measures outlined in the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, a new offence should be created so that a person using or under the influence of a drug which is not a drug taken under prescription for a recognised medical condition, excluding a condition related to drug abuse, should be guilty of an offence.  This is analogous to drunk driving offences minus the driving element.  There the offence is one of having a concentration of alcohol in one's blood or urine and driving in that condition.  The new offence would make it an offence to have a concentration of a drug in one's blood or urine.  The drugs in question are already listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act and in the regulations.  As in the case of the drunk driver the Garda should be given a power of arrest on suspicion of commiting an offence and should have a power of requesting a sample of blood or urine with the corresponding offence of refusing to give a sample should this occur.  This offence should be one which can be tried summarily in the District Court and carry a range of penalties from imprisonment to compulsory attendance for treatment. In my constituency, for a trial period, people who first come in contact with the law are given the option of rehabilitation locally and are taking it, and many of them are glad to do so.  We need to examine substance abuse much more than we have.</P>
    <P>There would be no point in sentencing a drug abuser to undergo compulsory treatment unless there is a regime in place to treat people who are sentenced. A State-funded rehabilitation programme is necessary and badly needed.  A programme of this nature will require the provision of secure residences, not prisons, staffed by professionals from several different walks of life and from the professions.  There will be a need for security staff to ensure that the accomodation is secure and that the inmates are not free to walk out whenever they desire.  Second, full <Col N="2038" /> medical care will have to be provided to detoxify the drug user by the best medical means.  Third, an education programme will have to be provided to educate and rehabilitate the offender. The precedent for a treatment centre of this kind already exists in Coolmine. This proposal differs in that it would involve compulsory rather than voluntary treatment and would necessitate the incarceration of the drug user for the duration of the programme.</P>
    <P>Turning from the proposed new offence to the existing situation, last week, Mr. Michael Dillon of the Customs and Excise groups in the Public Service Executive Union outlined the difference of approach between the Garda and Customs and Excise in combating drug importing.  It was reported: &ldquo;The problem is that while the Garda would like to catch the major drug dealers red-handed, Customs seek to keep the drugs out and seize the carriers on arrival at ports and airports&rdquo;.  Of course, they are both right but a way must be found to deal with this conflict. He also called for greater manpower and equipment to reduce the supply of drugs still further.  He cited the success of the Customs and Excise in combating the importation of drugs and seizures made to date, and they are to be congratulated and commended for their invaluable work so far.  We wish them continued success in the future.  They have shown from 1993 to 1995 increases in heroin seizures from 124,000 tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes, in ecstasy from 34,000 tonnes to 353,000 tonnes and in cannabis from 16 million tonnes to 30 million tonnes.  We cannot afford differences between the approaches of the Customs and Excise and Garda Síochána. If there are differences the Ministers responsible must tackle the problem and put the structures in place to enable both to work together with the aim of maximising the detection and prosecution rate of the importers and carriers of drugs.</P>
    <P>Both services need greater resources to be placed at their disposal.  The problem is now so great that whatever is <Col N="2039" /> required must be made available.  We have at our disposal one of the most powerful methods of combating the drug barons.  Their primary motivation is to get rich at the expense of others, and many have succeeded.  Those riches have never been subject to taxation. Their sources have not been examined to any great extent, and they are flaunted in the face of the hard-pressed taxpayer.  Why should they not be called to account for their riches?  Why, if they are found to have originated from illegal sources, should they not be seized by the State and deprived of their ill-gotten gains?  The Revenue Commissioners should be empowered, in conjunction with the Garda and Customs and Excise, to call on the drug barons to account for their riches.  This may require hiring specialist staff, if they are not already in position, to audit resources, to check title to their mansions, to collect and collate evidence and, where possible, prosecute offenders.  If further legislation is necessary it must be introduced without delay.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, working with the others, must quickly show that drugs related crime does not pay. In addition to the compulsory rehabilitation programme, it is also important that community based rehabilitation programmes are available.  This will require co-operation between the Departments of Health, Education, Justice, Social Welfare and the Environment. The drugs problem is not confined to disadvantaged areas but the bulk of it occurs in them.  The various Departments will have to examine these areas, identify the problems, devise solutions and put the necessary supports in place.  The perceived need of some people to escape reality through the use of drugs must be eradicated.</P>
    <P>There is an invidious and subversive threat to our society and we will have to attack it with vigour and determination. Drug barons will have to learn there is no safe place for them in this jurisdiction to hide and carry out their <Col N="2040" /> destructive trade.  They will not be permitted to destroy our way of life and our young people.  With single-minded determination and adequate resources, they can be confronted and defeated.  I will do whatever I can to see that their activities are not only curbed but terminated.  I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I broadly support this Bill and any constitutional measures which effectively control the parasites on society who peddle illegal drugs which are causing so much misery and waste in my constituency of Dublin North and throughout the country.  It is ironic that we are beginning to see a wider public acceptance of smoke free bingo halls, restaurants and even pubs, but peer pressure on young people makes many of them vulnerable to the preying connivance of the ruthless entrepreneurs who shamelessly profit from trade in illicit drugs.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister, Deputy Owen, when she says that measures in this or other Bills must be constitutional. I hope we do not face a constitutional challenge to this Bill on the grounds of human rights infringements or on any other grounds.  In our haste to protect the health of young people, we must not overlook omissions in this Bill or in any further legislation the Government may bring forward.  I imagine that many of the provisions of Part II will be difficult to implement without a change in the bail laws.  I hope the Bill will provoke a quick response. There is certainly a need for wide consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Woods stated, apart from alcohol the consumption of drugs while driving has not been addressed in law. The US carries out sobriety tests which cover illegal and prescription drugs.  It is time our laws were widened to encompass them.  There is also a need to face up to the fact that many people under 18 years of age are involved in <Col N="2041" /> the drugs trade through association with drug barons.  We do not seem to deal effectively with young offenders because most of our legislative provisions presume people only become involved in drugs when they are older. Unfortunately, this is not true in some cases.  Many young offenders are sent to Oberstown and Trinity House.  This is a constant source of worry for local people because these institutions are regarded as schools by the Department of Education and on that basis are not afforded protection and security. measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of Private Members' Business to deal with crime related Bills is a measure of the level of the public, political and media focus on crime.  Deputy O'Donoghue and I are sure to be here at 8 p.m. on Wednesdays taking about crime.</P>
      <P>On the media handling of the current crime debate, from its point of view there is an insatiable appetite for crime related analysis, scoops and scandals. The public service role of the media in dealing with crime is worthy of critical analysis.  There is a creeping tabloidism among the media, particularly the print media.  Others, apart from Deputies, who have time to scrutinise the standards of that coverage should do so.</P>
      <P>There have been allegations by the Minister and some commentators of a great deal of hype about crime. However, crime is a reality.  The media, in covering crime in all its gruesome details, reflects public fear.  The standards of that reporting is a matter for the press to debate.  It is not adequate for the Minister to say debating crime and holding her to account for her Department's handling of crime is hype. Crime is a reality and people fear the violence and current criminal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can take our democracy for granted.  There is a creeping tendency in the media to rubbish the efforts of all politicians.  Critical comment of the policies of political parties is fine but it is extremely dangerous and unhelpful in a democracy if all politicians as a class are <Col N="2042" /> rubbished.  It encourages people not to vote and to lose confidence in our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>We were confronted with a threat to the security of the State and to our democratic institutions by armed paramilitarism over a period of 25 years. This threat has been replaced by the threat of organised crime particularly drug trafficking.  We need to endorse and support the organs of the State, in particular this House, and the role of elected politicians in our democracy. There is a ceasefire by paramilitaries and the peace process is progressing. The Bill attempts to deal with drug related organised crime and proposes practical measures.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years the Opposition, in its various forms, has put forward radical measures to reform the law in a range of areas relating to organised crime.  At every opportunity the Progressive Democrats called for enhanced powers for the authorities to deal efficiently and expeditiously with such crime.</P>
    <P>Highly organised armed criminal gangs control the drugs trade.  Despite recent successes by way of drugs seizures by the Garda and the customs service, it is clear that a range of procedural and legislative reforms are required to ensure prosecutions and convictions.  Our decent law abiding citizens are tired of routine condemnations from all parties followed by an apparent absence of detailed proposals to tackle the problem.  This and the previous Government voted down every constructive proposal by the Progressive Democrats, advanced by way of Private Members' Bills and motions, to reform and strengthen the law on bail and the arrest and detention of suspects. Radical measures are required to respond to drug distribution and importation. These should be targeted at the godfathers and not at the unfortunate victims.</P>
    <P>Apart from the tragedy of drug abuse for young people, including deaths from ecstasy and heroin, the enormous <Col N="2043" /> impact of drug addiction on criminality make it imperative that radical measures be introduced.  We proposed that the absolute right to silence be abolished and safeguards introduced such as the video taping of interviews. The time has come to examine whether our legal system ought to be more inquisitorial.  There is public disquiet that the guilty are using the adversarial nature of the criminal justice system to escape justice, in other words, abusing the fundamental rights provided in our Constitution to protect the accused. Under the inquisitorial system the judge's role is to carry out any investigation required to arrive at the truth. Neither prosecution nor defence bears the burden of proof as in our system. The tribunal must make a <i>prima facie</i> determination of facts prior to trial.</P>
    <P>To introduce a fully inquisitorial system, including longer periods of investigation for alleged offences, even limited to organised crime and drugs, would require a constitutional amendment. However, some of the most important features of the system could be introduced here with a minimum of disruption. It is not beyond the capacity of the Dáil to legislate for necessary safeguards to civil liberties such as videotaping interviews and giving a supervisory jurisdiction to the District Court.</P>
    <P>The right to silence has existed in common law for centuries.  It developed when the legal controls over the detection of suspects were few.  Many accused were illiterate and had little or no understanding of the criminal process. Often the accused was not given any opportunity to speak in his defence and the right of access to a lawyer was unrecognised. Death was often the penalty for a relatively minor offence.  In these circumstances the right to silence was often the only effective defence an accused person had against the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>The current right of a suspect to sing dumb and refuse to answer any questions or account for his or her movements during a police investigation is a <Col N="2044" /> fundamental obstacle faced by the Garda in its task of investigating crime. Statutory provisions, such as section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act or sections 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, require suspects to answer police questions.  In general, however, accused persons now have at their disposal a huge range of rights recognised as essential to due process.</P>
    <P>The time has come to balance those rights with the rights of the victims of crime, and of law abiding citizens, and to expect public order in the common good.  The first duty of the State is to protect the safety of the citizen.  Citizens ought to be under a duty to give whatever assistance they can to the police force which serves them and their community and the Garda should be given power to ensure that persons suspected of involvement in serious criminal activity are obliged to account for their movements.  I am not calling for the total abolition of the right to silence but an amendment to the absolute right of silence which means that no inference can be drawn by the accused's silence.</P>
    <P>There are compelling arguments for giving police the power to arrest a person believed to be in a position to supply information about serious offences such as armed drug related activity but who refuses to co-operate.  It must be possible to extend the permissible period of detention and I understand the Minister has plans to do that.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has called for a unified prosecution service. He made that call last September or November publicity in an article he wrote in a Garda management magazine. When I questioned the Minister on 14 December about her response to this cry for help from the Director of Public Prosecutions, who said there were absurd delays and duplications in the prosecution service and that we should have a unified prosecution service, the Minister told me that the Director of Public Prosecutions was an independent office holder, that she had not discussed these matters with him and to do so would be improper.  That is a failure to <Col N="2045" /> understand the difference between independence and proper co-operation and accountability.  The cry for help from the Director of Public Prosecutions should be acknowledged by the Minister and the issues he raised debated in this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the Law Reform Commission on bail.  A broad analysis of preventative detention was carried out by the commission at the request of the Government.  Unfortunately, its report did not make any recommendations &mdash; it was not requested to do so.  Political direction is needed now.  Decisions must be made by this Government and they will be supported by the Opposition.  It is time for a reasonable amendment to be made to the law on bail and it is not beyond the intelligent capacity of this House to stitch safeguards into our Constitution dealing with the legitimate concerns about civil liberties expressed by some members of the Government parties. Indeed, we share those concerns but it is not beyond the capacity of the House to change the bail laws by way of a reasonable amendment to them.  This may require a constitutional referendum. The measures we put forward, such as those concerning sureties which could be forfeited if the person recommitted an offence while on bail, were reasonable and would not require a constitutional referendum but they were voted down by the Government.  I hope the Government bites the bullet on the important issue of bail.  We can do that without infringing on civil liberties.  It is a balance to be drawn in the light of our current needs given high rates of reoffending a current feature of our criminality.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue for yet another valiant effort to challenge the system. I am glad the Government has taken a reasonable approach to this Bill because the difficulties with organised crime and drug trafficking go beyond politics and there is a broad consensus in the House that radical measures should be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest and an open mind to the points made by Deputies from various parties in the debate.  While there has been a degree of media hype and, in some instances, hysteria about this problem, it is based on the genuine fears of people in regard to the current crime wave.  The way in which some commentators have reacted is inappropriate in that they have sought to manipulate the problem in a certain way, but most journalists reflect the honest fear felt by people as a result of an exceptional series of events which came together.</P>
      <P>It may be some time before we get the full stories behind the different murders and we may find that none of them had anything to do with organised crime but were of a traditional variety. However, these murders highlight certain changes in Irish society and in any analysis of or response to the crime wave, we must examine the changes in relation to crime and the prison system. If we can understand some of those changes, we may be able to find the appropriate remedies to cope with them.</P>
      <P>In regard to our prison system and the current crime wave, there are a number of separate but distinctive features which must be taken into account and which perhaps need different responses.  There is the whole question of rural crime and the insecurity felt by elderly people living in remote areas whose lives are restricted because of that fear.  Measures such as Community Alert, auxiliary police forces and other responses which allow communities in those areas have some degree of control of collective security, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, are the appropriate mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature of the current crime wave &mdash; the drugs problem &mdash; is essentially urban based although it is now percolating into the towns outside our large cities.  This is a worldwide, European-wide problem and in that sense we are part of a wider cultural change in <Col N="2047" /> Europe.  The third element in our criminal statistics, particularly in relation to our prisons, which must be considered is the number of sex offenders currently in the prison system or who will be going through it in future.  Society has learned slowly and painfully about sexual crimes and sexual abuse.  As a consequence in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of people being convicted and brought before the courts on these offences.  Sexual offenders are different from the traditional categories of prisoners. There are just a few in prison for subversive offences.  What might be termed common or ordinary criminals have, in the main, a drugs background.  Statistics shows that sex offenders as a proportion of the prison population will rise in future as it is not possible to grant them early release because of the nature of their crimes and the threat they pose to society.  There has been insufficient analysis of that social change.</P>
    <P>We need to view the drugs problem not just in the Irish context but in the European Union and world-wide context. The European Commissioner for Social Affairs, a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, said last year that the war against drugs and crime will be long and difficult and that we do ourselves no favours by adopting panic responses.  Some of his erstwhile colleagues would do well to head his comments. If we want to fight a successful war against drugs &mdash; all parties are agreed on that &mdash; we need to target those whose removal from the field will have the greatest impact.  By tackling the traffickers, we can reduce the supply of drugs on the market which would have two main benefits: first, it would reduce the opportunity for young people to be initiated into the culture of drug abuse; second, it would enable us to target resources in a way that helps addicts to cure their addiction.  We need to devise strategies on the demandreduction side.  I understand my colleague, the Minister for Health, will be <Col N="2048" /> bringing proposals to Government in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has brought forward a number of Private Members' Bills in the past 18 months with the aim of trying to anticipate the Government's approach to the issues in question and this Bill is in that mould.  However, there are many significant problems with the Deputy's approach to the drug trafficking problem, which no responsible Government could ignore.  The Minister for Justice dealt in detail with the shortcomings in the Bill during her contribution last night.  I will confine my remarks to the three matters which concern me, in particular, provisions dealing with the powers of detention and rearrest and extra powers for Customs and Excise officers.  Under section 1, the Garda Síochána could be given increased powers of detention in relation to offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, such as possession of controlled drugs, cultivation of opium poppy or cannabis plants, permitting the use of premises for drug offences and committing similar offences abroad. However, there is no mention of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which provides a definition of a drug trafficking offence which would include aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of drugs offences as well as attempting or conspiring to commit such offences.  Because of the ingenious methods adopted by drug traffickers to ply their trade it is essential that all persons who have an involvement in this activity should be amenable to any law designed to eliminate it.  The section purports to allow seven day detention, however, I can see no obvious references to any safeguards which would be expected to be included where such a power is being provided.  As I understand the position, very specific safeguards would have to be put in place to ensure that any additional powers of detention are likely to pass the constitutional test against the deprivation of liberty.  I am not making this point out of misplaced concern for the rights of people involved in drug trafficking.  My <Col N="2049" /> concern is that what the Deputy proposes would be likely to be found unconstitutional and would fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We need effective legislation that will not give rise to these difficulties and that is why I welcome the fact that the Government's drug trafficking Bill will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>It appears that a provision which allows for applications to be made through the courts to permit further periods of detention to be made <i>ex-parte</i> must offend against some of our fundamental legal precepts.  It goes without saying that it must infringe also on the basic concepts of human rights.  A further flaw is that it would appear that a person could be arrested again and again on foot of the same suspicion and detained.  Given the exceptional nature of the powers being created in the Bill, it would seem there is a necessity to spell out the circumstances in which persons can be rearrested and detained under this Bill.  The Deputy probably understands the point I am making.  I am not objecting to additional powers but if we put them forward they must be constitutionally effective, otherwise inevitably they will be struck down by the courts and when that happens, here or in Europe, the consequences for the status of the legislation will be quite drastic.  If the legislation is seen to collapse, it would be a very severe setback to the prosecution of such offences.</P>
    <P>The package of measures announced by the Government last July to address the drugs scourge included a reference to greater co-operation between the Garda and customs.  This would include allowing Customs officers to be present during the questioning of suspects. Section 4 of this Bill seeks to provide powers for Customs officers to question a person, having first informed that person of his suspicion that he or she has or is committing an offence under the Bill and issuing a caution.  In effect this section is creating a parallel system of collecting evidence which might be used in prosecuting the offence.  This fragmentation of powers would not be the <Col N="2050" /> most effective way of meeting the challenge posed by drug trafficking.  At a time when other jurisdictions are looking for ways of creating a unified law enforcement front to tackle the drugs problem, the Deputy's Bill would send us in the other direction.</P>
    <P>The causes of crime are complex and it behoves us, therefore, as legislators to examine these causes before we attempt solutions.  The Government has promised to bring forward its own comprehensive proposals in this regard within a matter of weeks.  In view of the evident shortcomings of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill &mdash; I mentioned only some of them &mdash; there are clear advantages in waiting for the Government's Bill.  At that stage the concern of Deputies and other Members can be raised.  I know the Government will not be deaf to reasonable and workable solutions.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Opposition Deputies and there was merit in the points they raised.  I do not see any fundamental conflict between the concept of civil liberties and taking draconian measures against persons such as drug offenders, but it is necessary that whatever legislation is introduced &mdash; however draconian &mdash; must stand up to certain constitutional tests.  If the proposals are assessed reasonably as being constitutionally invalid, clearly we have to face a debate on whether to change the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In addressing the debate on bail laws one must strike a balance between the liberties the vast majority of people deserve to enjoy and the power needed to address the serious crime problem.  In some jurisdictions there was an excessive reaction and the balance swung away from civil liberties and in others the cautious development of legislation collapsed as verdicts were overthrown and the Judiciary was brought into disrepute through miscarriages of Justice. In putting forward proposals, in many cases sensible ones, I urge Deputies to structure them in such a way that they will stand up and not simply be reactions they do not intend to pursue seriously in the long-term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> I wish to share time with Deputy Costello.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for allowing me share time with her.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute in light of the recent debate and the proposals introduced by the Minister for Justice yesterday.  She announced that she would publish the drug trafficking Bill, which supersedes the need for this Bill.  There is very little in the Bill which is not contained in the Minister's proposals.  Her decision not to recommend rejection of the Bill is generous considering Deputy O'Donoghue's onslaught on her over the last few months.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's resumed interest in the rise in crime reflects not so much its concern as its inability to mount a decent sustained attack on the budget. The proposal for seven days detention formed an integral part of the announcement made by the Minister in July and I have no doubt will be contained in the Bill to be introduced.  The proposals presented in this Bill appears to be unconstitutional and may infringe the European Convention on Human Rights.  Presumably the power of super-intendents to authorise the issue of search warrants for persons suspected of drug trafficking would be exercised by them in their own jurisdiction.  At present this power is exercised by district justices and to my knowledge no request for a search warrant was ever refused.  While it makes no difference in practice that this power will be given to superintendents it does in theory, in that the Garda will now conduct the investigation and authorise the issuing of a search warrant.  As a result, search warrants should be issued more speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed agreement between the Garda and Customs and Excise officers is already in place in many ways.  Under the Bill the Deputy proposes giving the power to question on suspicion, which currently rests with the Garda, to Customs and Excise officers.  It is a controversial proposal which must be carefully <Col N="2052" /> examined. The appointment of new judges announced by the Minister should reduce the delay in bringing people to trial.  Virtually everything contained in the Bill forms part of the announcement made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I represent a Dublin constituency and know only too well the necessity for these and other measures to tackle the drug problem.  Drug-related crime in the Dublin area accounts for 75 per cent of all crime.  Heroin addiction is the primary problem in Dublin.  That is not to underestimate the effect of other drugs. While it is difficult to estimate the number of addicts in Dublin, the guesstimate is 5,000.  These addicts require £500 per day to feed their habit and as a result petty crime such as larceny, bag snatching and burglary has increased.  Many heroin addicts in the north inner city have died.  There is no doubt that such addicts are from socially deprived areas. We must adopt a multifaceted approach to the problem of drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats one would imagine building Castlerea prison and abolishing the right to bail would solve the problem. Many complex issues give rise to the problem and these must be addressed if we are to deal with the problem in a comprehensive and meaningful fashion.  I welcome the expansion of the services at local level and in the Eastern Health Board, particularly the proposal to introduce satellite clinics around the country.  The problem will best be tackled by dealing with it at local level.  Politicians must lend their support as we are immune to intimidation or attack by pushers whereas local people are vulnerable to such pressures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased involvement of voluntary groups.  Not only do they provide treatment programmes but add considerably to the variety of programmes on offer.  There is still some debate on how to tackle heroin addiction effectively and it is essential to provide as wide a range of treatment as possible to people who have different needs.  I welcome the statement that a <Col N="2053" /> drug free unit is to be established in Mountjoy Prison.  In the past I was critical of the available services for prisoners willing to tackle their addiction in prison. Provision should be made to transfer responsibility for the treatment of prisoners with medical problems to the Eastern Health Board in the same way as educational services within prisons are the responsibility of the local vocational education committees.  Such a measure would ensure an integrated approach to the treatment of drug addicts inside the prison as well as in the community.  I urge the Minister to take action in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, referred to education which must play an important role in combating the present drug epidemic.  The Minister for Education is compiling a programme of education to combat drug abuse, particularly heroin.  While this will be introduced in all schools, primary schools in disadvantaged areas must be targeted.  Parents of children in those areas must be provided with information because they too form the front line in the fight against drug abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  Once again, the vulnerability of children throughout the world has been brought home to us through the shocking revelations and images of the film &ldquo;Return to the Dying Rooms&rdquo; on the ill-treatment of children in orphanages in China.  Amnesty International is greatly concerned by the growing body of credible evidence, including eye witness accounts, film footage, Chinese press coverage, orphanage workers' testimony and officially published statistics and records of internal investigations.  The Chinese Government should answer fully these <Col N="2054" /> allegations of children being deliberately left to die, sexual and physical abuse, denial of medical care and serious neglect.  Investigation is needed into these matters.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Chinese Government here as in other countries have categorically denied the allegations, but as the body of evidence becomes increasingly compelling blanket denials or failure to provide evidence to disprove specific detailed allegations do little to counter the concerns raised by these disturbing reports.  Such denials can only lead to the inference that the abuses in question may be officially condoned.</P>
      <P>I am also very concerned about reports of the arrest and detention of relatives of those who have raised these concerns in China.  We must continue to force children's rights to the top of political, economic and social agendas.  This is not about China-bashing; it is about putting children's interests centre stage. It is also about Ireland acting at national and international levels to promote the welfare of children and raise awareness worldwide about children's rights and high standards of child care for the most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>At the United Nations conference in Beijing one of the key issues clearly documented and discussed in upsetting detail was the need to protect the rights of the girl child around the world.  There are unique problems with the issue of the girl child in many countries, including the consequences for the girl child of the one child policy in China and other countries because of the low status of women, which leads to a lack of protection for baby girls, young girls being kidnapped in many parts of the world and sold to sex tourism and sex slavery, putting their lives at risk.  It is important that we communicate to China our concern about its children and the consequences of its policy.  More investigations in this regard are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many countries, including China, have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  There has never been a better opportunity to raise the <Col N="2055" /> issues that so adversely affect the lives of children. There is now an opportunity and responsibility for Ireland to use its international voice.  I welcome the action already taken by the Ministers of State, Deputies Gay Mitchell and Burton. I ask the Minister here tonight to ensure a thorough, impartial investigation into these allegations in an open and systematic way.  There should be an international investigation of these abuses.  We should raise the issue again and again within the EU, the Council of Europe and the United Nations.  We have an opportunity to raise this issue as one of international human rights.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Department of Foreign Affairs on its work on this issue to date in the international arena.  I ask that the Hague Convention on Adoption be considered to see if it can be acted upon by the appropriate Department here.  The Chinese authorities must demonstrate that existing legislative protection of the rights of children in care is effective in practice.  The findings of an investigation into this issue should be published in full.  Ironically, the rights of the girl child throughout the world should be firmly on the international political agenda as a result of the work done in the Beijing conference. Isolating China is not the answer; working with the Chinese on this issue and raising it at an international level is the way forward.</P>
    <P>We have on obligation to raise the standards of care for our most vulnerable children.  We are not immune from scandal in regard to children, including children in care.  As we come to the end of this decade it is clear that the education and protection of children has become one of the centrepieces of international development and human rights. The principle that education brings empowerment and, with it, the opportunities to transform life has been affirmed strongly by the global conferences at Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing. This makes the future for children <Col N="2056" /> a realm of optimism rather than a crucible of despair, as is stated in the UNICEF report.</P>
    <P>The UNICEF State of the World Children's Report, 1996, is a stunning report which highlights the devastating impact of global change and war on the most vulnerable members of society. The suffering of children around the world is horrifying.  The UNICEF report states that for complex reasons spanning 50 years it is now possible, in spite of the wars and poverty, to believe that ultimately the world will not abandon or marginalise children.  It has been a long struggle to have the lives of children taken seriously.  They are now at the centre of the human rights agenda.  The response of Irish people to &ldquo;Return to the Dying Rooms&rdquo; and other scandals has shown that Irish people want to put the rights of children centre stage.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am pleased that RTE will show the programme &ldquo;Return to the Dying Rooms&rdquo; next week and I recommend that those who have not had an opportunity to see it should watch it and ponder on the horrifying episodes outlined in it.  The Government is conscious of the deep public concern following screening of the programme on Channel 4 and release of the report by Human Rights Watch/Asia alleging a nationwide practice of allowing China's unwanted children to die of starvation and suffer abuse in State-run orphanages. The Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, and I have been actively concerned at the content and implications of the programme and the report.  The Tánaiste wrote to the Chinese Ambassador on 22 January asking her to convey to her authorities the sense of outrage which the programme and report evoked among the Irish people.  He indicated that while he was aware that the initial reaction of the Chinese authorities to the allegations had been that they were a fabrication, nevertheless he appealed to them for <Col N="2057" /> complete transparency and openness in respect of the allegations, for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State in charge of development co-operation I have sought to ensure that Ireland plays a significant role in promoting the welfare of children worldwide, to improve the condition of children in orphanages and to focus on issues such as child prostitution, land mines and child labour, areas where there are significant violations of the human rights of children.</P>
      <P>I was shocked at the horrific images of the suffering children portrayed in the television programme, as anyone who watched it must have been.  I made immediate contact with the executive director of UNICEF.  I also contacted the Presidency of the European Union, the Commission and my fellow development co-operation Ministers to urge consideration of possible areas for technical co-operation and dialogue with the Chinese authorities, including for example the training of staff for orphanages. Our first response must be to seek to improve the conditions in which children are living in Chinese orphanages. The commission is pursuing this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, spoke with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on the matter and I am pleased to inform the House that UNICEF has reached agreement with the Chinese Government to start a programme aimed at improving the care of institutionalised orphans and disabled children.  Similar programmes on children in Romanian orphanages resulted in a substantial improvement in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union Troika, on which Ireland was represented, visited Beijing from 22-24 January for a meeting with the Chinese authorities on human rights.  They raised the Human Rights Watch/Asia report and the television programme with the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry responsible. Lengthy discussions took place on the <Col N="2058" /> position of orphans and disabled persons in China, from which it was clear that the Chinese took the allegations very seriously.  As the Deputy said, the Chinese reject the allegations as a fabrication.</P>
    <P>The authorities arranged for the Troika to visit the Beijing Children's Welfare Institute which houses 400 children, many of whom are mentally or physically disabled.  One of my officials took part in the tour of that building. He saw 80 or more children who seemed to be well cared for and content although he reported that by western standards the conditions were austere.</P>
    <P>The Chinese also arranged for a group of European Union consular officials, including a representative from the Irish Embassy in Beijing, to visit the No. 2 Social Welfare Institute on Chong Ming Island in Shanghai.  The group reported that, relative to the objective Chinese standards, the conditions of the institute's premises were not inconsistent with those found elsewhere in China and that nothing they saw &mdash; I stress they saw a limited amount &mdash; indicated systematic ill-treatment or abuse of inmates.  The Director of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau pointed out that if cases of abuse, which is against Chinese law, were discovered, the culprits would be subject to disciplinary proceedings. Deputies will recall this was one of the institutions highlighted on the Channel 4 programme where particularly vile practices were alleged to have taken place.  It is incumbent on the Chinese authorities to bring to justice those who are guilty of violating the human rights of children.</P>
    <P>Our officials raised with the Chinese authorities ways in which it would be possible for Irish citizens and NGOs to contribute to the welfare of disadvantaged Chinese children.  The response has been positive and this is being followed up.  Irish Aid is also planning to provide assistance through international bodies and NGOs.  I asked our ambassador in Beijing to initiate such steps last October.  It is the Government's hope, and my own, that the deep interest and <Col N="2059" /> concern displayed for Chinese disabled and orphaned children can be channelled in such a way as to assist in the alleviation of suffering.</P>
    <P>The issue of adoption has been raised. I advise interested parties to make contact with the Adoption Board in the first instance to ensure there is a full understanding of the requirements for adoption under Irish law in accordance with the Foreign Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that the core of the problem in regard to able orphans relates to the status of the girl child.  However, based on my experience of living in Africa, I am aware there is a tremendous problem world-wide regarding the institutional care of disabled and retarded children.  China shares that problem.  As this is the 50th anniversary of UNICEF it is an area we should seek to address collectively through institutions like UNICEF.  In offering to share some of our experiences with the Chinese regarding improving conditions in the orphanages and staff training, a critical factor, we are conscious of our history in this area, having regard, in particular, to failings in our structures.  We do not make such offers out of anti-Chinese sentiment, we make them, on behalf of the Irish people, wishing to assist children who are deprived, abused and in trouble, whether in China or other parts of the world.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht agus éisteacht leis an gcás seo.  Sílim go bhfuil fhios ag an Aire agus ag an Aire Stáit go díreach cé mar a sheasann cúrsaí.  Go dtí seo ní bliain mhaith a bhí ann don Ghaeltacht.  Dhein mé scrúdú beag ar na Meastacháin le gairid agus fuair mé amach go raibh ardú cúig faoin gcéad &mdash; nó ocht faoin gcéad go hiomlán &mdash; ar Mheastacháin <Col N="2060" /> na Roinne.  Nuair a rinne mé dian staidéar ar na Meastacháin ansin fuair mé amach go raibh ardú naoí faoin gcéad ar Ealaín agus Cultúr, cúig faoin gcéad ar Oidhreacht, go raibh ardú 15 faoin gcéad ag baint le craoladh agus scannánaíocht agus nuair a bhaineann tú Teilifís na Gaeilge as sin go bhfuil fós cúig faoin gcéad d'ardú ó thaobh scannánaíochta de.  Is ionann sin agus ardaithe suntasacha do ghnéithe den Roinn a bhaineann le ceantair taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht nó le gnéithe taobh amuigh den Ghaeilge.  Nuair a dhein mé scrúdú ar ghnéithe na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge fuair mé amach go raibh laghdú 14 faoin gcéad ar airgead na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta i mbliana.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhriseann tú é seo íos feiceann tú go bhfuil laghdú 13 faoin gcéad ar an méid airgid a cuireadh i leataobh le haghaidh tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus seacht faoin gcéad ar na scéimeanna cultúir agus sóisialta, 17 faoin gcéad don Údarás agus an t-aon mhéadú a tháinig i mbliana ná sé faoin gcéad ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Ach caithfear cuimhneamh go bhfuil bunáite an ardaithe sin ann i ngeall ar an ardú a tugadh i lár an tsamhraidh anuraidh do na comharchumainn Gaeltachta &mdash; ardú a bhí ag dul dóibh le blianta fada.  Mar sin ar gach mír Gaeltachta tá gearradh siar nuair atá méadaithe sna míreanna eile ar fad i Meastacháin na Roinne.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad lá den mhí seo d'fhógair an tAire i bpreas ráiteas a d'eisigh sé go raibh deireadh á chur aige le deontas na ndóirse agus na bhfuinneoga sa Ghaeltacht. Ba aisteach an lá a roghnaíodh leis an bhfógra seo a dhéanamh. Cad a chiallaíonn seo?  Cé bheidh thíos leis? Daoine óga na Gaeltachta, daoine ar ioncam íseal go dtarlaíonn gur leo a gcuid tithe féin, rud atá thar a bheith coitianta faoin tuath in Éirinn agus go mór mhór sa Ghaeltacht.  Tugadh faoiseamh do na sean daoine ach má tugadh féin tá gá le leasú maidir leis an gcaoi a oibríonn scéim na Roinne i dtaca leis an Scheme For Housing Aid for the Elderly agus an Essential Repairs Grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> Anois tá trí scéim do na sean daoine agus níl tada do na daoine óga.</P>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeltacht thiar leis an gcinneadh seo a shábháilfidh £200,000 san iomlán ar an Roinn.  Cinnteoidh sé go bhfuil dochar nach beag déanta don dream sin sa Ghaeltacht atá tar éis gnótha a fhorbairt agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil bunaithe ar an deontas seo a bheith ar fáil.  Déanfaidh sé dochar do thionscal na tógála sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl aon amhras faoi sin.  Agus caithfidh an tAire cuimhneamh go mbíonn ar dhuine a bheith cláraithe le go mbainfidh sé tairbhe as an scéim seo.  Agus nílimid ag caint ar dheontas mór.  Naoi gcéad punt an t-uas deontas le dóirse agus fuinneoga. Má bhí rud ar bith le déanamh leis an scéim seo bhí se thar am go leathnófaí é amach go dtí an Ghalltacht seachas é a ghearradh siar sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Muna raibh an buille sin trom go leor do phobal na Gaeltachta fuair muid scéal lá na cáináisnéise nach bhfuil i gceist oiread agus pingin rua a chaitheamh i mblianna ar Sceim na mBóithre Aise.  Fuair Contae na Gaillimhe £85,000 ón Roinn anuraidh faoin scéim seo.  Chuir Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe punt ar phunt leis an scéim, rud a chiallaigh go raibh suas le £160,000 in aghaidh na bliana leis an bhfadhb ollmhór atá againn leis na bóithre beaga áise sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá an t-airgead sin curtha ar ceal anois.  Le blianta beaga anuas bhí dul chun cinn nach beag á dhéanamh maidir leis na bóithre áise. Dúirt feidhmiúchán amháin de chuid an chomhairle chontae liom le gairid dá mbeadh an scéim ann ar feadh cúig bliana eile go mbeadh bunáite na faidhbe réitithe.  Tá caint ag an Aire maidir le scéim eile.  Faoi mar atá an scéal i gContae na Gaillimhe faoi láthair tá moill cúig bliana le hiarratais faoin scéim sin. Cé dhéanfaidh na bóithre portaigh anois?  Cé dhéanfaidh na bóithre isteach go dtí tithe nach bhfuil aon bhóthar ag dul isteach chucu cheana féin?  Is léir go bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta ag tarraingt siar as na scéimeanna seo ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tá sé gceist ag an Aire an t-airgead seo a chaitheamh ar chéibheanna.  Tá <Col N="2062" /> £80,000 d'airgead na comhairle chontae caillte anois ag an nGaeltacht ach thairis sin freisin tá fhios ag an Aire go maith nach ndéanfadh ceithre scór míle punt tada do chéibheanna mar atá le déanamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Is léir nach bhfuil an Roinn dáiríre faoin nGaeltacht mar cheantar a thuilleadh, go bhfuil siad ag tarraingt siar as an nGaeltacht agus dairíre dá mbéadh macántacht ar bith ag baint leis an gcúram anois ó thaobh an Rialtais seo d'athreoidís ainm na Roinne on Roinn Ealaín, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta go dtí an Roinn Ealaín, Cultúir agus Gaeilge agus déarfaidís le muintir na Gaeltachta nach ann doíbh níos mó chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an Rialtas seo.</P>

      <P>Maidir le Scéim na mBóithre Áise, is suim theoranta airgid a bhíodh ag mo Roinnse le caitheamh ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; rud a chiallaigh nach raibh ar a cumas ach freastal ar líon beag den iliomad iarratas ar chúnamh a fuarthas gach bliain.  Anuraidh, cur i gcás, ní rabhthas ach in ann deontais a cheadú i leith thart ar 80 bóthar nó timpeall 10 faoin gcéad den 800 iarratas nó mar sin a fuarthas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is oth liom nach bhfuil aon soláthar i Vóta mo Roinne i mbliana le haghaidh caiteachais ar bhóithre Gaeltachta.  Tá suim mhaith airgid, áfach, i.e. £3.35 million ar fáil i mbliana le caitheamh ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht. Tá an t-airgead sin in áirithe le haghaidh oibreacha a bhfeictear tosaíocht níos mó a bheith leo ná bóithre &mdash; go háirithe ar mhuiroibreacha ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta agus ar fhorbairt na comharaíochta sa Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne. Glacaim leis, áfach, go bhfuil díomá ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil deireadh curtha le Scéim na mBóithre Áise.  Dá réir sin, nuair a bheidh cúrsaí níos soiléire thart faoi lár na bliana maidir le caiteachas mo Roinne i 1996 ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht, breithneofar an scéal tuilleadh, i gcomhairle leis an Aire <Col N="2063" /> Airgeadais, féachaint an dtig linn soláthar éigin a chur ar fáil i mbliana chun bóithre áise agus bóithre portaigh sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú.</P>

      <P>Má bhíonn airgead ar fáil ag an tráth sin, is é an cur chuige a bheadh i gceist &mdash; ar mhaithe le trédhearcacht, prionsabail dhaonlathacha agus dílárú feidhmeanna &mdash; ná blocdheontas bunaithe ar dhaonra na Gaeltachta sna contaetha Gaeltachta ar leith mar chéatadán de dhaonra na Gaeltachta in iomlán a thabhairt do na comhairlí contae mar a déanadh i 1995. D'fhágfaí faoi na comhairlí contae ar leith na bóithre a roghnú i gcomhairle le stiúrthóirí áitiúla mo Roinne agus an obair a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Idir an dá linn, tá cainteanna ar siúl idir m'oifigigh féin agus oifigigh na Roinne Comhshaoil chun freastal níos fearr agus níos éifeachtaí a dhéanamh ar na riachtanais i gceist.  Beifear ag súil leis go ndéanfaidh na húdaráis áitiúla freastal ar na bóithre Gaeltachta i mbliana faoin Scéim LIS.  Beidh cainteanna againn chomh maith le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, eagrais phobail agus na comharchumainn.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na deontais feabhsúcháin tithíochta ba mhaith liom a dheimhniú láithreach don Teach seo go bhfuil na deontais sin ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht i gcónaí.  Tá deontais ar fáil d'oibreacha substaintiúla ar bhunchreatlach tithe &mdash; mar shampla díon nua, úrlár nó síleáil nua, athchóiriú ginearálta agus a leithéid. Chomh maith leis sin, tá deontais ar fáil i gcónaí do shaoráidí sláintíochta nua cosúil le huisce, séarachas, seomra folctha agus freisin chun feabhsú a dhéanamh ar shean-chóras uisce nó séarachais.</P>
      <P>Níl san athrú a rinneadh le héifeacht ó 1 Eanáir 1996 ar dheontais fheabhsúcháin tithíochta mo Roinne ach nach gcuirfear san áireamh feasta le haghaidh deontais oibreacha a bhaineann le hathnuachan: (a) fuinneoga agus dóirse seachtracha atá fabhtach, agus (b) gáitéir, fánphiobáin, éadanchláir agus tairr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> Déanfar eisceacht i gcás iarratasóirí atá os cionn 66 bliain d'aois agus gur leo féin an teach lena mbaineann an t-iarratas.</P>
    <P>Bhí gá leis na leasuithe áirithe seo chun an soláthar airgid atá ar fáil a dhíriú ar na cásanna is tuillteanaí &mdash; oibreacha substaintiúla riachtancha agus costasacha.  I 1995 bhí thart ar 900 iarratais ar dheontais fheabhsúcháin tithe agus astu sin bhain níos lú ná 300 le hoibreacha i ndáil le fuinneoga agus dóirse amháin.  Fágann sé sin go mbeidh go leor oibreacha feabhsúcháin substaintiúla á ndéanamh sa Ghaeltacht i gcónaí le cabhair deontais ó mo Roinnse.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua gur chuir an Roinn Comhshaoil deireadh ar fad leis na deontais fheabhsúcháin tithíochta a bhí ar fáil lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht &mdash; agus sa Ghaeltacht féin d'iarratasóirí nach raibh cáilithe faoi Scéim mo Roinne-se &mdash; sa bhliain 1987 ag muintir Fhianna Fáil.  Ciallaíonn sé seo go raibh agus go bhfuil buntáiste mór ag Gaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; fiú leis na leasuithe a rinneadh ó 1 Eanáir seo caite &mdash; thar an chuid eile den tír.  Bhí an deontas speisialta d'fhuinneoga agus dóirse amháin le fáil le breis is aon bhliain déag agus caithfidh go bhfuil a lán den obair is riachtanaí déanta faoin am seo.</P>
    <P>Mar chríoch, ba mhaith liom a rá gur mion-leasuithe iad na leasuithe atá deanta ar an scéim feabhsúcháin tithíochta agus táim sásta nach gcuirfidh siad isteach ró-mhór ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is féidir liom an méid seo a rá futhu &mdash; níl tada iontu i gcomparáid leis an ngearradh siar tubaisteach ar na meastacháin tithíochta do 1995 a bhí beartaithe ag comhleacaithe an Teachta Ó Cuív nuair a bhíodar ag gníomhú mar Rialtas i mí na Samhna 1994.  Dá n-éireodh leo an gearradh siar uafásach sin a dhéanamh, ní bheadh deontais fheabhsúcháin tithíochta ar bith ar fáil ó mo Roinnse ag muintir na Gaeltachta inniu.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for attending.  I raise this issue to urge the Minister to make a direct appeal to the <Col N="2065" /> owners of the Early Learning Centre company in Cork to enter into negotiations with the workers' trade union representatives to resolve the dispute there which has continued since 6 December last.  The seven workers involved have been on the picket line in severe weather conditions and made many sacrifices in pursuit of their claim for parity of esteem with similar workers in the retail sector in Cork.  The workers involved are mature and have been with the company for more than six years.</P>
      <P>As a frequent customer of the centre I can testify to the courtesy, competence and reliability of the workers involved who, by any standard, are very experienced personnel within the retail trade.  The Early Learning Centre company insists on imposing a flat rate of pay on a worker irrespective of length of service which contrasts sharply with established practice in other retail stores in Cork city.  For example, in the retail trade there is a six point incremental scale, agreed between the trade unions and IBEC.  Consequently, the workers in the Early Learning Centre earn £2 less per hour than other retail workers with similar experience in the city.  The workers involved have received only a 7p per hour increase since 1994.  This is the claim the workers wish to pursue.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the company has refused to go to the Labour Court and not accepted an invitation from the Labour Relations Commission to enter into talks.  We have sophisticated and well developed industrial relations machinery. Its objective is to prevent disputes and to resolve them if they occur.  The workers involved in this dispute have served the Early Learning Centre company extremely well.  They are responsible people who have been treated badly.  The company should respect their rights and acknowledge their contribution to its growth in Cork city over many years by entering into discussions with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had appalling weather over <Col N="2066" /> the last number of weeks, heavy flooding and below freezing temperatures. The workers braved the elements day by day, hour by hour, in pursuit of a principled objective.  I appeal to the Minister to take a personal interest in the case and to make direct contact with the managing director of the Early Learning Centre company with a view to initiating talks that would lead to an amicable solution of this dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for raising this issue and I appreciate his concern.  It is regrettable that there should be an industrial dispute in the case of the Early Learning Centre's outlet in Cork.  The Early Learning Centre is a British owned organisation which has a number of outlets in Ireland employing approximately 70 people.  The outlets are mainly concerned with the retail of educational toys for young children.  This dispute concerns the company's outlet in Cork where the trade union, Mandate, has six members.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of this dispute relates to the union's claim for the application of local rates of pay to employees in the Cork outlet.  However, the parties could not reach a mutually acceptable agreement on the issues involved and strike action was initiated by the union.</P>
      <P>The resolution of an industrial dispute is ultimately a matter for the parties directly involved.  I have made my view known that I do not regard it as appropriate for me to intervene directly in industrial disputes.  However, the State assists parties to industrial disputes by providing dispute settling services, namely, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. These services which are provided on a voluntary basis are free of charge and offer the parties the most appropriate forum for resolving their disputes when they cannot be resolved through direct negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> In relation to this dispute, I am aware that the parties took part in a conciliation conference convened by the Labour Relations Commission in December 1995.  Unfortunately it was not possible to reach agreement at the conference and the industrial action continues.  I am informed that the union, Mandate, has since requested that the dispute be referred to the Labour Court for investigation. However, the employer has declined a court investigation into the dispute.  It would appear, therefore, that the matter is deadlocked unless the parties are prepared to compromise.  As I already indicated, the services of both the commission and the court are available on a voluntary basis and it is for the parties themselves to decide whether to avail of them.  I urge the employer and the union to make every effort to resolve their differences.  I assure them the services of the commission and the court remain available to assist them to come to an agreement, thereby avoiding further disruption and hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming in to reply. Under the 1994-99 operational programme and the joint INTERREG programme, £19 million was allocated for tourism and angling measures.  This was widely welcomed at the time and there were great expectations for the development of lakes and rivers which would attract visiting anglers to the constituency. The programme was announced in 1994 by the then Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy.  I, as chairman of the county council subcommittee on tourism, in consultation with fishermen and landowners, drew up and submitted a list of lakes for consideration for funding for the purpose of scrub clearance, erection of fishing platforms, access to lakes and car parking facilities.  The programme which spans 1994 to 1999 has practically reached the <Col N="2068" /> half way stage and not one project in Monaghan has been approved.  Some projects may have been approved in the Cavan-Leitrim area and on the canal.</P>
      <P>On 17 October 1995 I tabled a parliamentary question, column 68 of the Official Report, asking the Minister for the Marine when operational programme funding would be made available for fisheries and lake development.</P>
      <P>In his reply the then Minister for the Marine said:</P>
      <P>I have already announced 29 projects, involving total expenditure of almost £2.8 million, under this measure.  The main areas of targeted development include physical instream and bank development, stock management measures, the rehabilitation of depleted sea trout fisheries and the establishment of title to the fisheries ... The Fisheries Measures of the Joint Interreg Programme provide for investment of £2.5 million over the period 1994 to 1999 to encourage further cross-Border co-operation and development in fisheries.  Projects eligible for funding under the Fisheries Measures will include research, conservation and development of inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While 29 projects have been announced under the Operational Programme for Tourism, no allocations have been announced under the INTERREG programme for cross-Border areas.  It is time various Ministers ceased to talk about their concern for the peace initiative and cross-Border economic development. We have many visitors to that region on a weekly basis.  It is time those programmes within their ministries were allowed to proceed.  That is not too much to ask.  In that area there are two dozen voluntary groups, all of which were involved in the development of their own areas with the hope of obtaining EU funding.  Most of the projects related to tourism also had a cross-Border aspect.  They were introduced in conjunction with their counterparts from across the Border.  This is an area where specific funding is provided for <Col N="2069" /> cross-Border development and cross-Border projects.  If this had been allowed to go ahead the audit committee of the EU would not come along next year and be critical of the Government and the authorities here, as they were in the North, that there was not cross-Border co-operation and cross-Border projects, that they stand alone on each side.</P>
    <P>The Finn and Blackwater rivers form part of the Border and were targeted for restocking for the purposes of game and salmon fishing.  That type of development requires patience.  Members of voluntary organisations experience many problems, especially meeting in cold halls on winter nights in an effort to draw up programmes for their region in the hope of securing funds.  It is not acceptable that since 1994 we have not received one penny.  It is making a mockery of the concern expressed by Ministers about the peace initiative on a continuing basis not to assist in every way.  I ask that those projects be approved and allowed to proceed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for raising this matter on the Adjournment as it gives me an opportunity to outline the developments taking place in our inland fisheries, particularly in the Cavan-Monaghan Region.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the importance of our inland fisheries resource a comprehensive investment programme to develop the tourism angling product totalling IR£19 million over the six year period 1994-99 has been included in the tourism operational programme.  The purpose of the tourism angling measure is to ensure that our coarse, game and sea angling is upgraded to the best international standards with a view to increasing substantially tourist angling and revenue and the creation of valuable sustainable new jobs, particularly in the more remote and disadvantaged areas where the majority of our prime fisheries are located.</P>

    <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the <Col N="2070" /> Department are charged with responsibility for the administration and implementation of the tourism angling measure.  The Central Fisheries Board is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the programme nationally, with the Department having overall responsibility for its implementation.</P>
    <P>All applications for funding are subject to detailed technical, operational, management and financial assessment by committees comprising representatives from the Department, the Central Fisheries Board, the Department of Tourism and Trade and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I have already announced 38 projects, involving total expenditure of £4.5 million, under this measure.  Last December I announced investment of almost £240,000 in the development of coarse fishing facilities on the Ballinamore Ballyconnell canal in counties Cavan and Leitrim.  This project aims to develop those sections of the canal which were reopened in 1994 and the connecting rivers and lakes in order to create a recreational fishery which will be promoted for both pleasure angling and international match events.  I hope to announce further investment of £750,000 in this project over the period to the end of the programme.</P>
    <P>Indicative investment of almost £4 million in the Border region, including the Cavan-Monaghan area, has been provided for under the tourism angling measure.  While the extent to which this indicative investment is realised will depend on the number, eligibility and quality of projects submitted, I fully expect that there will be investment in the Cavan-Monaghan region in future tranches of projects.  I understand the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board have submitted a number of projects involving the development of fisheries in that region and that preliminary surveys of a number of lakes in that region are being undertaken at present with a view to identifying further potential developments.  The closing date for receipt of projects in respect of 1996 was <Col N="2071" /> 15 September 1995.  A number of applications are being assessed at present and I hope to announce a further tranche of investment within the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Scope for significant investment in the Cavan-Monaghan area and the Border region generally also exists under the fisheries measures of the Interreg programme, 1994-99, under which £2.5 million has been made available, and the recently announced Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  The objectives of the fisheries measures of the Interreg programme are to encourage cross-Border co-operation in the fisheries sector and to assist in the development, conservation and-or protection of fisheries.  The main types of action which will be funded under the fisheries measures are research and development, marine and inland fisheries, conservation management and development of the marine and coastal environment and infrastructure <Col N="2072" /> development of fishery harbours.  I hope to announce a major investment under this programme for the Border region in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The objective of Measure 3 (D) of Sub-programme 3 of the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, 1995-99, is to release further synergies in the provision of public services through co-operation between public bodies, leading to an improvement of services in the interests of Border communities.  The main beneficiaries will be local and cross-Border communities.  My Department and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland are responsible for the implementation and administration of this measure and are engaged in discussions at present with a view to its launch and promotion.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 February 1996.</P>

      <P>The specific procedures that operate for the appointment of consultants to my Department are those detailed in the guidelines provided by the Department of Finance for the awarding of public contracts.</P>
      <P>Before awarding a consultancy contract my Department provides for competitive tendering by inviting at least three firms to tender except where clear justification exists for engaging a person with particular expertise.</P>
      <P>Such specialists are engaged without competitive tendering.  The total cost of such a contract would not usually exceed £5,000 but where it does, the sanction of the Minister for Finance is obtained.</P>
      <P>Consultancies in excess of £50,000 also require sanction from the Department of Finance, even following a competitive tender.  Consultancies are referred to the Government Contracts Committee if there is a specific need to depart from the contracting procedures just set down or where a matter of major importance with policy implications arises in regard to the contract.</P>
      <P>The procedures for the award of public contracts in my Department are similar to the procedures I have outlined for consultancy contracts.  In addition my</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> Department is bound by the various EU Directives on Public Procurement which provide for competitive tendering across member states.</P>

      <P>The definitive statistical measures of employment and unemployment are based on the annual labour force survey.  The latest results, for April 1995, showed a total of 192,000 persons as unemployed &mdash; i.e.  some 84,000 less than the live register total for last April.</P>
      <P>The labour force survey has followed a consistent methodology for measuring employment and unemployment since it was introduced in 1975.  The figure of 192,000 unemployed is based on respondents' personal assessment of their usual situation with regard to employment.</P>
      <P>The live register, on the other hand, counts the number of persons falling within the scope of the Department of Social Welfare unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit schemes and is influenced by changes in administrative rules and practices.  It does not provide a measure of the level of unemployment, as it includes, for example, persons who work on a part-time, seasonal or occasional basis and persons who consider themselves primarily committed to home duties. However, it is in its own right an important social indicator of Government income support.</P>
      <P>The main statistical use of the Live Register is as an indicator of short-term trends in unemployment, in the absence of sub-annual labour force survey estimates. However, the definitive statistical measure of unemployment is that based on the labour force survey.</P>

      <P>I approved a payment of a grant of £40,000 to Galway Corporation for the Westside Community project in 1995 under the special local development grants scheme.</P>
      <P>Priority in the allocation of grants was given to those areas not in receipt of the Urban Initiative, Leader or similar direct financial assistance.  Unfortunately, due to the limited funds available and the large number of applications, it was not possible to allocate the maximum funding requested by any organisation.  This is in no way a reflection on the merits of the particular projects.</P>
      <P>However, I should point out that financial assistance for local development is available from a range of schemes operated under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 has total funding available, through ADM, for partnership companies in 35 designated disadvantaged areas, and for other community groups, totalling £104 million approximately. The Galway City partnership are currently engaged in a consultation process in the preparation of their local development plan and this process should include Westside Community project.</P>
      <P>Support for country enterprise boards, under the programme over the same period, will amount to £18 million approximately.  Since its start up in October 1993, Galway City and Country Enterprise Board has drawn down a total of approximately £2.6 million.  In 1995 alone, £750,000 was drawn down. Support for urban and village renewal, as part of the Local Development Programme, will amount to £102 million approximately.  These programmes offer significant support for local enterprise.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos.  23 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> On 5 December 1995, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland announced plans for a major survey into the presence of the radioactive gas radon in houses in Counties Carlow and Wexford.  A total of 3,483 householders in the two counties (1,000 in Carlow and 2,483 in Wexford) were randomly selected from the register of electors, and invited to participate in the free environmental radon survey.</P>
    <P>This exercise forms part of a nationwide survey being conducted into the presence of radon in dwellings and is scheduled for completion in 1998.  The survey has been completed in eleven counties, is ongoing in six more and has now been extended to Counties Wexford and Carlow.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland have informed me that the uptake so far for the survey was 260 and 596 householders in Carlow and Wexford respectively.  Radon detectors have already been issued to the participating householders in Carlow and are currently being issued to the remaining participants in Wexford.</P>
    <P>I am continuously looking at possible ways and means of improving the public's uptake of the RPII's radon testing services and, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and the RPII, exploring all available avenues open to deal with remedial measures.  Where high radon concentrations have been identified, techniques exist which enable levels to be reduced.  In August 1995 the Department of the Environment issued an advisory booklet which is designed to inform householders about radon in buildings and to provide guidance where it has been decided to take action to reduce radon levels.</P>

      <P>In addition, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Joint Interreg Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland 1994-1999 which provides for an EU backed investment programme of £68 million on the development of the transport, energy and communications sectors over the years 1994-1999 in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Interreg Programme is the promotion, creation and development of networks of cross-border co-operation and, where relevant, the linking of these networks to wider community networks, in the context of the completion of the Single Market.</P>
      <P>Investment in energy, telecommunications and transport and especially road transport networks will facilitate access to the main strategic road networks and domestic and external markets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  25, 48, 53 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I considered very carefully the proposal for adapting Baldonnel military aerodrome as a second commercial airport for Dublin.  The conclusion I reached, having consulted with my Cabinet colleagues, was that the project would not be in the interests of the aviation sector and the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made an extensive public statement on this issue last week and I have arranged for a copy of that statement to be placed in the Dáil Library for the convenience of Deputies.  In summary, I pointed out that: Dublin airport has the capacity to cater for traffic growth for the foreseeable future; independent studies have shown that Aer Rianta's cost base is not excessive and that its landing charges are competitive; two airports for Dublin would duplicate infrastructure and facilities leading to increased costs as economies of scale <Col N="1894" /> would be lost.  Airlines would be reluctant to transfer to a secondary location because of the loss of hubbing opportunities and integrated services that such a move would entail.  The coming on stream of the Baldonnel proposal would coincide with the planned abolition of the intra-EC duty free sales from 1999 which will have adverse implications for all airports and airlines. In other words, the economics of Baldonnel would be problematic from the outset; a commercial airport at Baldonnel would impact not only on Dublin airport but on the catchment areas of Galway, Shannon, Cork and Waterford airports putting further pressure on some of these airports to survive or grow; the Baldonnel project would not come on stream until the end of the century, in the meantime the Dublin airport development programme cannot be put on hold.  It would make no sense to enhance capacity at Dublin airport and at the same time provide capacity at another location.</P>
    <P>Baldonnel aerodrome will continue to be used by the Air Corps.  The Department of Defence will now pursue further the possible use of the facilities at Baldonnel for private executive air travel.  But the Minister for Defence and I believe that there may be scope for making greater use of Baldonnel in this area of aviation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 47 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1995 the developments of note in the British nuclear industry related to plans for a rock characterisation facility or &ldquo;rock laboratory&rdquo; near Sellafield; the UK Government's proposals on privatisation and a decision not to proceed with the building of two <Col N="1896" /> new nuclear plants.  I will deal in turn with each of these developments and the Government's views and concerns in each respect.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that earlier this month contrary to reports in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, I participated in a public inquiry in Cumbria to object to preliminary plans by UK NIREX Ltd. to build a deep underground radioactive waste dump near Sellafield, virtually at the edge of the Irish Sea.  UK NIREX Ltd. had applied for planning permission to Cumbria County Council to build a rock laboratory to investigate the geology and hydrogeology of the area.</P>
    <P>My Department expressed grave concerns about that plan to Cumbria County Council.  The council refused planning permission to NIREX in December 1994.  However, NIREX appealed the decision to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment and he subsequently decided to hold a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>While NIREX assert that this rock laboratory is purely for research, I see it as a first step, and indeed a significant financial pre-commitment, to an eventual underground structure at Sellafield for the permanent storage of domestic and foreign radioactive waste.  My personal participation in the inquiry, along with a team of legal and technical experts, is evidence of the Government's strong opposition to any extension to existing facilities around the Sellafield complex and the serious concern at the possibility that such a development would have the potential to contaminate the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for copies of my full oral submission to the inquiry to be placed in the Dáil Library.  I have written personally to the EU Commissioner responsible for nuclear safety and the environment on the matter and copies of my submission have also been sent formally to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for Trade and Industry.</P>
    <P>On completion of the public inquiry in February 1996, the Inspector will <Col N="1897" /> begin to draw up a report and make recommendations to the UK Secretary of State who will ultimately decide on the planning application for the rock laboratory.  I understand that the inspector's report will be ready towards the end of the year.  I want to assure the House that the Government will spare no effort to ensure that no new storage or disposal site for nuclear waste materials is built at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Of further concern during 1995 was the UK's plans for privatisation of its nuclear power stations.  The two nuclear generating companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, are being merged and privatised.  However, magnox stations, such as those at Sellafield and Wylfa, will remain in public ownership under a new Government-owned company which will ultimately be integrated with BNFL.  I believe this is being done, not for safety reasons, but for financial reasons due to the high cost of decommissioning these reactors.</P>
    <P>I continue to have very serious concerns about the age, safety and reliability of these magnox reactors, and I have made my views known to the UK Minister for Trade and Energy and the Secretary of State for the Environment. I have sought the early closure and dismantling of these reactors and I have asked the UK authorities to ensure that nuclear operators take the necessary steps to prevent possible future incidents, like the one in Wylfa in 1993. These ageing monsters have literally passed their `best sell by date'.</P>
    <P>The UK White Paper on Privatisation emphasised that there is no case for State intervention or public funds for the construction of new nuclear plants. I welcome therefore the recent decision by Nuclear Electric to scrap the planned construction of new nuclear plants, one at Sizewell in Sussex and the other at Hinkley Point, near the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I hope that this decision signifies a shift away from the nuclear option towards the use of safer fuels for power generation in Britain.  The sale of the British nuclear industry is due to take place before the summer once the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> Nuclear Installations Inspectorate has completed its regulatory duties in the relicensing of nuclear plants.</P>

      <P>Of the six applicants in the competition for the right to become Ireland's second mobile operator, four consortia or their members have sought additional information on the reasons underlying the recommendation that Esat Digifone be awarded the GSM licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Announcing the opening of the GSM competition in March of last year, I emphasised that my objective was to improve the quality and availability of mobile services throughout the country with the advent of competition and consumer choice.  I was determined to select a winner whose application displayed technical skill and financial credibility as well as an ability to develop the market aggressively with the introduction of competitive tariffing.  These were the selection criteria which held the highest priority and the heaviest weighting during the evaluation of applications.  Esat Digifone won the GSM competition because this consortium had both the entrepreneurial flair, the youthful energy and the determination to compete against the best and come out on top.  Across the range of selection criteria, Esat Digifone proved itself the best all-rounder.  This is why I had no hesitation in accepting the recommendation of my consultants and in nominating Esat Digifone as the winner.  It must be encouraging to other comparable <Col N="1899" /> companies and entrepreneurs in this country that it is possible to seize competitive opportunities and win, once the process is fair and the applicants correctly assess what is required.</P>
    <P>As I have emphasised on numerous occasions before, I am fully satisfied that the evaluation was conducted in a fair and objective manner throughout. Furthermore, the thoroughness of the comparative approach adopted by the evaluators left no question as to the clear-cut result contained in the consultants' report, who acted as guarantors of objectivity during the entire process.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is already aware that I have made commitments to each of the applicants with regard to the confidentiality of their applications.  Four of the six applicants requested and all were given assurances that the information in their bids would be kept confidential on a permanent basis.  To date, this has constrained me from releasing details of the comparative evaluation of the applications, since I believe that such disclosure must involve a serious breach of confidence on my part and would lead to disclosure of information essential to protect the winner's interests.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, following representations from some of the unsuccessful applicants, I also recognise that an understanding of how their applications were assessed could assist consortia in preparing applications for similar competitions in the future. Consequently the question of whether it is possible to release additional information to the unsuccessful applicants without breaching confidentiality is currently under active consideration.  Pending a final decision on this matter, I am not willing to release any further details on the evaluation at this point.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 29, 34 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the GSM competition was first launched it included an &ldquo;auction&rdquo; element as the fourth selection criterion in descending order of priority ranking below the tariff deal for consumers and other important criteria.  The imposition of a fee on Eircell was not envisaged and bidders would have borne this in mind when determining the amount offered.  It is public knowledge that the EU Commission raised legal arguments against this aspect of the competition. After taking the advice of the Attorney General's Office my Department entered discussions with the Commission which led to a modification of the fee requirement.  The thrust of the Commission's argument was that Eircell would have to pay a fee closely related to that to be imposed on the new operator. Accordingly a cap of £15 million was put on the licence fee for the new operator in the context that Eircell would pay £10 million.  This significantly <Col N="1901" /> changed the bidding environment.  The amounts were determined as not being onerous on operators and preserving a competitive framework for tariffs and service quality.  This approach was approved by the European Commission. I was also fully satisfied with this solution as was the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is public knowledge that very high fees were taken in a limited number of countries from both the new and existing operators but there are numerous other countries where fees, if they exist at all, are only to cover administration costs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the study undertaken by Professor Rodney Thom referred to by Deputy Keogh, I should say that I have not seen the study although I am aware of some reports of its conclusions in the media.  In this context I would like to point out that there is no true economic value of a licence to enter a duopoly market where both operators must pay a similar fee when they can fix their charges accordingly.  Where a fee is levied on both operators, it is the consumer that pays in the form of higher tariffs because both operators face substantially higher costs arising from the fee.  I therefore reject the speculation in the Deputies' questions that I could have extracted substantial amounts from existing and potential mobile phone users.  I simply was not prepared to impose a higher fee at the expense of higher costs and tariffs.</P>
    <P>I should say in response to Deputy O'Donnell's question that I have not said that the GSM licence was worth more than £15 million.  I can confirm now however that reducing the cost of mobile phone calls was of primary concern in selecting the second GSM operator. My declared objective throughout the GSM competition process was to secure a new operator who would have a progressive approach to market development, a commitment to a high quality nationwide service and an innovative approach to tariffs.  I am confident that in selecting Esat Digifone to become the new operator that this <Col N="1902" /> objective will be achieved by a consortium featuring a new Irish company as a lead member having won an open competition under a fair and rigorous process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 39 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The process of identifying and assessing a mineral deposit is a complex one involving a number of stages.  After the initial discovery it is necessary to carry out a great deal of further work to establish that it is commerically and technically feasible to mine and process it in ways consistent with environmental protection and planning requirements, and to develop detailed plans to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1992 technical report referred to <Col N="1903" /> by the Deputy was only a step along the way.  It did include an estimate of the resources in the deposit and merely showed that it was likely to be physically possible to extract a substantial tonnage of gypsum.  It also showed that the Glangevlin deposit was sufficiently economically attractive to warrant further more detailed exploration work.</P>
    <P>This is a long way from concluding that it was in fact a viable project.  The further work to confirm this needs a prospecting licence.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the prospecting licence is to give the holder the rights which he needs to allow him and my Department assess the deposit in detail. This would involve testing it for both quality and quantity.  If these proved to be satisfactory there would then need to be tests to identify whether there were any hazards or difficulties peculiar to the deposit which would have implications for the development of a mine.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal procedures the two applications received for a prospecting licence covering the gypsum deposit known to exist at Glangevlin were considered initially on the basis of the technical proposals put forward by the applicants.  One of the technical proposals was clearly superior to the other and as the applicant was suitable as regards technical competence, financial ability to carry out the work programme and character there was no reason to refuse to grant the licence.</P>
    <P>In the normal course a prospecting licence is issued for an initial six year term as there is usually less certainty of the existence of a deposit than exists in this case.  Because a good deal is already known about the Glangevlin deposit, the licence is being issued for only two years in this case and the work programme must be rigorously adhered to by the licence holder.  At the end of the two year period the licence holder will, on the basis of the approved work programme, have determined the feasibility or otherwise of developing the deposit for mineral extraction and the most <Col N="1904" /> appropriate way that it can be developed if it seems to be feasible.</P>
    <P>A renewal of the licence will be granted for a further two years on the basis that the licence holder will proceed with a full feasibility study and environmental impact study during that time should the results of the exploration warrant it.  At the end of the second period the licence holder should be in a position to decide whether or not to make application for a State mining facility, planning permission, an integrated pollution control licence and other required permits.</P>
    <P>I would stress that, if the exploration shows that the gypsum deposit at Glangevlin is of a quality and quantity which would make commercial mining possible, my intention is that it should be moved to a development stage as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The results of the exploration will be available to the technical experts in my Department and they have the necessary expertise to evaluate these results independently of the licence holder and form an expert opinion on the feasibility of its commercial development.</P>
    <P>Crude gypsum is a low value product with only a limited market and further processing will be an essential part of any development here.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the development of the deposit, if it proves to be commercial, will be by private capital and capital will always seek the maximum reward.  While I would be anxious that local employment should be maximised, this will be a matter for the ultimate developer and I will have no control over whether he wishes to process it on site, within the State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The market for gypsum products is seeing increasing imports and considerable price competition resulting in falls of over 30 per cent in the price for some major product lines since 1990.  In such circumstances the developer will be very anxious to ensure that the substantial development costs incurred in exploring the deposit and developing it as a working mine will not be lost.  The developer <Col N="1905" /> will, therefore, process the gypsum at whatever location will give the greatest guarantee of a return on investment. However, transport costs are a significant element in the cost of bulk products such as gypsum rock and this provides an incentive for processing as close as possible to any mine site.</P>
    <P>Should the licence holder feel, at any stage during the validity of the prospecting licence, that the indications are so unfavourable as to show that the development of a mine would not be commercially viable, the licence may be surrendered without any additional expense being incurred.</P>
    <P>In any case my officials will closely monitor work on this licence.  In the event that the prospecting licence holder fails to comply with the agreed terms attaching to the licence I will revoke the licence.  I would stress, however, that I have every expectation that the prospecting licence holder will comply fully with the conditions attaching to it.</P>
    <P>In the event of the licence being surrendered or revoked, I will then decide, having regard to the technical reports and other relevant information which will be available to my Department, whether to offer the licence to another suitable party or parties, or to remove it from offer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware from what I have siad that, in the first instance, there can, at this stage, be no guarantee of the development of a mine at Glangevlin. If, however, the deposit is proved to be of commercial quality it will be at least four years before the prospecting licence holder can be expected to commence development.  Development will not be able to commence without the required planning permission and other permits being granted for the project.</P>

      <P>The person named has applied to my Department for a passenger licence to provide a late night bus service between South Main Street and the Hilltop Hotel, Youghal.  As was indicated previously to the Deputy, consideration of this application is complicated by the fact that another bus operator is already licensed to provide a service on the route in question.  Furthermore, my Department has also received a number of applications from other bus operators in respect of the same route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, following a thorough reappraisal of the case, I have decided in principle that there are good grounds for allowing additional operators to provide late night services on the route in question on a trial basis for a period of <Col N="1907" /> six months.  The exact details of the additional services to be licensed, including the number and identity of the operators, are being worked out and I hope to be in touch with the Deputy very shortly in this regard.  There will be a review at the end of the trial period to assess the viability of the new arrangements, including their impact on the existing licensed service.  The experience of the Garda as regards the licensees' compliance with traffic and parking regulations will be an important factor in my Department's review of the experiment.</P>

      <P>Duty Free sales to travellers between member states of the European Union are due to be abolished with effect from 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>Duty free retailing is a significant source of revenue for Aer Rianta and for the privately owned regional airports. This has helped to keep basic charges to airlines at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports at their present levels since April 1987 and discounts to be given on these charges.  Duty free revenues are also important for the airlines themselves and for the shipping companies.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is mounting a campaign for the retention of duty free retailing after July 1999.  I share its concern and that of the airlines.  I will be bringing this issue to the attention of the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for the European Monetary Union process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.</P>
      <P>The regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.  I should also point out that since the establishment of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, all member state airlines are free to operate on any international route within the European Economic area without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department in 1993 introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is <Col N="1909" /> designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
    <P>So far operating contracts have been awarded for Kerry/Dublin and Galway/Dublin routes.  This programme applies to routes within Ireland only. International services should be operated on a fully commercial basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airports during 1993 and 1995.  In the case of Galway Airport these amounted to £179,000 in 1993 and £98,000 in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of transatlantic air services between Ireland and the US is governed by the Ireland/US Air Transport Agreement.  In accordance with the terms of that agreement, designated airlines of both countries are free to operate air services on specified routes between the two countries.  There are no limitations on capacity offered by airlines on such services and airlines are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to scheduled air services, Irish airlines currently enjoy access rights to four US points &mdash; New York, <Col N="1910" /> Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles &mdash; while US airlines may serve Ireland from any US point.</P>
    <P>In relation to charter services, both Irish and US airlines can operate from any point in the US to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Both scheduled and charter services must operate in conformity with current policy in relation to Shannon which is that airlines must maintain the same level of direct flights to Shannon as to Dublin.  However, in relation to charter services to Cork or Connaught Regional Airport, there is no requirement to serve Shannon.</P>
    <P>Currently Ireland has services from New York and Boston in the North East provided by Aer Lingus and from Atlanta in the South by Delta.  This year Aer Lingus will introduce a new year round direct service between Chicago and Ireland and will significantly increase capacity on the Boston and New York services.  They are also expanding the New York-Belfast links, developed in 1995.</P>
    <P>Overall Aer Lingus increased capacity on its transatlantic services by 10 per cent in 1995 and will further increase capacity by 13 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>I should of course also mention that Aeroflot has been granted traffic rights between Shannon and Chicago, Washington, Miami and Tampa and operates weekly services on all these routes.</P>
    <P>It is a matter in the first instance for Irish and US airlines to decide whether to operate services between US and Ireland based on their own commercial judgment but of course every opportunity is taken to encourage airlines to extend existing services and commence new services to Ireland.  In this regard my Department from time to time approaches US airlines regarding opportunities for new Ireland/US services as do other state agencies.  Both myself and my officials have had meetings in recent months with US based aviation interests who are seriously examining the possibility of starting up new transatlantic services to Ireland and they have been given every encouragement in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> I am aware that there is concern in some quarters about insufficient capacity on Ireland-US services to meet growing demand.  In particular concern is expressed about the lack of direct scheduled services from the regions not currently served on a direct basis.  It is believed that such services would increase the number of US visitors from those regions and would also reduce the number of US visitors currently arriving in Ireland via indirect routes such as over London.</P>
    <P>In order to have an up-to-date assessment of all the relevant factors, myself and my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, Minister for Tourism and Trade, last December set up a steering group comprised of senior officials from both Departments, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte to research in detail the possibilities for improving and increasing access from the US to Ireland.  This group is looking at all relevant issues including an analysis of the current market, the origin of existing tourists, the best prospective US regions to target for increasing the number of tourists, the possibilities of improving access and increasing services from these markets. The group will also consider marketing tools to improve the effectiveness of existing capacity such as code-sharing, improved interlining arrangements, and also appropriateness of existing advertising and marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>Work by this group is well in hands and I expect to have a report within the next ten days.  I will then decide on the appropriate follow up steps to take, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  This is likely to include approaches to selected US airlines in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, sets out the Government's commitment to seeking an amendment and updating of Euratom. This is being pursued in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which will consider amendments to the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1994, the European Council meeting at Corfu established a reflection group to prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 1996.  The reflection group <Col N="1913" /> presented its report to the EU Heads of State and Government in December 1995.  Ireland succeeded in having a reference to strengthening the nuclear safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty included in the report.</P>
    <P>Any amendment to the Euratom Treaty will require the unanimous agreement of all member states.  Such unanimity will be difficult to achieve given the opposition of certain member states to any review of Euratom and given the significant dependence of almost half the member states on the use of nuclear power for electricity generation and security of energy supply. Also, while Ireland has rejected the nuclear option, some member states see it as a cheap and environmentally friendly way of generating electricity, particularly in the context of CO2 abatement strategy.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the obvious institutional and substantive difficulties facing us in seeking to have the Euratom Treaty amended, I will continue the effort to have the Government's concerns about the safety of nuclear power taken seriously by our European Union partners with a view to having improvements to the health and safety provisions of Euratom debated by the Intergovernmental Conference.  I will also continue to take all practical steps in relevant international fora to highlight our concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most substantial degree of progress towards making public transport fleets more accessible to wheelchair users has <Col N="1915" /> been achieved by Iarnród Éireann.  All push-pull trains on outer suburban services are accessible and have a dedicated wheelchair area.  All Dart units offer full wheelchair access and this is also the case with all of the new Arrow railcars, which also have accessible toilets.  Approximately 70 per cent of Intercity trains are wheelchair accessible with dedicated spaces for disabled customers in the dining cars.  The remaining 30 per cent are basically accessible and spaces can be made available for wheelchair users by arrangement. Looking to the future, all of the new trains for the Dublin/Belfast service will have dedicated spaces for wheelchair users and on-board accessible toilets.  Furthermore, it is now company policy that all new carriages should be accessible to the mobility impaired and that in addition, all new Intercity trains should have wheelchair accessible toilets.  The new Light Rapid Transit vehicles for Dublin will also be directly accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
      <P>Catering for the requirements of wheelchair users poses major technical, operational and financial challenges for road passenger operators.  The latest generation of buses in use by both Bus Eireann and Bus Átha Cliath incorporate an improved level of accessibility including, in the case of new vehicles on urban services, features recommended by the UK-based Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. However, neither company uses any vehicles which are fully accessible to wheelchair-bound customers for the provision of services for the general public.  This is primarily because of the difficulty of acquiring technically proven, affordable and cost-effective accessible vehicles in current market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee to which the Deputy refers is currently assessing the pilot Omnilink accessible minibus project which was operated by Bus Átha Cliath in the city centre during the last half of 1995.  It is envisaged that on completion of that assessment and in the light of the experience gained from the pilot project, the Committee <Col N="1916" /> will consider what recommendations can usefully be made to promote a greater degree of accessibility on public transport fleets.  Meanwhile, the CIE companies are of course aware that it is my policy that they should afford a high priority to accessibility criteria in their ongoing fleet replacement programmes.</P>

      <P>Apart from the proposed extension of the Ballymun light rail line to Dublin Airport, DTI also recommended that a conventional rail link, but not necessarily a DART type system, from Dublin Airport to the Dublin-Belfast railway line should be evaluated as a longer term option.

      <P>The EU Commission are satisfied &mdash; on the basis of the cost benefit analysis &mdash; that the proposed station will be of benefit to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>It was on the basis of this satisfaction that they agreed &mdash; to make available up to 26 million ECU's in structural funding &mdash; under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme &mdash; for the project.</P>
      <P>The cost benefit analysis was conducted by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) &mdash; an independent London based consultancy firm.  It concluded that in monetary terms alone a net benefit of around £11 million &mdash; in 1993 prices &mdash; would accrue.  In addition, the station will confer diversity and security of supply benefits, which, of course, cannot be quantified in financial terms.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously to the House, the Government approved the holding of a competition to build, own, operate the proposed peat station.</P>
      <P>The competition process requires the preparation of an extensive portfolio of documentation by the ESB.  Work on the preparation of this documentation is proceeding with a view to getting the competition up and running as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this will be the first competition of its kind run in this country, and, because it is taking place at a time of flux in the <Col N="1918" /> electricity industry &mdash; with the restructuring of the Irish electricity industry and the preparation of the draft EU Electricity Directive &mdash; the competition process is a complex one.  In order to ensure a successful outcome to the competition and the resultant benefits, it is vital to ensure that all of the necessary preparatory work is satisfactorily completed.</P>
    <P>The ESB is fully aware of the need to complete this competition as quickly as possible and I am confident that the pre-qualification process will be announced very soon.</P>

      <P>The core <Col N="1919" /> light rail network recommended by DTI provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely via the Harcourt Street line and Ballymun at an estimated cost of £300 million in 1993 prices.  The Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provides for a total expenditure of £200 million, 1994 prices on light rail during the period, £175 million of which is proposed to be EU-cofinanced.  The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
      <P>In late 1993 a high level project team comprising CIE personnel and consultants analysed a range of possible options derived from the core light rail network which could be implemented within the £200 million allocation for light rail.  These options were examined against a number of criteria including their contribution to DTI objectives, financial performance, congestion alleviation, environmental impact and ease of construction.  The objective technical recommendation of the project team was that priority should be given to the construction of links to Tallaght and Dundrum.</P>
      <P>I launched a public consultation programme on the planned light rail links to Dundrum and Tallaght on 12 December 1995 following the conclusion of detailed work undertaken by the project team to identify the preferred technical route alignments for both links.  No final decisions will be taken on the precise routes until the public consultation is completed, a public inquiry has been held later this year and EU approval procedures have been completed.</P>
      <P>The target is to get phase 1 of the core light rail network in operation by the year 2000.  Phase 2 is planned to follow on immediately afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE has indicated that the extension of the Dundrum route as far as the Sandyford Industrial Estate would cost in the region of £15 million.  However any such additional expenditure would have to be 100 per cent financed from national resources as there is no matching EU assistance available for LRT <Col N="1920" /> beyond that specified in the Operational Programme for Transport.</P>

    <P>The granting of an approval for the expansion of the Poolbeg Station would not be contrary to any existing EU competition legislation.

While for practical reasons it is not possible to have such a process for the completion of the Poolbeg project, it is the Government's intention that the building, ownership and operation of all other new and replacement capacity, including the proposed new 120MW Peat Generating Station, will from now on be on the basis of a fully open competitive process.</P>

    <P>The criteria used in approving the <Col N="1926" /> scrappage plants were as follows: (1) Approval was confined to those engaged in the business of scrapping vehicles on a large scale and had fixed crushing equipment in place for that purpose; and (2) Approvals had regard to the geographical location of the plants for the convenience of the customers who would be seeking scrappage facilities under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of tenders did not arise. As regards the provision for recycling spare parts, this is not an issue in the operation of the scheme.  From a revenue point of view, there is no objection to or cognisance of the recovery of certain minor parts from vehicles intended for scrapping.  The conditions for repayment are met once the substantial vehicle is destroyed i.e. the engine and chassis.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department's health promotion unit has granted funding over the past number of years to the Irish Diabetic Association for diabetes awareness and education initiatives aimed at the general public.</P>
      <P>With regard to research, a significant part of the funding available for research is channelled through the Health Research Board.  Each research proposal is judged on its scientific and medical merits and funding is granted, on the basis of available resources, to those projects which fulfil these criteria and which would be considered to be of overall benefit.  This would also be the most appropriate forum for the submission of any research projects on diabetes.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a signatory to the St. Vincent Declaration, an initiative of the World Health Organisation, which has set targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.  In response to this Declaration a Diabetic Action Group, with representation from professional groups and voluntary organisations, including the Irish Diabetic Association has been established.  Any recommendations from the Action Group will receive detailed consideration.</P>

    <P>With reference to the individual case mentioned by the Deputy it would not be appropriate for me to give details of this person's case in my response.  I will communicate the details of the case separately to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Information made available to my Department in early 1995 indicated that a total of around 1,500 persons with a mental handicap nationally were awaiting placement in day services including workshops.  This figure does not however take account of the additional 500 places which were provided in 1995.  More detailed information will become available from the National Mental Handicap Database over the coming months.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that additional funding of £10 million has been made available in 1996 for services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>This includes £6 million revenue funding of which £3 million is being provided to meet the 1996 cost of <Col N="1929" /> additional services which were put in place in 1995 and which as I have already stated included over 500 day places.</P>
    <P>The remaining £3 million revenue funding provided in 1996 will facilitate the provision of an additional 66 residential-respite places and 265 day care places.</P>
    <P>In addition, £4 million capital funding is being provided of which £2 million will be used to support general service developments and £2 million to develop and improve the quality of training facilities under the European Regional Development Fund assisted programme.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £44.58 million invested in the services in the period 1990-95 has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services.  However, I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of all those awaiting services.  The Government is committed under both the Health Strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of services as resources become available.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention, on completion of the validation process in respect of the National Mental Handicap Database later this year, to initiate a review of the implementation of both policy documents <i>Needs and Abilities</i> and <i>Services to Persons with Autism</i> with a view to preparing an overall medium term development plan for the services.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 8 of 26 October 1995, in which I outlined the position regarding projects which benefited from national lottery funding from the former non-statutory National Heritage Council in 1994 and 1995 (to 9 July 1995).</P>
      <P>I also explained in that reply that the new Heritage Council, which I appointed on 10 July 1995 under the Heritage Act, 1995, is an autonomous statutory body whose functions include powers to provide assistance (including financial assistance) and advice to persons and bodies in matters relating to its functions.  A detailed list of any grants approved or paid by the statutory Heritage Council in 1995 and 1996 will be published in its annual reports for those years.</P>

In the circumstances it is not considered a priority at this time to direct resources towards another new organisation.  Participation in Planta Europa will be kept under review.

      <P>EU and national environmental standards require upgraded waste-water treatment for Dublin and other major sewage discharges by the end of the year 2000.  Dublin Corporation has been planning the necessary works for its area.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the preliminary report for the provision of treatment facilities, the corporation carried out a market testing exercise in 1995 to assess the cost implications of different implementation scenarios.  This indicated that the most cost-effective method of implementation would be to seek tenders for construction on a Design and Build (DB) basis.  My Department approved in November 1995 the preparation of the necessary contract documents and awaits submission of these by the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approval also issued to Dublin Corporation in November 1995 to have <Col N="1934" /> detailed proposals developed on a DB basis for management of sewage sludge at Ringsend so as to allow marine dumping of this waste to be terminated by 1998.</P>
    <P>Both proposals will require the preparation of environmental impact statements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Both schemes do not have a suitable source of water supply at present and their development is contingent on the prior construction of the Listowel Stage IV and Brosna regional water supply schemes.  Having regard to the existing level of commitments under the public <Col N="1935" /> water and sewerage schemes programme. I cannot say when it may be possible to advance these public schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested is set out in the following table.  The waiting periods stated are the longest which apply at the individual centres.  Many applicants, however, in particular those who indicate a need for an early test for reasons such as employment or travel abroad, are tested more quickly.  Last month, for example, 52 per cent of those who applied for an early test were tested within five weeks and all such applicants were tested within eight weeks of applying.</P>
      <P>Waiting periods are longer in winter because the hours available for testing reduce due to early darkness.  Testing output will increase significantly, and waiting times should be reduced from end February onwards, with the onset of brighter evenings.  In order to accelerate and consolidate the reduction in waiting times, I arranged for the recruitment and training of seven additional testers late last year.  These additional testers are now operational and should make a significant contribution to reducing the arrears over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is one of four schools in the parish. Efforts in recent years to amalgamate these schools have been unsuccessful, due mainly to local opposition.

The correspondence indicated that consultations with all local interested parties would be arranged.</P>

Among the changes put in train are: in 1993 a programme of training in relation to asylum specially designed for immigration officers was initiated.  The course was run in conjuction with the UNHCR.  Its aim was to broaden the understanding of the concept of political asylum and Ireland's obligations under the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of asylum seekers.  It also aimed to train immigration officers on how to establish if a person was an asylum seeker as well as providing advice on interviewing such persons.</P>

      <P>The latest data published by the Central Statistics Office on industrial earnings show average industrial gross earnings in March 1995 were £306.40 per week for males and £194.74 per week for females.  The overall average was £267.52 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data is not available on average take home pay as an individual's nett earnings depend on their family and other circumstances.  It is estimated, however, that relatively few people wholly dependent on the weekly social welfare payments, such as unemployment benefit or assistance, disability benefit or invalidity pension, are in receipt of social welfare payments in excess of 75 per cent of pay, <Col N="1945" /> whether it be gross or nett.  Such instances would be confined to couples with large families.</P>
    <P>For example, a couple on long-term unemployment assistance with six children are entitled to a maximum of £179.20 per week which represents about 58 per cent of average male gross industrial earnings.  Families of that size or greater comprise fewer than 2 per cent of those in receipt of weekly unemployment payments from my Department.</P>

      <P>An application under REPS was received by my Department from the person concerned. Part of the lands in question are in a proposed Natural Heritage Area (NHA).  One of the conditions of REPS is that an applicant who has lands in a proposed NHA must sign an undertaking to comply with the requirements set out by the Department of the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht concerning NHA sites.  The applicant in question has refused to sign this undertaking and, therefore, the application cannot be processed.</P>

      <P>The question of modernisation and expansion of the postal services is a matter for the board and management of An Post in the first instance.  The Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, specifically provides that the company shall have the power to do anything which appears to it to be requisite, advantageous or incidental to, or which appears to it to facilitate, either directly or indirectly, the performance by it of its functions as specified in the Act or in its memorandum of association and is not inconsistent with any enactment for the time being in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment of An Post to the modernisation and expansion of services is evidence by the adoption by the board of the recommendations contained in the recent review of An Post carried out on behalf of the company by independent consultants Price Water-house. As I indicated to the House on 28 June 1995, the review was instigated at my request and was to include an examination of the role, methods of operation and effectiveness of An Post. The review contains many constructive recommendations aimed at further developing the company's operations, standards and range of services and is seen as an excellent platform from which An Post can effectively deal with <Col N="1950" /> the challenges that lie ahead, especially those stemming from the present EU proposals for liberalisation of the postal sector.  As Minister with responsibility for An Post, I am fully supportive of their efforts in this regard.</P>

      <P>The issue of poverty is high on the agendas of both my Department and the Irish Energy Centre, and a number of initiatives have been developed to address the problems, in so far as they fall within our remit.</P>
      <P>Energy Action itself is grant supported by the Irish Energy Centre, on my Department's behalf, and I can confirm that support of £125,000, (up from £45,000 in 1995), will be made available to the group in 1996.  I can also confirm that an allocation of £80,000 has been made available to grant support and train four similar groups, in various parts of the country.  These groups will operate an energy conservation service, free of charge, for the elderly and those on low incomes, similar to that of Energy Action.  The service will consist of attic insulation, draught proofing, the fitting of lagging jackets and energy efficient light bulbs.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently working with the Department of the Environment to develop appropriate guidelines which will be issued to all local authorities and used in the development of local energy conservation programmes for local authority dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Naval Service currently has a total of seven vessels which are deployed in the most efficient manner on fishery protection duties.  The Naval Service fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the new arrangements on fishery control measures effective from 1 January 1996, including the entry-exist reporting system which requires prior notification by all large fishing vessels entering and leaving the Irish Box, I am committed to ensuring that the fishery surveillance function is strengthened and that sufficient resources are in place to deal effectively with any additional <Col N="1958" /> demands arising under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Enhancement of the protection capability is planned under the new EU five year financial aid package for fisheries surveillance.  The overall package was agreed at the Fisheries Council in October 1995.  Under the package, Ireland will receive financial support for a significant programme of capital investment in fishery surveillance equipment and in this regard Ireland will attract a higher rate of EU aid than other member states.  Additionally, in recognition of Ireland's very heavy surveillance costs, a sum of £12 million is to be made available over the period 1996 to 2000 to Ireland to fund operational needs of the protection service. Ireland is the only member state which will receive such support.</P>
    <P>I will be putting a package of specific spending proposals for 1996 and future years to Government shortly and will commence negotiations with the Commission with the objective of securing the level of capital and operational resources identified as necessary to maximise our fishery surveillance programmes. The question of an additional ship for the Naval Service is being considered as one of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The Commission has to decide on the 1996 programme before the end of March and at that stage I should be in a position to outline to the House the specifics involved, the make-up of the proposals, the level of support and the matching funds which Ireland will have to put up.</P>

This requiment is enforced by the regional fisheries board in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Upper Shannon Trout and Coarse Fish Development Society checks to ensure that anglers hold an appropriate share certificate have been carried out by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board since 1994.</P>
      <P>The statutory responsibility for enforcement rests with the fisheries boards.  The board has assured me in this instance that it is fully aware of its responsibilities to enforce the law in an equitable and reasonable manner and staff are trained in appropriate procedures for carring out the checks in question.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Council last October agreed a financial package of some £168 million to aid further investment by <Col N="1960" /> member states in fisheries surveillance over the next five years.  The EU package will support national investment by member states at varying rates of aid depending on the nature of the projects.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, Council agreed to ring fence a unique budget line within the overall envelope of some £12 million towards the operating costs of Irish surveillance over the five years.  Varying rates will apply here also but could for some projects be up to 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the overall capital budget of £156 million Ireland will also benefit from a higher rate of aid than the 35 per cent &mdash; 50 per cent range available to other member states.</P>
      <P>An indicative programme of expenditure proposals for 1996 and future years has been forwarded to the Commission. I will be putting specific proposals to Government very shortly with a view to getting approval to begin substantive negotiations with the Commission on the programme details.  My objective is to secure the maximum EU rates of aid for the capital and operating resources identified as necessary to further enhance our fisheries surveillance programmes.</P>
