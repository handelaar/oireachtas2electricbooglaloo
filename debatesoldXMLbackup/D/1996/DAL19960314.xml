      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4, Motion re Revised Estimates for the Public Services; No. 10, Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996; No. 11, Metrology Bill, 1996, and No. 12, Statements on &ldquo;Developing a Policy for Women's Health&rdquo;.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 4 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith and (2) the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>I know the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to extend sympathy to the parents and community of Dunblane in Scotland.  In recent weeks our minds have correctly been exercised by many past tragedies involving young children and debates have taken place in the House and in the media.  Everyone was shocked by what they saw on television last night, read in this morning's papers and heard on the radio <Col N="310" /> about the death of these 16 young children and their teacher.  The other children in that class and the wider community of Dunblane will never recover from this tragedy.</P>
      <P>One of the marks of civilisation is people's ability to reach out to other communities during times of tragedy, and we wish to do that on this occasion. The darker side of human nature is constantly with us and it was present in an unfathomable way in this case.  One could think about it forever but one would never reach a conclusion as the darker side of nature lies submerged until we are suddently forced to confront it, as happened in this case.  I know I speak for everyone in extending sympathy to the parents of these children, the teachers in the school and the wider community.  Our thoughts are with them at this traumatic time.</P>

      <P>The horrific tragedy in Dunblane yesterday is beyond description and the sympathy of the Irish people goes out to this small community which will probably never recover from it.  The way in which 16 children and their teacher were cruelly mown down is beyond description and words cannot fully express the sympathy we feel for the community of that small town and the wider community.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach issued a statement on behalf of the Irish people. We have been in contact with the Secretary of State for Scotland and I intend to contact my friend the Labour MP, George Robertson, to convey our deepest sympathy to him and the people of Scotland on this tragedy.  The general public and, in particular, the parents of school children were horrified by this tragedy and our sympathy goes out to the families of the victims and the people of Scotland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share in the <Col N="311" /> words of sympathy expressed by the Tánaiste and Deputy Mary O'Rourke. This was an unspeakable tragedy and words seem pointless but we all share in the sympathy extended to the families and small community of Dunblane. There is no point in adding further words as there is nothing we can do and unfortunately there is no way such a tragedy can be avoided.  I hope we remember that this matter is above politics. All we can do is express our sympathy on this tragedy.</P>

      <P>I hope the White Paper on Education will take into account the appeals for a review of security in schools.  My feelings on this tragedy are very poignant as I attended a one teacher school in Balbriggan which had 16 pupils.  In extending our sympathy to the people of Dunblane and Scotland we should look at the security provided for schoolchildren and other childen in our care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course of events I would be quite happy to impart information to the Deputy.  As she is aware, I am having a meeting this afternoon with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, which will be our first opportunity to review what has happened over the past ten days.  I will be in a far better position next week to give information as requested but there is little point in anticipating today's meeting, at which I hope we will get a lot of work done.</P>

      <P>Will the Government ensure that the Kelly Fitzgerald report is published?  I do not believe the threats of legal action from people who want to protect their own interests <Col N="312" /> should prevent the publication of this report.  This case involved a young child who was effectively tortured to death.  I think the report can be published in this House under privilege.  If it needs to be done in that way, it should be done.  It is in public interest that it would be published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been referred to on a number of occasions.  It was dealt with extensively at Question Time yesterday.  It would be the Government's wish to publish the report also, subject to the legal advice which is to be sought.  The report has implications for many individuals but, subject to getting legal clearance, the Government will have no hesitation in publishing the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, the Fine Gael Party, the major party in the three-party coalition, yesterday proposed a fundamental change in Irish neutrality in the European Parliament, in the presence of the Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  Is it intended to withdraw prior to publication, the proposed White Paper on Foreign Affairs as the Minister of State clearly indicated that it will not tackle the major issue of neutrality but went on to say that the Western European Union question must be examined in the Intergovernmental Conference? Is the promised legislation on neutrality to be brought forward?  More importantly, since a fundamental change is proposed in promised legislation, will the Government make a clear statement in its White Paper as to where it stands on this basic question of Irish neutrality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for <Col N="313" /> Government contains a provision, as did the previous programme for Government agreed between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party, that if there is to be a change in Ireland's traditional neutrality, it will only be done by the Irish people by way of referendum.  That is the position.  It has not changed.</P>
      <P>I do not accept responsibility for MEPs in relation to yesterday's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody recognises more than I that you cannot always control MEPs.  In view of the fact that the Intergovernmental Conference begins later this month, will the White Paper be published before then?  Can the House have a date for that?  Has the date been agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have confirmed on many ocasions to the Fianna Fáil spokesman on foreign affairs, it will be published before the Intergovernmental Conference.  I hope we can have a discussion as well because it is important that all parties in this House make their views known on all the issues which will be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I revisit the question which Deputy Harney raised earlier on the non-publication of the Kelly Fitzgerald report?  The Tánaiste indicated a view which is at variance with that expressed yesterday by the Minister for <Col N="314" /> Health when he said that the Government, subject to legal advice, will consider publishing this report which is of great importance and in the public interest.</P>

      <P>On pending legislation, may I ask the Tánaiste about the forthcoming adoption Bill?  I register the Fianna Fáil Party's strong protest at the voting down of our worth-while Bill by the combined coalition parties last night.  A precedent had been set in 1991 when Fianna Fáil in Government accepted Deputy Alan Shatter's Bill. When is the Government's adoption Bill to be published?  Does the Tánaiste approve of the way in which Fianna Fáil's worthy Bill was voted down?</P>

The Fianna Fáil Party, on the one hand, wants the matter discussed in this House.  On the other hand, they had three hours available and they decided not to use it.  They curtailed debate on the Bill last evening. That was their decision, not ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a very important Bill which goes far beyond the proposals contained in it.  It is about the balancing and repositioning of rights.  Democracy is built on the rights assigned to individuals and communities over a period and the normal evolution of rights in a progressive society means introducing more liberal laws to enable people to think and act for themselves.</P>
      <P>However, a dangerous culture has grown up here in the past few years whereby more and more rights are assigned to wrongdoers, law breakers, muggers and all sorts of evildoers.  The perpetrators of crime now have more rights than the victims.  The poacher has outfoxed the gamekeeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House must reflect on the concerns of people and act accordingly. People are sick to the teeth of the latitude criminals seem to have.  Hardened criminals know the law inside out.  They <Col N="319" /> know the loopholes and the limits within which the Garda Síochána must work.  Above all else, they are masters in recognising their own rights.</P>
    <P>My position is clear.  I want some of the rights currently enjoyed by criminals retracted or reduced.  I have spoken to hundreds of concerned citizens, particularly in my constituency, East Galway, following the spate of murders, muggings and savage beatings of elderly people.  They all want tougher action against criminals, and it would be remiss of this House not to take note of that concern nation-wide.  People want the balance to tilt back towards the victim. They want legislation which will be workable, sustainable, transparent and, above all else, effective.  I share that view.  I realise there must be checks and balances and mechanisms in place to protect the innocent.  However, the honest, decent man and woman in the street want the security to be able to perform their lawful duties without the stress, anxiety and fear caused by criminals roaming our streets.  What rights had poor Tommy Casey of Oranmore, County Galway, an elderly man who was savagely beaten in his own house by mindless thugs a couple of months ago? What rights had the two elderly farmers in east Galway, both living on their own, who were subjected to the most brutal attacks, who were beaten, burned and subjected to beastly and degrading behaviour by mindless thugs?  They had no rights.</P>
    <P>We had better accept that the fight is on.  This is not something that has arisen in the past two months.  It has been a creeping paralysis over the past ten or 15 years.  During that time we allowed ourselves to be outmanoeuvred by a line of thought that convincingly claimed that everybody has certain sacrosanct rights.  I compliment the Minister for Justice on introducing this Bill. However, I knew it would be only a matter of hours before there would be outright opposition to it.  On Tuesday on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; I heard somebody from a civil liberties group objecting to <Col N="320" /> the seven day detention provision which is a central plank of the Bill.  If that is taken out of the Bill, we will have wasted our time.  Against that background, if we genuinely believe we are losing the battle, particularly against drug-related cases, we must ensure that our laws strengthen the had of the Garda Síochána on that very thin line between peace and anarchy and give them the wherewithal to carry out the job on our behalf.</P>
    <P>It is important to protect the innocent. Under this legislation, whereby people can be held for seven days, a person in custody must be brought before a court within 48 hours, and any rights will be attainable at that stage.  I see nothing wrong with that.  We will have to go further to rid society of the menace of drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>I am informed that about 80 per cent of inmates in some of our prisons are there for drug-related offences.  If that is so, we have a huge problem on our hands.  I do not have to tell this House that terrible deeds are carried out by drug-crazed criminals.  Drug traffickers are the scum of the earth.  I cannot think of anything lower than a drug trafficker.  They should not have any rights.  Some people will be highly critical of me for saying that.  Any person who peddles drugs should be sentenced to hard labour.  I would not be sorry if the death penalty were reintroduced for convicted drug barons.  We have reached the stage where we must introduce draconian measures.  The godfathers of crime have access to information and are legally well briefed. They are playing for extremely high stakes.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill must reflect the concern of the community that for the past ten years the balance seems to be in favour of the criminal.  We cannot stand for that.  The provision that non-uniformed gardaí may raid a disco is welcome and should have been introduced 20 years ago.  The Bill also provides that customs officials may question suspects.  That may need to be <Col N="321" /> strengthened.  We must hit criminals where it hurts most, in their pockets. Revenue and customs officials should be in a position to use whatever mechanisms are necessary to track down ill-gotten gains irrespective of whether they are invested in flats, shops, houses and farms or used in money laundering. Suspects should be hounded every day of their lives.</P>
    <P>While we cannot do much to prevent people in foreign countries growing plants that produce drugs, we should try to secure our coastline and ensure drugs are not dumped on our shores.  I understand several Governments have requested the EU to provide funding for a programme to examine the transportation of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those involved in drug seizures but we must remember that the amounts seized are the tip of the iceberg.  There is a major drugs problem in Ireland and we must take all necessary measures to prevent illegal trafficking of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an austere measure which I welcome.  I have little time for the champions of civil liberties and do gooders as far as this issue is concerned.  It is incumbent on us to put the boot in.  I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through the House.  It will considerably strengthen the hands of the Garda and customs officials and if this measure is found to be deficient we must tighten the screw a little more.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem was not given the attention it merited over the years. There is no point in saying that this Government is more likely to solve it than any other Government but I hope we will come to grips with the problem. I applaud the efforts of the Minister for Justice who is extremely interested in this area.  She believes it is possible to curtail the problem, if not solve it completely. I hope this legislation will result in saving the lives and health of many young people who, were it not for drugs, would be in a better position than they are today.  This matter concerns everyone and there is no point blaming the Government, Opposition or the Garda. <Col N="322" /> Parents must take a greater interest in what young people do particularly late at night and at some of the rave discos. I hope the Bill achieves its objectives.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that 10 per cent of drug trafficking is detected and approximately 80 per cent of all crime in urban areas is connected in some way to drugs.  Therein lies the dilemma.  The Bill, in attempting to look seriously at measures to control the level of drug trafficking, has to be welcomed. Ireland is seen as the gateway to Europe for drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>People are very much afraid of the effects of drugs.  Parents fear that their children will get caught up in the drugs culture.  By and large in the past the drug scene was confined to Dublin and to a limited extent to cities such as Cork and Limerick but now it is all pervasive. Everybody is enmeshed in the drugs culture. Crime gives rise to fears.  The elderly are being attacked, there are break-ins, burglaries and murders: and people rob to feed the habit.  It is important that something is seen to be done.  Unfortunately there is now a public perception that crime pays, that people selling drugs are not apprehended and problems arising from drugs are not being dealt with at source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authorities took the view that there was not much point in apprehending the small-time dealer selling drugs on the streets and that it was far better to apprehend by means of surveillance those who were involved in the importation of drugs.  We can justifiably claim that the unfortunate effect of that policy is that many of the small-time street traders have become the drug barons of today.  By allowing them to go undetected and unreprimanded these drug traders have come to the conclusion that crime pays since they have no difficulty importing drugs and selling them on. <Col N="323" /> We have now seen the error of adopting that policy.</P>
    <P>When legislation is introduced, no matter how welcome, one has to look at the available resources.  We are awash with legislation but in many instances it is not implemented because we have inadequate resources in terms of the number of Garda Síochána and customs and excise officials, and the capacity of the surveillance.  Recently, I undertook a survey to establish the strength of the Garda force in the major areas on the periphery of Cork city and in the city itself.  In Ballincollig, one of the fastest growing towns in Ireland, I found that over a four year period there were four fewer gardaí; Bishopstown was down two gardaí and in Douglas, Blackrock and Carrigaline it was similar with the result that on the southern side of Cork there were 20 to 25 fewer gardaí than there were four years ago.  How can we hope to successfully implement the new legislation when we have not the resources or capacity to tackle crime on the streets.  We get phone calls every week telling us that people are congregating here and there buying and selling drugs.  It is a major difficulty not having enough gardaí on the ground.</P>
    <P>Very few of the gardaí passing out from Templemore are being allocated to Cork.  From the 88 who recently passed out from Templemore, Cork got one and from the two most recent graduations Cork would have been lucky to get five.  The authorities are not ensuring that an adequate number of gardaí are being posted to the Cork area and are not managing the age profile of the gardaí.  When I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue, it seemed age profile would become a difficulty similar to that in the Army.</P>
    <P>I am aware resources are scarce but will the Minister look seriously at the number of Garda Síochána assigned to the Cork area from the past three graduations from Templemore.  She may tell me this is an operational matter, but it is political and she has to have a say on the issue.  The members of the <Col N="324" /> Government will agree with me that Cork has experienced massive difficulties in getting new gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to carry out surveillance of the hundreds of inlets in Cork's very long coastline.  Deputy Joe Walsh mentioned that the outpost in Castletownbere was closed down.  The customs and excise officials work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on rare occasions are allowed to work overtime at weekends.  Surely we need to look at the rostering to ensure that the gateway to Ireland is under surveillance seven days a week. We have great opportunities to obtain funding from the Structural and Cohesion Funds to carry out surveillance. This week, the television programme &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; was able to track from where the drugs were coming in Morocco and the ships that were being used to transport them.  It has the names of some of the ships owned by drug barons to import drugs and was able to pinpoint various stopping off points where the drugs could be offloaded to other ships and then transported to this country.  If &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; was able to trace them, it begs a question about the Garda Síochána and customs and excise officials and whether the same type of information is available to them?</P>
    <P>If the Urlingford operation was a sting operation, I praise the idea of trying to catch the drug barons even if it costs the State money.  I hope there was not a tip off to prevent the real culprits, who will continue to wreak havoc on young people, being put behind bars. They only lost the initial deposit they paid for the shipment.  This case raises questions about the lack of integration and co-operation between the Garda and Customs and Excise.  While they have reached an agreement, they have still not come to grips with this new approach.  The leak should be found because it had terrible consequences in that we were not able to put these people in jail.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on the problem in Cork was frightening.  It showed how freely available are Ecstasy <Col N="325" /> and other drugs in the night-clubs.  The Garda and the State solicitor, Mr. Barry Galvin, have, on three occasions, opposed the renewal of a licence for people whose night-clubs were being used to sell drugs or who were suspected of being drug barons.  We must pay tribute to them because we know what the drug barons are capable of doing.  Mr. Barry Galvin is prepared to take action in the interests of parents and young people in Cork city.</P>
    <P>I understand he and the Garda have put together a file on the drug barons in the Cork area.  They have given examples of some of the activities in Cork and have tried to relate them to these people.  They have listed the assets of the alleged drug barons and have given those files to the Revenue Commissioners. At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts recently the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners indicated that their job was to collect money.  They seem to be moving away from investigations and audits. We all know the Revenue Commissioners have powers of investigation. However, there have been few audits of individuals who have acquired assets from the illegal sale of drugs.  It is time to address this matter.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with certain Revenue officials who are afraid to take action. There is no doubt that threats have been made against officials involved in doing such audits.  Not everyone is prepared to put their lives, their health or their families at risk to do this job.  We must give proper backup service when such audits are being done by the Revenue Commissioners and we must assure officials that they will not suffer in their attempts to uphold the law.  We must ensure that resources are available and there is co-operation between the Garda and the Customs officials.  The Revenue Commissioners must be able to seize the assets of people who have acquired them through the illegal sale of drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton said drug barons should have no rights and he would not be sorry if the death penalty <Col N="326" /> was introduced.  Society is becoming right wing out of desperation because there seems to be no improvement in the situation.  Section 2 permits the detention of certain suspects for up to seven days.  However, the detained person must be brought before a court and given the opportunity to give and to call evidence and to make submissions before a period of detention can be extended.  Will the Minister re-examine this section, because it will make the Bill unworkable.  She said the increased powers of detention were necessary under international law.  However, people are afraid that those detained in connection with serious offences may have to be released before the investigations are concluded.  A person can be detained for up to seven days but evidence must be provided as to why they were arrested.  I ask the Minister to examine this section and to amend it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Who has not got such difficulties? The Deputy had some in that regard too.  Ours is probably the most socialist state in western Europe and we are far from being right wing.  We might be a good deal better off if we were. This legislation is necessary and desirable and, I hope, it helps in the fight against drug trafficking.  I have serious reservations about our resources being sufficient to combat the problem.  I do not consider that amending the law, as proposed in this legislation, is sufficient to tackle or solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gangsters who control the drug industry by and large get away scot-free. Their activities appear to be curbed only within their gangs.  That has been indicated by a series of gangland killings in <Col N="327" /> recent years in feuds between people competing over the right to sell drugs in particular areas of the cities of Dublin and Cork.  I am not aware of any of those murders having been solved to date.  That points to a significant factor, that we do not have the problem under control.  In the past few weeks it has led to an alarming situation.  We have been told that the Provisional IRA has issued a hit list and it will adopt &mdash; or has adopted, if the murder in the northside of this city at the weekend is anything to go by &mdash; the strange strategy it adopted for years in Belfast and in the North generally, of taking the law into its own hands by assassinating people it believes are seriously involved in the drugs business.</P>
    <P>It is alarming that people are committing murders because they believe the law and law agencies are not able to deal with the problem.  I would like the Minister to tell us why the law enforcement agencies, particularly the Garda, have been unsuccessful in dealing with the series of drug-related murders committed in the past two or three years. It indicates that the gangs operating the drugs industry are virtually untouchable.</P>
    <P>I will repeat a fairly drastic suggestion I made during another debate some weeks ago.  When there is a serious crime problem in any State, drastic measures must be introduced to solve it. The Garda alone do not have the necessary resources, manpower or maybe the professionalism to adequately deal with the problem.  There are 11,000 Army personnel 750 of whom are presently on United Nations duties, mainly in the Lebanon trying to keep the peace between militant Arab sections and the Israelis.  Also, many Army personnel have been released from Border duty because of the comparative peace that has pertained over the past year and a half.  When law and order is at the point of breakdown, the Army should support the Garda to prevent crime.</P>
    <P>We should talk more about prevention than prosecution.  The statistics <Col N="328" /> show that we are not able to prevent crime.  We can only prosecute in 10 per cent of drugs related cases.  We need to strengthen our resources.  The Army should be brought in to aid the civil authority, the Garda Síochána.  They need not and should not be brought in as an armed force, but for observation purposes and to control activities on the streets and in urban and rural public places.  I do not consider that a dramatic suggestion, it is a necessity.  If we cannot solve the problem utilising existing resources, we must tackle it in another way.</P>
    <P>This legislation will go some way towards addressing but it will not solve the problem.  Is the drugs problem in Ireland disproportionate in comparison with other European countries and other civilised societies?  I suspect it may be.  I would welcome a survey and the publication of statistics in that regard.  If my suspicion is correct, we are not on top of the problem or anywhere near solving it.  The series of recent murders pinpoint that we are not able to adequately deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>That the IRA has entered the scene in the Dublin area should bring people to their senses and make them realise that we must do something further in terms of resources to ensure the drugs problem is brought under control. People have spoken of the need for EU assistance to deal with the problem.  I do not consider that EU assistance is necessary, but there should be harmonised laws on this serious matter in the EU, as there is in virtually all others issues affecting society.  The decision by the Dutch some years ago to legalise the sale of soft drugs was a serious mistake and should not have been allowed by the EU.  I understand that decision will be reversed.  However, it has resulted in Rotterdam becoming a clearing house for the drug trade worldwide.  The free availability of soft drugs there has led to an escalation of the shipment of hard drugs through that port.  That affects us because many of the drugs smuggled into the south coast emanated from Rotterdam and other parts of Holland. <Col N="329" /> It is unacceptable that one country in the EC has legalised the use of drugs, ostensibly soft drugs but the problem has escalated to the position where there is a free-for-all in hard drugs.  Rotterdam has become a clearing house for the drug industry and many of those drugs end up in our towns and cities.  It is most unhelpful that the Dutch have taken a step which has proved to be injurious for the whole of the EC.</P>
    <P>The fact that many of these drugs end up here proves that we are incapable of dealing with the problem.  Drug smugglers would not use Ireland as a transshipment location unless they were getting away with it.  Statistics indicate that there is only 10 per cent detection of drugs, and that is not due totally to activities of law agencies.  Much of the cannabis discovered off the south, south-west and west coast was accidentially discovered by fishing trawlers &mdash; such discoveries were made on a number of occasions off the Cork and Kerry coast and last year off the Wexford coast.  Cannabis is dumped in bales on the seabed for collection at a later date by drug smugglers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the discovery of 130 tons of cannabis in a trailer in Urlingford. It is very poor form for Members to be critical of the Minister for Justice and the Garda for what happened.  I do not criticise the Garda or the Customs service because they do their best.  Some people use this House as a medium for self-publicity and their actions damage the Garda and other law enforcement agencies.  The Garda should not be criticised when an operation does not work out as hoped.  To make a political issue of an operation such as that in Urlingford is improper, and the Deputies who tried to make capital of it for their own gain and publicity are a disgrace to this House.  The Garda are doing their best, but do not have sufficient resources. They need back-up, and the Army should be mobilised to help in carrying out searches and observing what is happening throughout the country.  That would enable the Garda to get on with investigative work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> The rate of apprehension is so low that the Garda strength needs to be boosted.  If we compare the rate of apprehension here for serious crime, particularly gangland murders, with that in Northern Ireland, there is a massive difference.  There are very few cases of serious crime in Northern Ireland where prosecutions are not proceeded with and convictions not obtained.  We lag way behind in our ability to solve serious crime.  Crimes, such as murder, which are committed by drug dealers and gangsters in the drug industry are not being solved.</P>
    <P>We read in newspapers that guns are for hire and for sale.  One of last Sunday's newspapers indicated that hit men will carry out an assassination for £5,000 &mdash; graphic descriptions were given.  If that is true, and I believe it is, there is a serious breakdown of law and order.  I wonder how prevalent is intimidation and threats to people involved in the investigation of activities by drug barons.  I suspect we do not know the full story.  I read recently that social welfare officers and Revenue Commissioners officials are threatened by gangsters if they do not give them what they want in terms of hand-outs or if they do not back off from investigation into their affairs.  I wonder if Garda officers are threatened in that way.  It is very likely that there is intimidation on a large scale.  People investigating crime do not feel safe, and that is alarming.</P>
    <P>The fact that murders are not being solved must give rise to serious concern. In circumstances where guns and hitmen are for hire, law and order is under serious threat and the problem is not being properly addressed.  This legislation may help in a small way but it does not deal with the fact that people are getting away with murder.  The Garda and law enforcement agencies are considered by those people to be irrelevant, hence the supposed vigilantes from the Provisional IRA are pretending they are the protectors of the citizens.  That is an alarming development. This problem has existed in the <Col N="331" /> North for years and now we are experiencing it in the Twenty-six Counties. The authorities in the North are used to investigating and solving serious crime, and until such time as we are capable of doing so we have a massive problem.  If that necessities bringing in the Army to assist the civilian authorities, so be it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Deasy on the overall problem of crime.  The Progressive Democrats strongly support this legislation.  The strong measures it contains &mdash; they ought not be measures on which we would lightly embark as part of the ordinary criminal law &mdash; are warranted by the extent of drugs-related crime.  It is so serious and of such proportion that it would be wrong to regard it as anything other than an emergency.  The strong powers in this legislation are appropriate to the scale of the crisis this country faces in dealing with drug-related crime. It is sad that last week this House rejected what I consider to be legislation which would have aptly complemented this Bill.  The purpose of that Bill was to bring about a revolution in the way the criminal process works, from the point of view of a unified prosecution service to issues to do with bail and the abuse of bail.  They are all related to the drugs issue, to the right of silence, to criminal procedures, to the sentencing powers of courts and to the whole question of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Does anybody believe that the big drug barons will not avail of the right to silence, that they will not avail of the loopholes in criminal procedures?  If they feel they can get away with it, they will not testify at their own trials, they and their underlings will be the first to avail of our inadequate prison service and will use every possible stratagem to avoid the just sentence their crimes merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is terribly sad that we are now putting in place what are well-intentioned powers to combat the drugs crime wave while at the same time turning down <Col N="332" /> vitally necessary changes in the way our criminal system works.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice recently took advantage of the privilege of this House to, in my view, abuse that privilege by levelling very serious and unfounded charges at my party's spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donnell.  In particular, the Minister took the unusual politically cowardly step of a staged Adjournment Debate to make very serious and completely groundless statements about Deputy O'Donnell's entirely proper and legitimate questioning of the circumstances that lay behind the Urlingford drugs seizure.</P>
    <P>In my view the so-called seizure at Urlingford was not a seizure.  The drugs were under the control of the Garda long before they were &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; or &ldquo;seized&rdquo; at Urlingford.  The truth about their transhipment and transport to Urlingford has been known for some time.  As early as December last &mdash; one month after the so-called seizure &mdash;<i>The Irish Times</i> published an exclusive background story in which it quoted the people of Castletownbere in County Cork as having come to the conclusion that the drugs had been landed by the Garda.  If publication of that fact endangered anyone's life, that danger existed even before and since December 1995.  Indeed, only the most naive observers would expect that drug dealers whom it was hoped to trap with the Urlingford drugs could not have put two and two together and seen that the entire operation had been one which the Garda had compromised in its planning and infiltrated, probably with the help of other countries' drug enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>When the matter was discussed in the Dáil two puzzling issues, which obviously demanded explanation, were raised by two Opposition Deputies. Deputy Bertie Ahern wondered how it was that those who brought the drugs to Urlingford could have escaped if there had been a proper surveillance operation. Later that day Deputy O'Donnell wondered why published explanations for ending the surveillance operation, <Col N="333" /> namely a so-called leak to the media, was not being investigated because, if there had been such a leak to the media, obviously that was a matter of the utmost gravity.  Both legitimate, reasonable queries were rubbished by the Taoiseach in one instance and by a Minister in another.</P>
    <P>In February this year Deputy O'Donnell was informed, on credible information, that there were substantial grounds for believing that there had never been a seizure at Urlingford, that the drugs had been landed in Ireland by the Garda and had been brought to Urlingford under Garda supervision with a view to entrapping known Dublin drug dealers.  If that information was correct, it logically followed that the Taoiseach's claim that the Minister for Justice was responsible for the largest drugs haul in the history of the State was suspect.  It also followed that sustained references by Ministers to a seizure at Urlingford were seriously misleading, as was the Taoiseach's answer to Deputy Ahern's query about the failure to capture those in possession of the drugs en route to Urlingford.  It also meant that the explanation given about leaks to the media, causing the end of the surveillance operation, was cast in a very different light.</P>
    <P>The political claims and contemporary media comment to the effect that the Urlingford seizure marked the success of co-operation between Customs and Garda were also suspect and if, as is now clear, that Customs had little or nothing to do with the Urlingford operation, contrived photo calls of gardaí and Customs men posing with the haul took on an aspect of official misinformation.</P>
    <P>If the information given to Deputy O'Donnell was correct, the obvious implication was that the public had been very seriously misled, both by Ministers and by certain people in the media who published apparently authoritative briefings based on very different facts.</P>
    <P>It was in this context that Deputy O'Donnell tabled her original parliamentary question to the Minister.  She <Col N="334" /> wanted to know whether there had indeed been an element of sting or entrapment, on the basis that the drugs had been landed in Ireland by the Garda and were being transported within the State with a view to flushing out drug barons.  The Minister's evasive Dáil reply was followed by a ministerial offer to Deputy O'Donnell of a Garda briefing.  Deputy O'Donnell was immediately conscious that, if she accepted a Garda briefing, it might be charged subsequently she had abused that briefing if she were to impart the information she had given to this House.  Deputy O'Donnell specifically told the Minister for Justice that she was accepting a briefing offered by the Minister only on the basis that she.  Deputy O'Donnell, would not be compromised into silence on the issue.  The Minister knows full well that Deputy O'Donnell accepted the briefing on that basis only. I want the Minister to confirm to this House that that is the case.  Moreover, Deputy O'Donnell specifically told the member of the Garda Síochána briefing her that she would be speaking on the issue in the Dáil on the following Tuesday on Second Stage debate on this Bill. No assurances were sought or given that she would be silent on this issue.</P>
    <P>In her Second Stage contribution Deputy O'Donnell was careful to confine herself to the matters to which her original information related.  At no stage in her contribution did she in any way breach faith or the confidence of her briefing.  The information in her Dáil speech &mdash; I challenge anybody to contradict me &mdash; pre-dated the Garda briefing.  That information appeared in a Sunday newspaper the weekend prior to her Second Stage speech.  Yet the Minister, one newspaper and at least one Member of this House on television, chose to allege that Deputy O'Donnell had breached the confidence of a Garda briefing in her remarks to this House last week.  That was a reprehensible charge and I call on those who made it to withdraw it.</P>
    <P>As somebody with whom Deputy O'Donnell discussed her information <Col N="335" /> prior to tabling her original parliamentary question, as some one with whom she discussed her proposed contribution to this debate last week, I wish to refute in the strongest possible terms the unfounded and wholly unjustified accusation of the Minister and various other persons in this matter.  The record will show that Deputy O'Donnell acted, as she always does, with propriety, courage and reserve.  Those who did not want the public to know the truth of what happened in relation to the Urlingford drugs issue have not acted in accordance with those same standards.  All of the operational detail, including the names of people suspected of involvement, have come into the public arena even though the media had been briefed by Garda sources.</P>

      <P>I want to correct the record of this House because, as you will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister for Justice chose what I consider to be a very cowardly option politically to come into this House and stage an Adjournment Debate in which she launched an unmerciful attack on Deputy O'Donnell's reputation and propriety, then left the stage without any opportunity for Deputy O'Donnell to reply.  While that does not surprise me it does disappoint me.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are giving major new, strong powers to the Garda Síochána.  If the culture of secrecy and obfuscation that surrounded the Urlingford matter, and the suppression of the truth in relation to that matter, were to continue in the context of these powers, it might have very serious implications for the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection, neither has my party and, in particular neither has Deputy O'Donnell, to entrapment of <Col N="336" /> drug barons.  Nobody thinks there is anything wrong with taking sensible legal and ethically defensible steps to amass evidence against those who we know in our hearts are orchestrating this vicious war against Irish people and society.  Nobody knows better than I that to obtain evidence, mere suspicion is often insufficient.  By the same token, where there is entrapment, this House does not want to know all the details of every Garda operation.  Nobody in this House, least of all the Progressive Democrats, has ever suggested that this House should have a supervisory role in every Garda operation or should know the truth about every single item concerning the unrelenting war against drug barons.  We do not want that knowledge but we insist that information tendered to this House is truthful.  We acquiesce in the fact that some matters are not mentioned in this House but it is a different matter if people come in here and make claims which subsequently turn out not to be true.</P>
    <P>We support the deployment of stronger powers in the fight against drug barons but there should be no hint from this House that it is appropriate for any Member, ministerial or otherwise, to make claims which subsequently turn out not to be true.  I do not care if they are economical with the truth in certain circumstances but I object strongly to the proposition that a Member can put an untruth on the record of this House. These new powers must be balanced with ministerial accountability and responsibility.  Every Member of this House is entitled, under the Constitution and under any democratic principle, to know that information imparted to this House is truthful and that claims are not dressed up to be something they are not, even to assist the laudable aim of pursuing major criminals.</P>
    <P>It is open to a member of the journalistic profession to print material based on his or her view of what is ethical, having regard to the risk to people's lives and the major interest in society in containing the drug war.  Nobody has <Col N="337" /> the right, however, to impugn the integrity of others to sustain the unsustainable.</P>
    <P>The allegations Deputy O'Donnell made in this House in relation to a sting or entrapment operation have been proved substantially correct.  If drugs were being transported across Ireland for the purpose of uniting them with drug barons and then arresting those drug barons, that is what the average man or woman in this State would refer to as a sting or an entrapment operation.  It was disappointing, therefore, to see responsible journalists being rubbished and thwarted and to read headlines which stated that certain people were denying that there was any such sting or entrapment operation.</P>
    <P>It is easy to suggest that one's own interests are synonymous and conterminous with the national interest or that any challenge to a particular version of events is dangerous because it endangers the lives of innocent people. Any threat which arose out of the Urlingford matter was because of the circumstances in which the operation ended and do not post-date, in any material sense, the first article published by <i>The Irish Times</i> last December.</P>
    <P>Anybody who read that article and who was of a mind to threaten somebody else's life could have put two and two together and worked out precisely what had and had not happened in relation to whether the presence of the drugs at Urlingford was a genuine transportation operation or an operation organised by the State with a view to entrapment.</P>
    <P>Some explanation should be given as to the reason it only emerged at a late stage in all these proceedings that an investigation was not being conducted into the allegations made at the time that the entrapment operation at Urlingford had been compromised by a leak to the media.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, received a written reply from the Minister for Justice on Tuesday which stated:</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have <Col N="338" /> informed me that all decisions in relation to this seizure were made for operational reasons.  The Deputy will be aware that I do not involve myself in Garda operational matters.  On the specific point in the question, I understand the gardaí have not carried out an investigation into alleged leaks.</P>
    <P>A journalist was briefed by gardaí on the morning of the Urlingford operation and told that the operation had been compromised by leaks.  That particular falsehood developed later to an allegation that members of the Revenue Commissioners staff had been responsible for that leak.</P>
    <P>The day before yesterday I asked the Minister for Finance in this House to stand up for his own officers and say they had not been responsible for any such leak on the basis that there had not been any leak and that it was a gross falsehood and malicious to say that the Revenue Commissioners had compromised that operation by leaking its details to the media.  I was disappointed that, although the Minister for Finance had read the remarks of the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Cathal Mac Domhnaill, to the Committee of Public Accounts on this subject, he would not endorse, back them up or take the opportunity to vindicate the characters of the officers of Customs and Excise and say they were not responsible for leaking the details of the Urlingford operation to the media, thereby compromising that operation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that political expediency prevents the Minister for Finance from coming into this House and saying that his officers did not participate in the Urlingford matter; that their presence in photographs afterwards was calculated to mislead since they did not have any significant part in the operation and that, most certainly, the operation had not been called off on the basis of any leaks from the Revenue Commissioners, as the newspapers had suggested.  That is a serious charge to have laid against the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise <Col N="339" /> officers, and it is unfortunate that a Minister for Finance would not come into this House and politically vindicate the standards of his own staff but chose instead to obfuscate and evade the issue in the hope that by doing so the political solidarity of the Government would be held together.</P>
    <P>Our interest in this matter is at the political level in regard to what happened in this House.  We do not have any argument with the gardaí; we have never sought an argument and will not have one in the future.  We support the efforts of the gardaí in their war against drugs and we will not be deflected from pursuing political accountability and high standards of political truthfulness in this House by remarks made by any other person in any forum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Next week Deputy McDowell, as a barrister, could be in the High Court defending the barons he <Col N="340" /> is talking about today.  I hope he will keep to his principles and not take the tainted money from these drug barons.</P>
      <P>I am a psychiatrist and I am also regarded as a drugs counsellor.  Drug abuse is not only a Dublin problem, it is a national problem.  It exists also in the larger cities of Cork, Galway and Limerick but it affects every town and village. A few months ago when the Labour Party in Clare called a public meeting to discuss drug abuse it created a stir because people felt it did not happen in small towns.  People came forward and later people from the villages asked us to come to talk to them.  The people recognise that drug abuse is a major problem.  I wish to state, for the benefit of Deputy McDowell, that it is not a problem of the unemployed only. His son, my son, our children can be affected today or tomorrow.  He might be defending my son next week.  It is a problem in every class of society.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Bhamjee</NameTxt>
      <P>He might be a user but I am sure the Deputy would be able to do justice for a few poor students.  It may be that hard drugs are a problem in the Dublin area, usually heroin which is injected intravenously.  There is a new phenomenon of burning the drug so that drug addicts become high on the fumes and we do not find marks on their arms as in the past.  Cannabis is sold openly and ecstasy is available on every street. Only a five minute walk from here I can buy an ecstasy tablet for £10.  The cost has reduced considerably because of supply and demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was hoping that Senator Magner might arrange with the drugs squad at Pearse Street Garda station to come to this House and give us a demonstration. The smell of cannabis is specific.  It would be nice if Deputies could smell cannabis, feel the grass and see what an ecstasy tablet looks like.  It is similar to the panadol tablets which many <Col N="341" /> Deputies take for the political headaches we have here every day.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction commences with the 11 to 12 age group.  We thought this was only happening in New York and other places, but down the road, not far from us, children of 11 and 12 are taking ecstasy tablets and smoking cannabis.  I was shocked by this because I thought it started only at the age of 15 or 16. Also some middle aged people are abusing ecstasy and are beginning to abuse cocaine.  Because ecstasy gives sexual stimulation some of the middle classes are using it.</P>
    <P>A cigarette of cannabis costs about £8.  The drugs squad showed the other day a drop of LSD, costing only £2, which one puts under the tongue to get high.  There are different names for its such as apple juice, pineapple or banana and these are the varieties being used by young people.  The content of these drugs is frightening.  Besides the drug element that causes the high, the drug manufacturers may have put in sugar or arsenic, which are illegal.  A child may take a tablet today which does not affect them but the next day they may get a tablet from a different supplier which will affect them.  Everything depends on the source of supply. This is where the Bill is important.  It helps us to get to the source of the supply.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of these drugs is that one gets high, but the next morning there is a low to the point where children contemplate suicide.  Some may have to take heroin to lift themselves up again.  This is a double addiction and problems develop.  With ecstasy, children need to drink water.  I have heard from children that in some places the taps are closed off.  Perhaps Deputy McDowell can examine the legality of this at the discos where the taps are locked so that children cannot drink the tap water and have to buy bottled water. This is dangerous because children have collapsed owing to lack of water which sometimes results in kidney failure. Some 14 to 16 children have died here because of ecstasy abuse.  We are all <Col N="342" /> aware that children have been isolated and found dead in public toilets, some with the syringe still attached to their armpits.  It is sad that it is happening.  It is our duty to prevent it and this Bill goes a long way.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a way of life.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice would be able to assist in tackling the problem.  Another problem which some Deputies may have is alcohol abuse.  One third of the admissions to psychiatric hospitals are due to alcohol abuse.  The question is whether we are prone to drug abuse.  I would like to inform Deputy Deasy that the level of drug abuse in Ireland is very low compared with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I gave lectures at which I stated there was no drug problem in rural areas.  I had to state the next year there was a drugs problem because drugs could be brought at any time. There is no such thing as drugs being available only at night or in certain locations, they are available around us. A cross addiction to alcohol and drug abuse is developing in the community. This is reflected in our reports to the health research board which is beginning to be concerned about the level of abuse.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to sound pessimistic but drug abuse is a worldwide problem.  I do not think we can stop it but we have to do our best to minimise it and to reduce the infiltration of drugs from Holland, which is also trying to prevent drug abuse becoming a major problem.  I will refer later to the legislation on drugs there.  Drugs are also coming from North African and South American countries.  To put it in a political context, a deposed president of one of the South American countries was supposed to be a major supplier of cannabis to the world market.  As he is deposed I am sure I can say it openly.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have different types of drug dealers.  I read in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> that four small suppliers have been caught.  In regard to the sting at Urlingford &mdash; if it was as sting &mdash; I support the Garda in what they did because they were trying to catch the <Col N="343" /> major supplier.  There are different categories of supplier &mdash; the producer, drug baron and small supplier.  The drug abuser who has to sell to get money to feed his own habit is also being caught. The other day an abuser was fined only £50 for having grass in his pocket.  I feel sorry for such people &mdash; perhaps Deputy McDowell will take them into account &mdash; because I see the real face of humanity when I meet them as patients in my work.  I also see it as my function to meet their families and, wearing my psychiatrist's hat, help people in a different way from Deputy McDowell when he wears his barrister's hat.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem lies in a multifaceted approach.  I welcome the creation of links between the Departments of Education, Health and Justice. The Minister for Education is introducing drug awareness programmes in primary schools.  Children take their first cigarette at nine or ten years of age and their first drink at 14.  We have to tackle this problem when children are very young and primary school is the best place to do so.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that emphasis is placed on personality development in schools.  There must be development of self-confidence and responsibility so that a child acquires the ability to say no either to the drug pusher who offers free samples or their peers and friends who might encourage them to take drugs so that they do not, in turn, become a drug abuser.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the methadone programme about which there has been much talk recently.  I disagree with much of it as there is a replacement of one addiction with another.  We should be looking at the multiple aspects of drug abuse, not just addiction.  These includes personality and social problems and there is also a need for counselling.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell and the Opposition should look at the development of public counselling services in Dublin city where there is a major lack of such services.  After my appearance on a Sunday morning radio programme last <Col N="344" /> week I received numerous calls from people in Dublin.  Perhaps, as part of his constituency work, Deputy McDowell will ask for such facilities to be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another facility in Dublin South-East.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MoosajeeBhamjee" hpid="Dr. Bhamjee Dr. Bhamjee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Bhamjee</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a practical step and should be simple and easy to obtain.  There are private facilities the provision of which I know the Deputy encourages as this forms part of the Progressive Democrats's programme, I also work with a private facility.</P>

      <P>There is a need for residential treatment programmes throughout the country, but particularly in Dublin. I work with the Bushy Park treatment centre which accepts public and private patients.  It treats some people for nothing.</P>
      <P>Sixteen to 18 year olds are beginning to present a problem.  The age at which people begin to abuse drugs is now very low.  This is worrying as they find themselves in situations where it is hard to stay away from drugs.  My party has been doing much to provide housing and create employment.  Perhaps when Deputy McDowell finds himself in Government with his Fianna Fáil colleagues in ten year's time he might continue this work.</P>

      <P>As this problem demonstrates, there is a link between politics and psychiatry.

As he can see, I have already started my election portfolio.  I <Col N="345" /> will be appearing on numerous television programmes and writing in newspapers for a long time to come.</P>

      <P>On the crime problem on which the Deputy would have more statistics, only 40 per cent is due to drug abuse.  Contrary to what Deputy Deasy said, the recent murders in the west which the Deputy and his party hyped to such a high degree were not drug related.  While drug addicts cause problems, they do not commit murders.  I am sure Deputy Davern will disagree with me on that point as he is also on the right wing.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;under which addicts will not be admitted to hospital involuntarily.  I disagree with that provision and will be taking the matter up with the Minister for Health.  I have admitted people against their will and found that when they are taken away from the source of supply they have a chance to abstain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a campaign in the media to try to have cannabis legalised.  I hope we will not take that road.  I have seen people develop schizophrenia, a subject much debated in the High Court in recent days.  The lack of motivation syndrome is associated with the continuous <Col N="346" /> abuse of cannabis.  It has been shown recently that genetic chromosonal problems can develop from the chronic abuse of the drug.  We would, therefore, put at risk the future of our nation if we try to legalise cannabis.  It is supposed to be good for pain relief and has been used by some to ease the pain associated with arthritis and gout.  However, new born babies have needed immediate treatment for withdrawal symptoms which many of us would recognise.</P>
    <P>I convey my best wishes to the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána who are confronted with a major problem. I wish them luck as it will be both frustrating and hard work to reduce the volume of drugs and catch the drug barons whom Deputy McDowell will defend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the widespread use of illegal drugs is one of the major problems facing society as we approach the end of the 20th century.  Unlike many of the other serious issues, the drug problem does not consist of a single element, rather there is a number of disturbing dimensions to drug abuse.</P>
      <P>The use of illegal drugs has a disastrous effect on the life of the addict.  As in the case of any substance abuse, the brief periods of relief and escape provided to an addict by the use of a drug are fitted in between extended intervals of sickness, despair, longing and, frequently, deep depression.  In the vast majority of cases, therefore, the drug addicts find that normal life pattern is destroyed as their addiction develops. Examples of certain and frequent rapid decline are only too common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the widely known horror of the consequences of drug abuse it is a continuing source of amazement to many people that an increasing number of young people in particular seem to ignore all warnings and take that first disastrous decision to experiment with drugs.  All too often the experimental phase is over within a very brief period and the unfortunate individual is well and truly launched on the painful road <Col N="347" /> to full drug addiction.  As the addiction deepens a number of other victims become directly involved.  Inevitably, the family tends to suffer at an early stage.  Slowly but surely, the son or daughter changes from a normal content member of the family unit to a virtual stranger, with much pain, hurt and despair along the way.  As the cost of maintaining the drug habit increases, the addict frequently starts to steal money or goods from fellow family members.  The family unit is plunged into crisis and existing problems are greatly magnified.</P>
    <P>In the case of full blown addiction, it is almost impossible to quantify the damage caused to the overall family unit.  In many cases people find it extremely difficult to regain the level of peace, happiness and trust which were taken for granted before addiction. When the addict has a partner or children the immediate damage is particularly severe.  The damage does not stop with the addict or remain within the immediate family circle.  As the habit increases a wide circle of friends and fellow students or workers are increasingly affected and the nature of the damage is similar to that in the family unit.  The addict loses many of his or her attractive characteristics and often becomes increasingly alienated from friends and colleagues.</P>
    <P>The fall-out does not end with the family, circle of friends or colleagues. An increasingly disturbing aspect of drug abuse is the widespread trend towards crime to obtain the necessary funds to feed the habit.  As an addict becomes more and more hooked the nature of the crime may change from stealing and petty crime to more violent activities.  Official statistics on the current position in Dublin are alarming. They indicate that more than half of certain types of crime is carried out by drug addicts desperate to feed their habit.</P>
    <P>Before assessing the likely benefit of the legislation the Minister introduced as one of her main responses to the increasing drug problem, it is important <Col N="348" /> to acknowledge the difficulties which lie ahead if we are to successfully tackle the problem of drug abuse.  Despite the allocation of enormous State resources, it must be accepted that countries such as the United States, Holland and Switzerland have not made significant progress in eliminating the scourge of illegal drug abuse.</P>
    <P>It would be dishonest and foolish for anyone to pretend that there are easy options.  On the contrary, there is little doubt that the successful elimination of drug abuse will be achieved only by the development and implementation of a comprehensive set of measures which tackles the many interlinked elements of the problem.  The resources of our educational and health care systems must be harnessed to promote total awareness among young people of the full horrors of drug abuse.  While much effort has been invested to date in this area, through voluntary groups and individuals, even more remains to be done.  Any hint of glamour must be stripped from the public image of illegal substance use.</P>
    <P>A highly resourced anti-drug information campaign will play a key role in the battle.  Three parallel programmes of equal intensity are required.  Our security and custom personnel must be resourced with state-of-the-art detection technology and sufficient manpower.  It is crucial that a highly sophisticated information network is developed under the control of the Garda to initially identify the main supply lines and, subsequently, the various distribution agents throughout the country.  Similarly, every resource must be made available to the gardaí to allow them fully utilise international information facilities on drug producers, importers and distributors.</P>
    <P>One of the two remaining vital requirements in the battle against drugs involves the development of suitable legislative measures to facilitate the successful prosecution of those involved in any aspect of the drug trade.  The Bill helps in this regard and I compliment the Minister on at last beginning to <Col N="349" /> respond to the major responsibilities which lie within her Department.  Since the ultimate outcome of any prosecution is often highly dependent on progress made in the first few hours after arrest, I welcome in general the various increased powers provided to the gardaí in sections 2 and 4.  There is also some merit in the provisions in sections 6 and 7 which deal with the involvement of Customs and Excise personnel during questioning and the rapid preparation of search warrants in a crisis.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, one cannot ignore the fact that the need to increase Garda power to allow an increased rate of success in prosecuting criminals carries the danger of reducing legislative protection for ordinary law-abiding citizens.  For example, the more we remove the special status of search warrants the more we dilute their primary purpose of protecting the right to privacy of ordinary law-abiding citizens.  Therefore, I stress the need to maintain a balance in this key area, despite the universal wish to give our law enforcement agencies every advantage in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The final element in the fight against drug abuse involved further development of treatment facilities for drug addicts.  Ultimately the addict is a victim and we must not lose sight of that. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure that our drug counselling and treatment services are adequately resourced to deal with all addicts.  This is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>As a society we will not overcome the drugs problem unless we devise, resource and implement a comprehensive national plan covering education, law enforcement, legislative improvement and treatment.  Because of the complexity and extent of the problem the establishment of a highly resourced administrative centre in the Department of Justice to co-ordinate the various aspects of the anti-drug campaign would be justified.  Success will come about only as a result of the vigorous pursuit of such a co-ordinated programme and <Col N="350" /> the intensive monitoring and fine tuning of its various operational aspects.</P>
    <P>Members of a sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security visited Cork last Friday.  This gave Members, particularly those from outside Cork, an opportunity to see the problem on the ground.  We met Fr. Kelly, the curate in Blackpool, who is doing excellent work in schools trying to discourage young people from becoming involved in drugs.  We also met the State solicitor, Barry Galvin, whom I compliment on speaking out against drugs and putting himself on the line with the drug barons and dealers in Cork.  The efforts of Mr. Galvin and the gardaí to bring people to justice through prosecution are being frustrated and this must be addressed.  I do not have time to go into the details of some of the points made by Mr. Galvin but he needs our support.  The recent efforts of the gardaí and Mr. Galvin have proved successful.  We also met Inspector Callaghan and Sergeant Michael Fitzpatrick of the Drug Squad who outlined the successes of the gardaí, but there is no doubt additional resources are required to allow them continue their good work.  We then visited the Rock Foundation which was the highlight of our visit.  This centre was set up by Fr. Rock to help the many young people in Cork who are homeless or disadvantaged. A total of 127 boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 are being catered for by the foundation.  The centre is a blueprint for the rest of the country because it operates on a shoestring and must raise much of its finance. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney take a particular interest in this centre which is the only drug unit that caters for adolescents?  We visited the centre last Friday and it was heart warming to hear boys who had been involved in serious crime, drug abuse and joy riding talk openly and convincingly about their problems.  The centre, which caters for 127 boys, has a bakery, restaurant and a stall in the market.  It does tremendous work but the vast majority of people are not aware of this. <Col N="351" /> We need to look closely at the successful work being carried out by the centre.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme highlighted the serious problem in Cork.  We know there is a problem in Dublin but there is also a problem in Cork which needs to be addressed.  Some people on the programme stated they were not involved in the drugs trade but everyone in Cork knows otherwise.  We cannot allow these people to enjoy high standards of living and own massive homes. It is time the Revenue Commissioners took them on.  The State Solicitor in Cork recently started this process and we must ensure that these efforts are continued.</P>
    <P>When we visited Cork Prison we saw the efforts being made to prevent drugs being brought into prisoners.  This initiative has proven very successful. The DARE programme which is operated in some parts of the United States and Sweden educates young people about drugs and seeks to convince them not to use them.  This is another programme which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Government did not see fit to accept Deputy O'Donoghue's recent Bill but I am glad the Minister has belatedly responded to this very serious problem.  The major problem facing us is law and order which is being adversely affected by the drugs problem.  If we do not tackle this problem at source and educate young people it will spiral out of control.  The problem can be dealt with if the necessary resources are made available and the various agencies adopt a co-ordinated approach to it.  The public want legislators to give every assistance possible to the people dealing with the problem at the coal face.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Drug addiction and abuse is an international problem and we are feeling the effects of it as much as any other country. We are not immune from the international drug trade, as was clearly illustrated on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme last Tuesday.  This highlights the need for strong international organisations and co-operation between countries.  Until such time as we attack the economies which depend on the export of drugs we will not be able effectively to tackle the drug problem. This is not being done effectively at international level.  As long as drugs can be exported from Middle and Far Eastern countries with impunity then we will not be able to deal with the problem. This is one of the reasons we need a strong United Nations and co-operation at EU level.  I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment that the drugs problem will be discussed at the International Conference and further efforts will be made to work out co-operative international strategies.  This is the first level at which we must deal with the problem of drug addiction and abuse.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the huge human cost in societies where drugs are freely available and I have seen evidence of this in my constitutency.  I am concerned about some of the provisions in the Bill but I am equally concerned about a problem highlighted by one of my constituents who told me 11-year-old children in the flats complex where she lives act as dealers and have mobile phones.  That is the reality of life for some 11-year-old children in the inner city who face a future of addiction, a shorter life expectancy and horrific problems, including the possibility of AIDS and prison sentences.  At any one time 40 per cent of the prison population has a background in drug abuse. Many prisons encounter serious difficulties in managing drug use among prisoners.  People ask how this can happen but it is very difficult to control this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the increased <Col N="353" /> powers of detention but I support the Bill.  It is an indication of the seriousness of the problem that many Deputies who are concerned about the need to strike a balance between increased legal and Garda powers and the protection of human rights support the Bill.  I am pleased the Minister referred to the need to build in safeguards and to ensure that the legislation is monitored and is not in conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights.  This is extremely important as one cannot overemphasise the problems of abuse. We must provide the necessary supports and training for the Garda who deal with the problem at the front line.</P>
    <P>The Minister has concluded from her examination that we need to go down this road.  This is a reflection of the seriousness of the problem and how out of control it is.  This can be seen in my constituency where there has been a frightening increase in the number of muggings in recent years.  This is linked to the heroin problem in that addicts who desperately need to feed their habit rob people of their money.  I hope the recently announced methadone maintenance programme will help solve this problem.  International evidence suggests that the development of a strong methadone maintenance programme decreases the anti-social behaviour of addicts and reduces the level of crime.  I hope the programme will have the same effect here.  Obviously we must ensure that the programme is not abused and that a black market does not develop in this area.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced by the Minister tackle the problem at one level only and we must deal with it at a number of other levels.  For example, we must educate very young children about the dangers of drugs.  Young adolescents take risks and we must teach them about the consequences of some of these risks.  We ask teachers to do many things and I welcome their increased commitment to help young people understand these dangers.</P>
    <P>We must provide separate services for adolescents experimenting with drugs, <Col N="354" /> who cannot be treated in the same facilities as hardened addicts and criminals. We must also provide freephone numbers which can be used by teenagers who are experimenting with drugs. Teenagers tend to portray a hard front and are reluctant to admit they have problems and we must make it easy for them to have access to help.  We must deal with the problem at an educational, medical and justice level.  To succeed we must dovetail all these different approaches and work well together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing her time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the growing problem of drug trafficking which is of great concern to everybody, inside and outside this House.  I agree with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who said recently that the spread of illegal drugs is a threat to the fabric of society. It is a problem not exclusive to urban areas and is common in many rural areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister for Justice as part of a comprehensive anti-drugs package which the Government announced last year.  I urge her to ensure that this critical legislation is updated and modernised in future to keep ahead of the drug barons and dealers who seem to find new ways to defy the law.  The measures to detain people suspected of drug trafficking for up to seven days and the detention of the so-called &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; and &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo; will reduce the level of drugs in circulation.</P>
      <P>The State has a responsibility and a duty to ensure its citizens are protected from the scourge of drugs and must use every resource in its power to do so. There should be co-operation from all the relevant State agencies who are in the front line fighting against drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controversy surrounding the drugs seized at Urlingford, County Kilkenny, is a case in point.  Since then, there has been charge and counter-charge about the role the Garda and Customs played in that operation. <Col N="355" /> Indeed, it has been suggested in some quarters that the operation was undermined by a turf war of sorts between the Garda and Customs.  This feud needs to be sorted out quickly.  The State must adopt a united approach to the drugs problem and the Minister for Justice must sort out these disagreements as it is clear the current difficulties must be resolved without delay.  This could be achieved through the establishment of one agency, such as an anti-drugs taskforce, which should be given the necessary powers and resources to work with existing agencies in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>As a public representative from east Cork, I represent a part of the country which contains some of the most rugged sections of the State's coastline.  Because of its craggy nature, the coastline around this part of Cork can hamper the authorities in their attempts to stem the flow of drugs and narcotics into the country.  Therefore, we should use our lighthouses to watch out for supicious vessels around the coastline.  The lighthouses in this area should be staffed by keepers who would be given the responsibility of reporting any suspicious activity to the Garda and naval authorities.  Staffed lighthouses would deter drug traffickers and make it more difficult for them to transport drugs.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I recommend the reopening of many of the defunct Garda stations which are dotted along the coastline.  As our coastline is one to the most rugged and craggy in Western Europe we must help our security forces to make it as secure as possible.  I hope this matter can be examined by the drugs strategy team which the Minister set up last year.</P>
    <P>We should not be afraid to tackle the drug barons, the people who set up the drug deals and those who transport the drugs from place to place.  We must implement harsh measures which are designed to put drug barons behind bars and out of business.</P>
    <P>Urban and rural areas are being blighted by drug related crime as the majority of burglaries are carried out by <Col N="356" /> drug abusers trying to feed their habit. This crime wave is a direct result of the work of a small band of drug barons, many of whom are well known to the Garda and public alike, and it seems astonishing that a newspaper can publish a list identifying known drug barons.  Many people are asking if a newspaper can publish the identities of these people behind bars?  Known drug dealers should be under constant surveillance to catch them in the act.  In some cases, drug barons are signing on to claim dole while living in houses worthy of millionaires.  The Revenue Commissioners should pursue and question people who cannot account properly for such wealth.  If necessary, the Revenue Commissioners should be given the full support of the Garda in the pursuit of drug barons.  If we could take these drug barons out of the system, the crime rate throughout the country would be dramatically reduced.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Naval Service for its role in stopping drugs from coming into this country.  In particular, I want to mention its role in stopping the yacht <i>Brime</i> from landing its drugs haul some years ago.  I understand that two people involved in that operation, the captain of the naval ship and the coxswain of the <i>Gemini</i> which transported the boarding party to the yacht, are to receive distinguished service medals.  I cannot understand why the other four people who risked their lives will not be decorated for their heroic efforts in detaining that yacht.  It does not make sense to decorate two people while four other people, who went on board with arms, will not be honoured.  I ask the Minister to take that matter up with the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Some of the recent press coverage about the drugs problem in Cobh, County Cork, was blown completely out of proportion.  Cobh's drugs problem is no different from the experience of any other town and I urge the press and radio media to bear this in mind when reporting about Cobh, and the drugs problem especially, in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> I support Deputy Dan Wallace's remarks about Father Rock, who is doing excellent work in Cork with young delinquents who get involved in drugs, etc.  He is based in my constituency in east Cork.  Any help which the State can give him should be forthcoming immediately because he is doing excellent work for young people who cannot receive treatment in any other part of this country.</P>
    <P>I am worried at present by the people in the media seeking the legislation of soft drugs.  As Lady Thatcher once said: &ldquo;Out, out, out&rdquo;.  These people should not be given any publicity because one cigarette leads to another.  The sooner these people are denied access to the media, and our television screens especially, the better.</P>

      <P>This is a constructive and important debate.  While I would not want to criticise the media for its lack of coverage of the debate as it is entitled to have its own priorities, I thought this debate would have received more generous coverage.  This House is often critised &mdash; rightly at times &mdash; for responding in a sluggish way to crises or for the delay in introducing legislation.  Now when we attempt to respond to this issue, the debate is not being reported sufficiently in the media and I am unhappy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the level of crime has increased throughout society. It is now big business and criminals are tough, audacious and determined.  Their self-confidence has grown over the <Col N="358" /> years, they have increased their weaponry from knives to guns and all kinds of weapons are now in use in carrying out crime.  We cannot return to the past and wish crime would go away.  We must respond in an intelligent way here and do what we can to understand that there is no going back.  We are part and parcel of modern society so we must do our best to respond.  We must also attempt to tackle the problem at its root and not just tackle the symptoms as we often do.</P>
    <P>We must identify the causes of crime and drugs abuse.  We heard some fine contributions to this debate this morning. Deputy Deasy made a very thoughtful contribution as did Deputy Mulvihill and Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to name three whom I heard. They made very positive suggestions to the Minister.  I hope when the Bill is passed, we will not just pack our bags and go away and forget about the whole business.  It is important that the Minister should take account of what we have said, respond intelligently to our observations and come back to the House to tell us how these measures are working.</P>
    <P>As an island we are wide open to importation of drugs.  Drugs are also being manufactured here &mdash; ecstasy tablets can be made in a small premises such as a garage and enough can be carried around in a suitcase to make a person wealthy for life.  We must find out how the drugs are coming in &mdash; just saying they are coming in is not good enough.  The Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise, the Navy and the Army must identify the routes by which drugs are coming into the country, the kind of drugs being used, and who are the godfathers behind the drugs trade. All these things have to be documented and tackled in an intelligent way.</P>
    <P>We see violent crime all around us. My city of Limerick has never before seen such a spate of killings.  How are people getting access to guns?  Surely the Garda Síochána can find out how guns are coming into a city like Limerick. They should nip this trade in the <Col N="359" /> bud and arrest the people responsible for selling them.  It is not difficult to get guns now in any area.  I suppose the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years has lead to greater availability of guns.  Violent crime here has paralleled that in Northern Ireland. The IRA has been involved in killing or shooting drug dealers.  That is not acceptable.  No matter how reprehensible, no matter how evil these people are, the IRA does not have the right to be judge and jury or to kill them.  It is the job of the State to identify the people concerned and to bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>We are not the simple, innocent society we once were.  We are a modern society, part of the modern information superhighway and we must deal with our problems appropriately.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the need for education.  I agree there is a need for education and health care.  We must try to educate our young people about the evils of society, including drug taking in the hope that they will respond in a mature way.  A remedial backup service is also required and greater involvement by the Minister for Health and local health boards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Urlingford drug seizure I do not know exactly what happened, but I have read the media reports.  I would not put anybody's life in danger, particularly a garda's.  The Minister and the Garda Síochána must tell us what went wrong without putting lives at risk.  I realise the Garda must become involved in a &ldquo;sting&rdquo; at times. Nevertheless the Urlingford case has left a bad taste in the mouth.  We need to see greater co-operation between the Customs, the Garda and the Navy.  In this case we are their masters and they must implement our policies.  It is not good enough that there are divisions. There is enough division in the Garda at present without division between the Garda, the Customs and the Navy. What we want is a united and co-ordinated approach to the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>On the confiscation of money from <Col N="360" /> drug barons and drug dealers, if somebody without visible means of support is living an opulent and flamboyant lifestyle, has a large house and drives a large car, that person must be getting money from some source.  If the Garda Síochána can prove the person is involved in the drug trade, the money should be taken from him.  These people are not involved in a teddy bears' picnic and will threaten any official who approaches them.  For 20 years Martin Cahill defied the Garda Síochána and officials from the Department of Social Welfare with impunity.  That is not good enough.  Such people cannot be allowed to disport themselves in public, and live opulent lifestyles.  They are bad role models.  They are a bad advertisement for the Garda Síochána if they can openly and with impunity be involved in criminal activities and action is not taken against them.  It is not good enough either that drugs are sold openly on the streets of Dublin or in the housing estates in Limerick.  If the television cameras can film people selling drugs, surely the Garda Síochána could do the same.  It is not acceptable that people can buy drugs in some city centre areas of Dublin and that they can be sold with impunity.  We cannot allow that to continue. The Garda must be able to curb that and stamp it out.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on us that the trade in drugs and drug consumption has increased.  We are an intelligent people, but in our haphazard approach to combating the drugs menace we have not behaved in an intelligent or co-ordinated way.  The time has come to do that.  All the arms of State must be used to stamp out this trade.</P>
    <P>The Government is in earnest, and this Bill is a step forward.  It is not perfect but at least it shows concern and that we are trying to do something.  Let us come back to the House and monitor its operation after six months and have a further debate to assess how successful these measures have been.  The only test is the acid test of whether they work in <Col N="361" /> practice and whether the Garda Síochána have more success in at least arresting the drug trade.  The only way legislation can be measured is on whether it is effective in dealing with a problem.</P>
    <P>This has been a good debate.  Some trenchant points have been made by concerned people in the House.  It has received little media coverage, and that is a pity.  I would like to see this debate being covered more fully by the media because the public want to know what we are doing about the drug problem. Backbenchers like me are attempting to give some advice and make recommendations to the Minister in an effort to deal with the problem.  I hope she will take those on board and I look forward to her coming back to the House and reporting on how these measures have operated over a six-month period.  I am grateful to my colleagues, Deputies Ahern and Davern for giving me a few minutes of their time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Government measure in nearly 14 months to do something about the drug problem. Although I welcome the Bill as a move in the right direction, I am disappointed with it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the ordinary members of the Garda Síochána in my constituency who have been active not only in successfully capturing people selling drugs in the area but who are implementing an educational programme on the problem.  I have held several public meetings to which the Garda Síochána have come and exhibited drugs.  This was as much an education for me as it was to the members of the public.  Those of us who were brought up in the sixties, with flower power and everything else, presumed we knew everything about drugs, but we were ignorant.  At that stage it was an urban problem but now it is a countrywide one.  I congratulate Tipp FM on its message &ldquo;Tipp FM Against Drugs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the seven day detention period provided for in the Bill.  Most people who commit crime are granted bail.  The public is horrified that people <Col N="362" /> who commit crime while on bail are given concurrent sentences.  Many criminals intimidate witnesses or abscond while on bail.  In Dublin recently a person robbed four banks while on bail and received concurrent sentences.  Two people being questioned about a murder case in Galway were granted bail and they absconded.  Two others were held.  Is there a political problem with holding a referendum on bail?  Are the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare and Leader of Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa, totally against it?</P>
    <P>People use the phrase &ldquo;drug baron&rdquo; which conjures up an image of someone who is exceptionally powerful.  That phrase should not be used but rather &ldquo;drug trafficker&rdquo; or &ldquo;drug peddler&rdquo;. They are peddlers in death and destroy the lives of young people.  In the last 18 months 16 young people died from abuse of ecstasy.  I am disappointed that a criminal is afforded the right to silence. The European Court of Justice decided recently that the judge may draw an inference from the fact that somebody remains silent during questioning. The person should not be obliged to answer questions but by not doing so the inference should be that they are guilty.  The right to silence was introduced at a time when people did not understand the law and were not allowed into the courts.  There is a defeatist attitude towards crime and it would help reassure the public if we removed the right to remain silent and improved the bail laws.</P>
    <P>I understand the necessary legislation to enable Revenue Commissioners to interrogate suspects was in place.  They have a right to know how people obtain money.  I watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; on RTÉ and was fascinated to see people who had not been employed for years living in big houses and enjoying high lifestyles.  It is amazing that the Revenue Commissioners cannot find out what such people are doing, yet an RTÉ reporter can ascertain taht information and broadcast it on television.  No inquires have been made into how a <Col N="363" /> number of people in my area obtain money to build new homes and buy vehicles and properties in other towns.</P>
    <P>A section of the Garda tries to play down the drugs problem but it is a reality, as any hardworking member of the Garda is aware.  Usually customs officials are the first people to have contact with drug importers.  However, they do not have a right to question them unless it is in the presence of a garda. Great credit is due to the Customs and Excise for its tremendous work in detecting drugs landed at various ports, particularly at Rosslare.  They should have a right to question suspects without a garda being present.  It would make for greater co-operation between that section and the Garda.</P>
    <P>It was frightening to see on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the amount of drugs imported. The television programme identified certain people but they were not arrested.  Six months ago there was a television programme showing people openly dealing in drugs on the streets in Dublin.  No one was arrested.  Drug-related crime accounts for 80 per cent of all crimes committed.  We do not have a problem with hard drugs in my constituency but we have an increased crime rate, particularly violent crime.  I use two legal drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. These can be mixed with other drugs such as cannabis which is seen as a harmless drug.  Deputy Bhamjee said it is good for gout and arthritis. However, research has shown that cannabis and hash can cause tremendous damage.  The drug that has had the greatest impact in rural Ireland is ecstasy which is manufactured in back rooms and large profits are generated from its sale.  The people who deal in ecstasy are, I think, of the lowest type. The television programme &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; showed many different ecstasy tablets but there was no consistency in the product.  What frightens me is the way young people justify using ecstasy; they say everybody is using it but only 16 people have died from it.  They see <Col N="364" /> that as an indication that the bulk of ecstasy tablets are all right.</P>
    <P>Nobody has educated young people about the long-term effects of using those tablets and the damage they may do to their kidneys, livers and their hearts.  It is the inconsistencies in the manufacturing of ecstasy that caused problems.  Recently, ecstasy tablets worth £15 million were seized from a back room laboratory in London. Ecstasy is being produced here.  When people are caught with tablets they say they are for personal use only.  They should have to say where they got the tablets or else face a penalty for using them.  Disco promoters are at their wits end trying to prevent ecstasy being distributed on their premises.  They search certain people and insist that they empty out their pockets before they are admitted but that is no good if young people have taken the drug before going to the disco.  The damage will have been done and the person's behaviour will be the only indicator of having taken ecstasy.  There is a serious problem in trying to control the use of ecstasy at discos.</P>
    <P>The concept of a rave party is to sell ecstasy.  Rave parties have been held in my constituency but nobody was arrested at them.  There is a public perception that not enough is being done to counter drugs.  What worries me is the increasing violence of young people who have taken a concoction of drink and ecstasy.  People empty out of different local discos at the same time and all congregate at the chip van in the town centre.  There have been violent clashes and I saw one young person knifed to death.  The concoction makes people high and more macho.  Anyone would have pity for a member of the Garda Síochána trying to arrest someone on drugs.  Those people are in cloud-cuckoo-land and it is almost impossible to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Education has a major role to play in combating the drugs scene.  We need to educate everyone properly and ensure that those leaving primary school can read and write so that they at least have <Col N="365" /> some chance.  The Department has made an attempt to do this by allocating remedial teachers or giving extra resources to schools in disadvantaged areas but we need to do more.  This is evident not just in the city but in my rural constituency where what was traditionally a rural school is seriously disadvantaged by insufficient resources. Some young people are disillusioned with life, feel that life has dealt them a bad hand and feel the necessity to turn to drugs.  Every Member should attend a drugs seminar organised by the Garda Síochána.  It would be no harm if the Minister were to insist that Members be briefed on the abuse of drugs.  I have been fighting against drugs for a number of years and I realise that it is necessary to keep up to date with the new cocktails.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister seriously consider changing the bail laws?  This is very important because people are losing confidence in this House and in the Garda Síochána.  The bail laws have lowered morale in the Garda Síochána. The courts should take an inference from the fact that a person would not co-operate with a member of the Garda Síochána and remained silent during questioning.  Anyone who is accused of a crime he did not commit will not want to remain silent.  The right to silence is based on a 17th century peasant concept but now everybody has the right to speak up for himself and only those who are guilty will prefer to remain silent rather than indict themselves.  If they remain silent the court must take that into account.  Every support must be given to the Garda Síochána, to the court system and, above all, to the parents of potential victims.  Recently a lady on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; told how she has lost three children already and expects to lose another one this year and perhaps another the year after through serious heroin taking.  That was the greatest indictment of Dáil Éireann and of our society.  There must be stiffer penalties and, above all, the public has to co-operate with the Garda Síochána to help in the fight against crime.  If we <Col N="366" /> do not change the law, the gardaí will not succeed.  We must enact laws that enable them to be dedicated to their work.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important Bills brought before the House.  I agree with Deputy Kemmy's remarks on the lack of media interest in the passage of this Bill.  It is amazing that the media has been captivated by the lifestyle, profiteering, deceit and successful escape attempts by drug barons.  It is difficult to reconcile the number of column inches dedicated in the Sunday newspapers to the successful lifestyle of such people with the media's lack of focus on this Bill.  It speaks volumns that the deed is more interesting than the tremendous efforts being made by the vast majority of Members to try to find some solution to this appalling problem.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful if the public were briefed on the provisions of this Bill which is one of the strongest anti-crime measures ever introduced.  Some think the Bill goes too far but others think it does not go far enough.  We must work within certain limits because under the Constitution we must recognise the freedom of the individual and people's liberties.</P>

    <P>The measures introduced in this Bill are a step in the right direction, the only step taken in the past number of years. Listening to some of the Opposition speakers, one would think that bail was not granted when Fianna Fáil was in office or that the right to silence was introduced only 14 months ago.  Some Deputies develop a passion for issues once they are out of office but they fail to show similar passion when in office. Miracles are expected to happen once there is a change of Government, yet these issues were not dealt with during the past seven years.  This shows insincerity. It would be better if people admitted it is a difficult problem to solve and that any Government, irrespective of its composition, must examine the matter carefully to find solutions. <Col N="367" /> The problem will not be solved by people pleading for it to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not ruled out changes in the bail laws or further examination of how to exploit every opportunity to suppress the drugs problem. We must be positive about this legislation.  No Bill has ever satisfied everyone.  This is a positive step by the Minister for Justice and she should be supported.  Once these measures are put into effect, she will be able to devote her attention to other issues such as the right to silence and bail.</P>
    <P>Drugs are one of the gravest threats to our society.  The deadly drugs trade, which must be wiped out, knows no boundaries.  It used to be an urban problem, but it is now also in rural communities. It is not confined to a certain class; if affects all sectors of our society.  Many victims are young people.  If the drugs trade was not as profitable, the problem would not have escalated to such an extent.  Once people are affected by drugs, they will do anything or pay any price to feed their habit.  The drug barons are reaping the rewards and they do not feel guilty about the effect drugs will have on their innocent victims. They are only interested in profits.  They will enjoy a lavish lifestyle with the money they make from those whose lives are destroyed.</P>
    <P>Even the dogs in the street know who the drug barons are.  We read stories in the newspapers about their lifestyle, yet they are free to continue their illegal trade.  We must ask ourselves why people who commit crime are not behind bars.  I understand it is difficult to catch these people committing a crime, but surely our system can be improved so that we can put them behind bars.  We must solve this problem because as long as drug barons are at large drugs will be imported and innocent victims will pay.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a comprehensive anti-drug package which will help to curb the problem.  Persons suspected of drug trafficking offences can now be detained for <Col N="368" /> a maximum of seven days.  That is welcome because we must give the Garda and those involved time to investigate suspects.  Up to now the amount of time the Garda could keep a person in detention was limited and this meant that people who could have been proven guilty were allowed to walk free.  The Bill also provides that further periods of detention after the first 48 hours may be authorised by a court before whom the person detained must be brought.  It also provides that persons arrested for a drug trafficking offence, where it is suspected that they concealed drugs on their person, can be taken into detention. We must allow the Garda to make urgent decisions.</P>
    <P>Time is of the essence in cases such as this.  An important section of the Bill allows members of the Garda Síochána, not below superintendent rank, to issue search warrants in drug trafficking cases where they are urgently required.  A delay in proceeding with a case often benefits a suspect.  Frequently suspects who drag matters out can walk free following a lapse of time.</P>
    <P>An important section of the Bill deals with the role played by customs officers in dealing with the drug-related crime. It provides that they will be allowed to question suspects detained by the gardaí on drug trafficking offences.  The Bill seeks to ensure that a unified approach will be adopted to tackling the problem. The Bill encourages co-operation among all those at any level who deal with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>There are many more provisions we would like included in the Bill, but we must proceed step by step.  Until now the Garda did not have sufficient resources or powers to deal with the reality of the problem.  If we are to succeed in the fight against the drugs menace &mdash; it is not an easy one &mdash; it is essential that we, as legislators, at all times give the Garda the necessary powers to deal with the reality of the drugs problem. By giving the Garda, who to date have done a great job in difficult circumstances, these powers, I hope the <Col N="369" /> drug barons will be isolated and removed from society.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise to anybody for the harsh measures contained in the Bill. When dealing with a serious problem we must have the courage to deal with it harshly.  In the long run we are being cruel to be kind.  If we succeed in stamping out the importation of drugs and in isolating drug traffickers, we will have some hope of saving a potentially innocent victim from getting caught up in the drugs scene.</P>
    <P>We should consider ways to encourage young people to have the courage to tell their parents and the gardaí of their experiences of drugs activity.  As a former teacher and a parent I find teenagers are willing to confirm they were offered drugs in town or in discos, but are fearful of disclosing information on where or who offered them drugs.  They know the lanes, streets and alleyways where such drugs activity occurs, but are motivated by fear that they will suffer if they disclose such information and, unfortunately, that may be the case. Students should be encouraged in schools to report their experiences of where and at what time they saw drugs activity in their towns or communities or who offered them drugs.  This information is needed, but the young people who have it are fearful of divulging it to the authorities.</P>
    <P>We accept that a lack of education is the root of the problem, but what are we doing within the education system to prevent people abusing drugs or to give them the confidence and courage to make a decision that they will not become ensnared in the drugs scene? Little, if any, time is devoted to this important education for life in the school curriculum.  Not sufficient courses or opportunities are available to teachers to ensure they are sufficiently conscious and concerned about this important issue.  Their time is taken up with teaching the school curriculum which is geared towards examinations. Much more could be done within the education system to address this matter and a positive worthwhile effort should <Col N="370" /> be made to do that not only at secondary, but at primary level.  Teachers should be able to attend appropriate courses and part of the school curriculum should be devoted to education for life.  Many teachers, like many parents, have never seen drugs and, therefore, would not recognise them.  How can they be expected to teach a successful course or convince young people not to become ensnared in the drugs scene when they do not have sufficient information?</P>
    <P>We should also concentrate on the enormous cost posed by the drugs menace, not only in money terms, but in terms of health, misery and despair.  It has involved costs for many hospitals which have had to set up drug units to treat addicts.  It also involves costs in terms of security and prison places.  The cost to this or any other State posed by the drugs menace is frightening.  We are familiar with pie charts which display public spending divided among social welfare, health, education and other areas, but I am sure we would be alarmed by the amount of the public spending devoted to dealing with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is one of the most important to come before the House because it deals with one of the greatest problems facing society.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it and I urge all parties in this House to co-operate in dealing with it.  It is important that all Members' views are noted in a positive manner and given in a co-operative one so that, together, we can make an impact in dealing with the drugs crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this long promised Bill provides the Garda with major additional powers, mainly in the detention of suspects on drug trafficking offences for a period ranging from 12 hours up to 14 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to Fianna Fáil's role in Government during the last number of years.  She indicated that there was inactivity on its part in <Col N="371" /> dealing with drug trafficking.  Legislation dealing with the confiscation of assets introduced by the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, provides the Minister with ample powers to assist her in dealing with this problem, but she has not done much about it.  As recently as two or three months ago I attended a meeting of concerned residents in the Coolock area on drug abuse.  Deputy Ahearn referred to the need to educate our young people on this matter, particularly in schools.  I made representations to the Minister for Education to put in place an education programme in Coolock, but I received a negative response, which is sad and disgraceful.  If Deputy Ahearn wants me to go down the avenue she explored about Fianna Fáil's input to this area I will be happy to do so.  Some aspects of her contribution were wide of the mark.</P>
    <P>It has proven extremely difficult to successfully prosecute those involved in illegal drug trafficking.  I congratulate and salute those who work at the front line in the Garda Síochana and Customs service for the confiscations to date.  I will not refer to the famous Urlingford case, known as the sting, because it has been debated sufficiently in this House. Our geographic position as an island nation close to the European base makes it easy for highly organised and sophisticated drug lords to operate the illegal drug trade.  They blatantly abuse the Garda and Customs service who have a difficult job policing our coastline.</P>
    <P>We must question why drug abuse has exploded in the past decade.  It is recognised that people get a kick out of drug use.  In the past 20 years there have been changing trends in drug use.  The present trend at rave discos is the use of the E tablet &mdash; I am sure in time that will be superseded by a more fashionable drug.  The explosion in the use of drugs is associated with financial gain. Huge profits are made from drug smuggling and drug pushing by drug lords who operate behind the scene.  That <Col N="372" /> matter must be tackled.  I referred earlier to the confiscation of assets.  Under section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1992, the Minister has power to freeze assets and drugs.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a major threat to society.  We are all aware of the knock-on effect of such abuse on communities. The crime wave which results from drug abuse must be addressed.  There is genuine concern about the increase in vicious drug-related offences involving violence.  It is incumbent on this House to find a solution so that confidence will be restored.  We have a huge young population who are targets for drug abuse.  Because of the hardship suffered by individuals and families as a result of drug abuse, this issue must be tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>I am not afraid to put on record that in the past I issued constituency newsletters on this matter, one of which, issued in the summer of 1995 and headed Let the Punishment Fit the Crime, received a huge response.  In that newsletter I indicated that it was time to play hard ball with crime, that we have suffered enough and that for far too long innocent people, particularly in Dublin, have put up with gurriers and &ldquo;druggies&rdquo;.  Robberies and assaults have become part and parcel of Dublin life and must be stopped.  The Garda and others in authority deserve our full support. It is time to take the gloves off and deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>In my newsletter I outlined measures that must be taken to deal with drug abuse.  For example, resources must be provided to combat the problem of drugs and drug-related crime.  Sentencing, early release and prison places must be considered and bail laws must be toughened.  A number of speakers dealt with the bail issue.  The Minister indicated by way of the national television network that within a matter of weeks or months she would hold a referendum on bail, but regrettably she has not met that commitment.  Perhaps the proposal is still under consideration at Cabinet and people are afraid to make a <Col N="373" /> decision on it.  I received immense feedback from my newsletter on the bail issue, which is an indication that people favour the introduction of radical measures.</P>
    <P>Other issues that must be considered include an increase in garda presence in city streets and residential areas, support services must be visible and community policing must be developed, with communities working with the Garda, neighbourhood watch programmes and liaison committees to assist in the prevention of crime.  We must introduce whatever measures are necessary to deal with the escalation of crime.  In my newsletter I indicated that the escalation in drug-related crime must be addressed.  There are no easy solutions.  Radical measures are required and I am prepared to lead the debate to address this issue.  This is one area in which initiative and action must be taken to make real progress.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the huge response to the effect that it was time these radical measures were adopted.  The radical measures I proposed were, a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in the case of drug barons and pushers, rehabilitation of drug addicts to reduce the demand for such drugs, improvement of our educational and detoxification facilities, and encouragement of registration of addicts and greater control of drugs.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate that followed the publication of my newsletter I specified that the overall objective was to eliminate financial gain from trafficking in drugs in the firm belief that there is no other method by which we can tackle the problem head on.  We must persuade known drug addicts to register, and give them the drugs they require freely until we are in a position to detoxify and rehabilitate them out of their usage.  While many such addicts want to come off drugs there are not sufficient detoxification or rehabilitative facilities available at present.</P>
    <P>By giving addicts the drug of their choice freely we would be removing the <Col N="374" /> financial gain from the marketplace thus lessening the incentive to import or smuggle them into this country.  I can assure the House that the absentee drug lords who rest on their laurels and enjoy huge financial gain from their activities, would not continue to do so for very long were that financial gain eliminated from the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that using taxpayers' money for the purchase of illegal substances would be a matter of considerable concern to society generally but, if we implemented a harnessed, properly targeted short-term programme to address this problem in the long term we would have a much healthier society.</P>
    <P>The number of drug addicts, regrettably, remains unknown.  Before attempting to address this huge problem, we should know the exact figure. While there are estimates of the numbers involved in the drugs scene, and of waiting lists for rehabilitative facilities and drugs substitution programmes, I suggest my proposal for their registration would highlight the precise numbers involved and identify the appropriate approach to be adopted in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to abuses of the present system.  I visited Mountjoy Prison and spoke to its Governor on the matter of abuse of drugs there.  While some three to five months ago the Minister for Justice promised to address this matter and devise a suitable package for its remedy, to date nothing has been done.  Whenever drug abuse is identified in Mountjoy or any other prison, it must be tackled head on by prohibiting all prison visits if such are perceived to be the cause.  The Minister does not need to await any additional reports on this issue.  We have sufficient in-house surveys to hand, we know there is a disgraceful abuse of drugs in that detention centre.  It is wrong that the Governor who readily admits that there is drug abuse there is afraid to take what he described as draconian measures to tackle it.  There is always the way out for those who find it too hot in the kitchen. If the Governor is not prepared to take <Col N="375" /> the necessary corrective measures to address the problem in his prison, he, and, indeed, the Minister, must acknowledge that the problem will continue.</P>
    <P>A doctor who practises in my constituency in the course of a letter to me stated:</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the question put forward by you to the Minister for Health re. drug addiction. I am a prison doctor, in a female prison, and I am dismayed at the extent of heroin abuse in Dublin city and in the prison; it seems to be escalating at an enormous rate.  Unfortunately, space is very limited, drug addicts are released early on temporary release without finishing a fraction of their sentences and before drug detoxification is complete.  No wonder they are back out reoffending.</P>
    <P>That doctor has his finger on the pulse of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Where was that doctor for the past ten years if he has only now discovered that problem?  He must be a contract doctor only in Mountjoy who prescribes methadone.  Would the Deputy put his name on the record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware also of genuine concern at the availability of methadone to addicts at satellite clinics which do not appear to be run very efficiently.  There are many &ldquo;hangers-on&rdquo; outside these clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had discussions recently with a voluntary group engaged in the implementation of a drugs programme in my constituency for addicts, already detoxified. Those addicts take part in the programme for three months for rehabilitative purposes, and receive the necessary confidence to reintegrate in society. I was assured by those involved in that programme, including the Garda, that it is very efficient and that most of its participants have been rehabilitated.  I pay tribute to those involved in the delivery <Col N="376" /> of that service.  I have no difficulty with such a service, if operated properly, but I am concerned about satellite clinics and the suggestion of enlisting general practitioners under the GMS to provide such a service.  If that suggestion is adopted young and old will be waiting in doctors' surgeries with drug addicts whose behaviour will be dictated by the substances to which they are addicted.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister include a provision in the Bill for a detained person to be informed within the time limit of the reason for their detention to give them an opportunity to consider their position and say what legal advice, if any, will be made available to them and if there will be a right of appeal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to contribute to this debate as I had an important appointment concerning the issue of drug abuse and treatment services for addicts.  I was provoked into coming by the contributions of the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Ahern, and Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>I represent Dublin South Central which has a major drugs problem. Unemployment and drug abuse are the two major problems facing this country and, unfortunately, both are linked.  I am conscious of developments in the south inner city of Dublin where drug abuse is endemic and many people have died of AIDS.  Of the 7,000 reputed addicts in the city, approximately 1,000 live in the Dublin 8 area of my constituency which is also involved in the treatment centres controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the struggle to rebuild a sense of community in the most deprived inner city flat complexes given the obstacles faced by the people living in them.  It is because of my admiration for honest, hard working citizens living in deplorable conditions particularly the flat complexes in the south inner city, that I have come into this House specifically to castigate the leader of Fianna Fáil and Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell of the Progressive Democrats for their outrageous <Col N="377" /> attack and political correctness <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Urlingford drugs seizure.</P>
    <P>I am critical of aspects of the Garda Síochána policing but in regard to the exercise by the Garda at Urlingford, it is crucially important that the message going out from this House is not one of condemnation or cheap political sniggering at the failure of the Garda to make an arrest.  I want the Garda to know that I applaud their adventurous but unsuccessful operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell, who was elected to represent one of the more deprived areas of his constituency in the south inner city, knows the type of ruthless gangsters that evaded arrest at Urlingford. He knows the havoc and the human misery they have wreaked on drug addicts, their families and victims and the sense of community that has been shattered in parts of the inner city. Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell are clearly recipients of leaks from the Garda Síochána but they should use that information in a balanced way.

    <P>I support this important Bill designed to target the drug barons but I ask the Minister to monitor it closely &mdash; I realise it will be reviewed in 12 months &mdash; to ensure it is not abused to target the so-called stuffers and swallowers. There is an inherent contradiction in the Bill in that the drug barons are not the people who stuff quantities of drugs into their rectums or swallow condoms full of heroin.

      <P>Will this legislation be used simply to target people who arrive at air or sea ports with drugs from the United Kingdom or Amsterdam?  I agree they should be apprehended but a seven day detention period is not necessary.  I hope after 12 months the drug barons, who are supposedly the target of this legislation, will be apprehended.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the outrageous suggestion by my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy McGahon, that drug barons should be shot.  When Deputy McGahon makes such statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we know he does not mean the Garda Síochána should shoot suspected drug barons.  What worries me most about that remark from Deputy McGahon &mdash; who should know better &mdash; is that he has a clear position on IRA gunmen when it comes to Northern Ireland.  I condemn his remarks out of hand because no sooner had he issued the call to shoot drug barons than people reputedly involved in the drugs trade were and are being shot in my constituency.  I would like to <Col N="380" /> ask Deputy McGahon one direct question. If the forces of the State will not do the shooting, who was he calling on to do it?  We see that the IRA names the top 40 dealers on a death list.  It is sadly ironic that Deputy McGahon who fought IRA terrorism in such an honourable way, should now make statements that give support to the Provisional IRA's death list.</P>
      <P>The reason I take this personally is that in my constituency a number of people involved in the drugs trade were murdered.  Recently, two people &mdash; known as the Viper and the Gantly &mdash; were shot in my constituency.  It is not proper that a message should go out from this parliament from Deputy McGahon that those who are armed should be encouraged to shoot people on the streets.  I do not mind when people die of natural causes, particularly drug dealers, but I do not want my innocent constituents to be caught in the crossfire.  There is likely to be crossfire because there is a crisis in some communities between their continuing to work with the Garda Síochána and the counter demand and pressure on them work with the vigilantes with republican paramilitary support.  I know where I stand in the struggle, on the side of understanding and sympathising with those residents whose lives have been wrecked in seeking solutions to the problem of drug addiction in their estates.  Today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> points out that a drug dealer, another constituent of mine, the same person who was initialled in the star list of 40 as GK has been sentenced to four years. Which route does Deputy McGahon wish to take?  Is it to support the shooting of drug dealers or drug barons or to respect and empower the Garda Síochána to go after these same drug dealers on the so-called dealth list of the IRA and put them behind bars where they are supposed to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise my extreme concern that communities in inner city flat complexes of about 360 flats, comprising in excess of 1,000 people, well known in the <Col N="381" /> national media, are in crisis.  The difficulty for them is which agency will resolve their crisis.  Daily, the children go down the steps which have obvious signs of tinfoil having been used for smoking cocaine, vomit, excrement and occasionally a discarded needle.  This is the reality for young children who are being sent to the local schools.  Instead of their lifestyle being improved they see drug barons, drug dealers and drug addicts growing in numerical strength and taking over and influencing the direction and running of flat complexes.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Justice to recognise that while these people do not represent an anti-Garda Síochána philosophy, they are easily seduced into the quick fix solutions being offered to them.  Sadly, we are on the threshold of major disturbances in our inner city.  I appeal to the Minister to develop within the Garda Síochána, in the local stations &mdash; Kevin Street or Kilmainham &mdash; a team of professional gardaí who understand the frustrations of the tenants and sympathise with them in their dilemma. The Garda must reassure the tenants that they are the arm of the State and capable of making the arrests that these people are demanding.  They should also reassure the people there that the Garda Síochána are not just using their flat complexes to observe the activities of the runners on behalf of the dealers. These people have a right to the peaceful enjoyment of their lives.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to convince people that the State is interested in them and wishes to protect them when, day in day out they see people injecting their veins and drug dealing and former tenants of the flat complexes moving into £100,000 houses less than half a mile away.  They see this but as a State we have not managed the problem.  Very soon we are likely to lose the battle for the minds and souls of these people.  If we lose that battle we will have to deal with another more complicated and more difficult set of agents who are ready to fill the vacuum.</P>

      <P>This welcome legislation <Col N="382" /> forms part of a comprehensive necklace of initiatives by the Government to combat the smuggling of drugs.  For too long many observers and commentators felt this was an international problem and that Ireland would escape it or, that if it did arrive, it would be in large urban conurbations and not an all-Ireland, urban and rural, problem, but it has well and truly exploded.  It is a problem in every city, town, village and parish.  It will require the co-ordinated efforts of the State, the Garda, health and education systems, parents, teachers and individuals all working together to ensure the problem does not escalate and that there will be no further victims. It is a pity that recent debates on this issue have been hijacked in a desire to generate publicity and exploit media opportunities regardless of the consequences.</P>

      <P>In answering these two questions together the Minister may have been confused.  I asked him the number of meetings that will take place outside Dublin.  We would all wish to see proper criteria for these meetings. There is a need for regionalisation.  I fear that a set of meetings will be held in Dublin and another in Galway with very little in between.  There is an opportunity to show that the location of meetings will be decided by their content. Will the Minister outline the work programme he wishes to instigate at these meetings and indicate whether the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will play any part in an inter-ministerial committee to monitor work during the six month period of the Irish Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union between 1 July 1996 and 1 January 1997 during which period I will be President of the Council of Ministers of Culture and Audiovisual Matters.  The usual arrangement is that a formal meeting is held towards the end of the period of the Presidency.  A number of informal Council meetings also take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number allocated for the period of the Irish Presidency is seven or eight, but I will not be holding an informal council meeting.  I have decided &mdash; this <Col N="384" /> was the practice, I think, during the Belgian Presidency &mdash; to hold a seminar to address issues affecting the Council of the Ministers of Culture and Audiovisual Matters which have accumulated during the past three years and to envisage the role of the Council in years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Galway seminar will address the issues of culture and democracy in an age of rapid technological change, leading in particular to the views of my colleagues in the Council of Ministers of Culture and Audiovisual Matters on the strengthening of Article 128 in Chapter VI of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Those are the meetings for which I will have responsibility.  Other meetings will also take place.  For example, meetings of experts will take place throughout the country where appropriate.  A suggested meeting of audiovisual experts is likely to be held at a venue such as DCU.  Should other meetings be held they will be held at the most appropriate venue.  I will bear in mind the Deputy's views on regionalisation which I share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Minister appreciates, the best way to demonstrate his interest is to ensure that such meetings take place in the regions.  I was interested to hear that he will have discussions on the issues affecting his Department.</P>
      <P>I was also interested to learn that the seminar in Galway will address the issues of culture and democracy.  I would be very interested in sitting in on what I have no doubt will be an interesting and academic discussion, but I fear this brings us back to the realm of rhetoric versus reality, as it was described in a recent editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I am not just looking to the future, but the current position.  That is the reason I am interested in hearing if the Minister intends to set up an inter-ministerial committee to monitor work during the six months of the Presidency. He can then talk about his plans for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also interested in hearing if the <Col N="385" /> Government is prepared to promote the use of the Irish language during the Presidency.  There appears to be a certain reluctance to include it on the agenda.  Is the Minister aware that Irish people who apply for EU jobs for which more than one language is required cannot count Irish as one of those languages? A similar restriction applies to 70 million others throughout the Union who speak what are now termed &ldquo;lesser used languages&rdquo;.  This is a matter of concern as Irish citizens are being discriminated against when it comes to job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to seek official status for the Irish language in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference arising from the Maastricht Treaty?  Does he realise and accept that this status would give Irish speakers access to the work and travel opportunities currently enjoyed by bilingualists from all other EU countries? As I am sure he is aware, over 500 jobs for highly qualified bilingualists could be created overnight in Brussels and elsewhere at no cost to the Exchequer if this policy was pursued.  Will he agree that such recognition would consolidate the efforts of many, North and South, to create a truly bilingual society?  As I am sure he is also aware, we are missing out on the much needed resources that would be available if the Irish language had such status.</P>

      <P>I will try to answer as briefly and succinctly as I can the three points raised by the Deputy.  On the first point I refer her to my comprehensive reply to the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which the words &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; and &ldquo;reality&rdquo; were used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be provoked into giving too many embarrassing facts.  When I became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the provision for the Arts Council was £10.1 million.  It is now £18.4 million, an increase of more than 80 per cent.  The <Col N="386" /> editorial referred to the gap between that £18.4 million and the £26 million required for the full plan and I described it as saying &ldquo;we want it all and we want it now&rdquo;.  I do not wish to delay on the issues of rhetoric or reality, but in the brief period when I was out of Government &mdash; between the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government and the present one &mdash; the provision for the Arts Council was decreased.  In the draft Estimates my acting successor, Deputy Ahern, proposed a cut in the provision for the council.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should read my reply and not waste the time of the House.  She should allow us move on to deal with the other matters raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will use every opportunity available to me to advance the status of the Irish language.  The number of jobs to which the Deputy refers is interesting.  I will speak in plain language.  The pass was sold in the Treaty negotiations on Irish accession to the Community.  That is the position I inherited.  Every opportunity will be taken at the meetings between 1 July 1996 and 1 January 1997 to ensure <Col N="387" /> the Irish language is given the recognition and status it deserves.  Improving the status of the Irish language from a recognised to a working language will be extremely difficult, but in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference every opportunity will be used to regain any ground lost at the time of accession. I have had discussions on this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In regard to co-ordinating practical work during the Presidency, Ireland will play a leading role on a number of important initiatives, such as Media II, the concluding Ariane and transfrontier directives.  The work of my Department and the council will be co-ordinated with the overall work of other Ministers participating in the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister at least give a guarantee that he will seek official language status for Irish?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

It is my wish that Irish be used as a working language and I will seek to advance that aim in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is the function of the Cultural Relations Committee, which was appointed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to make recommendations to the Tánaiste for expenditure on schemes for the promotion of Ireland's cultural relations abroad.  The establishment of a new independent agency to take account of the international dimension of arts development was mooted in The Arts Plan 1995-1997, published by An Chomhairle Ealaíon/the Arts Council, and which was subsequently approved in principle by the Government. The Deputy will also be aware that, at its meeting in January last, an chomhairle decided to redesignate the plan to cover the five-year period 1995-99. While discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs have not taken place to date on the suggestion of the Arts Council, I propose to embark on such discussions as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This issue was highlighted in the arts plan and I am sure we all support it.  I urge the Minister to have further discussions with his colleague to establish the arts agency.  I am sure he will agree the work of the Irish Literature Exchange, <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> and the Frankfurt Book Fair is important to the promotion of Irish arts abroad.  While the concept is laudable, will the Minister agree the working practices of <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> have not been satisfactory?  Some artists have referred to <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> as a mess.  Will the Minister examine the matter?  I am sure he knows that many of the contracts were signed only this week.  How many contracts have been signed with artists?</P>

      <P>
        <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> is a wonderful exhibition of contemporary Irish culture and I am looking forward to attending its official launch in Paris tomorrow.  The interest in it in France is so great that 500 people attended the press conference a few weeks' ago.  It will be important not only for its six months' duration but also for the enduring links it will establish between Irish artists and cultural institutions in France.</P>
      <P>This is a significant achievement on behalf of the commissioner, Doireann Ní Bhriain, and the committees in France and Ireland who put together a programme.  As <i>L'Imaginaire</i> is under the joint sponsorship of the President of France and Her Excellency, the President of Ireland, it would be inappropriate for me to interfere with its detail. Because it is the first large-scale exhibition of its kind in France, involving expenditure of £1.5 million, is preparation involved complicated negotiations about venues, artists and participants in France and Ireland.  I am satisfied with the arrangements and I am also pleased about the long-term contacts it will secure between institutions.</P>
      <P>There are complications regarding the visual arts in that some of the venues are under the control of the mayoralty of Paris or the French Government and others are under the control of individual cities.  I am pleased that arrangements so far have been successful.</P>

      <P>While the concept of <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> is laudable, two of the dance companies, Daghdha and Mandance, taking part in the dance element which will open at the Pompidou Centre next Wednesday did not secure contracts until this week.  Is the Minister aware that an arrangement for rehearsals by these companies at the Pompidou Centre are a mess?  I understand information given by the Irish <i>L'Imaginaire</i> office on the availability of rehearsal time has not proved correct and the dance companies that will arrive <Col N="390" /> in Paris on Tuesday afternoon may not have an opportunity to rehearse.  The first performance is on Wednesday night.  Many of those involved are frustrated by the level of organisation.  Will the Minister guarantee to inquire immediately about the rehearsal arrangements for these two dance companies? I suggest also that he request the file of correspondence between Daghdha and Mandance and the <i>L'Imaginaire</i> office so as to acquaint himself with the practical difficulties being experienced by these companies?  The Minister will probably say the day-to-day operation of the companies is not his responsibility but I am aware of his interest in this area and am sure he would wish to see these difficulties ironed out.</P>

Tugadh deabhrú ar an Athló sa Teach seo ar 31 Eanáir 1996 gur mion leasuithe amháin atá déanta ar an Scéim feabhsúcháin tithíochta agus nach gcuirfidh siad isteach ró-mhór ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is féidir liom an méid seo a rá futhu &mdash; níl tada iontu i gcomparáid leis an ngearradh siar tubaisteach ar na meastacháin tithíochta do 1995 a bhí aontaithe ag comhleacaithe an Teachta Ó Cuív agus an Teachta Ó Gallchóir i bhFianna Fáil nuair a bhíodar ag gníomhú mar Rialtas i mí na Samhna 1994.  Bhi ceannaire reatha Fhianna Fáil ina Aire Airgeadais agus ina Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta ag an am sin.  Murach gur cuireadh an drochchinneadh sin ar ceal nuair a bunaíodh an Rialtas nua agus nuair a tháinig mé fhéin ar ais ní bheadh deontais feabhsúcháin tithíochta ar bith ar fáil ó mo Roinnse ag muintir na Gaeltachta inniu.</P>
    <P>Meastar go mbeidh sabháil de thart ar £360,000 i gceist in aon bhliain amháin de bharr na leasuithe atá déanta i ndáil le deontais tithíochta de, ach ní shábhalfar an méid sin i 1996 toisc go bhfuil go leor iarratais idir lámha cheana féin den chineál atá i gceist sna leasuithe.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Scéim na mBóithre Áise is suim theoranta airgid a bhíodh ag mo Roinnse le caitheamh ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; rud a chiallaigh nach raibh ar a cumas freastal ach ar líon beag den iliomad iarratas ar chúnamh a fuarthas gach bliain.  Bhí sé de nós thart ar 800 iarratas a fháil agus obair a <Col N="393" /> dhéanamh ar thart ar 80.  Anuraidh, cur i gcás, is soláthar de £250,000 a bhí ar fáil agus ní rabhthas ach in ann deontais a cheadú i leith thart ar 80 bóthar nó timpeall 10 faoin gcéad den 800 iarratas nó mar sin a fuarthas.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol do Theachtaí, níl soláthar i Vóta mo Roinne i mbliana le haghaidh caiteachas ar bhóithre Gaeltachta. Ar ndóigh, is ceist go príomha don Roinn Comhshaoil agus do na Comhairlí Contae iomchuí í staid na mbóithre sa Chaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheidh cúrsaí níos soiléire thart lár na bliana seo maidir le caiteachas mo Roinne i 1996 ar Scéimeanna Feabhsucháin sa Ghaeltacht, breithneofar an scéal tuilleadh, i gcomhairle leis an Aire Airgeadais, féachaint an dtig linn soláthar éigin a chur ar fáil i mbliana chun bóithre aise agus bóithre portaigh sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú.</P>

      <P>Tá sé ráite go minic ag an Aire go raibh gearradh siar déanta ag an Rialtas a bhí ann i mí na Samhna 1994 go dtí deireadh na bliana sin.  An bhféadfadh sé fianaise a thabhairt dom i scríbhinn ar an ráiteas sin?  Ní fhaca mise é sin riamh i scríbhinn.</P>
      <P>An dara ceist a bheadh agam ar an Aire ná an nglacann sé leis anois go bhfuil trí scéim ann anois do dhaoine ós cionn 66 bliain d'aois ach nach bhfuil aon scéim feabhsúcháin tithíochta ann ó thaobh dóirse agus fuinneoga do dhaoine faoi bhun 66 bliana d'aois.  Is iad na trí scéim do dhaoine os cionn 66 bliain d'aois ná Scéim an Bhoird Sláínte, Scéim an Chomhairle Contae agus Scéim Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Daoine atá faoi bhun na haoise seo agus a bhfuil drochchaoi ar a ndóirse agus a bhfuinneoga, an nglacfadh an Aire leis nach bhfuil aon scéim ann dóbh sin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freisin, ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire, céard faoi na daoine a raibh iarratas déanta acu roimh an lá &mdash; agus níor thug an tAire aon fhógra go raibh an rud seo ag teacht isteach &mdash; agus gur cuireadh an t-iarratas ar ais chucu mar nach raibh uimhir chláraithe chonraitheora ar an iarratas.  An bhfuil sé i <Col N="394" /> gceist ag an Roinn na hiarratais sin a ghlacadh?</P>
    <P>Céard faoin na daoine a raibh fiosrúcháin déanta acu leis an Roinn agus teangmháil déanta leis an gcigire acu nó go raibh siad ag fanacht go dtiocfadh an cigire amach ach nach raibh iarratas foirmeáilte déanta acu chuig an Roinn roimh an sprioclá mar nár thuig siad go raibh aon phráinn leis, an bhfuil an tAire sásta glacadh le hiarratais ó na daoine sin?</P>

      <P>An nglacfadh sé leis gur ar éigean a bhí an tAire Airgeadais/ Gaeltachta i rith an tréimhse idir an t-am ar shiúl Páirtí an Aire amach as an Rialtas agus an lá a dtáinig siad ar ais leis an méid corraíle a bhí ann agus an méid freagracht a bhí ar an Rialtas, gur ar éigean a bhi aon Aire ag breathnú ar mhionsonraí na meastacháin ag an bpointe sin toisc an oiread brú a bhí ar gach Aire ag an am agus gur seafóid a bheith ag tarraingt anuas na ceiste sin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé ráite ag an Aire cúpla uair go bhfuil an comhairle contae agus an Roinn Comhshaoil ann le breathnú i ndiaidh na mbóithre áise.  An dtuigeann <Col N="396" /> an tAire gurb eard atá i gceist le bóithre áise go príomhà ná bóithre nach bóithre comhairle contae iad agus gurb é a dhéantar freastal ar na bóithre sin ar an ngnáthbhealach &mdash; bóithre portaigh nó bóithre ag dul chuig tithe, rud atá coitianta i gConamara &mdash; ná tríd an scéim LIS.  An nglacann an tAire leis go bhfuil liosta 25 bliain i nGaillimh don scéim LIS agus nár tháinig aon ardú substaintiúil ar airgead do na scéimeanna sin i mbliana?  Mar sin is eard atá á rá ag an Aire le daoine ná má theastaíonn bóthar áise nó bóthar portaigh uathu nach bóthar comhairle contae é go mbeidh orthu fanacht sé nó seacht nó ocht mblianta chun é a fháil déanta.  An bhfuil bunús leis an rud a dúirt innealltóir de Chomhairle Contae na Gaillimhe liomsa ó athraíodh an scéim, dá mbeadh cúig bhliain eile den scéim mar a bhí sé, go mbeadh deireadh curtha le fadhb na mbóithre i gConamara?</P>

      <P>Níl aon eolas agam faoin dtuairim seo atá nochtaithe ag innealltóir de Chomhairle Contae na Gaillimhe.  Bheadh áthas orm dá mbeadh sé fíor.  An fianaise atá ann domsa ná go raibh 800 iarratas ann agus go raibhamar ag freastal ar 80 in aghaidh na bliana.  Tá mé sásta athbhreithniú a dhéanamh i lár na bliana más féidir ach an rud atá tábhachtach ó thaobh scéimeanna feabhsúcháinde, go raibh a lán rudaí eile le déanamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá méadú de 6 faoin gcéad sa scéim feabhsúcháin agus tá géarghá le hobair eile a dhéanamh agus ceapaim go raibh an scéim mí-éifeachtach. Caithfimid fé an féidir freastal ar na cásanna is géire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil airgead breise ag teastáil don scéim LIS má táimid chun feabhas a fheiceáil ansin.  Maidir faoin rud seafóideach a chuir an Teachta i mo leith, is féidir liom a rá go raibh an tAire sealadach ag obair sa Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta idir a deich a chloig ar maidin agus leath uair tar éis a deich istoíche ón mhaidin a tháinig mé féin ar ais mar Aire na Roinne sin.  Scríobhfaidh mé litir chuig an Teachta ag nochtadh an eolas atá ar <Col N="397" /> fáil dó agus má theastaíonn sé uaidh, níl aon bhac ormsa é a chur ar fáil don phobal chomh maith.</P>

      <P>Bhí scéim de shaghas éigin ann ag an Roinn go dtí seo.  B'fhéídir nach raibh an scéim nó a reachtáíl ró-shásúil ach ar a laghad bhí scéim ann agus níl scéim ann anois.  An nglacfadh an tAire leis má theastaíonn uainne mar náisiún, muintir a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh caoi de shaghas éigin ar na bóithre áise agus go mbeadh meastachán ceart foirmúil curtha isteach ó thosach na bliana sa cháináisnéis agus teacht ag an Roinn ar mhéid áirithe airgid ó thús na bliana a bheadh ringfenced i gcóir bóithre áíse na Gaeltachta.

Ní raibh an seanscéim sásúil nó éifeachtach agus ba mhaith liom a rá go poiblí go raibh an milleán ar gach taobh den Teach go raibh sé i bhfad ró-pholaitiúil.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 26 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I have approved in principle the funding of eight projects submitted to me under the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee which I have established for this purpose will now consider and make recommendations to me on the other applications received.  I expect this process will take approximately two months to complete and I hope to be in a position to announce details of further projects to which funding will be offered in May.  Decisions will be made on the applications submitted in respect of the Cill Rialaig project, the Portmarnock Community School Theatre and the Virginia Community Theatre during this process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information.  Is he aware of the feeling among people in the arts world that the cultural needs of over 500,000 people in the three new Dublin council areas have been neglected by the Arts <Col N="399" /> Council over the years as it has given priority to city areas?</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Portmarnock application is being considered. Does the Minister accept there is a need for a cultural focus for the north Dublin region, in particular, as there are no suitable venues for cultural events? Does he accept the proposal is a tremendous opportunity to provide a theatre that will reach people of all ages across the social spectrum, particularly young people, who will not travel from the outlying areas of North County Dublin into the city centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful to the Deputy if I explained the process we are following.  To give an idea of the great interest there was when we placed the advertisements, we received 170 applications for projects valued at £87 million.  The amount available is £19.7 million plus contributions from local authorities etc.  The way in which it has been operating &mdash; and it enables people to understand how the decisions have been taken &mdash; is that all the applications were referred to the Arts Council to see where they fitted in, in terms of an arts assessment in the context of the plan. Bord Fáilte, on an agency basis for my Department, looked at the financial viability of each project.  In addition, a committee which I established, and which the House also wanted, in relation to regional balance vetted each project in terms of its regional significance. The next round, after these eight, will be announced in the month of May.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point because it is important to assure him and the House that major national and cultural institutions provision in the centre of Dublin cannot be taken as providing automatically for the areas he describes.  They have made a good case in their own right.  They have completed the process and they should be included in the May evaluation.  Later in the summer we will advertise again to see other projects that might have missed the closing date in relation to the first advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> On the Deputy's other points I take his concerns very seriously.  Giving access to people of all ages, and to people in age groups that perhaps have been underprovided for in the past, is a factor which must and will be borne in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the Minister's response.  This project has planning permission.  The dramatic societies and other arts organisations fully support it.  Will the Minister ensure that it gets equal consideration with the other applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it will be treated as fairly as all the others, and there will be no undue delay on my part once I receive the recommendations from the final group assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocations made to date under this scheme were made in accordance with criteria that would be acceptable to any right-minded promoter of the arts.  Will the priorities of the five-year arts plan be taken fully into account when future grants are made under this heading?  I have in mind specifically that Cork city has been designated as a centre of excellence for the visual arts and the need there is, if that is to become a reality, to make provision for studio space for practising artists and also for artists' residences and other provisions of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is taken into account in the first threshold of evaluation that I spoke about.  Deputies will appreciate also that I have described a threefold process of evaluation before recommendations come to me.  Projects differ in quality.  Questions may arise on one project that do not arise on another. Rather than using that as an excuse for dismissing projects, every effort is made to try to secure the information so that it can move on to the evaluation process. I assure the Deputy that the integration of the focus of the plan with the <Col N="401" /> decision making process is and will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I have given the percentage increase.  One of the difficulties of putting total expenditure figures together is that the Arts Council does not differentiate between the sources of its funding when paying out to different applicant organisations.  On the sentiment expressed by the Deputy on the overall sharing out of lottery funds, I should imagine that my Department is not receiving at all what it should receive.  Representing arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, our proportion of the lottery should be very much more.  Whenever this debate arises I shall look forward to the Deputy's support.</P>

    <P>Tá fhios ag na Teachtaí, ní foláir, go bhfuil socraithe, i gcomhréir le cinneadh an Rialtais den 20 Nollaig 1995, go ndéanfar na costais chaipitil móide na costais reatha a bhainfidh le Téilifís na Gaeilge a mhaoiniú ón Státchiste agus ón airgead atá carnaithe as an bhfarasbarr ar an teorainn ioncaim a leagadh síos faoin Acht Craolacháin, 1990, agus atá coimeádta ag RTÉ.  Is é an costas caipitil measta don stáisiún nua ná £16.1 milliún.  D'aontaigh an Rialtas freisin go gcuirfí soláthar de £10 milliún in aghaidh na bliana ar fáil ar bhonn leanúnach i leith na gcostas reatha. Chomh maith leis sin, cuirfidh RTÉ uair an chloig amháin de chláir ar fáil saor in <Col N="403" /> aisce don stáisiún nua.  Meastar go mbeidh sé sin dóthaineach lena chumasú don stáisiún dhá uair an chloig de chláir a thairiscint in aghaidh an lae í dtosach báire, gan dul i muinín ardaithe sa cheadúnas teilifíse.  Is gnó do Chomhairle Théilifís na Gaeilge, i gcomhairle le hÚdarás RTÉ, modhanna a mholadh chun go bhféadfaí maoiniú, nach ón Státchiste é, a ghiniúint do chláir breise. Níl moltaí dá leithéid faighte agam go dáta.</P>

      <P>The Minister said, in effect, that Teilifís na Gaeilge will not be self-financing.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £16.1 million.  Will the taxpayer have to pick up the tab for that?  If the taxpayer does not subsidise the station directly will the licence fee be increased or will funding be acquired from advertising revenue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital costs of £16.1 million associated with Teilifís na Gaeilge will bring a transmission system into existence which will initially broadcast for two hours in Irish but will be available to carry out other broadcasting functions.  As regards running costs of £10 million, when I repealed the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act in 1993, RTÉ had accumulated funds above the restrictions imposed on it in 1990 of the order of £17 million. Some £6 million was left to assist in establishing Teilifís na Gaeilge and that was to be supplemented by Exchequer funding.  RTÉ will make a case for an increase in licence fees on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision to establish Teilifís na Gaeilge received all party support.  It is important to establish such <Col N="404" /> a service for cultural reasons and it would be curious if at the end of this century we had a choice of 200 television services without one being in the Irish language.  It is extraordinary that those who are opposed to this service express little concern about the other 199 services.  Funding, other than Exchequer funding, is a matter for Comhairle Teilifís na Gaeilge and the RTÉ Authority who have discussed these matters.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled by the funding arithmetic.  It will take £40 million to fund three hours of broadcasting and half that cost will be borne by RTÉ. How will the cost of the remainder be carried in the long-term?  There will be a skeleton service at the beginning but when that is increased will the cost to RTÉ increase accordingly?</P>

      <P>I put the proposals for Teilifís na Gaeilge to Government and I know the decisions that were taken.  It was always understood that one hour would be provided by RTÉ as the national broadcaster.  If RTÉ did not do so could it in truth claim to be the national broadcaster in the widest sense of that term?</P>
      <P>The station will be funded by the Exchequer.  It was stated recently on a programme that, looked at one way S4C had £59 million and, looked at another way it had £70 million but until you have £59 million or £70 million to spend you should not try to spend it.</P>
      <P>There are those who suggest that if RTÉ had a different attitude towards the Irish language we would be in a stronger position.  Many of us regard the Irish language as part of our national identity and we are providing for that.</P>

In January 1995 he made a statement on the running costs of Teilifís na Gaeilge and RTÉ's responsibilities.  However, he seemed to do a U-turn on that in 1996 <Col N="405" /> and gave RTE additional responsibility for the running costs of Teilifís na Gaeilge. Will he consider setting up a structure for such funding rather than leaving it vaguely as Exchequer funding?</P>

      <P>I will deal with the structures for Teilifís na Gaeilge when I amend the broadcasting legislation.  To ensure that Teilifís na Gaeilge would be established I took decisions even though the legislation was quite old.  There are no difficulties with RTE providing one hour's service.  Fruitful negotiations have been held between Comhairle Teilifís na Gaeilge and Udarás Radio Teilifís Éireann which I appreciate.  I am grateful to the engineering and technical staff of RTE for running with the timescale. As a result we will be able to meet the broadcasting date.  It will be an exciting experiment.  RTE has not received a television licence fee increase for a long time.  However, that is a separate matter.  I am happy that the new station will be successful and the initial funding is adequate.</P>

      <P>Am I correct in saying that the channel will be utilised for 12 hours each day?  I do not know why it appears as Teilifís na Gaeilge in the Estimates since it will be used for many different purposes.  Does the Minister agree that the capital costs associated with two or three hours' broadcasting in Irish will be in the region of £6 million rather than £16 million?  Is the Minister surprised that this service which will provide employment and develop that unique part of our heritage is questioned when there is not a murmur about the proposal to spend £17 million on providing three or four railway stations in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first point is an interesting exercise in mathematics. He made the same point as I made, that you will be able to allocate the capital costs properly in the future when you look at the usage.  We are providing £16.1 million capital for a transmission system, of which as the Deputy <Col N="406" /> mentioned &mdash; I agree with him &mdash; only a proportion of transmission time will be for Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot answer him directly because the proposed usages have been submitted to Comhairle Teilifís na Gaeilge and others for further consideration.  When they have been assessed one could begin to look at it like that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct in his second point on employment which is regularly misrepresented.  It will create about 250 jobs or certainly 230 jobs, 30 high quality jobs directly and 200 jobs in the independent production sector.  In the first round of commissioning more than 20 companies participated and more than 40 companies North and South participated in the second round of commissioning.  Teilifís na Gaeilge is creating excitement in the Gaeltacht in terms of jobs in new technology for highly educated people.  The person operating the camera when I was interviewed recently was a young woman as was the person handling sound for a programme to be transmitted abroad. They will be making programmes apart from their work with Teilifís na Gaeilge. When history comes to be written it will be the subject of a great thesis as to who precisely was so bitterly antagonistic towards this project which is crucial in my view.  It is a statement to the end of the century about diversity of culture and it is about democracy.</P>

To say at this stage that you can afford and use revenue figures to justify the total swamping of the viewing and listening public in Ireland <Col N="407" /> on criteria simply to do with what it costs to turn something on or off would be a draft, hopeless and anti-democratic policy for broadcasting at the end of this century.</P>

      <P>Television receiving licences are issued under the provisions of sections 5 and 6 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  Under the Act, the consent of the Minister for Finance is required before I can make any alteration in the level of the television licence fee.  It is a matter of long-standing practice that decisions to increase television licence fees are taken by Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the level of the licence fee has not been changed since 1986 and I feel that it is not inappropriate to review the level of the licence fee after so many years.

      <P>Is it the Minister's understanding that it will be necessary to increase the licence fee to enable RTE to meet the additional commitments being placed on it by law?  On the one hand RTE is expected to provide £7 million for the funding of Teilifís na Gaeilge, which we have discussed, and is required by law to make 20 per cent of its expenditure available to the independent television makers by 1999, three years away.  It makes 6 per cent of its expenditure available at present.</P>

      <P>The latest figures I have seen for the provision of one hour's television by RTE to Teilifís na Gaeilge is between £5 million and £5.5 million, and not £7 million.  Having a good RTE requires addressing the issue of its income and the level of the licence fee.  I repeat that RTE seems to have made a good and sustainable case on its own grounds irrespective of the question of this hour.  Would it not be rather extraordinary to have lived from 1986 to 1996 and needed the requirement of one hour in Irish to electrify the case for a licence fee increase?  On the independent sector, it has been very good for the film making community and it is good for RTE and has meshed nicely in regard to future broadcasting policy.</P>
      <P>RTE has made a good case.  I am reflecting on it and it is my conclusion that it is not inappropriate to consider whether the licence fee is adequate at this time and to go to Government on that basis.  We have to consider whether that is appropriate.  RTE can make its own case.  There are other factors that the Deputy did not mention such as that the station has to reinvest in capital, regear its staff and that it has an important and exciting programme of regionalisation and so on.  The case for a licence fee increase is not predicated on the narrow base of either of the two points that have been made.</P>

      <P>This question arises in relation to policy points which must be considered, for example, in Europe in relation to the television <i>sans frontieres</i> and its application.  Does the Deputy want the national broadcaster to be split &mdash; in other words, RTE is a national broadcaster when it is doing one thing but not when it is doing something else?  If one makes the national broadcasting system function in a mixed way, will it be able to divide itself regularly in relation to one part of its activity or another?  This question is crucial in terms of the decision on the implementation of conditions &mdash; for example, how to define the proportion of home produced programmes.  There is a big difference between RTE and Mr. Berlusconi's stations in Italy.  The Green Paper looks at this issue but one must be careful not to be driven into an inoperable stance while living in the mixed world of broadcasting and competition because the benefits of the licence fee are enjoyed.</P>

      <Quest>whether details of the meeting between the Committee on European Affairs and the National Association of Regional Game Councils has been brought to his attention; if so, the action, if any, he intends taking on certain issues raised such as the destruction of wildlife by continental tourists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While the official report of the proceedings of the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on 8 December 1995 is not yet available, I have received a copy of the presentation made by the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC) to the joint committee.  I subsequently met the joint committee on 20 February 1996 to discuss the matters raised by the NARGC and related issues and have arranged for a copy of my presentation to the committee to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>My primary responsibility under the Wildlife Act, 1976, is for the conservation of wildlife, including migratory species of wild birds which are also of interest to the NARGC.  Both the NARGC and I agree that controlled or sustainable hunting does not pose a threat to such species of wild birds.  This is the concept of &ldquo;wise use&rdquo; or &ldquo;sustainable yield&rdquo; whereby the yield taken from the population through hunting on an annual basis does not compromise the survival of the population.  The conservation requirements of the species are met through the provision of a limited hunting season under section 24 of the 1976 Act.  This restricts the hunting of the species by resident and foreign hunter alike.</P>
      <P>The draft heads of a Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, are currently in preparation in my Department.  Provision is being made for additional measures for the control of tourist shooting by introducing regulations for the licensing of game shoot promoters. The role of gillies will be addressed in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NARGC's submission to the <Col N="412" /> joint committee makes a number of references to tourists shooting non-huntable species and to trespassing.  I have no doubt that some tourists breach our laws and, indeed, so do a small minority of resident hunters.  However, the extent of abuse by tourists is, I feel, exaggerated and is not supported by good evidence. When there is sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution, rest assured that my Department will pursue the matter.  The NARGC, through its regional game councils as recognised bodies under the wildlife code, has a role to play here in that they can prosecute proceedings for certain breaches of the 1976 Act.  It is essential that evidence be supplied in good time so that a summons can be served before the offender leaves the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that migratory species are under threat due to the activities of continental tourist shooters. So long as such shooting is sustainable, I see no reason why it should not continue. I am conscious that the system of control needs further regulation and, as I mentioned earlier, I intend to address that matter in the proposed amendments to the Wildlife Act, 1976.  I propose to introduce the amending Bill later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not rest assured with that reply.  Does the Minister believe that wildlife destruction is not serious? Is he telling us that tourists are not shooting song birds or endangered species such as snipe and woodcock, which the National Association of Regional Game Councils mentioned at the joint committee?  Tourists are shooting song birds and all types of endangered species and no action is being taken against them.  I have yet to see such a tourist appearing in court on a charge.  Has the Minister any intention of employing additional staff to ensure that a major part of our heritage is not wiped out?</P>

      <P>As regards the Deputy's final point, there is a need for more staff but that must be agreed in the context of the overall level of public service <Col N="413" /> staff.  I emphasise that the absence of evidence and of people willing to come forward has blocked prosecution in a number of cases.  However, if evidence is provided, I will not be reluctant to prosecute any case which is brought to the attention of my staff.  I intend to improve the procedures on the licensing of game shoot operators and of gillies, but I also want to improve the method of compiling and monitoring reports on what is in the bags of hunters.  There is room for improvement and I am anxious to do something in this regard.</P>
      <P>We will be on much stronger ground when the Bill to amend the Wildlife Act is passed.  Part of the NARGC's submission dealt with section 22 of the Firearms Act, which is within the remit of the Minister for Justice.  I intend to incorporate section 22 into the amended Wildlife Act.</P>

      <P>There has been a series of cases where prosecutions should have been taken but were not.  Tourists have been caught trying to smuggle wounded endangered species out of the country, but no action has been taken against them.  People are bewildered as to why no action was taken.  Perhaps the Minister could explain why that was the case.</P>
      <P>Will the embargo on employing people in the public service stop the Minister from employing additional wild life rangers?  There are two mountain ranges in my county but there is only one ranger.  That is inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The restrictions on recruitment into the public service will affect this situation.  I appreciate the Deputy's support as I make the case to members of the Cabinet.  Many necessary appointments will not go ahead because of the attempt to curtail the total number in the public service.  We are trying to find a way around that by seeking a new focus for essential recruitment. I would like to appoint people to essential posts, but we are affected by the embargo.  We must look at ways around that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised another point <Col N="414" /> about tourists smuggling birds through Dublin Airport.  Members of NARGC were present in the gallery when I made a submission at a meeting of the joint committee on the case of a tourist whose bag, which contained a dead swan, was opened before he boarded an ALITALIA flight at Dublin Airport. The individual boarded the plane and the dead swan was left behind.  As the Garda authorities were not contacted by a member of the airport staff, local police or an individual, Department officials investigating the matter later found there was a serious deficiency in evidence that could be used to prosecute the individual, even outside the country.  I am glad attention was drawn to this case.  Under existing law it is possible in such circumstances to seize an individual's guns and equipment.  I wish we had been able to do so on that occasion.  If the individual concerned had been detained, I would not have been reluctant to ensure he was prosecuted.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that since I raised this matter during Question Time a month ago there appears to be some improvement in addressing such matters.  Having listened to members of the NARGC, the Minister recognises the difficulties it faces in dealing with tourism shooting.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate when he intends to introduce the wildlife amendment Bill?  He said it would be introduced later this year, but at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs he said it would be introduced before the summer recess.  Can I take it that the legislation will be introduced sometime between April and July?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy why I cannot give her that undertaking.  I encountered a four week delay in dealing with the matters in the Bill that could give rise to legal and constitutional difficulties.  It would be more realistic to introduce the Bill in the early autumn, but it is my aspiration to introduce it before the summer recess.  I <Col N="415" /> would be misleading the Deputy if I did not say the delay in dealing with technical, legal and constitutional aspects of the Bill will mean its introduction four weeks behind schedule.</P>

      <P>The survey indicates that Keshkerrigan is by far the most overcrowded location.

      <P>Will the Minister deal with the provision of additional facilities in Ballyconnell as a matter of urgency? A survey carried out by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte Éireann indicates that the projections for the use of the Erne-Shannon Waterway have surpassed all aspirations. Problems will arise in the coming season as the existing facilities in Ballyconnell are inadequate.  I appeal to the Minister to ask the Department to treat this matter with the utmost urgency.  This waterway was restored to generate an economy devastated by the troubles in the <Col N="416" /> North and it is particularly appropriate to augment its economic position now.</P>

We will immediately provide the moorings at Keshkerrigan.  If I can identify a way of bringing forward the projects concerned, I will do so.  It is important that we should respond to the increased interest in this area and I will investigate if a delay in proceeding with a project in another area would enable me find the money to provide some of the other facilities required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be relevant to the legislation but it is relevant to the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a comprehensive response from the State, voluntary agencies, parents, teachers and the gardaí to address the escalating drugs problem.  This problem exists in every <Col N="467" /> city and town and all parts of rural areas.</P>
    <P>I note that an interesting recent indicator of the extent and seriousness of the problem is the number of taxis in which security barriers have been installed to protect the drivers from increasing attacks by crazed drug addicts looking for money to feed their habits.</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of a comprehensive package drafted by the Government to respond to the drugs problem. It is important that the gardaí and all State agencies involved in this battle should have the confidence of all Members of this House.  It is unfortunate that in dealing with events in recent weeks personal gain and promotion were put before the welfare of those agencies.  I refer the Urlingford issue.  We must take seriously the statement from Garda headquarters that personnel have been put at risk by the reckless disregard of Members of this House.  That is extremely regrettable. Given that sensitive information is being leaked from the Garda and other agencies, it is essential that the promised legislation, to deal with the problems in the GRA and provide for a cohesive Garda force, be introduced as quickly as possible.  It is important that rank and file gardaí are united in their pursuit of the criminal.  There is a perception that a disproportionate amount of time is consumed by the internal politics of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The question of deploying gardaí to the maximum benefit of the community must be considered.  I welcome the Government decision to abandon proposals to extend the rural policing scheme, which was introduced in certain areas on a pilot basis, because it did not work.  One of the critical aspects of good detection, detention and prosecution of offenders is intelligence gathering. There is a significant body of evidence to suggest that the rural policing scheme, where a garda from a neighbouring town drives to a village to open the local Garda station for two hours or <Col N="468" /> so and expects the people to provide information, has not worked.  The rapport necessary between the Garda and the people is lacking in circumstances where there is not a local Garda presence. I have grave reservations about the effectiveness of this scheme, which operates in parts of my constituency.</P>
    <P>There should be a study of the crime detection rate in areas where this scheme operates.  The policy whereby gardaí live and work in the local community should be pursued by the Minister and those responsible for the deployment of Garda personnel.  If a garda lives and works in the local community, is involved in local organisations and is on first name terms with many of the people it is a significant deterrent to crime.  There should be incentives for gardaí to live in the area in which they work and a commitment should be given by the Garda authorities that gardaí will remain in one area for a certain length of time.</P>
    <P>A large number of gardaí from rural areas stationed in the Dublin metropolitan area are anxious to be transferred to their local areas.  Perhaps consideration could be given to those willing to give a commitment to live in the area to which they are assigned, and a clause relating to such a commitment could be included in the recruitment contract.  These are essentially matters for the Garda authorities, but they should be taken on board.  This proposal may not be as simple as it sounds in that other factors must be taken into consideration such as a spouse working or children attending college, but the principle is a good one.  From constituency experience I believe &mdash; perhaps the Minister will contradict me in this regard &mdash; there is a lower level of rapport between local people and gardaí in communities where gardaí are not living in or familiar with the area in which they work, and consequently a poorer level of crime detection.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures which provide for increased powers of detention, search warrants and so on.  It is important that the Garda is armed with <Col N="469" /> the necessary resources to enable it to deal with the menace of drugs, and this legislation is an important step in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. The drugs issue is undoubtedly the biggest problem facing my constituents in Dublin.  Progress has been made in many areas, but in spite of the tremendous growth rates in the economy in recent years, developments in Northern Ireland and availability of Structural Funds, the feel-good factor is missing because of the overwhelming effect of the drugs problem and associated crime, particularly in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Recently I attended the funeral of a teenage girl from my constituency who died as a result of heroin abuse.  Present were many of her young friends, some of whom have drug problems and are on the brink of being sucked into the drugs culture, which is prevalent throughout Dublin.  Successive Governments and State agencies have failed those people. We offer them very little in terms of life opportunities.  In many cases they are condemned to a life of misery and sometimes to death because of our failure to tackle the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>I am not making a personal attack on the Minister for Justice or the Government. The heroin problem has existed in Dublin for many years and it is only now we are starting to take it seriously. Part of the reason we are only beginning to deal with the problem now is that it is starting to affect rural areas.  That is an indication that Dublin issues are neglected and overlooked and do not receive the attention they warrant until similar problems affect the wider community in rural Ireland &mdash; there is a very strong rural bias in all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is part of the Government's overall package to deal with the drugs problem.  It is the first step in tackling the problem in a co-ordinated way, with the involvement of a number of Departments. Having said that, the provisions of this Bill fall very short of what is <Col N="470" /> required and are utterly inadequate to tackle the huge drugs problem in Dublin. Having read press releases and listened to various Ministers on the subject, I do not detect the sense of urgency required to tackle this problem which is affecting so many other aspects of our lives.</P>
    <P>This overall package is designed to cater for treatment of drug addicts.  We know there are approximately 7,000 heroin addicts in this city.  It is my firm belief that the key to tackling the crime problem is to eliminate the drugs problem. There is very little point in placing somebody with a serious drug addiction problem in a prison like Mountjoy where it is more likely to be exacerbated than treated or eliminated.</P>
    <P>The package before the House on the treatment of drug addicts is very short on specifics.  Of the 7,000 known drug addicts in this city, some 2,000 await rehabilitative services.  They want to avail of services to help in dealing with their addiction, yet such services are not available to them.  The package is very vague on the number of additional places to be provided on drugs treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>While there is reference in the package to the problem of those who smoke heroin, we have no idea precisely what is proposed.  Members' attempts to elicit such information by way of parliamentary questions to the Minister have been unsuccessful.  I am not at all sure that problem is being taken seriously.  I wonder whether some people dealing with this problem at departmental level are aware of or understand the dynamics of the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the provisions of this Bill but I must ask whether it will cater for those most in need.  This week the Incorporated Law Society expressed its concern that the real drug barons will not be caught under the provisions of this Bill.  While it may be successful in tackling smaller drugs dealers, generally referred to as the stuffers and swallowers, many more important criminal justice measures need to be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> Our first priority must be to tackle the operations of the large drug barons who have extremely luxurious lifestyles, the most intimate details of which can be read daily in our newspapers. Journalists appear to encounter no difficulty in ascertaining the details of their lifestyles, the types of cars they drive, the jewellery they wear and the holidays they take.  To all intents and purposes they appear to be untouchable.  Why is that the case?  We know that the necessary powers to tackle this problem are vested in officials of the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Welfare and that many of these drug barons are signing on for the dole and receiving other social welfare benefit. What is being done about it?</P>
    <P>Such lack of action is the most appalling example for anybody living on the fringes and considering a career in crime.  It is quite clear to every young person in Dublin city that crime does pay, that ill-gotten gains from drug dealing enable criminals to enjoy luxurious lifestyles.  These people appear to be untouchable.  Why should that be the case?</P>
    <P>Recently an official of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners attending a committee of this House remarked that they are very concerned for their safety and that of their families.  The drugs problem has reached such a level we must decide whether to tackle it or give in to these drug pushers and traffickers.</P>
    <P>The Government must examine urgently the establishment of a special unit comprised of hand-picked officials of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners prepared to undertake this type of very dangerous task with the full backing of the Garda.  All such tasks must be undertaken with guarantees of personal safety, through Garda protection and so on.  If that special unit is not established urgently, we might as well give in to these criminals.</P>
    <P>There is also urgent need to increase the numbers of garda in the drugs squad.  Gardaí inform us that 80 per cent <Col N="472" /> of all crime is drugs-related, yet it is impossible to understand why 1 per cent only of Garda personnel are allocated to that squad.  Since the work of the drugs squad is slow, tedious, intelligence gathering and so on, it must be strengthened and made more efficient, particularly in operational matters.  What is needed is better quality rather than more policing.  For example, we must examine the amount of Garda time wasted in court awaiting the hearing of cases.  This must affect their morale.</P>
    <P>In addition we need to examine the matter of bench warrants recently raised by all parties in this House.  There has also been much recent talk about bail, another issue on which we could have made much progress had we in place a proper system of collation of bench warrants which could be implemented more quickly.  This would improve the position overall.</P>
    <P>We must also seriously examine the chaotic position in our prisons and the toxicology ban.  It is ludicrous that it is impossible to obtain an analysis of any illegal substances picked up by the Garda.  These substances must be submitted to a laboratory for analysis which can take up to six months.  I hope I have put across my frustration at our utter failure to tackle this problem and to protect young people in our cities from the ravages of drug abuse.</P>

      <P>I thank those Members who contributed to this debate for their general welcome of the Bill.  Today I listened, either on the monitor or in the Chamber, to the contributions of Deputies Deasy, Frances Fitzgerald, Mulvihill, Kemmy, Davern, Callely, Eric Byrne, Theresa Ahearn and Shortall.  The number of contributors to this Second Stage debate is ample testimony to people's concern at what is undoubtedly a national tragedy.  The number of contributors, the depth of their research, their personal insights and the excellent quality of their contributions demonstrate their collective concern and the consensus <Col N="473" /> that this problem must be tackled nationally.  I am delighted there has been broad welcome for this Bill which comprises only one facet of the overall task of dealing with crime, in particular drugs-related crime.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with some specific points, I want to reiterate what was said by the Minister for Justice in the Adjournment Debate on Thursday last, 7 March 1996, concerning the major drugs seizure at Urlingford last November, to which Deputy Michael McDowell referred once again.  This matter has been raised in the House on a number of occasions by way of parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As well as the Customs and Excise authorities, the Garda have full seizure powers to intercept and seize illegally imported drugs.  That seizure is still the subject of a major investigation by the Garda Síochána.  It is being conducted at an international level, involving people who are suspected of being top players in the international drugs trade. It is essential that this investigation should not be hambered in any way.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy O'Donoghue, one of the people to whom a confidential briefing was given.  As should be the norm in such circumstances, that confidential briefing was respected by him.  It was not respected in the case of another person who was party to a briefing and the consequences of that may be rather dire in the long-term.  The battle against major drug criminals requires that our law enforcement agencies be in a position to play a part and that their capacity to do so be totally beyond doubt.  Anything which could hinder the fight against these criminals must be avoided and in view of the sensitivity of the issue and the ongoing investigations, we should not say anything further at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broad subject matter of the Bill, I would impress on Deputies that the Government has emphasised that the drugs issue will be approached in a comprehensive way.  In this regard the proposals represent one facet, albeit an <Col N="474" /> important one, of the Government's overall approach to the problems posed by the trade in illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Minister for Health recently announced proposals for a comprehensive range of measures to prevent drug misuse and for the treatment of persons already misusing drugs.  These measures recognise the overriding need for a co-ordinated response by all agencies.  There will be a series of measures aimed at reducing the demand for drugs, including a recognition of the crucial role which local, voluntary and community groups can play in co-operation with their local health boards.  Education and the provision of information will also be central.  A special study by a task force will seek to understand the root cause of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that education and the promotion of healthy lifestyles can play a crucial role in the prevention of drug misuse.  In this connection the Minister for Health announced a range of initiatives and incentives which will be undertaken in conjunction with the Minister for Education which demonstrate a clear commitment to approach the problem from a number of different angles, while at the same time ensuring there is no relaxation in the current laws relating to the possession and consumption of controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>The need for education was one of the areas alluded to by Deputies Kemmy and Davern.  We are conscious of this and what we are talking about here is a comprehensive approach of which this Bill is but one facet.  The Bill must be seen in the context of a global approach by the Government to the problems which confront us as a result of the activities of those who trade in the misery which accompanies drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 which enables a sum to be prescribed by regulations for the purposes of seizure and detention of cash under section 38 of the Act.  I am pleased to say a draft of such <Col N="475" /> regulations has now been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  The regulations will enable Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act, which provides for the seizure and forfeiture of drug trafficking money being imported or exported in cash, to be given full effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue sought to suggest that the provisions in the Bill were watered down because of the attitude taken by the Labour and Democratic Left parties.  Such allegations are par for the course now and they are as tiresome as they are inaccurate.  A supposed defect identified was that after 48 hours in detention a suspect must be brought before the courts if detention is to be continued.  In making this point the Deputy ignored the fact that the Minister made clear at considerable length in her opening statement the reason the Government had taken this approach; essentially the advice the Minister received was that provisions along these lines are necessary if we are not to fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>If on Committee Stage ways of tightening up the section can be suggested, while keeping it within the bounds of what is likely to prove acceptable under the terms of the convention, I am sure the Minister will be happy to discuss that.  It serves no purpose, however, for the Deputy to ignore our obligations under the convention and seek to pretend that what is in the Bill derives from some imagined dispute between the parties in Government.</P>
    <P>The public will not be impressed by an attempt to turn a debate on a fundamental reform in our law in relation to one of the gravest issues facing society, into an opportunity for political point scoring.  To suggest we were putting the rights of the accused above those of the victim has no basis.  To advocate the introduction of measures which would be likely to fail because of legal challenges would be to do a great wrong to the community in general and victims of crime in particular.  The obligation on a <Col N="476" /> Government in bringing forward legislation is to ensure, as best it can, that the measure will be effective and will withstand subsequent challenge.</P>
    <P>An analogy was made with the operation of section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 in so far as detention is concerned. That analogy does not seem to be appropriate.  A regime which provides for detention up to a maximum of 12 hours and one which provides for detention for up to seven days are clearly different and greater safeguards are required the longer the potential period of detention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue painted a picture of the legal regime he believed necessary to implement the proposals in section 2 but it is difficult to see how these are well founded.  It is unlikely that the analogies he draws with procedural arrangements in criminal cases generally would apply in their entirety to a measure dealing not with the prosecution of offences but the question of detention.  What is at issue in the Bill is a stage before any charge has been made.  In any case, it would be wrong to allow a person to be detained in a Garda station for up to seven days without that person being brought before a court, for the reasons which the Minister explained.  On Committee Stage the Minister will be happy to consider amendments which might improve the Bill but there is little point in putting forward amendments which ignore realities.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society suggested that the seven day detention provision in section 2 was a risk to civil liberties and should not be introduced. The Minister, in her opening statement, recognised that the seven day detention may seem rather draconian but she set out the reasons which justify its provision and laid great emphasis on the various safeguards which accompany it, which should allay any fears that it is excessive in the context of the evil we are trying to eliminate.</P>
    <P>At any rate it was made clear that the provision is aimed at the major players. <Col N="477" /> It should also be seen in its proper context, namely, the international nature of the trade in illegal drugs and the need to have adequate time to make inquiries, for example, of police forces abroad.</P>
    <P>There was also mention of the suggestion made by the Commission chaired by Judge Martin concerning the video-recording of interviews.  The present position is that a pilot scheme was established to examine this recommendation. The pilot scheme only became fully operational in the spring of last year.  A steering committee under the chairmanship of Judge Esmonde Smyth, which is overseeing the pilot scheme, is of the view that a two year period will be needed to produce the necessary data on which results can be assessed. The steering committee have made certain recommendations to the Minister with a view to increasing the number of suspects who participate in the scheme and these are under active consideration.</P>
    <P>Some further points of detail in relation to the Bill were made which we can also tease out more fully on Committee Stage but there is one point in particular which Deputy O'Donoghue made which should be mentioned at this juncture.  He criticised the approach taken in the Bill to the question of additional powers for customs officers. Customs officers already have certain powers in relation to questioning in their own right persons suspected of drug smuggling offences.  In this regard I would refer Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Noel Davern to section 29 of the Finance Act, 1971, as amended by section 19 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1988, which states:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person entering the State shall, at such place and in such manner as the Revenue Commissioners may direct, declare to the proper officer of Customs and Excise any thing included in his baggage or brought with him which on importation is subject to any prohibition or restriction or to any duty or tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> It is clear that drugs would come within this category.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person entering or leaving the State shall answer such questions as may be put to him by any officer of Customs and Excise with respect to his baggage and any thing included therein or brought with him, and shall, if required by the officer, produce that baggage and any such thing for examination.</P>
    <P>Without the presence of the Garda Síochána there are clear rights of search in relation to any aspect of any person's baggage which in the case of drugs is adequate.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the Bill is a sensible step to enhance the level of co-operation between the Garda and customs officers in the area of drug trafficking. The Bill will enable additional powers to be given to customs officers allowing their participation in interviewing persons detained in Garda custody for drug trafficking offences.  The reality is that the Garda have a special role in relation to the collection of evidence for prosecution in the types of cases dealt with in this Bill.  The Deputy seems to envisage a separate parallel system operated by customs in relation to prosecutions in such cases.  Perhaps on reflection he will accept that that would not be a sensible way to proceed particularly in the context of the need for the closest possible co-operation in these cases between customs officers and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow customs officers to participate in the questioning of persons detained by the Garda in relation to drug trafficking offences.  It does not go beyond that and it is difficult to see in the circumstances how Deputy O'Donoghue's suggestion, that as a result of this measure existing powers of customs officers arising in an entirely different context will be somehow called into question by the provisions of this Bill, is valid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> In relation to preliminary hearings the Minister is considering this whole issue but Deputy O'Donoghue is somewhat inaccurate when he suggests that the Progressive Democrats' proposals in this area are broadly similar to his own inasmuch as the Progressive Democrats' proposals appear to envisage an alternative to preliminary hearings which could take place in the court of trial itself.</P>
    <P>While obviously one could not agree with much of what Deputy O'Donnell had to say during her contribution, it is to be welcomed that she acknowledged that the Bill was carefully drafted to ensure its constitutionality and that it embodies the necessary safeguards to allow the provisions to survive a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread acknowledgement that, while the terms of the Bill are harsh, they are &mdash; regrettably &mdash; necessary to deal with the realities involved in the evil trade of drug trafficking. Too many young lives have been destroyed, too many families made miserable because of the activities of drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a major step forward in the fight against this deadly menace and I commend it to the House.  I thank Membeers for their contributions.</P>

      <P>A significant change in existing law is proposed, whereby in special circumstances, dispensation from compliance with this requirement may be given.  This dispensation may be granted where field trials of new technologies are necessary to establish suitability.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, conformity assessment procedures comprised type approval of new designs and then in turn the verification of each instrument of the approved type before being used for a prescribed purpose.  Type approval entails the detailed testing of a new design in accordance with international standards to ensure that its metrological integrity is assured over a reasonable period of time.  The type approval certificate is issued thereafter.  In the restructured service, both testing and formal approval will be undertaken by the National Metrology Laboratory, Forbairt.  Heretofore, type approval was a ministerial responsibility.</P>
      <P>Verification, an inspection function, arises when instruments are being prepared for initial use for a prescribed purpose and entails examination for conformity with an approved type and testing for accuracy.  The conformity assessment procedures will be set out in regulations to be made by the Director of Legal Metrology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important new provision in section 14 (4) enables instruments not intended for a prescribed use to be subjected to the conformity assessment procedures. This will have relevance mainly for industrial quality assurance.  A system of in-service inspection will be prescribed by the Director of Legal Metrology. Provision is made for marking and <Col N="481" /> sealing of instruments to signify conformity with legal requirement.</P>
    <P>Existing law on units of measurement is being reproduced in the Bill.  Ireland inherited the imperial system of units of measurement and significant progress had been made over recent years in replacing it by the Système International d'Unités, SI, colloquially called the metric system.</P>
    <P>The Bill also lays down the definition of other units by reference to units of the SI system; the denominations of standards for mass, volume-capacity and length; and standards through which the units may be realised and disseminated.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of standards necessary to support measurements generally here is being conferred on Forbairt.  The Bill also permits other competent organisations to be responsible for provision and maintenance of standards in their own specialised fields.</P>
    <P>An inspector's primary responsibility is to establish if, following initial verification, instruments in use for trade continue to remain within the permitted limits of error.  However, an inspector may, if requested by the owner and with the approval of the director, carry out adjustments to measuring instruments in use where they are found to be outside the permitted limits.  A somewhat similar provision is in existing law. Forgery of marks, tampering with, or unauthorised removal of marks and seals will constitute an offence under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have, through the years, provided and maintained weighing equipment for public use, most notably weighbridges set up for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) (Amendment) Act, 1960, as well as those established for the purposes of markets and fairs laws dating from the last century.  This arrangement is being continued and in fact being extended to include measuring instruments.  Public confidence in the operation of such equipment is maintained by a system of <Col N="482" /> controls and obligations applicable to the operator of the equipment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also regulates the sale of solid fuel by reference to quantity.  At present, there are no legislative requirements regarding the display of the net quantity on sealed bags of solid fuel. This omission is now being addressed. Provision is also made requiring the vendor of solid fuel sold loose or in an open container to issue a docket to the purchaser indicating the quantity sold. The existing laws relating to quantity control and short measure are being brought together.  Thus they will be more intelligible to the enforcement authorities, the trade and consumers.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down: a regime of offences; provides for appeals to the District Court; the stipulation of rules for the prosecution of offences; and the imposition of penalties for those found in breach of the law.  The Bill will permit the transfer of property and equipment currently vested in the Minister or the local authorities to Forfás.</P>
    <P>These are the principal features of the Bill many of which of necessity are of a technical nature and may sound somewhat arcane.  However, it is important to stress that the enactment of the legislation and the associated modernisation programme shall improve considerably the service available to both industry and consumers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Most aspects of this Bill are straightforward and, therefore, I will not dwell unduly on them.  I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive introduction and background to the Bill.  I pay tribute to the Garda sergeants who have served in the weights and measures division since its inception. The system is governed mainly by the Weights and Measures Acts, 1878 and 1889 as amended by the 1928 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1922 the Garda Síochána took over from the RIC and since then the legislation has been administered successfully and efficiently.  The Garda is responsible for all areas outside the old Dublin Corporation and Dun Laoghaire <Col N="483" /> Borough Council areas.  These entities operate their own service.</P>
    <P>A weights and measures sergeant was appointed in each area and acted independently reporting only to a superintendent in Garda Headquarters and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, as required.  He collected fees, stamped equipment and administered the law and regulations.  His mileage expenses were paid by the local authority and subsistence from the verification fees after due process.  It was always a prestigious and sought after job within the Garda.</P>
    <P>In 1970, the Conroy commission proposed the post should be civilianised, but nothing was done until five years ago when the proposal was resurrected. Legislation was required, but was very slow in coming forward.  The start-up date for the new service was put back year to year until late 1995.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago the service was operated by 65 sergeants, 40, five years ago and 20 at present.  By the year 2000 there will be eight remaining.  I understand there is dissatisfaction among weights and measures sergeants about the proposed change.  I intend to table amendments on Committee Stage to sections 8 and 9 and, possibly others to assist in the transition.</P>
    <P>As the purpose of this legislation is to ratify EU directives, equipment was purchased by the Department some time ago.  I seek confirmation that this equipment is still considered modern.</P>
    <P>On Bills as technical as this, it would be helpful if Deputies on this side of the House were given an opportunity to study the Minister's comprehensive comments prior to the introduction.  As the Minister of State will recall from his own time in Opposition, departmental resources can be sorely missed.  Even a three hour preview would be helpful.</P>

      <P>It is important that Members on this side of the House are given an opportunity to assess the many Bills due for publication this year by the Department.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the science of measurement.  Some relevant items which the Minister of State may mention would include meat plant scales about which we have heard so much; weighbridges; oil tankers; bushing machines, used possibly in the grain business; petrol pumps; pubs; taxis and milk meters, a source of contention in rural areas between dairy purchasers and the farming community.</P>
      <P>There has been a long delay in giving effect to the European regulations which are binding.  A delay of two years is long enough for a Bill such as this which lacks complexity.  The Trade Marks Bill, recently introduced, is passing through the House swiftly.  It is my understanding that Ireland will be the last country in Europe to give effect to the regulations concerned.  I suspect the position is the same in the matter of the Metrology Bill.  There is no need for us to be so tardy in incorporating in Irish law regulations which we have already agreed.  This does not give a good impression of modern Ireland to the Commission in Brussels and its administrators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising the question of the recent finding of 1,500 adoption files in the National Archives. Society is being confronted with its past in the last few weeks through the discovery of these files, the revelations <Col N="485" /> about residential care, the west of Ireland farmer case, the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the Kilkenny incest case and the Madonna House scenario.</P>
      <P>We have to acknowledge that there is huge sadness and many of these scandals reveals the hidden side of Irish women's lives particularly.  They also reveal a society where people who did not fit into rigid roles were hidden away, a society of high moral standards and abysmally low concern for the needs of individuals, particularly the most marginalised. We must acknowledge also when discussing this issue, that many of the religious orders tried to provide what the civil authorities did not provide at the time &mdash; care and attention for many of the people who ended up in their care.</P>
      <P>The women of religious orders gave their lives and committed their every moment to this task and without them Ireland in the 1930s and 1940s would have looked very like Victorian England.  They provided shelter, education and the possibility of a future to many individuals shunned by society. They provided love, too, but not always. The experiences of people have been mixed, some have had very good experiences in difficult situations.</P>
      <P>In the past we had idealisation and denial rather than equality.  This idealisation affected women particularly and created rigid roles outside of which women risked their reputation, sanity and, often, freedom.  In many ways, we are seeing the dark hidden side of the idealisation of women.  This has been exposed time and again by women in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country was shocked to hear of the files on 1,500 babies and small children who had been sent to the United States; that they were found, it would appear almost by chance by an archivist, Caitriona Crowe.  The country was shocked at their loss and discovery and that files with sensitive information could be found almost by chance.  I congratulate Caitriona Crowe on her sensitive response and the action she took in urging that the files should be looked at. <Col N="486" /> I also congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health for being so open about the existence of these files.</P>
    <P>The procedures for adoption have obviously changed greatly.  This change means we must be extremely sensitive to those about whom these files were written in the first place.  We must ensure that this issue is dealt with with the greatest delicacy.  We must not revictimise people by hamfisted openness.</P>
    <P>These 1,500 files will lead to mixed reactions for those most directly involved.  There will be relief for many that more information may be available to them.  For others there may be a fear that long held secrets and a life carefully constructed could fall apart.  Given the huge consequences that could arise from the finding of these files, it is important that we offer reassurance to all about the manner in which this information will be dealt with.  Adoption practices have changed greatly.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify whether there are other adoption files similar to the 1,500 files located in the National Archives in any Department or health board, for example, the Department of Education?  What form will the inquiry take into the finding of the 1,500 files? What is the status of the guardians who applied for the passports in respect of the 1,500 adoption files?  What was the role of the intermediary bodies and organisations which handled adoptions? Will he outline the circumstances under which the birth parents made their declarations and indicate whether any criminal acts were committed? Although we may not be able to answer all the questions, it is important they are asked.</P>
    <P>The most important question relates to the future management of these files. When will it be possible to establish a voluntary contact register and a statutory based contact register?  What were the people attempting to make inquiries told?  Did they just come up against a blank wall?</P>
    <P>We are being forced to confront as <Col N="487" /> never before some of the hypocrisies and denials of society.  How we handle this information will, in many ways, determine our future health as a society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  We are discussing a deeply sensitive issue which is broad in scope in both human and administrative terms.</P>
      <P>In recent times the question of society's attitude to children has dominated public debate to an unprecedented degree.  The issues raised in that debate go to the core of our values and raise questions about our sense of community.  We have measured ourselves by reference to our treatment of the most vulnerable among us and found that our attitudes have fallen far short of our ideals.</P>
      <P>Our treatment of children born outside of what was the conventional relationship is difficult to reconcile with a State founded on the principle of cherishing all of the children of the nation equally.  It is also hard to reconcile it with our image of ourselves as a caring and compassionate society.</P>
      <P>In relation to adoptions abroad the role of the then Department of External Affairs was to provide passport facilities to those who it was hoped were going to a better life abroad.  For many &mdash; I hope for most &mdash; of these children a welcoming society awaited them in another country.  There will always be adopted people who want to know more about who they are, about their early days, who want perhaps to reach out to a parent.  There will be birth parents who may wish to re-establish contact with children for whom they have long grieved.  In providing passports the Department opened files on individual cases and each file contains an important element of each individual's story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Tánaiste said in his reply today to the Deputy, when he became aware last week that the Department's <Col N="488" /> archival material contained information on individual adoptions and that this information appeared to comprehend the majority, if not all, cases of adoption by US-based parents, he instituted an inquiry to determine the scope of the information available to us.</P>
    <P>What has been established is that a series of files dealing with social and legal issues was opened by the consular section of the Department in 1945.  This included the question of adoption.  The series eventually evolved into a list of files dealing with individual cases.  The file series continues until 1983 but the last adoption recorded of an Irish child by adoptive parents based outside Ireland appears to be in 1972.  It will be appreciated that until the material, which covers about 1,800 files in all, is researched in detail it will not be possible to give definitive statistical information on the number of cases involved.</P>
    <P>In so far as can be ascertained at present each file relating to an individual adoption contains the name of the birth mother, the name and date of birth of her child, the name of the adoption agency and its representative and the name and details of the adoptive parents. Of birth mother and child there is little detail apart from the birth mother's declaration of &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; of the child to the adoption agency.  The files do not contain copies of the children's birth or baptismal certificates.  It appears the mothers were generally young and from different parts of the country and the children were adopted at age one or two.  Some mothers seemed to have remained with their children until or near the time of adoption.</P>
    <P>The files contain little or no correspondence with the adoption societies. The representative to whom the child was surrendered in turn made a declaration surrendering the child to his or her adoptive parents.  In some instances the correspondence refers to arrangements made to have the children travel safely by air with reliable people.  Some contain details of arrangements made at the other side of the Atlantic to meet the <Col N="489" /> children on arrival.  Almost all contain detailed reports on the adoptive parents which establish their bona fides as parents, their financial situation and a guarantee of the religious upbringing of their adopted children.  It should also be acknowledged that the files in some instances also demonstrate the adoptive parents' longing to adopt and their joy at being able to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>About 1,500 files up to and including 1963 have been deposited in the National Archives.  The remainder are held by the Department.  The Passport Office has records of passports issued in the original names of the adoptees which tally with the information held on file.  Separate files on individual passport applications would have been destroyed with most other pre-1979 passport application files.  However, the basic details have been retained on micro-fiche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending a closer review of the files themselves the Tánaiste has had the central file index and a small but representative sample of the files examined. I feel confident in stating that the information contained on the files appears to comprehend the great majority of cases of foreign adoptions where passports were required since 1950, most of them undertaken by US-based parents.  Some files relate to other countries such as Canada, Great Britain and South Africa.  A small number of files relate to the adoption by Irish <Col N="490" /> people living in Ireland of foreign children. Another category of files, particularly those occurring in later years, relate to unsuccessful adoption inquiries. Most adoptions recorded appear to have taken place in the 1950s.</P>
    <P>Before issuing a passport to a prospective adoptee the role of the consular section of the Department was to satisfy itself that the mothers and guardians had given their consent to adoption abroad.  The consular section also satisfied itself as to the suitability of the prospective adoptive parents.  The documentation required in respect of the latter &mdash; if Catholic &mdash; was specified by the Catholic Social Welfare Bureau which liaised with the Catholic Charities' Organisation in the US.  The latter had branches throughout the US and was required to be approved as a child-placing agency under the law of the State in which each adoptive couple resided.  There was no standard format for &ldquo;statements of surrender&rdquo; by either the birth mother or the guardian.  When the documentation was in order the consular section informed the Passport Office which then issued the passports.</P>
    <P>All the files in the adoption series are restricted under section 8 (4) of the National Archives Act, 1985, which permits restriction of information on the ground that files &ldquo;contain information supplied in confidence&rdquo; or information which &ldquo;might cause distress ... to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals&rdquo;.  Access to this information is a core issue.  On the one hand, access is regarded as a right by many adoptees and birth-adoptive parents.  On the other hand, many of the parties involved consider the right to confidentiality as absolute.</P>
    <P>At the Ursuline Convent in Waterford on Thursday last the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;I hope that we can quickly arrive at a point where it will be possible to make information available to people who want help in being reconciled and reunited with each other&rdquo;.  The Department is in contact with the Department of Health which, as the Department responsible for the Adoption Board, <Col N="491" /> plays a central role in this area.  Officials from both Departments will meet next week and hope to clarify the issues involved and the general lines of their resolution.  The Department of Health has appointed a co-ordinator whose first task will be to identify the extent of documentary material in existence on adoptions in general.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is seeking legal advice on the question of access to information. I understand the Minister for Health will seek similar advice.  Preliminary legal advice available indicates that there are impediments at present to making information on specific cases available to voluntary agencies. However, the possibility of releasing information to the individuals concerned, with the permission of the persons to whom it directly relates, is being explored.  Members will be aware that access to information about adoptions in Ireland is regulated by the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1991.  Where adoption boards or the courts are asked to make information available the interests of all parties have to be very carefully weighed.  I am sure Members are aware that the general principle is not to release information without the consent of the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope that the knowledge that these files exist will be a source of comfort to adoptees, particularly those adopted abroad.  It is the Tánaiste's wish to be as helpful as possible in relation to the provision of information.  He is also very conscious of the need to respect the privacy of all interested parties and to protect the confidentiality of communications between the Department and the interested parties.  There is no clear-cut answer to the dilemma posed by the competing interests relative to information on adoptions.  It is a dilemma posed by the sad circumstances surrounding the reality of adoption.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the <Col N="492" /> Minister for Health of the serious position in the Galway East constituency and County Galway in general because of a lack of medical requisites for geriatric and other public health service patients cared for in the community.  As and from next week they will be in short supply.</P>
      <P>On examining the Book of Estimates I note the Government proposes to spend £2,148,770,000 on health care this year and that £1,164,354,000 has been allocated for the discharge of services in the eight regional health board areas.</P>
      <P>Last October, November and December there was a similar shortage of dressings, bandages, tapes and other medical necessities for people cared for in the community.  A number of carers telephoned my home and constituency office this week about the matter.  By caring for the elderly in their homes those people save the State a vast amoung of money.  If those elderly people were cared for in State geriatric homes run by health boards or private nursing homes subvented by health boards &mdash; both of which are ultimately paid for out of Exchequer funds &mdash; it would cost the State at great deal more money.</P>
      <P>These people urgently require the assistance provided by carers and home helps and the professional medical back-up support provided by the excellent cadre of public health nurses who operate in the community.  The carers who contacted me said they had been informed that the normal supply of dressings, bandages and other medical requirements would not be provided this week and that there may be a shortage of them in the months ahead.  I ask the Minister of State to give me a commitment that there will be no diminution in the funding for community care nursing services, which save the Exchequer much money and do tremendous work, and no shortage in the provision of medical requisites for geriatric and other patients.  I hope he can give this assurance so that this matter will not have to be raised again.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  On the question of the Estimates, the 1996 letter of determination of health expenditure issued to the Western Health Board represented a real increase of 3 per cent over the figure for 1995.  This has to be regarded as a reasonable allocation given the Government's policy is to maintain overall public expenditure increases in 1996 to within 2 per cent of the approved level for 1995.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the Western Health Board to determine budgets for individual services within its overall allocation and the responsibility for the provision of services such as the public health nursing service rests with the board. Accordingly, this matter was raised with the Western Health Board which stated that certain difficulties in regard to the placing of orders for the supply of medical requisites had been brought to its attention by the public health nursing service in the Galway area.  The board is examining this issue and I have been assured that it will continue to make arrangements to ensure that medical requisites are provided to patients in need.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the serious accommodation problem in Kilmurry, Ennis, national school on the Adjournment.  The provision of an extension is vital.  I am very disappointed that Kilmurry national school has not been included in the building programme for 1996.  It has been suggested that this school should be put on an emergency list for the provision of a prefab.  However, this would not be appropriate as there is rapid growth in the area and the school will qualify for an extra teacher next September due to <Col N="494" /> the increase in student numbers.  It can be seen, therefore, that long-term accommodation is required.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to extend the existing classrooms due to the design and age of the school building.  The principal had to acquire a portacabin as there was nowhere to keep pupils' shoes and coats.  This costs the board of management £121 every 28 days.  The toilets, which were built in 1980 when student numbers were much lower, have been deemed to be well below standard and fall short of the Mid-Western Health Board's hygiene standards.  Furniture is also required but it is unlikely that this will be provided before next September. The present enrolment is 61 and another pupil will be enrolled after Easter. This means one teacher will have to teach 34 pupils, three more than the maximum, in a small classroom.  The school would be entitled to an extra teacher if the building was provided.</P>
      <P>The inspector submitted a report in adequate time for Kilmurry to be included in the building programme for 1996.  I visited the school and was very impressed by the work done by the two teachers.  Their commitment to the education of the local children should be recognised by the Department of Education through the provision of proper facilities which in this case amounts to a new extension and the appointment of a third teacher.  The conditions in the school are unacceptable and I ask the Minister to address this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline my Department's response to the accommodation problems in Kilmurry national school which has a staffing level of one principal and one assistant teacher and an enrolment of 61.  Based on this enrolment, it is likely that an additional teacher will be appointed to the school next September. The school has two permanent classrooms which are smaller than modern day classrooms and I am aware that additional accommodation is needed.  A <Col N="495" /> building project for the school was considered for inclusion in the 1996 capital building programme.  This project was reviewed against a set of objectives and a priority listing.  As other projects were considered to be of higher priority Kilmurry national school will not be progressed through the building stages under the 1996 national building programme.</P>
      <P>My Department is seeking to address the school's immediate accommodation needs.  A planning review has been carried out and a report has been furnished by my Department's professional staff. The next step is to determine how the accommodation difficulties can be overcome within the limited financial resources available.  My Department will shortly contact the school authorities with its proposals.  I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to overcome the present difficulties.  I accept the urgency of the case and fully appreciate the concerns of the school authorities, teachers and parents of the pupils at Kilmurry national school.  The Deputy can be assured of my desire to see an immediate improvement in the school's accommodation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of ministerial contacts with Packard Electric on the Adjournment.  The efforts to resolve the difficulties in Packard Electric over the past year have not been helped by a lack of clear information.  Following the frenzied comings and goings at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995 an agreement was reached in June 1995. However, it was very unclear in regard to the problems it resolved.  At that time <Col N="496" /> I highlighted the lack of information given to the workers and the deliberate obscuring of important facts.  The arrangement was that people who had been let go would now be told whether they would be re-employed.  However, the brief statement issued today was ominous.  What have the Minister and the Minister of State been doing in the nine months since last June with regard to meeting Packard Electric, either internationally or domestically?  What arrangements have been made in the employment protection unit, which was set up to deal with these issues?  What steps were taken in that period to ensure the best possible employment arrangement for Packard Electric workers?  I am not confident that a strong committed approach was taken.  I understand the Minister met management today to discuss the matter.  What arrangements were thrashed out?  What arrangements has the Minister made with the Packard Electric workers? What is the outlook for that firm on which so many depend for a living?</P>
      <P>So many pinned their hopes on what seemed last June to be a better deal.  I expressed grave reservations about the lack of clarity at that time and I hope the Minister's reply will contain better news.  It is important that the arrangements being put in place now for the workers will be clear.</P>
      <P>There is equally unhappy news about Jacobs, also sited in Tallaght, and the redundancies which it hopes will be voluntary. That remains to be seen.  I take no satisfaction in saying it is an unhappy day for that region.  We must all seek to salvage the best we can but the dignity of the workers demands there be proper information.  I want to hear what efforts have been made over the past nine months to secure these jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for sharing her time with me on this most important matter and I thank the Minister for attending.  He knows the situation in Tallaght as well as I do since we both represent the area.  What we are confronted with today is a great <Col N="497" /> catastrophe in terms of potential job losses.  Neither Deputy O'Rourke nor I wants to talk up the crisis but to tackle a crisis we must recognise it exists, as it does in the Tallaght area, where two substantial employers face considerable difficulties in retaining their current job numbers.  That Jacobs is intending to shed up to 200 jobs is serious.  Although the departure of these workers may be on a voluntary basis, the jobs are lost to the greater Tallaght area nevertheless.</P>
      <P>A similar situation pertains at Packard Electric.  Its workers tell me when they visit my home and clinics that no matter what they do, no matter how much they have given in the past in terms of longer hours, revised work practices, redundancies, etc., nothing seems to be enough for Packard Electric's management.  The workers feel genuinely hard done by and let down by management practices.</P>
      <P>There is confusion in the minds of the workers as to how the issue of redundancies will be handled.  They do not want redundancies but that is the prospect they appear to be facing.  Their concern is that nothing has been spelled out clearly to the workers or their representatives.</P>
      <P>That is the crisis which faces Tallaght. It involves what is likely to happen, and which one hopes will not happen, in Packard Electric and Jacobs.  Over the past two years or so, the greater Tallaght area has not obtained a single large industrial job creating development. This concerns all of us who represent and have the interests of Tallaght at heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this important matter.  I wish to inform the House that I and my colleague, Minister Richard Bruton, have had a meeting this morning with the company at its request.  The company outlined to us that, in accordance with the agreement entered into in June 1995, it was meeting the unions today to <Col N="498" /> advise them, first, of the business prospects for 1996 and, second, about the situation in relation to employees currently on layoff.  I will remind the House that the relevant sections of the company-union agreement brokered last June by Minister Bruton and me are as follows and, contrary to the impression sought to be given by Deputy O'Rourke, could not be more clear.</P>
      <P>The Company will advise the Unions by 15 March 1996:</P>
      <P>(a)  of business prospects for 1996. If prospects are such that a majority of those laid off will be re-engaged over the first half of 1996, no redundancies will take effect until 1 June, in accordance with previous practice.</P>
      <P>(b)  if business prospects at 15 March indicate that a majority will continue on layoff over the first half of 1996, then a phased redundancy programme, again in accordance with previous practice, will be on offer from 15 April for those on layoff for whom a return to work date has not been determined.</P>
      <P>(c)  In the case of either (a) or (b) above, the period of layoff will be included in reckonable service for redundancy calculation and minimum notice calculation purposes.</P>
      <P>The company has reiterated its commitment to increasing the competitiveness of the Tallaght plant, but it has pointed out that business prospects for 1996 remain poor and, accordingly, it intends to implement a redundancy programme. In accordance with the June agreement, details of the programme, including its impact on the 400 workers on layoffs, will be communicated to the employees by 15 April 1996.  The company was not in a position to advise us or the unions as to how many employees were likely to be involved in the redundancy programme.  No Minister has control over what a private company decides to tell its workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in pretending to the House that the situation in the company is not extremely serious.  Clearly efforts <Col N="499" /> to obtain new business and to improve the competitiveness of the Tallaght plant need to be vigorously pursued and the earlier there is clarity about future plans, the better.</P>
    <P>At our meeting this morning we stressed the necessity for the company to observe scrupulously the June agreement. I would now strongly urge both the company and the unions to adhere to the terms of that agreement so that the combined energies of both workers and management are devoted to the core objective of securing the future of the plant.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware that whatever number of redundancies is eventually agreed, it will be a painful experience for those who become unemployed in the circumstances.  There is no doubt that the recent history of the Tallaght plant has been deeply troubled, as Deputy Flood said.  There is no point at this stage in tracing that history. However, if it were not for the frenzied comings and goings to which Deputy O'Rourke referred, the plant would have shut.  Their purpose was to avoid that closure.  I would hope that with <Col N="500" /> good will on all sides negotiations between management and unions will secure the future of the plant.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the situation at the adjacent Jacobs plant. There is the unwelcome news at Jacobs of the loss over a period of three years of some 200 jobs.  That is to be regretted but it is important to draw a clear distinction here.  The case of Jacobs involves a major investment programme of in excess of £25 million pounds, the modernisation of the plant, the implementation of new technology with a capacity to boost output with fewer workers, the guarantee, in so far as anything is guaranteed in the economy, that the future of the plant is assured and the secure employment for the workforce in that plant.  I am satisfied from my discussions with the management of the Jacobs plant that there is the real, and I would like to think definite, prospect of an agreement with the different unions which represent the workers there on a voluntary severance programme which will be implemented and that the plant will go from strength to stength.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 26 March 1966.</P>

      <P>The ruins of Pollboy mill outside Ballinasloe, County Galway, which were in a dangerous condition were demolished in connection with the proposed development of navigation along the river Suck to the town of Ballinasloe itself.  The decision to demolish the ruins was taken only after lengthy and careful consideration of a number of alternative routes for the development.  The evidence gathered shows that the scheme of works now in hands presents the most practical and cost effective solution to the extension of the navigation to the town.  The cost of preserving the ruins, which had no particular architectural or archaeological merit, would have been prohibitive.</P>
      <P>Planning approval for demolition was received from Ballinasloe urban district countil in May 1995 and following an appeal by a local group against the decision, the approval was upheld by An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>Bórd Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board, which operates under the aegis of my Department supports the indigenous film-making sector through the provision of development and production loans.  In 1995, the board received £2,850,000 by way of a capital grant-in-aid from my Department, all of which was committed to indigenous projects by year end.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, I assumed responsibility for the certification of film projects under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, in May 1994.  While the section 35 tax relief scheme does not constitute financial assistance provided directly by my Department, since its cost is in terms of revenue foregone by the Exchequer, this scheme is a major source of State support for the film industry.  In 1995, 49 film and television projects were certified by me, of which 31 are classified as indigenous.  The total amount of section 35 investments to be raised for these 31 projects was some £39 million.  This compares with 18 non-indigenous film and television projects certified in the same period which involved a total of some £34 million in section 35 finance.  In every case, an Irish registered and resident production company was established for the purposes of section 35, as required by the legislation.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost to the Exchequer in terms of revenue foregone if all the projects certified in 1995 proceed to production will be, in the case of indigenous projects, some £17 million and in the case of non-indigenous projects, some £15 million.</P>

Cuirtear an chabhair seo ar fáil trí mo Roinn féin, trí Bhord na Gaeilge, trí seirbhísí chraolacháin RTÉ, trí na heagrais dheonacha Gaeilge, agus trí thionscnaimh ar nós Glór na nGael, Raidió na Life, ANOIS agus na tréimhseacháin Ghaeilge, Amharchlann de hÍde, Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge agus ar bhealaí eile nach iad.</P>
      <P>Tá an-mholadh ag dul do na tuismitheoirí agus a bpáistí a dheimhníonn ionad don Ghaeilge ina saol sa teaghlach agus lasmuigh de agus a bhíonn ag iarraidh an t-ionad sin a fhorbairt.  Táim cinnte go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeilge mar thaca éifeachtach nua do phobal na Gaeilge ina iomláine chun cur ar a gcumas an Ghaeilge a bhuanú agus a shealbhú níos daingne ina saol laistigh agus lasmuigh den teaghlach.</P>

    <P>Two of the three statutory nature reserves located in the Dublin region will benefit from a small amount of funding under the &ldquo;provision for improvement of visitor facilities at nature reserves&rdquo;.  These are Rogerstown Estuary and Baldoyle Estuary, where approximately £10,000 will be spent between the two sites on providing educational-interpretative information panels to acquaint visitors and the general public on the natural history of the reserves.</P>

    <P>Mar chuid dá chúram maidir le athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an dul chun cinn d'fhoilsigh Bord na Gaeilge tuarascáil dar teideal &ldquo;An Dátheangachas san Earnáil Phoiblí&rdquo; i mí Bealtaine anuraidh. Díríonn an tuarascáil sin ar fhreagairt an hEarnála Poiblí i gcoitinne do na Treoirlínte faoin Dátheangachas san Earnáil Phoiblí a eisíodh chuig Ranna <Col N="423" /> Stáit agus Eagrais Stáit agus tá anailís neamhspléach inti a rinne an Foras Riaracháin thar ceann Bhord na Gaeilge.  Ba é sin an chéad thuairisc dá shórt agus beidh sí le foilsiú go bliantúil mar shlat tomhais chun feidhmiúna dtreoirlínte a mheas.</P>
    <P>Tá iarrtha ag Bord na Gaeilge ar na Ranna Stáit agus ar na hEagrais Stáit tuairisc a thabhairt an chur i bhfeidhm na gcláracha gníomhaíochta dá dtagraítear dóibh thuas go deireadh 1995. Chomh maith leis sin beidh iniúchadh á dhéanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge ar chur i bhfeidhm na dtreoirlínte trí cheistneoir a ullmhaíodh i gcomhairle leis an bhForas Riaracháin agus a scaipeadh ar Ranna Stáit agus ar Eagrais Stáit le líonadh. Déanfar anailís ar fhreagairt an cheistneora sin agus foilseofar na torthaí a luaithe is féidir i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Léirigh an tuarascáil dar teideal &ldquo;An Dátheangachas san Earnáil Phoiblí&rdquo; dá dtagraítear di thuas go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar go leor gnéithe den scéal, ina mease méadú in úsáid na Gaeilge i gcomharthíocht de gach saghas agus in úsáid stáiseanóireachta lándhátheangach.</P>

      <P>As outlined in that reply, efforts, under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to bring about a significant improvement in the reception of RTE television services in Northern Ireland have been ongoing for some time.  Any improvements in RTE reception brought about by this process will apply also to Teilifís na Gaeilge transmissions.</P>
      <P>A group established by the conference, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and their opposite numbers in the British Administration reported to the conference that the removal of the power restrictions towards Northern Ireland of the RTE transmitter at Clermont Carn offered the best prospects of a significant improvement in RTE reception in Northern Ireland in the short-term.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I and my colleague, Deputy Howlin, Minister for the Environment, established, in February 1995, an interdepartmental working group, made up of officials of our Departments and of the Office of Public Works, to examine and make recommendations on strengthening the protection for listed buildings, including recommendations for placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, for the introduction of incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of listed buildings, and for carrying out a full national architectural audit.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a similar parliamentary question from Deputy de Valera on 2 March 1995, I am very aware of the problem posed to owners of historic houses which are open to the public by the high costs of public liablity insurance and I have specifically asked that this matter be included in the remit of the working group.</P>

    <P>In addition, I am aware that my ministerial colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has commissioned a report on &ldquo;An Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland&rdquo;, including public liability insurance, from Deloitte and Touche, management consultants.  I understand that the report, which should form a blueprint for future action in this area, will be finalised shortly.  The consultants have been asked to make recommendations which may have a positive effect towards reducing the cost of insurance, including public liability insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by INDECON International Consultants on the section 35 tax incentive for <Col N="430" /> the Irish film industry was commissioned by me in the context of the Finance Act, 1993, which provided that the incentive would expire in 1996.  At a time when all tax incentives have been the subject of the most rigorous scrutiny by Government in the context of the 1996 budget, the House should be under no illusion that the extension of section 35 was in any way an automatic option for the Government.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed consideration of the INDECON report by my Department and by the Department of Finance, an amended section 35 regime has now been put in place up to 1999.  This new regime sends out a powerful signal to our film and television production industry that the range of incentives which I have introduced to develop the industry remain in place in the period up to 1999.  Industry practitioners are now well placed to address weaknesses identified, and to make strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the regime now in place to secure their long-term future.</P>
      <P>The essential features of the new section 35 regime are that they remain faithful to the core analysis in the INDECON report.  This analysis called for the maximisation of the return to the Exchequer in terms of expenditure on Irish employment and Irish goods and services; the reduction of the overall cost of the measure to the Exchequer; and the increase in the investment pool to make use of the new section 35 regime.  I am satisfied that the question of maximising indigenous production and of developing key talent in this country is addressed by the retention of the provision whereby up to 60 per cent of the cost of production of films, with budgets not exceeding £4 million, can be met by section 35 funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the other recommendations of the INDECON report, officials of my Department have already held meetings with representatives of the trade unions involved in the industry; with the key producer groups and industry representatives; and with the representatives of the financial intermediaries involved in <Col N="431" /> the raising of section 35 funds.  The analysis in the INDECON report concerning labour market entry restrictions and inflexibilities, the relative organisational weaknesses of the industry itself, and the question of leakage from the system arising from fees and commissions were brought to these groups' attention and a full and frank exchange of views ensured.  While it is not part of my function to intervene with market forces in the film and television production industry, I do look to the various industry interests to consider the INDECON analysis very carefully and, in a spirit of partnership with Government, to establish the essential conditions for the sustained development of the industry by responding to the INDECON analysis in an appropriate fashion.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 37 to 40 together.</P>
      <P>When I became aware last week that my Department's archival material contained information on cases of Irish children sent to be adopted abroad.  I instituted an inquiry to ascertain the extent of that information.  Most of the files relate to adoptions in the US but there is also mention of other destinations such as Britain, Canada and South Africa.  Until the material, which is in some 1,800 files, is researched in detail it will not be possible to say definitively how many adoptions were involved.</P>
      <P>What has been established at this stage is that a series of files dealing, <i>inter alia,</i> with the general question of adoption was opened in 1945, that, around 1950, files on individual cases began to be opened, that the majority of the adoptions abroad appear to have taken place in the 1950s and that the last ones appear to have been in the early 1970s. About 1,500 files relating to the years up to and including 1963 are in the National Archives and the remainder are in my Department.  The Passport Office, separately, has records on microfiche of passports issued to the children concerned.  Like all other files about passport applicants prior to 1979, the Passport Office files about children adopted abroad were destroyed after a certain period.</P>
      <P>The legal position with regard to access to the information in these files is being considered at present.  My Department is also consulting the Department of Health given that Department's central responsibility in relation to adoptions.  I hope that a way will be found to make the information available to the people concerned with the permission of those to whom it directly relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Department of Foreign Affairs in the matter of adoptions <Col N="433" /> was related to the issuing of passports to the children involved.  In this context the Department required documentation on the suitability of the prospective adoptive parents and proof that the mothers and guardians had given their consent to the children travelling abroad to be legally adopted.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Social Welfare Bureau in Dublin liaised with this Department and with the Catholic Charities Organisation in the US about the standards to be met by adoptive parents and the paperwork to be presented to us by the convents and orphanages as evidence of that when applying for passports for the children.  The Catholic Charities Organisation had branches throughout the US and the Department required that it be approved as a child placing agency under the law of the State in which each adoptive couple resided.</P>
    <P>Most of the children seem to have been under the care of religious sisters in adoption societies throughout the country and their legal guardians were the religious sisters in charge of those institutions into whose care their mothers had surrendered them.</P>
    <P>The files we have looked at contain little or no information about the circumstances in which the mothers made their sworn statements surrendering the children nor the way in which those statements were obtained.</P>
    <P>A list of approved adoption societies made available by the Department in response to inquiries from abroad in 1962 on the adoption of Irish children contained the following names, but there may have been others:</P>
    <P>Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland, 30 South Anne Street, Dublin.</P>

The Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish law must comply, provides that most charitable and voluntary activities are exempt from VAT: this means that bodies engaged in such activities do not charge VAT on the services that they provide but, as a necessary corollary, neither are they entitled to recover the tax borne on the goods and services they purchase in the course of these activities.  Generally speaking, VAT can <Col N="435" /> only be recovered by VAT-registered businesses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The nominal change in the Health Vote is a decrease of 1 per cent.  However when account is taken of the fact that funding for the disabled person's maintenance allowance was transferred from the Health Vote to the Vote for Minister for Social Welfare and allowing for certain once-off items of expenditure in 1995, there is real <Col N="436" /> increase in the Health Vote of approximately 4 per cent.  The Vote allows for the full year costs of developments initiated in 1995 and also includes a savings element of 0.7 per cent of non-capital expenditure, which as the Deputy is aware was required of each Minister, in the context of the 1996 Estimates.  The savings have been used as a contribution towards the cost of further service developments approved for 1996 in line with the Government Programme and the action plan contained in the health strategy.  These developments include child care services, services for the mentally handicapped, the physically disabled and the elderly, psychiatric services, dental services, acute hospitals and services for those with AIDS/HIV and drug problems.  I am satisfied that there is adequate funding to maintain services at approved 1995 levels and to provide for the critical service developments which are contained in the Government's programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Adjournment Debate on 5 March I informed the House that I would be asking the health boards to check any records that may be available to them to establish the extent of the practice of sending children abroad for adoption.  This has been followed up by my Department which wrote to the health boards in the matter on 6 March.</P>
      <P>My Department is in contact with the Adoption Board regarding assistance in making inquiries about records which registered adoption societies may have on children who were sent abroad for adoption.</P>
      <P>The records of the Department of Education relating to children placed in industrial schools in the past may also be of relevance and the two Departments will shortly be liaising on this matter.</P>
      <P>In tandem with these inquiries, my Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Education will give consideration to the most appropriate arrangements for collating the information contained in available records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to explain that my immediate priority in the adoption area is the introduction of amending legislation to address the issues raised in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland and to extend the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions to secure the recognition of adoptions effected in countries, including the People's Republic of China, whose laws permit the termination of adoptions in <Col N="440" /> particular circumstances.  I expect to be in a position within the next two weeks to seek Government authority to the drafting of a new Adoption Bill to deal with these two matters.</P>
    <P>It would also be my firm intention to bring forward at the earliest possible date a further Bill to provide for the establishment of a national adoption contact register to assist adopted persons and birth parents who wish to re-establish contact with one another.  The Government accepts that the law in this area is in need of updating to take account of recent developments in adoption practice and the changing nature of adoption.  The feasibility of extending the scope of the proposed contact register to include Irish persons adopted abroad in the past will be examined in the context of the preparation of the necessary enabling legislation.</P>

      <P>I will shortly be seeking the authority of the Government to the drafting of a new Adoption Bill to address the issues raised in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan -<i>v</i>- Ireland.  This will involve giving fathers of non-marital children a greater say in the adoption process.  The proposed Bill will also provide for certain amendments of the Adoption Act, 1991, which contains the current statutory framework for the recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also intend, as a separate exercise, to prepare legislative proposals for the establishment of an adoption contact register to facilitate adopted persons and birth parents who wish to re-establish contact with one another.  The question of an adopted person's right of access to his or her original birth <Col N="441" /> records will also be considered in that context as the two matters are interrelated.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention, in due course, to bring forward new legislation to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and International Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption.</P>

      <P>I can also confirm that the Eastern Health Board provided funding to a number of children's residential centres for the recruitment of additional staff.</P>

      <P>Go dtí go mbeidh struchtúr reachtúil ar leith bunaithe do Theilifís na Gaeilge tá RTE freagrach as na hoibreacha capitil don tseiribhís chomh mhaith le bheith freagrach as cúrsaí foirne an stáisiún, cláir a choimisiúnú agus reachtáil na seirbhíse nua.  Tuigim ó RTE go bhfuil £10,717,000 caite acu i ndáil leis an tseirbhís nua go deireadh mí Feabhra.  Baineann £7,353,000 den tsuim sin le caiteachas caipitil agus £3,364,000 le caiteachas reatha.  Mar a luadh cheana, meastar go mbeidh an tseirbhís nua ar an aer faoin 31 Deireadh Fómhair 1996.</P>
      <P>Rinne mé socruithe go mbeadh trí thuarascáil ar fáil dom i ndáil le Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Bhunaigh mé an Coiste Bunaithe chun comhairle a thabhairt dom maidir le bunú, structúir, sceidil na gclár agus amanna craolacháin na seiribíse nua agus An Coiste Teicniúil chun comhairle chur orm maidir le bunstruchtúir theicniúil na seirbhíse. Leag mé tuarascálacha an dá choiste sin faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais ar an 20 Iúil 1994.  Luíonn saineolas, maidir le pleanáil agus tógáil gréasáin theilifíse in Éirinn le RTE go príomha, agus bhí An Coiste Teicniúil ag brath go mór ar RTE i ndáil le meastacháin chostais agus comhairle faoin gcorás tarchuradóireachta ab oiriunaí don tseirbhís nua.

      <P>It is not, at this stage, possible to state the total investment in the film industry in 1995. The Audiovisual Production Federation of IBEC provides an economic database on all film and television production in the State, and reports for 1993 and 1994 are available.  However the annual IBEC report for 1995 will not be available until the second half of this year when all of the information will have been obtained from the various production companies and compiled by IBEC.</P>
      <P>During 1995, I certified a total of 49 film and television projects under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended.  The total of the budgets of these projects was £128.5 million and the certificates allowed for a total of £72.9 million to be raised under section 35.</P>
      <P>The estimated benefits-refunds by way of tax relief due to investors under section 35 in respect of these investments, assuming all the projects go ahead, amounts to some £32 million.  It should be noted, however, that in many cases there is a significant lag between the issue of a certificate and the claiming of tax relief on foot of that certificate, and that some projects may not proceed to production.</P>

      <P>I recently allocated £15,000 under the pilot scheme of grant aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.

      <P>Retrospective equal treatment payments are being made to married women who received lower entitlements than other claimants in similar circumstances in the period December 1984 to November 1986, when the EC directive on equal treatment was fully implemented.  Because people whose payments were reduced by the implementation of the equal treatment provisions in November 1986 received transitional payments to compensate for that reduction, the married women concerned are also receiving retrospective transitional payments.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations which gave effect to the equal treatment provisions the effective date, as far as entitlement to transitional payments for people who were in receipt of disability benefit is concerned is 17 November 1986.  In order to qualify for transitional payments, a person is required to have been receiving payment, inclusive of an adult dependant increase, on any day in the week prior to that date and to have lost the adult dependant increase under the new conditions which came into effect on that date.  A claimant not in receipt of disability benefit in respect of 17 November 1986 did not qualify for transitional payments.</P>
      <P>Transitional payments were intended to compensate people who, having been in receipt of benefit for a period prior to the effective date, suffered an actual reduction in payment as a result of the new situation.  I do not believe that a review of the regulation to cover the type of case referred to by the Deputy, would be justified in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>Civil servants employed before 6 April 1995 are insured at a modified rate of PRSI contribution which does not provide cover for unemployment benefit.  Full PRSI cover was extended to all new public sector employees, including new entrants to the civil service, recruited on or after 6 April 1995.</P>
      <P>Persons who are on a career break from the Civil Service and who are awaiting re-employment are not entitled to claim unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance as they fail to satisfy one of the conditions for the receipt of those payments which requires them to be continuously unemployed. Having regard to the conditions governing career breaks in the Civil Service, I have no plans to amend the social welfare code to allow persons on such breaks awaiting re-employment to claim unemployment payments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be interested in the following measures in place to support the role of women in rural society.  Under the <i>Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-1999</i> under the Structural Funds, Teagasc is committed to providing training for promoting the role and active participation of women in rural society.  In order to facilitate the participation of women in Teagasc training courses, a number of the adult courses will be reserved for women in 1996, with an anticipated enrolment of about 700.</P>
      <P>The training needs of women were the subject of a study commissioned by Teagasc and carried out in 1995 with funding under the EU NOW initiative. Their training programme covers the following areas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Certificate in Farming now includes a module stressing the importance of involving women in the whole decision making process in relation to agriculture and rural development</P>
      <P>&mdash;specific courses are provided for rural women on personal development, start-your-own business, food enterprise, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;since 1994 under the Operational Programme, new Rural Enterprise courses have been provided in the food, tourism, horticulture and <Col N="462" /> horse development areas and it is encouraging to note that 78 per cent of the participants in 1994-1995 were women.</P>
    <P>Teagasc, in association with FÁS and CERT, are engaged in a project to develop a gender proofing system in their organisations.</P>
    <P>Progress in all of these areas is monitored by this Department and will come up for discussion at the next meeting of the Monitoring Committee of the Operational Programme (on which the social partners are represented) on 28 March 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Leader:</i> No new measures are proposed. In the programme as it operates, while there is no specific emphasis in favour of women, all groups must give equal access to women in all of their training and project activities.</P>
    <P>A target of 40 per cent representation of women on the boards of the Leader project has been set.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Training:</i> the Rural Training Advisory Committee (RUTAC) is well advanced in establishing a new Rural Training Course which will be provided by Teagasc and other Training Agencies (FÁS, CERT, etc.).  Particular provision will be made to encourage women to participate in the new course.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rural Development Policy Advisory Group:</i> This broadly representative group has been established to advise on the formulation of future policy.  Among the issues which the group will report to the Minister on is the involvement and participation of women in rural development.</P>

      <Quest>whether a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will qualify for the REP scheme if he leases 30 acres of land which has been in the National Heritage area for six years.</Quest>

      <P>It is not possible to say from the information provided if the person named will qualify for the REP scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible to participate in REPs a farmer must be farming a minimum of three hectares of land owned or leased for a period not less than five years.  A farmer is defined as a person or group of persons deemed by the Minister to be engaged in the practice of farming. Participants must undertake a range of <Col N="464" /> measures as set out in the scheme with the objective of</P>
    <P>&mdash;establishing farming practices and controlled production methods which reflect the increasing public concern for conservation, landscape protection and wider environmental problems</P>
    <P>&mdash;protecting wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna</P>
    <P>&mdash;producing quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly manner.</P>
    <P>A copy of the scheme document will be sent separately to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The position on the leasing of land in NHAs in the context of REPs is being examined in my Department at present. I am concerned that some land leases, in NHAs and in other areas, were, it would appear, devised for the purposes of drawing down increased REPs payments and involved little or no environmental improvements.  Applications submitted where no environmental improvements are evident will be rejected.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have given approval for Aer Rianta International to make a bid in partnership with a leading London financial institution for a 40 per cent shareholding in Birmingham Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta International has been selected as the preferred bidder and the due diligence process is currently under way.  On completion of this process.  Aer Rianta will make a further submission <Col N="465" /> to my Department before any final decision or commitment is made.</P>
