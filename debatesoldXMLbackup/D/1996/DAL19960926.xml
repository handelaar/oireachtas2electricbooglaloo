      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that Government inaction on the issue of drugs is having a devastating effect on local communities?  Despite all the legislation passed by and promised by this House communities are taking to the streets all over this city and elsewhere to drive drug pushers out of their midst.  Is it not the case that Government inaction and floundering policies are creating major difficulties which could well end up in tragedy?</P>

      <P>In view of the judgment in the McKenna case prior to the last referendum, will the Taoiseach say whether the Government has any legislation in train to establish an independent referendum commission to ensure the Government will not try to influence the outcome of a referendum? Are there are such proposals in the Government programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to legislation in respect of the proposed referendum on bail.  Does the Government intend to introduce any legislation on foot of the judgment in the McKenna case which effectively forbade the Government from spending Government money to promote campaigns for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in a referendum? I have on the Order Paper the Independent Referendum Commission Bill, 1996.  Will the Taoiseach consider having it taken in Government time to give effect to the judgment in the McKenna case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be helpful to Deputy Dempsey.  No legislation has been promised at this stage on the matter referred to so, strictly <Col N="652" /> speaking, the matter is not in order.  I can, however, tell the Deputy that the issues raised in the McKenna judgment, in so far as they might require legislation, are being considered carefully. The matter contained in the Deputy's legislation is being considered in parallel but no final decision has been taken at this stage.  The matter is being considered with some degree of urgency in view of the fact that we will have another referendum in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to introduce youth service legislation in advance of the Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill, 1996, to indicate that the Government is trying to help young people as well as punish them?  This would give a good signal in terms of Government priority.  On what date might this legislation be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to make the point that the Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill, 1996, is designed to help and rehabilitate young people who have got into difficulty.  The Deputy should not characterise the legislation in the way he has or draw the contrast he is attempting to draw by putting his question in that way.  However, having said that, the Government has authorised the drafting of youth services legislation and I hope it will be introduced before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy during the last session that the Bill in question is in drafting.  I am aware that the legislation is urgent because of the need to provide a licensing framework for aquaculture.  I intend that we will see that legislation before the end of the year, perhaps comparatively early in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> On the question of greyhound legislation it is not possible to give any time for the date of introduction of the legislation because the matter is still the subject of consultation with the relevant interests in the industry.  I am sure the Deputy, being as interested in the industry as I am, wishes it to be consulted properly.</P>

      <P>Arising from the legislation on light rail, which we passed before the summer recess the Taoiseach promised that as soon as the European Commission had reported on the social and economic arguments in regard to the Ballymun line, he would make a statement.  I understand the Commission has now reported.  When will the Government announce that the Ballymun line is included in the light rail plans?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept the Deputy is introducing would represent a major change in traditional approaches to asylum.  The implications of that would be quite difficult to measure.  Such a change would also have to be examined in the context of our responsibilities as part of a common travel area with other countries in the European Union.  We need to be aware of that consideration at all times.  As far as possible there should be a uniform approach on asylum issues at European Union level.  This is one of the issues currently under examination in the Intergovernmental Conference concerning the new treaties of the European Union which we hope to see approved next year.  Pending that wider consideration I would not be in a position to give any answers in regard to the concept which the Deputy has introduced.  He should analyse this concept very carefully before advocating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three promised Bills on the Order Paper relating to changes in the bail laws.  Is the Government mindful that the change in the law on bail will have huge implications for the management of the Prison Service and for the allocation of more prison spaces?  Is the Government prepared to bring forward additional measures to reform the Prison Service given that, for example, so far 197 people have absconded from open prisons this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need for total reform of our Prison Service.  Is there a plan to deal with this creaking prison service which has allowed 197 persons to abscond this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the Government's announcements of the introduction of a referendum to permit a change in the law on bail was accompanied by announcements of additional prison spaces.  We recognise, and have recognised from the beginning of our consideration of this matter, that the provision of additional prison spaces would be required.  The Deputy has advocated views on the <Col N="657" /> management of the Prison Service. Those are policy decisions that would be best the subject of a substantive motion or discussion at Question Time with the Minister for Justice.  They are not matters that require legislation in accordance with arrangements as they exist, but of course improvements can be suggested and will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that developments at EU level, as outlined by me last night require fundamental changes in the regulation and administration of telecommunications in Ireland.  These changes must take place against the background of the Government's objectives for the sector.  The Government's key objectives is to achieve a telecommunications sector which is in the top quartile of OECD indicators of price competitiveness, quality and availability as soon as possible. The Government believes that such a sector will play an important part in maintaining and developing Ireland's economic competitiveness.  Before outlining the steps which are being taken to achieve this objective and the role of this Bill in this context, I would like to briefly review the current status of telecommunications in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of providing telecommunications services in Ireland was transferred from the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Telecom Éireann on its establishment on 1 January 1984.  Telecom Éireann's function is <Col N="659" /> to provide a national telecommunications service within the State and between the State and the rest of the world.  It has the duty to meet the needs of the State for comprehensive and efficient telecommunications services and to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services throughout the State, so far as is reasonably practicable.  This is the company's universal service obligation. The company has the exclusive privilege of offering, providing and maintaining the public telecommunications network and voice telephony services. In addition, Telecome Éireann is the only undertaking licensed to provide international public infrastructure and international voice telephony services. The company's privilege, as originally granted, has been narrowed as areas of the sector have been opened up to competition.</P>
    <P>Investment in telecommunications has been an important component of productive infrastructural investment in the Irish economy since the late 1970s. More recently, the scale of investment has remained at an impressive level. Total investment since 1985 has been of the order of £1.9 billion.  This investment has generated tangible results in terms of the capability and quality of the infrastructure.  At this stage 75 per cent of the national backbone transmission network is based on optical fibre and 80 per cent of Telecom Éireann's customers are connected to digital exchanges.  This is on a par with the most advanced networks of other member states.  However, investment continues to be required to meet the growing demand for new services, such as mobile communications, and enhance the ability of the network to provide widespread advanced services.  In particular, this requires further investment in the customer access network.</P>
    <P>As regards market development, Telecom Éireann has 1.3 million lines in service giving a national telephone density of 35 per cent.  This has grown from 28 per cent in 1990 but lies well behind the EU average of 48 per cent.  The <Col N="660" /> Government is determined that this gap should close over the medium term.</P>
    <P>As regards telephone tariffs, Ireland has historically had high average charges for telephony, although some elements have been provided below cost.  However, in recent years, in preparation for competition, charges have been substantially adjusted and this had led to a better alignment between costs and revenues.  Since 1990, all charges including rentals and local calls have fallen significantly in real terms.  Overall reductions of the order of 40 per cent in real terms have been achieved, and long distance prices have fallen by over 60 per cent.  Despite this achievement, Ireland still has a relatively high level of telephony prices compared to many of our EU partners and certain prices are still out of alignment with costs.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has made significant progress in improving its financial position in recent years.  Its debt level has been reduced from two and a half times annual turnover in 1985 to 60 per cent in the year to March 1996.  While this level is now comparable with some other public telecommunications operators, further progress is required to give Telecom Éireann the same financial flexibility enjoyed by others.  An important aspect of the delivery of telecommunications services, like in all other areas of business, is the need to provide the optimum customer service. Telecom Éireann has made considerable progress in this area.  I welcome the publication earlier this year of its customer charter.</P>
    <P>Apart from Telecom Éireann, the Irish telecommunications sector includes a number of other service providers. These operators are entitled under licence to provide services outside of Telecom Éireann's exclusive privilege.  Approximately 30 of such service providers are licensed to provide liberalised services.  In addition a second operator has been licensed to provide GSM mobile telephony in competition with Eircell, which has been established as an independent subsidiary of Telecom Éireann.  Another segment of the <Col N="661" /> sector, the provision of terminal equipment, is fully liberalised and no licence is required.</P>
    <P>Apart from the second GSM operator, licensed service providers are not currently entitled to provide or use infrastructures, other than lines leased from Telecom Éireann, satellite networks or cable television networks, for the transmission of the services which they are licensed to provide.</P>
    <P>Having briefly outlined the current position regarding telecommunications in Ireland, I will indicate the main features of the Government's programme for the achievement of our objectives for the sector.  The main elements are: the further development of Telecom Éireann as a major player, providing high quality telecommunications services in both monopoly services and emerging competitive markets; the establishment of an independent regulator for the telecommunications sector; and the liberalisation of the market to allow full competition.</P>
    <P>To accelerate the further development of Telecom Éireann the Government and the company have agreed it should form a strategic alliance with a major telecommunications operator. Furthermore, it was agreed the best way to secure a successful long-term strategic alliance would be to enable the partner to take an equity stake in Telecom Éireann.  The Government and Telecom Éireann sought a partner which would have the necessary commercial and technological experience and capabilities and commitment to support the company in growing and developing its business.</P>
    <P>The Government approved a mandate for negotiation of a strategic alliance in July 1995 and, following an open and competitive selection process, the Government in July of this year approved the signature of an alliance agreement with KPN/Telia.  The details of the selection process and the main features of the agreement with KPN/Telia have already been outlined in the House so it is not necessary to go into detail on these issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> The second major element of the Government's strategy for the sector is the establishment of an independent regulator.  Up to now, the regulation of the sector has been a function of the Minister.  The Minister is, at the same time, the shareholder of the major player in the market and responsible for the overall development of the sector. With the emergence of competition in the Irish telecommunications market, it is appropriate that the regulation of the sector be seen to be independent from the Minister's shareholding and sectoral development functions.  This separation is also a feature of telecommunications development in most of our EU partners and a requirement of pending EU legislation.  It is all the more appropriate given the strategic alliance deal in which the Minister, as Telecom Éireann shareholder, will have a shareholding relationship with a consortium of international public telecommunications operators.</P>
    <P>The legislative measures necessary to establish the regulator are outlined in the Bill.  I will elaborate on these provisions later.  It is the Government's intention to establish a multi-sector regulator covering energy and communications at a later date when the drafting of necessary legislative provisions is completed.  The functions of the telecommunications regulator will be subsumed into this body on, or shortly after, the establishment of the multi-sector regulator.</P>
    <P>The third element of the Government's strategy for the development of the telecommunications sector is the liberalisation of the market to allow full competition.  The Government has decided to remove all remaining restrictions on full competition so that the market will be fully liberalised by 1 January 2000.  While full liberalisation will take place from 1 January 1998 in the European Union, some member states, including Ireland, have the possibility of deferring liberalisation for up to five years.  The Government has decided not to avail of the full five years in order that the benefits of competition can be <Col N="663" /> experienced as soon as possible. However, the Government was concerned to ensure that when full competition is allowed Ireland should have a strong national telecommunications operator in Telecom Éireann, capable of withstanding the rigours of competition and growing further in that area. The Government believes the ongoing transformation and development of Telecom Éireann as a customer-focused and market-oriented company will have reached the stage by the year 2000 where it will be in a position to compete against new entrants to the liberalised Irish telecommunications market.</P>
    <P>This Bill is aimed at putting in place some of these key steps in achieving the Government's objectives for the telecommunications sector.  The measures in the Bill can be grouped into three main areas.  First, the Bill provides for the establishment of the director of telecommunications regulation and transfers the Minister's existing telecommunications regulatory functions to the director.  Second, it will make the necessary legislative amendments to permit the strategic alliance agreement with KPN/Telia and the share transactions which will underpin the deal.  In this regard, it makes some changes to the relationship between the Government and Telecom Éireann that are appropriate to a situation where the company has shareholders other than the Government.  Third, the Bill provides for a new method of telecommunications tariff control, initially by the Minister and ultimately by the director of telecommunications regulation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the office of the director of telecommunications regulation is provided for in section 2 and further provisions regarding the director are set out in the First Schedule.  The director will be in a position within the Civil Service and the appointment will be for a period of up to six years. Section 5 requires the Minister to provide, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, staff, premises, equipment and other resources required by the <Col N="664" /> director for the performance of his or her functions.</P>
    <P>The office of the director will accordingly be staffed with Civil Service staff transferred from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications but the director will have power to acquire externally sourced staff subject to approval of overall staff numbers by the Minister for Finance.  While the Bill provides that the Minister may delegate his powers in relation to the transferred staff to the director, thereby giving the director full control over those staff, the Government has decided that the Civil Service staff will be seconded to the office of the director and thus will nominally remain officers of the Minister. The position will be reviewed in the context of the establishment of the multi-sector regulator and the integration of the director's functions with those of the multi-sector regulator.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 sets out the functions of the director.  The functions are those transferred from the Minister under section 4 as well as further functions conferred by the Bill.  The director's functions will mainly involve the issuing and enforcement of licences for telecommunications service providers, for the use of the radio frequency spectrum, including the use of the spectrum for broadcasting, and cable television infrastructure. The director will also have responsibility for tariff regulation after the first tariff order is made by the Minister. I will outline the tariff regulation provisions later.  The Bill includes powers, in section 12, for the director to appoint authorised officers to obtain information necessary for the performance of the director's functions.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the director shall be independent in the exercise of his or her functions.  This is a key principle underlying the establishment of the office of director.  Consistent with this principle, section 6 provides for the financing of the costs by the director in exercising his or her functions.  The director will retain fees which are payable under the transferred licensing functions and may also impose a levy on <Col N="665" /> providers of telecommunications services. The levy will be raised through a levy order by the director and used to meet the director's expenses.  It will also be used for the payment by the Minister of Ireland's membership charges to international telecommunications organisations.  The director will only be permitted to retain the amounts which are necessary to meet the costs of providing the regulatory services and if there is any surplus it will be surrendered to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The second main purpose of the Bill, to which I referred earlier, is to provide for the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance.  Section 8 removes restrictions contained in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, on the issue and transfer of shares in Telecom Éireann, thereby enabling Telecom Éireann's strategic partner to take an equity stake in the company.  The section places a lower limit on the shareholding of the Minister and the Minister for Finance in the company: their aggregate shareholding shall not be reduced to less than a majority of the issued share capital.  Section 9 enables the Ministers and the company to enter into agreements related to the sale and issue of equity in the company.  Such agreements may cover a wide range of issues connected with governance of the company, investments and other matters. The strategic alliance arrangement with the KPN/Telia consortium involves three agreements: a share purchase agreement, under which the consortium will acquire its equity stake in the company, a shareholders' agreement, which set out the framework for the relationship between the Ministers and the consortium in regard to the governance of Telecom Éireann, and an agreement on strategic co-operation setting out the contributions to be made by the consortium to Telecom Éireann at strategic and operational levels.</P>
    <P>An important component of the strategic alliance transaction and in the achievement of the benefits of the alliance is the opportunity which will be afforded to the staff of Telecom Éireann <Col N="666" /> to share in the growth of the company. Section 8 enables the company to issue, and the Ministers to transfer, shares in the company for the purpose of employee shareholding schemes.  As part of the mandate for the strategic alliance negotiations which the Government approved at the start of the process, the Government indicated that, subject to certain conditions, they were willing to consider setting aside up to 5 per cent of the share capital for an employee shareholding scheme.  The Government's intention is that the terms under which the shares will be issued will be to encourage active participation by employees as shareholders in the company and that the scheme should facilitate the change management process within the company leading to the continued improvement of the company's customer service, quality and commercial success.  Detailed negotiations with the staff on the restructuring of the company and on employee shareholding have yet to take place.  I am aware that staff representatives have expressed interest in a larger employee shareholding.  If negotiations result in an agreement among all parties, including the strategic partner, which would assist in the future development of the company and if such an agreement involved practical and feasible arrangements by the staff to purchase at full value shares in excess of 5 per cent I will be prepared to put appropriate proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill also relates to the strategic alliance issue.  It modifies the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, in relation to the number of employee directors to be appointed to Telecom Éireann.  Currently, under those Acts, the number of employee directors of Telecome Éireann is one-third of the total number of directors of the company, which has been set at 12.  The Government has agreed in the context of the strategic alliance transaction that the partner will be entitled to appoint three directors to a board of 12.  In order <Col N="667" /> to preserve the Minister's majority position on the board to reflect the Government's majority shareholding, the Government has agreed in the context of the transaction to reduce the number of employee directors to a number which does not exceed one-third of the number which the Minister is otherwise entitled to appoint.  Accordingly, the Government has agreed that the Minister should appoint seven, including the chairman and the chief executive, and that the number of employee directors to be appointed under the worker participation Acts should be two.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the possible implications from an employee representation point of view of a reduction of employee directors from four to two. However, this solution was driven by the need to preserve effective control of the State's majority shareholding, the representational interests of the strategic partner, the objective of maintaining a small to medium sized board for the purpose of effective governance and the need to have meaningful employee representation at the key decision making forum in respect of company operations.  I am, however, open to any suggestions, proposals or amendments that may emerge from consultations with the trade unions involved and interested parties as to how the employee issue could evolve.  If agreement is reached and if such agreement requires changes to the text of the Bill, new proposals could be introduced on Committee Stage or, if some form of agreement could not be reached quickly, the matter could be dealt with in subsequent legislative proposals during 1997.  I would like to emphasise that State representation on the board is also being reduced and employee director representation is being kept at the highest level possible consistent with the need for majority control by the State as majority shareholder on a 12 person board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> The third main purpose of the Bill which I mentioned earlier is to introduce a new method of regulating telecommuncations tariffs.  Currently the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, allows Telecom Éireann to set rates and other terms and conditions for its telecommunications services but the company must obtain the Minister's approval for price increases. Service providers licensed to provide services outside Telecome Éireann's exclusive privilege are not subject to price control.  The Government believes that tariff regulation remains necessary for services offered in markets which have not reached a sufficient level of competition to ensure that tariffs will remain at reasonable levels.  However, regulation of the tariffs for such services should enable Telecom Éireann to position itself for a competitive environment by giving it flexibility to adjust tariffs to better reflect its costs while, at the same time, capturing for consumers a share of the benefits of increased efficiency and driving overall tariffs in Ireland closer to relevant international comparisons.</P>
    <P>After reviewing the various approaches, the Government has decided to employ a &ldquo;price cap&rdquo; type system of tariff regulation for services that are not subject to full competition. The price cap is a common tool of price control in markets approaching liberalisation where there is a need to ensure that consumer benefit from price reductions while at the same time affording the telecommunications operator the opportunity to restructure charges in advance of competition. Under the price cap system, charges are limited for defined &lsquo;baskets&rsquo; of services but the service provider has some flexibility to adjust tariffs for individual services within the baskets.  This confers freedom to restructure tariffs with reference to growing competition as well as strong incentive to increase efficiency. Section 7 provides that the Minister may make an order specifying a price cap for a specified basket of telecommunications services provided by a company. The price cap order will specify that the <Col N="669" /> combined prices of the services included in the basket will not increase beyond a specified level and this level will be set at a certain percentage below the consumer price index.  This will ensure that prices will fall in nominal as well as real terms.  This function will be transferred to the director along with the Minister's other regulatory functions.  However, to allow companies a stable environment in which to implement business plans, any price cap order which is in force at the time of the transfer will not be subject to review the director until two years after it is made and then only at the request of the Minister.  However, the director may modify the order on the basis of that review.  Five years after the price cap order has been made by the Minister, the director may review and modify the order on his or her own initiative.</P>
    <P>Apart from the three main areas covered by the Bill, which I have just outlined, it also makes technical amendments to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 regarding the pension arrangements for persons who were members of the staff of the former Department of Posts and Telegraph and who retired or died before the day on which the transfer of staff from that Department to Telecom Éireann and An Post took place.  The amendments underpin practical arrangements which have been put in place for the discharge of the liability of the Minister for Finance relating to those pre-vesting day pensioners of Telecom Éireann and An Post.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions deal with offences and penalties for breaches of provisions repeals of provisions of certain enactments, the procedure for laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the payment of the expenses of the Minister in the administration of the Act and the commencement provisions. In relation to the repeals, these are required mainly to update the corporate governance framework applying to Telecom Éireann having regard to the strategic alliance.  A number of the <Col N="670" /> provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 which apply jointly to Telecom Éireann and to An Post are being repealed in so far as they relate to Telecom Éireann only.  As regards commencement of the Act, section 17 provides that the Minister may by order bring different provisions of the Act into force at different times but at the latest the whole Act will come into force ninety days after it is passed.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the background to and the main provisions.  I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the telecommunications sector is undergoing an unprecedented period of growth and development.  This sector is becoming increasingly important as a facilitator of economic and social growth and wellbeing.  The Government has decided that the telecommunications sector in Ireland must be in the top quartile of international indicators of price competitiveness, quality and availability by the end of this decade.  The steps provided for in this Bill are essential to enable this target to be achieved. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his address to the House.  Fianna Fáil, has decided to oppose this legislation because we believe the public is being short-changed by what can only be described as a scandalous deal &mdash; a deal which, apparently, has the agreement of the Minister, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; to sell to two companies, KPN of Holland and Telia of Sweden 20 per cent, to start with, of Telecom Éireann.  The Bill is seriously flawed in several respects, and it reflects this Government's incoherent strategy for Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>The sale of 20 per cent of Telecom for £183 million is a betrayal of the taxpayer who, as the Minister rightly pointed out this morning, has invested heavily in the telecommunications industry for 15 years.  Up to £2 billion has been invested in the telecommunications service; now, 20 per cent of that is being sold on the cheap in what I have already described as a panic sale</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The price achieved is derisory and seriously undervalues a major State asset.  Twenty per cent of Telecom Éireann, which, incidentally, includes Eircell and Cablelink, is worth three or four times the £183 million achieved, and I predict it will be sold for this some time in the next decade.  However, the beneficiaries will not be this State, Telecom Éireann or the worker or taxpayer but the Dutch and Swedish investors, who will make a major killing in the next decade on these cheap shares. Fianna Fáil would not have entertained this deal, put together by Deputies Spring and De Rossa.</P>
    <P>Telecom's turnover in 1994 was £871 million, 1995 it was £979 million and in 1996 it was over £1 billion.  Its profits on ordinary activites rose from £80 million in 1994 to nearly £200 million in 1996. Its net debt has decreased from over £1 billion in 1994 to £718 million now, while annual capital expenditure ran at about £200 million per annum.  In this deal, a company which makes profits of almost £200 million, if one adjusts for depreciation, is now being valued at £900 million.  The real value of Telecom Éireann, even factoring in the arrival of competition, is up at the £2 billion mark. If the Minister cares to check that with any stockbroker in this city, he will be told this company is worth up to £2 billion, not the £900 million that, <i>pro rata</i>, the Minister has got for it.  This is about ten times profit, which is the norm for the telecommunications industry. That price would make 20 per cent worth at least £400 million, not the £183 million which the Minister has flogged it off for.</P>
    <P>Less than three years ago a figure of £460 million was being discussed for 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  That was just an initial offer which would have been upped in negotiations.  At one stage, ten telecommunications players were in the field for Telecom Éireann. There was great scope to get a good partner at a good price.  However, the Minister's and the Government's handling of the competition has resulted in <Col N="672" /> eight of the ten bidders dropping out.  In the end, the Minister was stuck with KPN and Telia.  They had him over a barrel and negotiated this deal which values 35 per cent of Telecom at just £315 million.</P>
    <P>This deal does not just give KPN-Telia a stake in Telecom's core business for £183 million, it also gives them 35 per cent of Cablelink and Eircell, both potentially very profitable operations in their own right.  It is abundantly clear that the deal is not in the best interests of the taxpayer or the economy.  Worse again, all the rights and vetoes in this deal are held by the Dutch and the Swedes.  They can decide whether to buy the extra 15 per cent.  The State cannot choose when or whether this right is taken up or is waived.</P>
    <P>The construction of the deal, which has cost in the region of £5 million in foreign consultancy fees, is highly questionable. A provision is made to revalue Telecom in three years time.  However, by waiting three years to value Telecom, an incentive is surely built into the deal for the Dutch and the Swedes to restrict, not increase, the value of the company. By restricting the value, the KPN-Telia consortium can keep down the price they have to pay for the further 15 per cent.  To create an incentive for the purchase of 20 per cent in order to keep the price down for the remaining 15 per cent, rather than an incentive to keep the price up, is a silly structure to put in place.  Of course, they will work to keep the price down to buy the additional 15 per cent and that will restrict the value of Telecom in that three year period.</P>
    <P>Already the Dutch and Swedes appear to be calling the shots at this arrangement with media reports that the consortium may be seeking a refund and a change in terms if the EU derogations are not achieved.  The Minister has presented the derogations publicly as a &ldquo;done deal&rdquo;.  It appears some back-tracking is taking place.  Last weekend in Dublin a senior European Commission civil servant gave a strong signal that Ireland may not be granted two of the three Telecom derogations it is <Col N="673" /> seeking.  While Ireland may get a two year derogation on full competition on voice telephony, it may face competition next year for certain business from companies with alternative communications networks.  Telecom may also be forced by the EU to sell its 80 per cent stake in Cablelink as part of an agreement on a derogation in relation to competition on voice telephony.  If this is sold off the Dutch and the Swedes will probably refuse to pay any serious amount in three years time.</P>
    <P>The situation would worsen if a four year derogation which has been sought on a directive which would allow mobile phone companies to bypass Telecom for trunk and international calls is not granted.  The EU official who was in Dublin last weekend said the alternative infrastructure market has to be opened as soon as possible, if not by 1996 at least by 1997.  This would allow companies with existing networks, such as Esat Digifone, ESB, RTÉ and CIE to compete with Telecom for closed user business.  That would mean that the GTM system which is available in Leinster House could be contracted out to someone else with their own infrastructure.  If there is back-tracking on these two derogations, KPN-Telia will be in a very strong negotiating position and may be able to get 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann without having to pay anything near the £500 million which the Minister is claiming will be achieved in the long-term.</P>
    <P>If KPN/Telia was the best telecommunications group in the world one might see some logic in this deal.  If the benefits were not monetary perhaps it would be enjoining a major world telecommunications bloc, but that is not the case.  While KPN/Telia are members of the Unisource group, Unisource is not the one taking shares in Telecom Éireann.  Unisource will not own the shares but rather two constituent companies: one Swedish and one Dutch.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's own consultants, Monitor, came to the conclusion during the run-up to the alliance that Unisource's members had too many <Col N="674" /> internal problems to be a good partner for the semi-State company.  Monitor also came to the conclusion that Unisource was not likely to be interested in any real sense in Ireland.  I understand it based that conclusion on the comments made by the president of Unisource who waxed eloquently about the benefits of operating in other European countries.</P>
    <P>Unisource has yet to prove itself as a buffer against British Telecom and other world players, such as AT&amp;T. Frankly, KPN/Telia are not being rated in technology terms.  I understand from an article in <i>The Financial Times</i> recently they are experiencing significant internal pressures seeking funds from their own Government in order to make further capital investments without taking on Telecom Éireann.  Many who have had dealings with them claim it is unclear how the KPN/Telia partnership operates.  Some claim the Swedish arm, Telia, has only shown an interest in Telecom's mobile operation.  Whatever may be said about KPN/Telia, the group can certainly see an opportunity for their investors and I congratulate them on that.  Would that our Government could see the same potential.  Whereas the Dutch and Swedish investors will reap the rewards from this deal, it is a disastrous deal from the Irish taxpayers' point of view.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not given Telecom workers or Irish pension funds a look in?  He has only grudgingly given a small stake to the Telecom workforce. His comments today about flexibility are clearly designed to get this Bill through without incurring the wrath of the unions.  I know what the Minister is at in that regard: get this Bill through, promise to look after them in the next Bill and hope they do not crowd the Gallery in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Irish pension funds which contain Irish workers' money have already put forward a plan as to how they could participate in the opening up of the Irish semi-State sector.  If Irish pension funds want to buy a slice of the Irish telecommunications revolution they have to <Col N="675" /> take a stake in a Dutch firm, KPN. According to <i>The Financial Times,</i> it is likely that the Swedish state company, Telia, will shortly go on the stock exchange.  Again, Irish pension funds will have to get access to Telecom Éireann shares by buying shares on the Swedish Stock Exchange.  This is crazy. Irish fund managers seeking investment in Telecom Éireann will have to buy into a foreign company in order to get a diluted second hand investment in Telecom Éireann, a company built up by Irish taxpayers.  That is why I described this deal as scandalous.</P>
    <P>Irish pension funds add up to about £15 billion and about 40 per cent or £6 billion is invested abroad.  About £240 million of that £6 billion is invested in overseas telecommunications companies such as British Telecom.  It is ludicrous that £240 million of Irish workers' money, Irish pension fund money, can be invested abroad in Telecom companies but cannot be invested in our Telecom company.  That is difficult to explain.  Why are they being excluded? Why are Irish pension funds being told to get lost, that they cannot invest in Telecome Éireann while foreign, private and public investors are being included by this Government?  The Minister has excluded the funds of Irish workers, Irish pension funds, from the telecommunications revolution.  It is exciting but, according to the Government, no Irish need apply.  If you want shares in this company you will have to buy them on the Swedish Stock Exchange or in the long-term on the Dutch Stock Exchange.  That is the gift of this Government to the people who built Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The left wing parties in this Government have had an interesting conversion to privatisation.  They have not said a word about the sell-off of 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  If a Fianna Fáil Government was sitting on the Government benches flogging a stake in a State company to foreign investors, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, the Minister of State at the <Col N="676" /> Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, would be hanging from the rafters seething at the mouth in protest at the selling of the State's silver.  I understand from my Chief Whip &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; that they do not propose to speak in this debate as neither Democratic Left nor the Labour Party appears to have speakers listed.  They are leaving it to the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to make the sale to the foreigners while the Irish cannot get involved and the left wing keep their heads down.  That is a cosy cartel.</P>
    <P>At the time of the sale of the shares in Irish Life, Deputy Taylor said it would be a gross dereliction of the public interest if the privatisation of Irish Life, in whole or in part, were to be allowed to proceed without full disclosure of all the facts and all the options considered by the Government.  He went on to say that one of the critical issues in relation to Irish Life was the value of the company and how that value was arrived at.  He said that in 1986 the then Minister for Finance reported to the Government that the company had substantial reserves and that this company was floated in secret. It is almost inevitable that it will be sold on the cheap and that the initial investors will make a quick killing.  Would he say that now about Telecom Éireann? He said the public was not being well served when fundamental decisions which could ultimately affect our economic sovereignty and independence were made behind closed doors.  These decisions are being made behind closed doors because the Minister does not propose to publish the documentation or deal or tell us how he calculated the value.  He should not try to tell me that the market decides the value because there is no market when there is only one bidder for the shares in the company: that is not a market, it is a secret deal.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, a Cabinet <Col N="677" /> colleague of the Minister, Deputy Lowry, undertake to make all the facts surrounding the Telecom deal known to the House and the public?  Will all the secret consultancy reports and studies which we have demanded for more than 12 months be placed in the Oireachtas Library today?  Will the Minister, Deputy Taylor, come into the House this morning, this evening or tomorrow and tell us about the sale of Telecom Éireann and his views on quick profits, secret deals and initial investors who make quick killings?  I would also like to hear his views on the differences between the sale of Irish Life and the sale of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Many times on the Order of Business I have asked the Taoiseach the number of Bills which will be brought forward to regulate Telecom and this famous strategic alliance.  This is not a strategic alliance or a sell-off, rather it is a sell-out and the more one analyses it the clearer it is that it is a scandal.  Two foreign companies, not even a group, are being sold a big slice of one of our most successful State companies for a knockdown price.  This is happening in secret and without a whimper from the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, or the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. No reports have been published. The public and workers in Telecom Éireann should ask those parties why they are not here today.  I would like them to contribute to this debate and to explain how the price was arrived at and the part they played in arriving at this scandalous deal.</P>
    <P>The list of legislation shows that two Bills similar to this one are being proposed by the Minister.  Yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach told me that the new telecommunications Bill will not be introduced until 1997 and that the utilities regulatory commission Bill will establish a regulatory commission which will be responsible for the independent regulation of the energy, communications and transport sectors.  If the commission will have overall responsibility for regulating the <Col N="678" /> communications industry, what is the purpose of the provision in this Bill which will set up a regulator for the telecommunications industry?  How can one get both these proposals to get and say, as was stated in the House yesterday, that in order to put the strategic alliance in place a new Bill will be needed in 1997?  I understood that this was the Bill which would allow the Minister to sell the shares in Telecom Éireann.  How many Bills will be introduced to deal with this issue?  I wonder if the way in which the price was arrived at and the three-headed nature of the Government is behind the proliferation of Bills and the attempt to conceal what is really happening &mdash; the sale of shares in a major State company in as surreptitious, quiet and secret a way as possible?  The issue is being shrouded in complexity by the use of nice phrases such as &ldquo;strategic alliance&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulatory systems&rdquo;, but as we know this is a good old fashioned flog-off of shares to overseas companies.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other fundamental flaws in the Bill.  I am aghast at the provisions in section 7 which the Minister held out as very useful.  In short, section 7 provides for telephone price increases.  At a time when there is huge pressure for price reductions, it is ludicrous to include in a Bill a clause which in effect says that the Minister may allow price increases up to and including the rate of inflation.  In other words, the Minister will not sanction increases above the rate of inflation.  At a time when prices in telecommunications companies all over the world are tumbling like the Berlin Wall, the Minister should include in the legislation a provision for price reductions by Telecom Éireann and other companies.  By including a provision for price increases, that is precisely what will happen.</P>
    <P>The Dutch and Swedes got this company on the cheap, secretly and without the approval of this House specifically as regards the price and it has been suggested that allowing prices to float up to the level of inflation year in, year out was part of the deal with KPN/Telia.  I <Col N="679" /> am interested to hear whether the Minister discussed future prices in the economy with the KPN/Telia consortium. Did it have an interest in section 7 which, in effect, does not force the introduction of price reductions?  The danger of this provision is that it almost guarantees the introduction of higher prices, which will be disastrous from the point of view of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Forfás report &ldquo;Shaping our Future&rdquo; notes that Ireland's telecommunications costs have fallen significantly but are not as low as those in the UK where there is strong competition. The report concludes that with the effective use of advance communications, approximately 40,000 jobs could be created in the economy by the year 2010.  I agree with the Minister that this highlights the importance and potential of this sector.  However, one cannot develop this sector with this type of legislation.  The Minister may argue that the price provision will not have any effect.  However, based on a recent <i>Financial Times</i> report that may not be the case if the regulator is also appointed.</P>
    <P>On 23 September the <i>Financial Times</i> reported that Oftel, the British Telecom regulator, stopped British Telecom cutting prices.  British Telecom was offering small business access to the information super highway at a special rate but the British regulator stepped in and refused to sanction a decrease in prices.  If that is what regulation means then we do not want it.  Instead of legislation which seeks to keep prices up let us have competition and let the market decide and force down prices.  The proposed capping mechanism will not work &mdash; rather it will encourage higher prices.  This provision should be withdrawn from the legislation and replaced, if necessary, with a clause which helps to force down prices and does not allow them to rise.</P>
    <P>Apparently the regulator will be a civil servant.  As a Minister I worked with civil servants for more than eight years and have great respect for them but how can the regulator be independent if he or she is a civil servant who is <Col N="680" /> under the control of the Minister of the day?  How does this fit in with Civil Service and public service Acts?</P>
    <P>A matter of extreme concern in Telecom is the Minister's decision to reduce the number of worker directors on the company's board.  Under section 10 the Minister will halve the complement of worker directors to two which means only one trade union will have the necessary numbers to elect worker directors and the other five trade unions will be disenfranchised as their board seats are being given to two foreign companies, the Swedes and the Dutch. Given the recent comments by Democratic Left in support of worker representation, how does the Telecom decision fit in with the Government's policy or is it a case of saying one thing but deciding another in Government? What is the position of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, on this issue?  He has not said anything either in the House or publicly.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Communications Workers Union put forward a good proposal for an additional director to represent separately the workforce's shareholding in Telecom.  The idea of a substitute director to represent the smaller unions has also been proposed. The union proposed that candidates for the worker director elections need not be employees.  This is a sensible suggestion as the role of director is becoming increasingly complex and external experience can be useful on a board with that kind of responsibility.  The proposals put forward by the Communications Workers Union seem sensible and reasonable and the Minister should give a commitment to take them on board in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael was able to accommodate Democratic Left as far as seats around the Cabinet table were concerned.  The Minister, Deputy Lowry, played a part in creating the formula to accommodate Democratic Left when it wanted an extra seat or two.  He should have no difficulty using the same formula for Telecom Éireann to provide an extra couple of seats.  The Minister appeared <Col N="681" /> to have a particular skill in devising that formula and perhaps he could apply it to Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister will have the power to sell off up to 49 per cent of Telecom Éireann without it being necessary for the matter to come back to the House.  The Minister wants to decide to whom he will sell it, who is the best partner, from what country they should come, whether it should go on the Stock Exchange and whether the workers should be involved.  He wants a blank cheque from the House.  If he finds somebody for the remaining 10 per cent, he wants to be in a position to put it through quietly at a Government meeting, make a public announcement, call in the cameras and call it a strategic alliance.  However, it will probably be another sell off.  My party opposes the Bill because it seeks a blank cheque to allow the Minister sell off the remaining percentage.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the deal which may prove unconstitutional is that the Government has made a generous PRSI gift to the Swedes and Dutch.  At present, workers in Telecom Éireann pay the lower rate of PRSI while those in private companies pay the higher rate.  The Dutch and Swedes will only be charged the lower PRSI rate and this is a multi-million pound sweetener in the deal.  It also reduces the sale price of £183 million.</P>
    <P>The Bill also transfers the licensing of television transmission from the Minister to the new regulator.  The Minister is aware of the deflector debacle throughout the country and the Taoiseach is on the record as saying in Carrigaline that he would issue licences for community deflector systems as soon as he took up office.  However, there is no sign of the licences.  Section 127 of the programme for Government states that the Government will allow competition between community deflector systems and existing MMDS franchise holders. However, there is no sign of it as yet. What is the Minister's position on the issue?  Fianna Fáil holds the view that, <Col N="682" /> subject to resolving the legal and technical positions, the community deflectors should be allowed to continue in business. The Minister gave this commitment; when will he make it happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party gave much thought to the Bill before deciding to oppose it.  Full documentation should be laid before the House.  The Bill sells off 20 per cent of one of the most successful State companies for a scandalously low price; it is worth three or four times that amount.  The sale is to two foreign companies only, with no provision for Irish pension fund investors who must invest overseas.  It is likely that high profits will be made by the foreign companies involved in a matter of months.  The Bill provides for price increases in telephone charges rather than price reductions. The two board seats will be taken from workers and given to two foreign companies. The regulator will be a State employee rather than being independent.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, my party opposes the Bill because it is a rotten deal for taxpayers.  The shallowness and hypocrisy of the so-called ideology of the two left wing parties in Government has been exposed in the House.  Instead of protecting valuable State assets, which have been built up by taxpayers and Telecom Éireann subscribers over many years, Deputies De Rossa, Rabbitte and Spring, with the assent of the Minister, Deputy Lowry, have agreed meekly to the sell off of a major State asset.  It is a disgraceful decision and a sell out.  It is a shabby deal and should not proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats will vote against the Bill, not necessarily for all the reasons mentioned by Deputy Brennan but for some of them.  I will deal with those aspects in detail during my contribution.  For the telecommunications sector the Government should have a clear and coherent strategy which should be founded on <Col N="683" /> four basic principles: first, it should put the interests of consumers first.  Second, it should encourage the maximum amount of competition in the marketplace as quickly as possible.  Third, it should end direct State involvement in commercial telecommunications, and fourth, it should ensure the industry is properly regulated by a regulatory body independent of Government.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the fourth principle in that it provides for the establishment of an independent regulator to oversee the telecommunications industry. However, I am concerned that it appears the regulator will be a civil servant from the Department and that the staff will all be civil servants.  This makes one wonder about the degree of independence. The regulator should be somebody from outside the public service who is appointed because he or she has, or is capable of having, a consumer orientation or background.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not address the other three basic points I made.  It appears the Government still lacks a clear policy on the development of the telecommunications sector.  I would welcome the appointment of an independent regulator, if that is what he or she proves to be, because for too long the Government has confused the roles of owner and regulator.  This is particularly the case regarding the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. This Department owns several billion pounds worth of corporate assets and is directly involved in a range of commercial activities, including hotels, airports, aviation companies, cable television, road haulage, rail and bus services, oil refining, natural gas, electricity generation and distribution, peat production, coal distribution and telecommunications. The Government has a regulatory role of some type in all these areas, but finds it has a conflict of interest given its ownership role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the key areas of transport, energy and telecommunications, the Government's main objective should be to encourage competition as far as possible <Col N="684" /> to minimise the cost of these basic services to industry, commerce and individual consumers.  Competitive services are the foundation of a competitive economy, increased employment and increased prosperity.  International experience of recent years shows that in countries such as Australia, Britain, New Zealand and the United States, the liberalisation of the telecommunications market has led to a fall in charges in real terms and to a significant improvement in the range and quality of services available to consumers.  Irish Governments have been reluctant to promote competition in these State dominated industries and we are now being forced to do so by European directives.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Beef Industry: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Cowen on Wednesday, 25 September 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the central economic importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy, condemns the Government for its failure to deal with the BSE crisis since 20 March last, deplores the failure of the Government to clarify Ireland's position in relation to the EU Commissioner's proposals to reorganise the beef regime under the Common Agricultural Policy and calls on the Government to defend and protect the interests of the Irish beef sector in the present negotiations before the viability of thousands of Irish farm families is fatally undermined.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, recognising the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy and the serious difficulties being encountered by the beef <Col N="685" /> sector, endorses the action taken by the Government to alleviate the effects of the BSE crisis on Irish producers and approves the approach adopted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the European Commission's proposals for reform of the beef regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I focused yesterday on the Minister's recent predictions for the future of the agriculture industry.  He indicated that, by the year 2005, there would be approximately 60,000 full-time farmers and that no milk quota system would be in place.  Those two predictions are an indication of the dire changes that face the agriculture industry in the intervening period.  If the Minister's figures are accurate, the number of full-time employees in the industry will be whittled away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if the focus of the debate shifted to long-term issues to divert attention from the current BSE crisis, the most serious difficulty to hit our agriculture industry for many years.  Some of the solutions proposed by the EU will have profound implications for our agriculture industry and the economy in general.  Its importance to our economy is graphically underlined by the fact that we export approximately 80 per cent of our beef produce. Members referred to the gradual move towards a world price structure for agricultural produce.  This will have an even more dramatic impact than the recent significant reduction in beef prices. While beef production has a low labour intensity, it has a high capital requirement and even in good times the return <Col N="686" /> on investment is marginal.  If management does not operate efficiently, the return might not even justify the investment. The interdependent link between our 12,000 beef finishers, our store producers and those involved in the dairy and suckler cow sectors, who produce the calves, has a domino effect on finishers.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that pig meat and poultry products can be sold at a reduced price and still make a profit for producers while, in comparison, the price of beef is high.  It is not a wise exercise to compare the bovine beef production, pig meat and poultry enterprises.  Members will be aware that in the past 20 years pig meat production has diverted from family farm type units to much more intensive enterprises. There has been a similar movement from small to medium sized producers to large acreage producers in the potato industry, particularly in Counties Louth, Meath and Dublin.  The pig meat industry has not attracted support from the European Union and only in recent years EU money has been made available for the development of storage facilities, handling equipment and so on in the potato industry.  That was a catalyst for the dramatic changes necessary for the survival of that industry. However, a large amount of EU funding has been made available for the beef industry.  Therefore, is it necessary to examine the development plans for that industry?  If the Minister's predictions on farm incomes and the numbers employed directly in the industry are accurate, our beef industry faces serious difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister focuses his attention on the serious difficulty that currently obtains for beef finishers, store cattle producers and calf producers and ensures they receive adequate compensation, they will go out of business long before the year 2005-06, with serious implications for the economy.  The beef industry is crucial to our balance of payments and the economy in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The BSE crisis arose six months ago and, because of Government inaction, the problem is escalating.  We have had the Florence summit, the Luxembourg package and we are holding the Presidency of the EU, but neither the Minister nor his Cabinet colleagues acted on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Florence Summit was hailed as a major breakthrough and the catalyst for restoring consumer confidence in the beef sector but obviously the UK were not aware of that and its Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogg, has disregarded the Florence Summit.  I am amazed at the Minister, Deputy Yates, allowing the UK off the hook in terms of culling when it will cause major problems in the industry here and in the European Union.  He is more concerned about not upsetting the British Government and the British Minister than about our farmers.</P>
      <P>Current cattle prices are an insult to farmers who are losing £300 per head compared with 1993 prices.  Many small farmers will go out of business this winter. Banks are already putting pressure on beef farmers, withdrawing loans and calling in repayments which many farmers are unable to meet.  This is unacceptable at a time when the Minister wants to give the impression that he is concerned about farmers.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the protests by angry farmers in Killarney.  The Minister and his backbench colleagues should note that the majority of the farmers who protested in Killarney are Fine Gael supporters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> Consumer confidence is in need of major restoration by this Government. The Minister spoke of regulations for the rendering industry and meat factories and to control the amount of money farmers will be paid in compensation but, in fairness to our farmers, there is nothing wrong with Irish beef and the problem is not of their making.  Our beef is produced on a green island in environmentally-friendly conditions. Our farmers produce a first class quality produce yet they are denied the price they should get because of the lack of action and diplomacy by the Minister and his Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a great PR man but he has little substance.  He has nothing to offer farmers and Fine Gael supporters are totally disillusioned.  Many of them say the Taoiseach should re-shuffle the Cabinet and put someone who knows how to deal with the present problems into the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

The direct devaluation effect on each animal is about £150 per head and the loss on one animal alone equates to the cost of a tonne of fertiliser. I heard a great deal of nonsense <Col N="689" /> from Fianna Fáil last night and Irish farmers are beginning to accept that it is nonsense.  Deputy Cowen should know that bluster and loud talking will not solve this problem.  If he believes the Government does not have the answers, farmers want to hear his answers.  There were no answers last night, nor was there a sinner in the Gallery for the debate.  In answer to Deputy Browne's point, we went around the country in the last two weeks to face the farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> I agree with Fianna Fáil that, as far as European farmers are concerned, the keystone to the Treaty of Rome is that they are entitled to be looked after in good and bad times.  There is a moral responsibility on the Commission to ensure more compensation is made available and the person most likely to bring it through is the Minister, Deputy Yates.  Fianna Fáil should not think bluster will carry the day for them because that time is past.  Farmers accept the position although they do not like it and nor do we.  I assume Fianna Fáil do not like it either but they should tell it as it is and between us we will try to deal with it.  They should not paint the picture as being rosier than it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the conditions leading to current difficulties in the beef business are historical, and stem from the steps taken by the then Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry and the then Minister, Deputy Walsh.  They agreed to certain strategies and told us compensation was for lower prices.  Unfortunately we were hit by BSE this year but that is outside the Government's control.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the record of Fianna Fáil.  Its members talk about what they will do to open the Libyan and Iranian markets.  When Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach he went to Libya to open that market.  However, the record shows that, while 43,000 cattle were sent to Libya in 1990, none went in 1991 or 1992.  In 1993, 39,000 were sent and in 1994, 5,800.  Last year, when Fine Gael was in Government, 81,420 cattle were sent to Libya, which is twice as much as the largest amount when Fianna Fáil was in power.</P>

More money is being spent in one week on the Border to save the meat industry than that Minister was prepared to spend in the annual budget to promote Irish beef.  This Minister is providing £23 million.  If we are to get anywhere it will be through realistic, constructive efforts to manage the market and improve consumption by product promotion.

      <P>This debate is important and it is a pity that it has degenerated into the claptrap coming from the Opposition benches.  This is a serious economic crisis for the country, not just the farming community.  I will respond to some points made by Deputy Killeen. Last night he criticised the Minister, as did Deputy Byrne this morning, for the share of the package put together following the BSE scare that this country, with 7 per cent of the livestock population in the Community, received.  It was 10 per cent of the total budget.  We did extraordinarily well, twice as well on a <i>pro rata</i> basis as the Italians, Austrians, Swedes and other Scandinavian countries.</P>

      <P>As mentioned by Deputy Crawford, in 1989 the Iranian market closed down because of the British BSE scare, which the Iranians thought could have effects here.  To my knowledge no realistic attempt was made to open up that market at that time.</P>

He was accompanied by Deputy Andrews, <Col N="693" /> a member of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, and Niall Andrews, MEP.  I would like Deputy Andrews to tell us what happened during that visit because Deputy Cowen has not described how he got on in Teheran or in the other parts of Iran he visited.  That visit did not yield very good results and from the stories we hear it appears it did a good deal more harm than good.  That is the reality.</P>

      <P>As a member of the IFA, I deplore the actions that took place in Killarney.  It would have been excellent if the large numbers who attended demonstrated in an ordinary way but the manner in which a section of the demonstrators took the law into their own hands and conducted a noisy and unruly demonstration in the immediate vicinity of the hotel did not do us any good.  That impacted in the worst possible way on the Community's Agricultural Ministers, including the German and French Ministers, to whom we must look for a favourable response to this problem.  We do not have the funds within our resources to resolve the problem.  The point was well made that £1.6 billion of a total agricultural income of £2.2 billion or £2.4 billion is received in direct transfers from the European Union.  We must do everything possible to ensure we create an environment under which that income continues to flow.</P>

      <P>Farmers' incomes and livelihoods are under threat as a result of this crisis in which neither they nor Government had any hand, act or part in creating.  What happened in Killarney will do very little to help resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>The British Government has no answer to the problem.  Even yesterday it was changing its mind about whether the disease is transmitted from cow to calf.  There is no scientific evidence to substantiate any of the measures taken during recent weeks.  I hope that the British Government will do what was agreed in Florence and depopulate affected herds.  The Minister and the Government must be congratulated for the speed with which they acted, particularly along the Border, to stop cattle being smuggled into the South, which would have been unfortunate and would have created the perception that our herds were at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Opposition, particularly Fianna Fáil, has failed to <Col N="695" /> resist the temptation to make this a political football.  Everybody understands that the problems of the farming community are not of the farmers' making nor are they caused by those currently in power.  To inject some realism into the debate, it is useful to consider the extent of the remedial action taken by the Government since the crisis broke in March, given that I heard today that nothing has been done and nothing is happening.  There has been a 12 per cent increase in export refunds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish herd has been depopulated to reassure potential customers. Our diplomatic resources have been mobilised to protect and expand our live export markets but we need to do more.  In cases such as this there is always more we should and could do but what is happening here is nothing short of political point-scoring.  There has been a shock in the agricultural market which is not dissimilar to that experienced during the 1970s oil crisis which fundamentally changed the global economy.  Prior to this crisis, which arose from the ineptitude of the British Government, beef consumption was in decline and the BSE scare accelerated that.  Unfortunately, there is little or anything any Government can do to alter the public's perception, having regard to the manner in which the crisis was dealt with in the media.</P>

      <P>It might not be any harm if we were to put this matter into perspective. This problem is primarily one of people in Europe not eating beef.  It has arisen because of BSE and the way in which it has been covered in the European media.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should not be blamed for this phenomenon; it is beyond his control and to continue to blame him serves no useful purpose.</P>
      <P>The enormity of the difficulties should not be underestimated.  We have not fully come to grips with them.  Consumer confidence has been seriously eroded and will not be restored easily. The public has no obligation to eat beef, or meat, because there are many alternative ways of having a satisfying and adequate diet without beef.</P>
      <P>We must look at BSE in a wider context. BSE is just one more food scare, although it is the worst to date, and we have failed miserably to learn how to cope with them.  In this respect, a fundamental problem with BSE is getting the public to deal with the concept of risk. Life is full of risks.  A risk free life is not possible.  We must all live and deal with risk.  We must, therefore, try and get this matter into some kind of perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also understand and realise that there are many problems to which we do not know the answers.  This is part of the difficulty with BSE.  The experts, people who have been studying this matter for years, do not have the answers to many of the questions which arise.  However, we crave for certainty <Col N="698" /> in life; indeed many people are prepared to provide a false certainty.  In addition, there has always been fear of the unknown.  In the old days there was a fear of ghosts, etc., but that has been replaced by a fear of technology.</P>
    <P>We must try to understand technology, we must try to understand these diseases and we must try to understand the concept of risk so that we can deal with them in a reasonable manner, bearing in mind that we have to live with a certain level of danger.  We would be better off treating members of the public as intelligent rational beings and explaining these things to them than having various agencies of State and Ministers for Agriculture, here and elsewhere, telling us that there are absolute safeties.  There are not and it is nonsense to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have spent some time considering these matters and have concluded that there is not a great deal of risk attached to BSE.  I have no problem eating beef, but I am not going to suggest that it is perfectly safe; nobody can say that, nor can it be said about any diet.  We should come to grips with this reality.</P>
    <P>I accept that the farmers have a serious problem and I am glad there are none of them in my constituency because it gives me licence to talk more freely about their behaviour in Killarney; it was appalling.  Rural Deputies should realise that the urban population is appalled by that kind of unacceptable behaviour.  It is impossible to understand it.  It is also counterproductive because if this matter is to be contained, everybody's support will be needed.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil idea of blaming the Government is consistent.  We have all blamed Governments for everything, including the bad weather.  However, this matter is beyond the capacity of the Government to deal with.  It is a consumer problem and the sooner we accept this the better, rather than being involved in the politics of blame which ultimately does not get anybody anywhere.</P>

      <P>Not all of us living in urban areas were appalled by events in Killarney on Monday evening.  It was the most entertaining clip on the news. The farmers did not expect to break through the cordon, but having done so they were at a loss as to what to do. Events such as these happen in urban areas.  However, we were terrified that they achieved their end by such a small demonstration, which they usually do.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Fianna Fáil Party finally recognises the central importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy.  I only wish that party had recognised this in the events leading up to the beef tribunal, the consequences of which are still unresolved.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis has its roots in the overriding ambition of the Tory Government in the UK to deregulate.  I am always astonished at the achievements of the farming industry.  It has always had exceptional Ministers for Agriculture, and this Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is no different. He has visited Russia, the UK, Italy, Spain and Libya to secure not just existing markets but to ensure that we open up further markets.  In this he has been extremely successful.  In this respect there has been a sea change in the farming community in recent weeks. Everybody to whom I have spoken has told me what a great Minister he is.  If I were a farmer I too would concede that he is doing an exceptionally good job.</P>
      <P>Democratic Left acknowledges that farmers and processors have been hard hit by the crisis which was not of their making, but of the farming industry.  It originated in England and we are feeling the effects.  Why can people in the wider world not distinguish between Irish and English beef?  What has An Bord Bia been doing?  We now find that the shamrock is not recognised.  Why did we spend so much money on it and why are those responsible still in charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have expressed my views and the view of my party on the need to reform the CAP before it becomes unsustainable. I still maintain that the system <Col N="700" /> of perks, grants and subsidies is one which disproportionately benefits large ranchers, is unsustainable in the long-term and will eventually be rejected by the taxpayers of the EU who are picking up the bill both in terms of taxes and higher food costs.</P>
    <P>However, my party fully supports the effort being made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, to ensure that Irish farmers and processors are not penalised for the mind boggling bad management of the UK herd.  It is a tribute to the Government's tenacity that 10 per cent of the EU compensation package has been secured for Ireland despite the fact that we hold only 7 per cent of EU beef production.</P>
    <P>The Government is not afraid to take tough decisions.  It was a lack of tough decisions in previous Administrations that gave us the beef tribunal scandal. The Government's decision to slaughter BSE infected herds has protected Irish farmers from that catastrophe.  It is regrettable that the UK Government lacked the political and economic guts to take a similar decision.</P>
    <P>I hope the compensation package negotiated by the Government will cushion our farmers against the worst effects of the crisis in the short-term. However, in the long-term, we must recognise that there has been a fundamental sea change in consumer attitudes. People are not eating beef.  There has been a 20 per cent reduction in consumption because they are nervous about their diet.  We will not persuade them to return to eating beef until we can guarantee that the meat they eat is perfect and will not detrimentally affect their health.</P>
    <P>The farming industry, not just the Irish industry, is responsible for what it has done.  It has, unnaturally turned herbivores into carnivores and then into cannibals by feeding them their own species.  We cannot continue to do this without the kind of effects that have emerged under BSE.  We must stop <Col N="701" /> using the headage mentality which compensates those who produce most and start considering schemes for producing quality rather than more beef.  Food production and consumption have become political issues.  Until we begin to examine how food is produced rather than by whom, we shall lose the battle. The ultimate arbitrators, consumers, will decide for themselves.  Until we can prove to them that this product is good and pure and identify our market, we shall continue to lose the battle.</P>
    <P>I believe that ultimately our farmers will recognise that we have an excellent Minister for Agriculture and Food doing an extremely good job on their behalf and will reject the nonsense we have heard from the Fianna Fáil Party in recent weeks, trotting from city to city seeking urban votes, then coming in here to talk about farmers' interests.  I cannot fathom it.</P>

Failure to obtain contracts in Libya and Iran is well understood beyond the parameters of this House.  Deputy Crawford might not be aware that the day after the Minister left Tripoli the Australians signed up with Libya for 50,000 head of cattle.  The Minister made a clear statement that he was there merely to sign a contract and was not prepared to discuss any of the other problems the Libyans appeared to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that that market, clearly identified as one for our exports, has been lost to the Australians.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the efforts of the Iranian Ambassador and others, there would be an absolute closed door to us in the Iranian market.  It is imperative that the Minister for Agriculture and Food or the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should engage in the necessary exercise to bring about circumstances in which Iran will again accept meat from this country rather than from countries like Uruguay and others.  We now witness our counterparts within the EU taking our market share in Iran.  Deputy Crawford and others will readily understand that once ejected from a market it is very difficult to be reinstated.</P>
      <P>It is time we began to examine the overall matter of consumer health and the realities of the marketplace.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say yesterday that he will introduce regulations regarding meat and bone meal imports. It is ridiculous that there are gardaí on the Border whose duty it is to prevent cattle being smuggled across.  Deputy Crawford and others who live nearby will readily understand that smugglers never travel on main roads in either direction.  Yet those same gardaí are allowing trucks to pass carrying meat and bone meal compound to be fed ultimately to ruminants in this part of the country.  While such compound is intended as foodstuff for the poultry industry, we are all aware that a certain amount is being diverted into other livestock feedstuff, something which must cease immediately.  There is need to establish a register of those entitled to obtain feed destined for poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need also to introduce higher standards.  We talk much about improving general health and welfare in respect of the overall agricultural scene. Some officer must be appointed whose <Col N="703" /> task will be to monitor and give a quality assurance to consumers generally. We shall not progress past 82p per pound if we do not restore consumer confidence and assess their needs.</P>
    <P>During a previous debate on this issue I ask the Minister to introduce a test on all carcases to detect residues.  We are told this cannot be done, yet I understand that McDonalds are about to have such a test introduced in regard to the beef they use in their burgers.  Meat and bone meal in feedstuff is a major problem which must be tackled urgently. The time has come when there will have to be a quality assurance in the case of all farms.  One person is best equipped to give that assurance, the veterinary surgeon who deals with each farm.  It is time regulations were introduced to ensure that a veterinary surgeon or a departmental officer can take samples of all products to be found on farms whether feedstuffs, manure or any other.</P>
    <P>We shall be unable to sell our beef or any of our other grassland or meal compound products as long as we are unable to stand over their quality.  This is another matter that must be tackled urgently.  The Minister would be better employed pursuing those matters immediately rather than some of the other hare-brained ideas being spoken about.  The sooner the better top-up payments, needed to finance their various commitments, are made to farmers.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand, as I am sure can many others, the frustration at what happened in Killarney.  Many of those demonstrators, awaiting grants and so on, had to obtain funds to pay fees for children returning to second or third-level colleges, having expected the income from the sale of their livestock to cover such commitments.</P>
    <P>We must also examine some of the other hare-brained schemes suggested, one being an intervention scheme pitched at £ per pound for weanlings, which was a joke.  Any farmer with weanlings wishing to avail of such a scheme merely had to wait two months <Col N="704" /> before drawing his £100 subsidy on male calves.  Had the Minister said he was prepared to allow a certain number of such animals to qualify and pay the additional premium it would have prevented the pile-up that will inevitably occur in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to some of those not present in the House who have been endeavouring to reopen our traditional markets, such as those in Libya and Iran.  The Iranian Ambassador has done everything in his power on a number of occasions, from a political point of view, to improve the position. Why can the Minister of State not tell us why he or his Minister could not travel to Iran to ascertain how they could overcome the present problem?  We were told by the Minister, prior to the summer recess, that the problem there was of a veterinary nature.  My understanding is that the Iranians are reasonably happy with regard to the veterinary position and that our efforts over many years to prevent the spread of BSE are acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>Will we have a recurrence, as in the case of Libya, of a Minister arriving the day after a contract has been signed with another country for the following six months?  That is a problem we must confront.  I urge the Minister to ask his senior colleague and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to talk to these people.  There is no point in Deputy Ferris informing us that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs shook the hand of the Iranian Foreign Minister in a corridor in New York.  That would be similar to my meeting somebody outside the entrance of Leinster House, shaking their hand and inquiring how they were.  That is not where business is conducted.  It is not conducted in public.</P>

      <P>Some of them did so without the presence of television cameras. When history has been written, Deputy Crawford will know who engaged in <Col N="705" /> such endeavours in private.  Business with Iran will be conducted when our Ministers go there and negotiate.  A number of groups with contacts in Iran have done their utmost to improve the position.  I know that Deputy Crawford, representing an area with a large number of winter fatteners that produces quite an amount of beef, will understand the need for the establishment of a market for next year's stock.  At present farmers have not the confidence to put such animals in sheds.  If confidence in farming is not restored in the very near future the overall effects on our economy in 1997 will be drastic.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  All headage payments, premia and payments under REP schemes, or any scheme the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has not suspended, should be made as quickly as possible. Farmers owe more money than ever and have very high borrowings, borrowings which were encouraged by this Minister and the Department.  They need those payments urgently so they do not have to sell cattle immediately.  As my colleague, Deputy Ellis, said, we want to build some confidence in the industry.  I ask the Department to do a small thing to encourage this.</P>
      <P>The agriculture budget has not been spent and we read in today's paper that £825,000 was overpaid last December to nearly 14,000 Department staff for over-time. There is panic in the agriculture sector.  I saw the results of this uncertainty in my constituency yesterday. Prices for good cattle in the marts there were disastrous.  Farmers would like to know what will happen in the coming months.  They are losing up to £200 per head of cattle and there has been no response from the Department.  The payment of headage premia due is the minimum response necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> In County Galway and in the western counties farmers depend mostly on store cattle.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not firmly on the side of the smaller producer.  He came to a meeting in Galway and may have gone to meetings all around the country, but farmers in Galway wonder why he is not spending more time looking for markets.  Why is he touring Ireland, going to party political meetings, talking to farmers about what he will do when we want him to find markets as quickly as possible?</P>
    <P>The live trade is particularly important to the smaller producer.  I was glad the Minister came to a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs two weeks ago.  I mentioned at the meeting the question of the live trade and in response he said that but for the Taoiseach's discussions with President Mubarak, Egypt would not be open today.  I do not believe the Taoiseach has done more than make a telephone call to President Mubarak on that issue and I would like the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to adopt a hands on approach to get those markets as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to Iran, the Minister said he did not wish to pre-empt discussions that may take place but that both France and Ireland were pulling out all the stops for the Iranian market, and he considered this to be very urgent.  Since the Minister spoke at that committee meeting, France has done its own thing. It is a pity the Minister would not do his thing for Irish farmers by reprsenting them as well as possible.  I would like the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to show us evidence of what they are doing, particularly in regard to the live trade.</P>
    <P>I regret that so little has been done about the Departmental dispute concerning meat inspectors.  One commentator said this morning that this dispute could be as serious or more serious than the BSE crisis.  I am amazed there have not been talks with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or any other Department on this issue in recent days.  I hope &mdash; Deputy Cowen referred <Col N="707" /> to this last night &mdash; the meat inspectors' dispute is resolved as quickly as possible. Some 9,000 workers are facing lay-offs and the livelihood of farmers is in jeopardy because this dispute has not been tackled.  We want talks to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I also raised the issue of compensation with the Minister at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs.  I am amazed that compensation is not being given to farmers who sell at the marts.  Surely farmers deserve that compensation more than the agents and dealers who buy cattle.  I understand the Minister talked about a national scheme of compensation for farmers with heifers for sale at marts.  I would like him to clarify that when he replies to this debate, because that would be the most unfair treatment of farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton mentioned the role of the consumer.  I agree this is vitally important but I am amazed there has not been a concerted effort by the Government to promote beef.  It is too late now in many ways but the Government should still move.  This has been done very effectively in the case of sheepmeat.  The Government should start such a promotion.  The Minister says the retail price of beef is not sufficient; let him promote its consumption. We would at least have increased confidence in the industry if he did so.</P>

      <P>I welcome this very important discussion and thank the Fianna Fáil Party for putting down the motion.  I thank the Government side for responding to it and hope it will ensure that common sense prevails in the light of this awful tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the crisis in the beef industry is apparent to all.  Beef consumption has fallen heavily right across Europe.  As a result, cattle prices have <Col N="708" /> collapsed and tens of thousands of Irish farmers are under severe financial pressure.  It is not an exaggeration to say this may be the greatest crisis to hit agriculture since the economic war of the 1930s.</P>
    <P>Consider the situation in which Irish agriculture now finds itself.  Cattle prices have fallen by more than 20 per cent compared with a year ago.  The value of the national herd has fallen by up to £1 billion.  Exports of Irish beef to continental Europe have plummeted.  Prices for cull cows have collasped causing major knock-on problems in the dairy industry.  Cows due for culling are now being retained on farms and their milk output is pushing the dairy industry into a very serious superlevy problem.  I am not convinced the Government has tackled this crisis with the seriousness it deserves.  I have no doubt the Fine Gael Party in Government is well aware of the scale of the problems currently facing the agricultural sector, but I am not convinced the other two coalition partners are of like mind on this issue.</P>
    <P>Coherent and decisive Government action is needed to deal with this crisis. It would be a tragedy for the country if this Administration, which is openly divided on so many issues, was to divide on the beef issue also.  The solution to this problem lies at European level and it is there that our efforts have to be concentrated.  The Government must ensure that compensation is made available to Irish beef farmers.  This crisis was not of their making.  The reputation of their product and demand for their product has been severely damaged by events entirely outside their control, namely the gross mishandling of the BSE situation by the British Government.</P>
    <P>There are now proposals from the European Union to solve the beef problem by introducing a calf and weanling slaughter policy as a means of reducing supply.  This is not the route we should take.  I see several major difficulties with it.  It would send a very negative message to consumers at a time <Col N="709" /> when the beef industry should try to rebuild its image.  The impact on supply would be very gradual.  It would take two years, for instance, for calf slaughtering to reduce supply.  Such a scheme would destroy the raw material of the beef industry for future years.  The whole scale of the agri-business industry would be reduced, with job losses across the board.  A policy to slaughter calves and weanlings would do little to help the position of beef finishers.  They would effectively compete against an intervention mechanism when buying in their stock, but they would sell their finished cattle into a depressed market.</P>
    <P>A much better suggestion for dealing with the problem would be to take cull cows into intervention and to compensate farmers at market rates for the animals involved.  That would not have the negative image problems associated with slaughtering calves.  It would have a number of practical advantages in that it would reduce supply almost immediately and it would alleviate consumer concern about eating beef from older animals.</P>
    <P>We are now moving into the peak disposal season for the cattle industry in Ireland.  It is vitally important that measures are taken to restore buyer confidence at all levels of the industry, otherwise, the whole cattle sector could be plunged into major decline.  We must pay more attention to the place of the consumer in all of this.  If the BSE crisis has taught us anything it is the truth of the cliché about the consumer being king.  Many people in the beef industry paid lip service to that idea.  Now, they ignore it at their cost.</P>
    <P>The key to success for the Irish beef industry lies in quality assurance and customer assurance.  As long as market confidence can be maintained in the Irish product all doors will be open to it.  We express great pride in the clean and green image which our beef enjoys, or which we think it enjoys.  The fact is that this favourable image is useless and will rapidly disappear without proper verification standards.  We have an advantage but we are throwing it away <Col N="710" /> because of our inability to convince international consumers of how good and safe is our product.</P>
    <P>The organisation charged with responsibility for maintaining public confidence in Irish beef is the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The Department's record in policing that industry over the last decade has left a lot to be desired.  Irish taxpayers will this year face a bill of up to £100 million in EU fines because of the Department's failures to control abuse and fraud in the beef processing industry. Taxpayers and consumers might have hoped that the Department had put that era behind it.  Revelations during the past week, however, are hardly encouraging.</P>
    <P>During the week in which the BSE crisis broke we read in the papers that one of the Department's officers was to face criminal proceedings for allegedly selling bogus Irish health certificates to cover British cattle.  This scam would have enabled British cattle from BSE infected herds to be sold into continental Europe markets as Irish animals and the potential damage to Ireland's disease-free status would be immense.  I need hardly say that incidents of this kind do not cast a very favourable light on the Department.  There continues to be a serious question mark over its ability to police the beef industry in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague. Deputy Clohessy, for sharing his time with me.  It is obvious from all who wish to take part in this debate that further time is needed to discuss these issues of grave importance to the agriculture industry and to the economy generally. It is amazing the Government never seems to initiate these debates; they are initiated by Fianna Fáil and by our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Cowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BSE has had a catastrophic effect not only on the agricultural community but on the whole economy, yet no decisive action has been taken by the Government to conserve present markets or to <Col N="711" /> try to find new markets to make up for recent losses.  There has been no Government action to bolster the confidence of the consumer with regard to beef.  There has been a worsening of the position of the beef industry since March of this year when the BSE crisis erupted.  The only practical assistance to beef exporters was from the Fianna Fáil Party with its visit to Iran.  The Minister was unable to follow up on this visit even though the groundwork has been laid for him by the Fianna Fáil representatives on that occasion.</P>
    <P>As President of the Council, the Minister has failed to achieve consensus at EU level on how to approach the BSE crisis.  Only confusion and discord are evident.  There is no co-ordinated strategy, which is vital to restore consumer confidence in the safety of beef.  The fact that the Minister is prepared to consider the Fischler proposals on the slaughter of calves demonstrates his complete lack of comprehension as to the extremely damaging effects such a policy would have.  As Deputy Cowen pointed out, this policy amounts to the equivalent of eating seed corn.  The Minister has been unable to convince his EU colleagues of Ireland's special dependence on beef.  The point made by Deputy Clohessy and others on the issue of compensation is of grave importance.  This issue has not been adequately addressed by the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister's paralysis results in beef prices falling through the floor.  He does not appreciate what this means for the industry, the individual farmer and the economy generally.  If he is not prepared to take immediate action, the future viability of thousands of farm families will be fatally undermined.  That is why Fianna Fáil decided to bring this debate to the House.  We realise the catastrophic effects this issue has had on the farming population.  Most disconcerting is the fact that there seems to be no will on the part of the Government to address this problem.  It lacks courage to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> I sympathise with the Minister in that, in his job to defend and protect the interests of farm families and the industry generally, he is not helped by the views expressed by Deputy Kathleen Lynch in today's debate, which can only be described as an indiscriminate gratuitous insult to farmers.  The Deputy may believe that this might serve her political interests but she forgets that the agriculture industry is the foundation of our economy.  She should urge her colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to act for the common good.</P>
    <P>The importance of An Bord Bia has been referred to in other debates on the agriculture industry initiated by Fianna Fáil.  I hope the Government will give further assistance with regard to BSE so that An Bord Bia will be in a stronger position to market Irish beef.  Unfortunately, no distinction is made between Irish and British beef in terms of quality, which should be evident.  The Government has failed in that regard. The threads could be picked up by An Bord Bia if given extra financial assistance to deal with the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Denihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to address the House on this motion.  It is evident from the Minister's statement in the House last evening that the motion tabled by the Opposition is misguided and inaccurate in that it fails to acknowledge the enormous efforts made by the Department, the Government and various Government agencies during the last six months or so to protect the beef industry from the worst effects of the BSE crisis.  The amendment moved by the Minister more accurately reflects the position and I am delighted to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People listening to the Deputies who support the motion could be forgiven for believing that the BSE crisis is confined to Ireland and that it stems from some failure on the part of the Government, but nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a European crisis of <Col N="713" /> dimensions never previously experienced and it stems from a disease which originated in the United Kingdom.  The fact that it is a European rather than an Irish crisis is demonstrated by the fact that beef consumption across the European Union has fallen by about 20 per cent since the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March and average EU cattle prices are now some 16 per cent below 1995 levels.  In addition, most of the beef sold into intervention since the beginning of the crisis has come from member states other than Ireland, which means that the Irish industry has performed quite well on the commercial market given the difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware both of the importance of the beef industry to the national economy and the serious threat to the industry posed by the BSE crisis.  At the informal meeting of the Council of Ministers over the weekend the Minister made the point repeatedly to his European counterparts and the Commissioner that the beef industry was more important to the Irish economy than the entire agriculture industry to the European economy.  It is evident from the Minister's statement last evening that the Government has taken a range of measures to minimise the impact of the crisis on the economy, the beef industry generally and, in particular, beef producers.</P>
    <P>My Department has never sought to minimise the scale of the crisis or its impact on producers.  However, by any standards, the compensation package negotiated in June, which was worth some £70 million to Irish producers, registered a substantial negotiating success on the part of the Minister who succeeded in securing 10 per cent of this package for Irish producers.  This figure does not include the amendments made to the deseasonalisation premium scheme in order to ensure its retention in 1997.  This premium is worth £16 million annually to Irish producers and has already helped to restore confidence to the winter fattening segment of the beef industry which, as we all know, is of <Col N="714" /> vital importance to the overall health of the sector.  The decision by the European Commission, as announced at the informal meeting of the Council in Killarney earlier this week, to bring forward the date of payment of cattle premiums into the current budget year and to increase the rate of advance to 80 per cent will make additional financial resources available for the beef sector in 1997.  This improves the prospects for a further compensation package in the course of the 1997 budget year.</P>
    <P>In essence, the current problems in the beef sector stem from a lack of consumer confidence in beef.  This lack of confidence is reflected in a 15 to 20 per cent fall in consumption in Europe since the beginning of the crisis.  Unfortunately the fall in consumption has been even higher in some member states and all of the evidence is that beef consumption is unlikely to return to 1995 levels for some time, if ever.  This development has created a new imbalance in the beef market and this has increased the net surplus in the European Union by up to one million tonnes.  This problem has to be addressed urgently because failure to do so would simply store up further problems for the future.  The Commission's proposals for reform of the beef support system, which are designed to restore balance to the beef market, have to be seen in this context.</P>
    <P>We support the Commission's strategy of scaling back beef production to the new consumption levels because in the long-term this is in the best interest of Irish producers.  There is no other option.  Our overall approach to the Commission's proposals is to ensure that the Irish beef industry is not required to make a disproportionate contribution to the overall reduction in production sought by the Commission and that the measures are implemented in a balanced way throughout the European Union.  Clearly, we welcome the Commission's proposal to increase the intervention ceiling for 1996 and 1997. If these ceilings were to be retained at current levels they would be quickly exhausted and prices would collapse to <Col N="715" /> safety-net levels.  The decision of the Council at its informal meeting in Killarney this week to proceed to the early adoption of a Commission proposal to increase the intervention ceiling temporarily for the two tenders in October and the first tender in November pending the adoption of the full package of proposals was extremely welcome because it removes a degree of uncertainty about the availability of normal intervention arrangements during the next six weeks or so.</P>
    <P>I reject the criticism by Deputy Cowen who argued last night that the Beef Management Committee has failed to recognise the importance of the beef sector to the Irish economy.  The reality is that the Beef Management Committee has taken a number of measures designed to tailor the intervention system to the needs of the Irish beef sector.  For example, the intervention system has been extended to include steer grade 04, the committee normally accepts in full Irish offers into intervention and the processor's margin has been increased in direct response to the Minister's intervention with Commissioner Fischler.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced last night that additional measures were being introduced to reinforce the existing ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to cattle and sheep.  I thank Deputy Ellis for his support for this proposal.  In that sense, his contribution was very positive.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the problems being encountered by beef producers and the beef industry generally as a result of the BSE crisis.  It has taken effective action on a range of fronts to minimise the effects of the crisis, in particular by way of the retention of various markets which were under threat, the introduction of effective emergency intervention measures and the implementation of a BSE compensation package worth £70 million. Our strategy has been designed to address the short, medium and long-term dimensions of the problem.  The <Col N="716" /> problem to be addressed is the imbalance between supply and demand in the EU beef market and the Commission's proposals for reform of the beef sector have to be judged in that context.  I assure the House that there is strong Government solidarity on this issue.</P>

      <P>This motion would meet with the acceptance of all Fine Gael backbenchers and farmers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, said it was mischievous.  It states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the central economic importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy, condemns the Government for its failure to deal with the BSE crisis since 20th March last, deplores the failure of the Government to clarify Ireland's position in relation to the EU Commission's proposals to reorganise the beef regime under the Common Agricultural Policy and calls on the Government to defend and protect the interests of the Irish beef sector in the present negotiations before the viability of thousands of Irish farm families is fatally undermined.</P>
      <P>No one could oppose that.  The Minister will have to accept that what we are saying is accurate.  I do not underestimate the task confronting him.  We are not blaming the Government for creating the BSE crisis, what we are saying is that its response to the crisis, the test of any Government, has been abysmal to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers demonstrated in Killarney earlier this week.  As the Minister and all Fine Gael backbenchers well know, farmers are hardworking people who do not want to travel to Killarney in the autumn to protest, but they had good cause for so doing.  I do not want to comment on their actions on the day in <Col N="717" /> question but it was their intention to send a signal not only to the Minister and the Government but also to the Commission that they were both angry and frustrated.  No one can blame them for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the increase in export refunds.  This time last year they decreased by some 35 per cent. This was followed by a fall in prices and, in turn, the debacle of the announcement in the House of Commons.  Suddenly, BSE was being mentioned in the media throughout the world.  Little had been known about it prior to that.</P>
    <P>What was our response?  The Minister decided to do nothing but wait and see which way the wind was blowing and then react.  What he should have done immediately, in our opinion and that of farmers and those interested in the economy, was to dissociate Irish beef from British beef.  Cattle are produced here under a strict health regime but the Minister failed to draw that distinction with our European and Third World customers.  The Minister should have acted immediately.  The Opposition was told yesterday that it had little to offer by way of suggestions to deal with this crisis.  We have put forward suggestions but there has not been any response to them from the Minister.  I will repeat some of those suggestions in my contribution.</P>
    <P>By initiating this debate Fianna Fáil sought to set out clearly the failure of the Minister and the Government to deal effectively with the BSE crisis.  As an Opposition party, we wanted the Government to set out the policies, if any, it has to deal with the worsening problem.  The Minister's only suggestion last night was that farmers should produce beef at 82p per pound.  I am sure all farmers would like to achieve that one day.  I have cattle to sell, as do some Members on the opposite side of the House, but does the Minister honestly believe that small farmers can change from producing beef at 1.05p per pound to 82p per pound within a matter of two or three years?  The Minister <Col N="718" /> should come back to the real world and put forward realistic proposals.</P>
    <P>Because of the ongoing industrial action in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the cattle industry, already on its knees, has been crippled in recent days.  The immediate crisis has not received any response from the Minister.  He has failed to meet members of IMPACT, the union representing 40 per cent of his staff.  The Minister's appalling description of his hard working meat inspectors as &ldquo;opportunists in the extreme&rdquo; must rank as one of the most unhelpful interventions in recent industrial relations history.  It is also a case of the pot calling the kettle black.  If there is opportunism in the Department, it is coming from the top down.  We are reminded of that every day when we turn on our televisions or read newspapers.</P>
    <P>The 300 staff involved in this dispute have a legitimate grievance.  That has already been recognised by the Department. Since the reintroduction of intervention, staff have been pressed beyond the existing limitations of training and manpower.  Rather than address real problems in his Department, the Minister has opted to play to the gallery, not for the first time.  The result is that at this most critical time of the year, during the most critical year in memory, meat factories are in a state of chaos.</P>
    <P>The ongoing failure of the Minister to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency is only the latest in a series of blunders by him in handling this ever worsening crisis.  The Minister's only defence in the debate last night was that Fianna Fáil had nothing new to say. That overlooks two facts.  First, it is the Minister's job to bring forward proposals and, second, Fianna Fáil last night restated the obvious fundamentals of this crisis, one of which is the inadequate response of the Government.</P>
    <P>Our party spokesman, Deputy Cowen, clearly set out the approach that needs to be taken to deal with this crisis. Ireland has a good news story to tell about its beef industry.  Our grass-based. <Col N="719" /> environmentally friendly, extensive production is a model of how the industry as a whole needs to be developed.  Just as BSE is not a problem of Ireland's making, likewise intensive overproduction is not a feature of the Irish industry.  The strength of our argument should be buttressed by the Commission's own position paper on CAP reform.  Commissioner Fischler, in his option paper for CAP reform published some months ago, set out the clear intention that in future payments to farmers should be linked to environmental and quality criteria.</P>
    <P>By these criteria, Ireland has a natural advantage over EU states in beef production.  Ireland is dependent on beef to an extent unlike that of any other European country.  Although we have the most extensive regime of major producers, we are also the largest exporters in the northern hemisphere. To put it in graphic political terms, beef is to Ireland what fish is to Spain or olive oil is to Greece, but as Irish fishermen know, and Irish farmers are finding out, the difference is that where Spain views its industry as a vital national issue, a veto issue if necessary, there is no corresponding political will in Ireland.  Shame on the Minister in his role during Ireland's Presidency of the EU.</P>
    <P>This crisis has never been at the top of the Government's agenda.  We have heard sniping from the Democratic Left backbenches today.  The Tánaiste and members of the Labour Party prefer to perpetuate their grudge with the beef industry rather than advance the national interest.  A graphic illustration of this is the failure to convene a meeting of the Joint Trade Commission between Ireland and Iran.  A meeting of this body is already a year and a half overdue.  This body is the key to opening our formerly profitable market in Iran.  Resolving the technical issues alone will not sell even one pound of beef to Iran.  The Tánaiste refuses point blank to have a meeting of the commission. At this most crucial time for <Col N="720" /> the beef industry, old scores are put above sales abroad.  Will the Minister tell us the reason the Tánaiste will not convene a meeting of the Joint Trade Commission?  Is there another agenda? Why has the Minister allowed Denmark and New Zealand to take advantage of our disadvantage?</P>
    <P>A meeting of EU Ministers was held recently in Killarney.  Government Ministers normally invite their European counterparts to their own constituencies. Why was the recent meeting in Killarney not held in Wexford?  Is the Minister ashamed of the tourism industry in Wexford?  Is the Minister ashamed to promote County Wexford?  Why did he not take this opportunity to do so? The Minister has a job to do.  I ask him, for the benefit of the agricultural community and the whole of the economy, to do something about this crisis.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this debate.  I ask the Minister to urge the Taoiseach to ensure that every Deputy is afforded an opportunity in Government time to discuss this major crisis in agriculture, our biggest industry.  The Government talks about transparency and openness &mdash; the Minister referred to that last night &mdash; but it is refusing to be accountable to this House.  If the credibility of public representatives is to mean anything in rural communities, Members such as Deputies Davern, O'Hanlon, Timmins, Kitt, Burke and others should be entitled to come into this House for a full Government debate on this issue. That is the least Government and Opposition backbenchers deserve.  As far as I am concerned, there will be no further business in this House from next week onwards until the Government accedes to a full debate so that my colleagues can avail of the same opportunity given to me.  The Minister and I are the only two Members who have had an opportunity to speak at length on this issue.  That is not good enough in a parliamentary assembly on an issue as important, delicate and critical as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Minister made a landmark speech last night.  He described what is probably the greatest sell-out of a negotiating position by a Minister for Agriculture. Let me paraphrase it succinctly in the next minute and a half.  The Minister said that, as the country responsible for the largest surplus of beef in the EU, it is in our best interests to go ahead with the Fischler proposals.  This country produces seven million cattle out of a total EU market of 84 million cattle under the most non-intensive systems of production in the Community.  We have always been exporters of beef.  Are we now to be punished at the Minister's behest, under this country's Presidency, on the basis that were we not exporting 80 per cent of our cattle to the EU and elsewhere, there would not be a surplus? That is the political noose on which I will hang the Minister from now until the next general election.</P>
    <P>We joined the European Union to get away from dependency on Britain.  It is now being suggested that we cut out production to a far greater extent than any other country because of the Minister's public position at the Killarney meeting.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggests that he has attained a floor price of 82p. That is a market price.  Regarding export refunds, the Minister was very critical of the fact that £1,000 was being spent on cattle that were worth £200 in Egypt.  That is what Egypt is prepared to pay.  Is the Minister suggesting that we should not take that money, that a French farmer or a German farmer or someone else should benefit from what has always been a permanent feature of the Common Agricultural Policy, the export refund system to take away surplus production?</P>
      <P>I demand a Government debate on this issue as and from next Tuesday morning.  I want to hear from Deputy Connaughton and others who are entitled to speak for more than three minutes on a matter of such importance. I hope Deputy Connaughton will use his influence with the Minister and the Taoiseach to get a full three-day debate on this matter before it goes further, because the Minister's negotiating position as described in this House is selling farmers down the river.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was saying that Irish Governments traditionally have been reluctant to promote competition in these State dominated industries in the fields of transport, energy and telecommunications particularly but we are being forced to do so by European directives.  It has taken an outside body to tell us what was good for us, even though it was obvious what we should have done and what we should still do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of an independent office for the regulation of the telecommunications industry is a significant departure from traditional policy and as such I welcome it, even if it is forced on us against the wishes of, presumably, the Government and the Department by European requirements.  It will, I hope, mean direct responsibility for regulation is removed from ministerial control. Independent regulation on its own will <Col N="725" /> not lead to increased competition; that will require political will which I do not see in the present Government.  The State controlled Telecom Éireann dominates the telecommunications sector in this country and currently it faces competition in some areas of its business, for instance, in international calls, and it will soon face competition in others, such as mobile phone services.</P>
    <P>Essentially the company's control of the Irish telecommunications network means that it will be the dominant player in the overall market for a considerable time yet.  Irish consumers are paying an unduly high price for the maintenance and protection of this State monopoly.  This is apparent from the results of the survey published yesterday by the Telephone Users' Advisory Group.  That survey showed that Ireland has the highest home telephone rental fee in Europe.  It also showed that we have the highest charges for both local and internal trunk telephone calls in Europe.  Monopolies, particularly unregulated State monopolies such as this, are an expensive luxury in any economy.  This survey clearly illustrates that in so far as telecommunications in Ireland are concerned.</P>
    <P>As long as Telecom Éireann controls the country's basic telecommunications infrastructure the movement towards full competition will be slow.  This does not have to be the case.  The Government could take decisive action to encourage the rapid development of competition in the Irish telecommunications sector.  The best way to do this would be to separate Cablelink from Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Cable television companies are now recognised as the most natural competitors to telecommunications companies in deregulated markets.  With direct access to huge numbers of homes and businesses, modern technology allows them to supply a range of telephone and telecommunications services as well as television signals.  Cable television is set to become the key piece of information infrastructure for domestic consumers and for small and medium enterprises <Col N="726" /> during the coming years.  For example, in Northern Ireland the company which has won the cable licence for that region has already announced its intention to compete aggressively against British Telecom in that market.  Consumers will benefit from significant reductions in charges.</P>
    <P>This Bill, by virtue of section 7, envisages only increases in already penal charges.  Unfortunately, the reductions in Northern Ireland will not be copied in the South.  Cablelink, the most obvious competitor in the mainstream telephone services market, is effectively controlled by Telecom Éireann which owns 75 per cent of it.  The other 25 per cent is also controlled by the State through RTE.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that for an investment of £30 million-£50 million the Cablelink infrastructure could be upgraded to compete fully with Telecom Éireann in voice telephony and other services.  As long as Cablelink is owned by Telecom Éireann this will not happen.  There is no reason Telecom should invest money in a subsidiary to enable it to compete with its core business.  Monopolies do not function in that way.  Cablelink should be allowed to operate as an independent company.  It would then be in a position to develop as an innovative and aggressive player in the Irish telecommunications market, offering strong competition to Telecom Éireann and providing a real choice for hundreds of thousands of consumers.  Some years ago when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I sought to achieve that but could not prevail against the Fianna Fáil and the Department's desire to hand Telecom Éireann a total monopoly with no potential competitors.</P>
    <P>Ideally, the Cablelink company should also be privatised in addition to Telecom Éireann.  This would benefit the taxpayer in two ways: first, the sale of the company would net several hundred million pounds for the Exchequer and, second, the State would not be required to fund that company's heavy capital investment requirement in the years to come.  The best option would <Col N="727" /> be to float the business on the Stock Exchange.  This would allow the company to remain under Irish control and ownership while giving it independent access to an unlimited supply of new capital.</P>
    <P>It is not just the Progressive Democrats Party which believes that Cablelink should be hived off from Telecom Éireann.  A recent report on industrial policy states:</P>
    <P>There is a good case for the sale of Cablelink to an independent network provider, subject to conditions on significant investment and upgrading in order to promote competition and new services.</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from the document &ldquo;Shaping our Future&rdquo; published recently by Forfás, the Government's advisory body for industrial development which is part of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The steering committee which oversaw the production of that report included representatives of Government, the business sector and the trade union movement.  The document was launched with considerable fanfare and the impression was clearly given that it represented official Government policy. Yet the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications appears to be moving in the opposite direction.  When he announced the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann to KPN-Telia it became clear that Cablelink was to remain part of Telecom.  This means that one company will, in effect, continue to control two separate information monopolies.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision.  If he is genuinely concerned about promoting competition then there is no reason he should not proceed with the demerger of Cablelink.  If he goes ahead with his present plan then he is missing a great opportunity to increase consumer choice and reduce consumer costs.  I understand that the European Commission is looking at the question of Telecom's ownership of Cablelink.  I note that Mr. <Col N="728" /> Herbert Ungerer of the Competition Directorate DGIV in Brussels has publicly questioned Telecom's continued control of Cablelink, particularly as Telecom has unfortunately been given a derogation to preserve its monopoly and voice telephony until the year 2000. It would be embarrassing if, yet again, we are to be forced by pressure from Brussels to do the right thing which we are not prepared to do voluntarily. Surely the rights of consumers, both private and commercial, must be addressed in the decision-making process. The rights of consumers come last in the decision-making process in which we are now engaged.</P>
    <P>The Bill stipulates that while part of Telecom Éireann may be sold to the private sector the State is to retain a majority shareholding in the company. Why should this be the case?  Section 8 (2)  which provides for that is a disgrace. There is no longer any rationale for State control by ownership of the telecommunications industry.  All over the world Governments are coming to this realisation.  In Britain, New Zealand and even in the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe it is recognised that telecommunications is a commercial business which should be regulated by Government but not owned by them. The fact that telecommunications is a vital industry is no argument for State control through ownership.  The same used to be said of the Irish Sugar Company, Irish Life and the B &amp; I Line but the State has long since ceded control of these firms to the private sector and everyone has gained from that including, above all, the employees.</P>
    <P>This ideological obsession with State ownership has cost us dear in terms of Telecom Éireann's so-called strategic alliance which is merely a euphemism for partial minority privatisation.  It was the Government's insistence on continuing State control which scared away potential bidders for the Telecom stake. Companies such as British Telecom were simply not interested in becoming minority partners in a State controlled company, particularly one with the <Col N="729" /> record of Telecom Éireann.  In the end the Government was effectively left with one bidder.  It seems incredible that we had to pay consultants £5 million in fees to assist competing bids when there was only one bid to be considered.  Why does the Government want to retain control of Telecom Éireann?  The State has nothing to offer in management terms, otherwise it would not have sought what it calls a strategic partner for the company.  Equally the State has nothing to offer in terms of capital, otherwise it would not be selling part of the company.</P>
    <P>I could understand a sensible strategy, whereby the Government sold its holding in the company in tranches, gradually reducing its stake over a number of years.  This is what successfully happened in Irish Sugar-Greencore and Irish Life.  However, such a move is not planned with regard to Telecom Éireann.  Continuing State control of the telecommunications industry is deliberately included in the Bill.  What does the Government think it has to contribute to the long-term development of the company that the private sector cannot offer?  The only justification for it appears to be ideological and related to the welfare of trade unions and their officials.</P>
    <P>I question the manner in which the sale of the stake in Telecom Éireann has been handled.  The Exchequer received a nominal £1 from the sale of Irish Steel. It will not receive anything from the sale of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  The purchase price of £183 million will be reinvested in the company.  Effectively, this means the buyers, KPN-Telia, will get their money back.  Any proceeds from the sale of a further 15 per cent of the company of KPN-Telia will be swallowed up in meeting the State's obligations to the Telecom Éireann pension fund, where the liability is vast and measured in many hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>KPN-Telia's option over the remaining 15 per cent apparently cost it nothing.  This means the State is locked <Col N="730" /> into an arrangement whereby the Dutch-Swedish consortium has an effective lock on Telecom Éireann's long-term future.  Without paying the Government a penny, is has, for all practical purposes, secured effective control of what is perhaps the State's most valuable commercial asset.  It is ironic also that control of Telecom Éireann should now pass to foreign ownership.  In other countries, governments have sold their telecommunications networks by floating them on their stock exchanges.</P>
    <P>For example, in New Zealand, the Government pocketed £2 billion from the flotation of the New Zealand Telecom Corporation.  If Ireland had followed that route, Irish investors would have had an opportunity to purchase shares in Telecom Éireann.  The company would have remained in Irish hands and under Irish control.  It is a strange state of affairs when Irish pension funds can put their members' money into British Telecom and the telecom companies in New Zealand and Hong Kong, but they are precluded by the Government from investing in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is no reason Telecom Éireann could not have been privatised via the public floatation mechanism.  There is pent up demand for quality new stock issues among Irish institutional and private investors.  The Minister for Finance frequently encourages the Irish investment community to put more money into Irish companies, but how can they do so if they are not given the chance?  Why should it be necessary to continue to rely on public investment and borrowing of public money when there is almost unlimited private money to make the same investment at no cost to the Exchequer and with no resulting increase in the national debt?  A well managed and independent Telecom Éireann would have been in a position to command the confidence of international institutional investors.  The company could then have pursued a strategic alliance on its own terms without any Government interference.  The <Col N="731" /> Exchequer would have benefited substantially in terms of privatisation receipts and Telecom Éireann would have been in a position to fund itself in common with any other commercial organisation.  It is a great pity for the company and the investment community in Ireland that this route was not followed.  The insistence on continued Government control of Telecom Éireann in the Bill is all the more surprising given the State's poor record as a strategic manager of the company.</P>
    <P>Under State ownership, essential cost cutting at Telecom Éireann has been continually postponed, much to the detriment of the company's long-term commercial prospects.  By the company's estimates, it is carrying excess costs of more than £100 million a year.  As a virtual monopoly, Telecom Éireann is able to pass these costs on to consumers, keeping Irish prices above those in the UK and damaging the competitiveness of the economy in the process.  Despite being lumbered with £100 million of unnecessary additional costs, the company was still able to deliver an operating profit of £218 million in its last financial year.  This represents an operating margin of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Failure to tackle the problem of rationalisation has left us in difficulty. KPN-Telia is likely to insist that the necessary cost cutting measures are implemented at a brisk pace.  De-manning Telecom Éireann will dramatically increase profits and boost the value of the company.  In a few years time, KPN-Telia's stake in the company will have risen to a strategic 35 per cent.  This will effectively shut out all other bidders and leave KPN-Telia ideally placed as the sole bidder to purchase out right control of the company.  The clever New Zealanders received £2 billion from the sale of their telecom company, but it is unlikely the Exchequer will ever see a fraction of that amount from the disposal of Telecom Éireann, although it is probably worth more than the New Zealand company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> It is recognised by all competitors that telecommunications will play a vital role in determining industrial competitiveness in future years.  The pace of technological change in the industry will be rapid.  In State controlled companies, strategic decisions are made ultimately by bureaucrats and politicians.  Experience tells us such companies are not the best equipped to cope with the needs of a fast changing market.  We should not be afraid of competition, as we so patently are afraid.  Instead, we should welcome it.</P>
    <P>The UK has already given itself a huge competitive advantage over all other European countries through the thorough manner in which it has deregulated its telecommunications market.  This gives it an important card to play in attracting mobile investment projects in the services sector.  We should seek to emulate the British achievements in this area.  American companies will not be attracted to Ireland by the prospect of dealing with a largely State owned company which controls two telecommunications monopolies.</P>
    <P>In terms of employment and prosperity, we have a huge amount to gain from the deregulation of the telecommunications market and the ending of direct State involvement in the sector. We should enthusiastically pursue this option, not seeking to protect State monopolies by postponing competition as has been done for years, a policy which the Bill perpetuates.</P>
    <P>Regarding definitions in the Bill, I note that, in section 6 (1), providers of telecommunications services are not defined, but telecommunications service is defined in extraordinarily broad terms in section 7 (1).  It is so broad that it includes virtually any form of communication. I hope this is not an attempt to extend and deepen State control of the telecommunications industry with a view to protecting Telecom Éireann's monopoly in the long-term.  We have nothing to lose and much to gain by promoting competition in telecommunications. In the interests of consumers, I <Col N="733" /> urge the Minister to promote competition and not to frustrate it as the Minister's strategy subtlety does.</P>
    <P>I re-echo Deputy Brennan's observation earlier that the Labour Party and the successors in title to Official Sinn Féin appear, incredibly, to have absented themselves from the debate. We have been told, semi-officially, that they will not be contributing to the debate.  That is remarkable.  I would like the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, or another left-wing theologian to reply to what I said and point out where, if anywhere, I am wrong.  I would also like them to outline the benefits that would accrue to this country from continued State ownership of telecommunications when Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Poland, former East Germany, the Baltic Republics and, possibly, Romania and Bulgaria believe the State has nothing to contribute to efficiency or competitiveness by retaining ownership of telecommunications. As this is an open ended debate I invite them to come in and let us hear what they have to say. In the absence of that, there can be no argument for maintaining the <i>status quo,</i> as essentially we are trying to do, with only minor changes.  The <i>status quo</i> has not served us well, it will not serve us well and, as our neighbours and competitors change rapidly, we will be left a long way behind if we fail to do likewise.</P>

      <P>I am bemused by Deputy O'Malley's concluding remarks about ideology on the State sector.  Not long ago he was a Minister and leader of a political party in Government with a party with whom, perhaps, he regards holds a similar ideology.

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Brennan would indicate if he agrees with the policies enumerated by a member of a <Col N="734" /> party which may be a potential partner for Fianna Fáil in Government at some time in the future.  Deputy O'Malley was selective in the historic cases he outlined. I recall Mr. Hynes, a former chief executive of Telecom Éireann, indicating sweeping changes in the company when a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government was in office.  He was unceremoniously sacked by the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for suggesting that there was over-manning in Telecom Éireann and that sweeping changes were necessary to make the company more competitive.  Why did Deputy O'Malley not intervene at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He allowed the Minister to sack him.  If his beliefs were as strong then as they are now, he should have taken action.  This Government does not have the type of ideological hang-ups about privatisation Deputy O'Malley suggests.  Members will recall that in the past year and a half Irish Steel and the remaining shares in Irish Life were sold and we are now talking about the partial sale of Telecom Éireann to enable it meet the competitive challenges which it will inevitably face from various companies here and in the EU that would like to have a foothold in our telecommunications market.  I believe all political parties accept the need for the £500 million from the sale of part of Telecom Éireann to be pumped into the company to make it more efficient.  Its enormous capital investment, which was badly needed, has put a strain on its finances. Members will recall when people had to wait four or five years to have a telephone installed but, fortunately, successive Governments have ensured that is no longer the case.  I am sure we could all tell anecdotal stories about various Ministers of State and many Members will recall the answers Mark Killilea provided for the installation of telephones during election campaigns but, fortunately, that is no longer necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> The State's investment in the telecommunications system over many years has been of enormous benefit to consumers and the economy in general. As a peripheral nation, we probably require a better telecommunications network than any country in the European Union to sell our products effectively and efficiently on the European and world stages.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to bring about the transformation of Telecom Éireann and prepare it for competition. This will be achieved through a strategic alliance deal agreed with KPN-Telia. The deal will involve that consortium acquiring a stake of up to 35 per cent in Telecom Éireann over a three year period.  The financial terms are expected to produce total proceeds to the State in excess of £500 million, something on which Deputy Brennan poured cold water.  This money will be available through a profit sharing formula to further strengthen the company.  It will allow the State capture 60 per cent of the increase in value of the Telecom Éireann shares above a certain threshold.</P>
    <P>KNP-Telia will pay the State an initial £183 million towards a 20 per cent stake in the company and an additional £200 million over the next three years as they exercise options for a further 15 per cent of shares.  The partner will make further payments to the State in respect of both the 20 per cent stake and the 15 per cent of shares purchased under option, subject to the growth of the company. Under the profit sharing formula, all profits will be shared 60:40 between the State and KNP-Telia after the consortium has earned an agreed return on its investment.</P>
    <P>The structure of this deal will allow the State, the company and the strategic partner to benefit from the significant contribution which KPN-Telia will bring to the company and our telecommunications sector.  Through this deal KPN-Telia are committed to investing substantial human and strategic resources in the company to allow it realise fully <Col N="736" /> its development potential.  This will ensure that we will become one of the more progressive countries in Europe in terms of price, quality and technologically advanced services.  KPN-Telia will provided a comprehensive strategic support programme for Telecom Éireann which will consist of technical support, expert and managerial assistance, software and systems improvements covering mainstream telephony, data services and mobile and multi-media services.  These are important developments in the area of communications which have not been developed to their full potential by Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>A total of 85 separate strategic initiatives have been agreed between KPN-Telia and Telecom Éireann.  I understand a team of experts and managers will be available as required, amounting to an equivalent of up to 100 man years of effort spread over the next few years to hammer out the various multimedia developments I outlined.</P>
    <P>The KPN-Telia consortium is backed by the resources of Unisource and Uniworld which will enable Telecom Éireann provide worldwide interconnections on best terms to assist Irish industry and business, something to which Deputy O'Malley and others should have referred.  The two companies are among the world leaders in terms of quality and efficiency.  They bring a good track record to the task facing them here because of their accomplishments in their markets.  In seeking a partner for Telecom Éireann the Government wanted a pattern that would fit well with its strategy and hold similar views on its strategic direction for the future.  The KPN-Telia group has fit that strategic pattern.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what some Members said, this is a worthwhile deal for the country and for Telecom Éireann.  The amount involved is reasonable for a 35 per cent stake in a company that has a large debt and has undergone enormous capital investment and it must get a return on that investment.  Taking into account the worldwide connections Telecom <Col N="737" /> Éireann will be afforded in this consortium through Unisource and Uniworld, Irish businesses will have an opportunity to be even more competitive as it will assist them in the communications sector and keep costs down.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Government's decision to ensure the regulator is independent. Consumers, whether household or business, should have a regulator or ombudsman to deal effectively with matters relating to charges.  It is crucial to have an independent person dealing with those issues so I am glad section 2 states that this will be the case. The ombudsman system, which has been established in Ireland for a number of years, is working reasonably well for consumers and a suitably independent person, such as the regulator under this legislation, will provide the consumer with protection from companies which may not pass on the benefits of growth and competition as they should. I look forward to scrutinising the regulator's work so that consumers and business people who regularly use telecommunications will receive the benefits.</P>
    <P>ESAT is a welcome addition to the telecommunications industry.  When the bids for the mobile licence were made and decided on, I was disappointed that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had difficulty accepting the competition was above board or that the result was a testimony to ESAT's capacity, as an Irish company in an international consortium, to outbid others and win the second mobile licence.  I congratulate ESAT on the strides it is making in the Irish telecommunications market.  It is providing necessary competition for Telecom Éireann which will mean an even better environment for consumers. It is important for consumers that there are sharp-edged companies like ESAT, prepared to take on the challenge of competing in the telecommunications business.  It appears to be making great strides at present.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with Deputy O'Malley's remarks about Cablelink. <Col N="738" /> For some reason, Telecom Éireann and RTE have acquired shares in this company and I question the need for their involvement.  There are peripheral reasons for their wanting a controlling interest but Cablelink should be able to stand on its own and make links with international consortia in telecommunications and communications generally without recourse to Irish State companies. I have no difficulty in reviewing Cablelink's place in the telecommunication and television market.</P>
    <P>One of the great bones of contention concerning telecommunications in rural areas is the proliferation of masts in scenic places and my parliamentary colleagues in Kilkenny and I attended various meeting on this subject recently. Telecom, ESAT and RTE have decided to locate installations between 30 and 60 feet high in sensitive, scenic areas where householders would have difficulty getting planning permission from the local authority.  I ask the Minister to insist that his policy of co-sharing arrangement between these companies is implemented.  It is not acceptable that each company feels it should have different sites within a small area in order to retain its independence. Arrangements should be entered into to minimise the number of masts erected around the country and the companies should share facilities to that end.</P>
    <P>Local people also have fears, well-founded or not, about the emission of non-ionising radiation.  The Radiological Protection Institute has the necessary expertise, as an established independent authority, to reassure the public on the safety or otherwise of these installations.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle represents a mountainous region where there is a difficulty with signals and these installations are causing community groups concern, much of which stems from anecodotal conversation about radiation.  It should be monitored by an independent authority such as the RPI.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for bringing the legislation before the <Col N="739" /> House.  Selling a stake in a State company is a long and protracted process, as other Members who have been involved in such schemes will testify.  It takes time not only to set up the deal but to negotiate it and put it in legislative form.  The Minister has got a reasonable deal. Telecom will benefit enormously from the sale of this 35 per cent stake.  The State will still have a controlling interest but that may not always be the case as the legislation can be reviewed.  If further developments in telecommunications are required, any future Government will have to take that on board to ensure the broadest range of communications are available to the Irish consumer, the company delivering the service is competitive and the consumer receives the benefit of lower charges from increasing competition with which these companies must inevitably cope.</P>
    <P>The independence of the regulator is crucial in protecting the consumer.  An Irish controlling interest in regulating these charges is important to many who have lobbied various politicians and Governments to ensure charges are minimised.  Because of the emergence of competition over the last year or two Telecom Éireann has had to look more closely at what it can do to reduce charges, generate greater efficiency and pass on extra benefits, which it had not done to date.  I hope the independent regulator will, like the Ombudsman, play a major role in protecting the citizen and ensuring a competitive telecommunications sector for individuals and businesses.  Accordingly, I have pleasure in supporting this legislation.  Undoubtedly, there will be many opportunities to review this Bill but the sale of the 35 per cent is a good first step in protecting the jobs of Telecom employees and the company itself, and in obtaining a return on the huge investment made over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>To date 1,631 applications have been made to the Compensation Tribunal, of which 1,483 are primary claimants, 83 are dependants and 65 are carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must have applied within six months of the establishment of the tribunal, that is, on or before 21 <Col N="741" /> June 1996, or must apply within six months of the date upon which they first became aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant who it is satisfied was under legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser of that legal disability. The number of additional applications that may be made to the tribunal cannot be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has heard 140 cases to date, making 139 awards and disallowing 1 claim.  The awards made by the tribunal to date range from £15,200 to £332,756 and no award of the tribunal has been rejected.  There is one award which is the subject of judicial review proceedings.  The total amount of the awards made to date is approximately £15.5 million.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides that the Minister for Health, if he considers it appropriate may amend the scheme, but no such amendment shall operate to remove, restrict or diminish in any way rights or benefits conferred on persons entitled to claim under the scheme in its unamended form.  As I have already stated in the House, if I have evidence and I am convinced that the workings of the tribunal are not serving the very best interests of the claimants, or if in my opinion such amendment would improve the scheme, I will use my powers under the scheme to ensure that the tribunal is at all times meeting the needs of persons infected with hepatitis C.  As I have already stated in the House, I have been informed by the tribunal that no applicant will be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement to the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing.  The tribunal has also informed me that to date no hearing date has been allocated to a claimant unless such a date has been sought by the claimant. The tribunal has also informed me that <Col N="742" /> an additional 100 hearings have been scheduled up to 15 January 1997 with a further 40 claims currently awaiting hearing beyond that date.  I am satisfied that the tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently as I had envisaged at the outset.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, came into operation on 23 September 1996.  Deputies will recall that this was a central feature of the health care package which I agreed with the various representative organisations.</P>
    <P>Persons eligible to receive services under the Act are those, who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of a health board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of anti-D product or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.  Eligibility is determined on an individual basis without a means test and applies for the lifetime of the eligible person.</P>
    <P>The services to be provided by the health board free of charge to eligible persons under the Act are: (a) general practitioner medical and surgical services; (b) drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances; (c) the nursing service specified in section 60 of the Act of 1970 &mdash; (home nursing); (d) the service specified in section 61 of the Act of 1970 &mdash; (home help); (e) dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, optical and aural appliances; (f) counselling services in respect of hepatitis C; and (g) such other services as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>At my request each health board has appointed a liaison officer to ensure the smooth operation of the delivery of services under the Act, to act as a contact point for individuals and with the various interest groups whose members will be availing of services under the Act. My Department will continue to maintain contact with the representative organisations and the health board liaison officers to ensure that any initial problems that may arise can be tackled quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Less there be any doubt about the matter I wish to confirm to the House again that whatever resources that are required to implement the Act fully will be provided by the Government.  These new primary care services are, of course, in addition to the special hospital in-patient and out-patient services which have been established and developed over the last two years.  A sum of £2 million was provided for these services this year.</P>
    <P>There are two other remaining elements in the health care package to which I would like to refer.  I have agreed to establish a statutory consultative council on hepatitis C. My Department has had discussions with the representative organisations on the contents of a draft establishment order. A further draft of the order was sent to the representative organisations in recent weeks for their views.</P>
    <P>This new draft takes account of the earlier views of the organisations.  As soon as I have received their responses to the latest draft of the establishment order, which I believe will be positive, I will be setting up the consultative council.</P>
    <P>The final element of the health care package involves the establishment and funding of a special programme of research on hepatitis C under the aegis of the health research board.  This programme will include research projects into hepatitis C as it relates to persons infected through the use of anti-D.</P>
    <P>I have allocated £100,000 for this year in respect of suitable projects.  I understand that there has been a good response to the health research board's public advertisement for research proposals and a decision on projects to be funded will be taken by the board in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply in regard to which I wish to ask a number of supplementaries.  Will all persons screened under the national screening <Col N="744" /> programme who were diagnosed as having hepatitis C qualify for health care and will they be eligible to go before the Compensation Tribunal?  What role will the Blood Transfusion Service Board continue to have regarding hepatitis C victims?  Will the <i>ex gratia</i> payment scheme continue?  How will confidentiality be maintained when hepatitis C victims apply for their hepatitis C cards?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Approximately 58,000 to 59,000 persons were screened.  As the Deputy will be aware, the vast majority of those screened negative.  Therefore, all those screened would not all be eligible for free health care as there is nothing wrong with the majority of them.  The persons who would be entitled to free health care would be those who screened positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes.  A list of those people is available.  There is not any issue outstanding between my officials and the representative groups in regard to those who qualify.  That matter is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the role of the BTSB and the continuation of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment scheme, that scheme was put in place to fulfil a need at a particular time and it is proceeding.  I have not asked a question concerning the position of a person who accepts a compensation award.  I presume such an award would represent a full and final settlement and such persons would not be entitled to further <i>ex gratia</i> payments, but persons awaiting a hearing will continue to be covered under the scheme.  The BTSB also has another role, to quickly provide information in its possession as a result of the screening programme, which would be essential for persons who bring a case before a tribunal or before the courts. The board has the documentary evidence linking particular persons with a set dosage of anti D products or blood transfusions.  As the Deputy is aware, all <Col N="745" /> that needs to be established before the tribunal is the link between the blood product or infected blood and the incidence of hepatitis C from which a person is suffering.</P>
    <P>We have stressed that confidentiality is required, but it cannot be guaranteed. In terms of the context of the problem, there is a given number of people who are entitled to free medical care.  To ensure that this care is given to those entitled to it, but only to those entitled to it, some form of identification is necessary.  It has been done by way of application and a specific card.  We have liaison officers on the health boards who will, in effect, have a list of the people who are eligible within their own board area and we have stressed that everything must be treated with absolute confidentiality.</P>
    <P>In addition, the service will be provided by a person's own GP, and unlike the medical card situation, the service is not confined to practitioners on the GMS list.  One may go to one's GP, family doctor, or another doctor who is not on the GMS list, so the confidential relationship which at present pertains between a specific person and their GP, who would now be aware of their condition in respect of hepatitis C or the antibody, would apply.</P>
    <P>I am confident that confidentiality will be maintained and we have made it a priority in the operation of the scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that the interest groups involved and the individual applicants for this new service are very concerned that confidentiality should be maintained.  I have stressed this continually in my dealing on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What additional resources have been made available to the health boards specifically for the operation, administration and putting in place the services for hepatitis C victims?  What details of such services will be available in the annual reports of the health boards, given the Minister advised that there would be details?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> Research was to be undertaken and published on the area.  Did it get lost or should we expect it shortly?  If a member of a family where a victim has died as a result of hepatitis C was to go to the High Court I understand that there would be a ceiling placed on the award by virtue of the fact that the victim was deceased.  Is there a similar ceiling for the tribunal or can it assess it based on the arguments put forward?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Regarding the financial arrangements, hitherto we were running a number of schemes which involved the expenditure of money.  One of them was the <i>ex gratia</i> payments to which the Deputy referred. This entailed a small amount of money in its totality and was effectively demand led.  On the secondary care side and the acute hospitals, we provided a sum of £2 million in the 1996 Estimate for acute hospitals.  This has been sufficient and we know it will be so to the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Health Act, 1996, which came into operation a couple of days ago by commencement order made by me on 23 December 1995, will have also to entail expenditure.  However, this is being budgeted out of the general allocations for GMS, but we will be including a new element to cover it.</P>
      <P>This is not service based on the medical card, but the type of service which is being provided under the medical card scheme through the GMS is in many ways analogous, except that the GMS scheme is means tested and this is not. This means that approximately 1,600 people have been added on the enormous number of people who have medical cards.  The quantum, therefore, is very small but it will be included in the health boards' budgets.  The medical and GP side is not a huge cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to do an estimate of the costs in respect of the other services which are to be provided.  Returning to my initial reply, in terms of GP services, drugs, medicines, etc.  I could provide a reasonable estimate now.  Furthermore, in terms of additionality it is small, given <Col N="747" /> the kind of budget we are running, and there is no problem in meeting it.</P>
    <P>I will be seeking information on home nursing, home health, dental and oral matters etc., in the course of setting allocations for health boards from the liaison officers.  It will be different from health board to health board because the number of people affected in some health boards is quite small, while it is substantial in others.  We are also trying to continue the situation where those in the functional area of one specific health board have traditionally obtained a service across the boundary.  It will, therefore, be flexible.  We will provide whatever funds are necessary to provide this service properly and we will work with liaison officers who will be in contact with individual persons in the provision of this service.</P>

The board has publicly advertised for pure research projects.  They obtained a number of offers and they will be selecting from those.  Their initial budget to allocated grants to project teams in the hospitals or universities is £100,000. Before the end of this year they will be selecting the projects which will be funded.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 23, 27, 48 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons on the public hospital waiting list at 30 June 1996 was 30,447.  The full figures on a national <Col N="749" /> basis for 30 June 1996 were not available until recent days.  The corresponding waiting list figure at the end of June 1995 was 27,696.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the overall waiting list for in-patient treatment has risen over the past 12 months and I intend to act quickly to tackle this increase.  The level of service to be provided by the acute hospital sector for 1996 as agreed between my Department and the health agencies will be fully delivered in accordance with the agreed service plans.  As the Deputy will be aware, seasonal closures of hospital beds are usually planned to coincide with a period when staff are on annual leave and to take advantage of a fall off in non-emergency elective admissions during the holidays.  In addition, this period is often used as an opportunity to refurbish wards or to carry out minor capital improvements.  Decisions on the extent and timing of such closures are, in my view, best left to local health agencies.</P>
    <P>In June 1996, a total of 141 beds were closed.  This represented 1.1 per cent of the total bed compliment of 12,777.  A further 276 beds were closed in July 1996 and in August 1996 a further 288 beds were closed.  In the peak holiday month of August, therefore, a total of 705 beds were closed, or 5.5 per cent of the total bed compliment of 12,777.  The monthly average of beds closed during the June to August period was 421 or 3.3 per cent of the total bed compliment. However, I should stress that all emergency and urgent services continue to be provided during this period.</P>
    <P>I have had the position reviewed and I now intend to direct some funding to this area so that waiting lists do not continue to rise for the remainder of the year.  I have instructed officials from my Department to examine, as a matter of urgency, a number of areas where waiting lists are excessive and where existing spare capacity can be used to effect a reduction in these lists.  I expect to have this exercise concluded within the next few days.  Is it likely that, by the end of this year, the total additional funding provided to reduce waiting lists since <Col N="750" /> June 1993 when the overall waiting list figure was 40,130 will be of the order of £50 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a scandal that the sum of £30 million spent by the Government in 1993 and 1994 which had such a successful result in reducing the waiting list means now almost nothing in that the waiting list has increased significantly in the past 12 months?</P>
      <P>The Minister says he intends to act quickly but is it not money that is needed?  How much money is the Minister going to provide, how soon will it be provided and what result will it have?  How many of the 705 beds closed in August are still closed?  When will we have the full complement of beds available again?</P>

This has been continued since I took over as Minister for Health from my colleague, the Minster for the Environment.  Deputy Howlin.

We have been in contact with hospitals and agencies all around the country.  There is spare capacity in some hospitals and agencies. There is no point in giving money to hospitals and agencies that do not have spare capacity.  I expect that the hospitals I have identified have the capacity to spend another £5 million or so for the remainder of this year.  I will be providing that extra funding.  I cannot tell the Deputy the number of operations that will pay for but it will be of the order of 6,000 or 7,000.  Therefore, the progress which Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party commenced, which we have continued, will continue right on through the next election into our second term in office, provided we can all keep out the Progressive Democrats, who have no interest in this matter, who had waiting lists of 41,000 the day they left office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The provision of treatment and rehabilitation services for drug misusers is a matter for health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Drug misuse in this country takes two forms, the misuse of so-called &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy, which is prevalent throughout the country, and the misuse of heroin, which is confined mainly to certain parts of Dublin. The most recent report of the Health Research Board on treated drug misuse in the greater Dublin Area noted that in 1994, 2,702 persons received treatment for drug misuse in that year. The 1995 report, which will be published before the end of the year will have details of treatment from all over the country.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in February of this year to implement a range of measures aimed at reducing the demand for drugs.  These measures include strengthening existing school-based substance abuse programmes in conjunction with the Department of Education; boosting locally-based initiatives on education and prevention, in conjunction with education personnel, the Garda and other agencies; running national and locally-based drug awareness campaigns aimed at young people and their parents; and targeting specific education programmes at high risk areas such as the inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also recommend improving the service provision for drug misusers, particularly in Dublin city, where the problem is most acute.  This is being done by extending locally-based drug treatment facilities in Dublin; giving general practitioners a wider role in the provision of treatment to stabilised drug misusers; co-ordination of detoxification facilities and improving rehabilitation. Since the Government decisions, all health boards have established regional co-ordinating committees to monitor the problem in their area and to make <Col N="753" /> recommendations on the appropriate response.</P>
    <P>Treatment for cannabis or ecstasy misuse generally takes the form of counselling and support while, for those misusing heroin, treatment involves a number of other therapies including drug substitution therapy, i.e. methadone.</P>
    <P>A register of drug addicts receiving methadone treatment is maintained in the Eastern Health Board area.  The total number of persons on this register at present is 1,552.  There are in excess of 500 persons awaiting treatment for drug misuse in the Dublin area at present.  The Eastern Health Board hopes to have cleared this waiting list by the end of the year.  The nature of the problem is such, however, that as services develop more people come for treatment.  It is not possible at this stage to put a definite figure on the number of heroin addicts in the city.  The Eastern Health Board has concentrated on putting in place a comprehensive range of services as provided for in the decisions. These include the extension of locally based drug treatment facilities in Dublin, in consultation with local communities. Supports for community-based initiatives have been put in place in areas such as Kilbarrack, Clondalkin, Killinarden, Fettercairn and Ballyfermot; general practitioners will play a wider role in the ongoing maintenance on methadone of persons who have been stabilised in the treatment centres. Over 50 general practitioners are now involved; rehabilitation and support services have been further developed; special attention is being given to the problems of persons who smoke heroin. Detoxification programmes for young heroin smokers have been established in a number of centres; there has been an external evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of services in the Eastern Health Board area; the nuisance which drug misusers can cause in the vicinity of treatment centres and other locations is being alleviated by arrangements agreed between the Eastern Health Board and the Garda; the co-ordination of detoxification facilities has been <Col N="754" /> improved.  In addition, the number of detoxification beds has been increased and a downstream facility is in planning; a total of 1,552 people are now in receipt of methadone maintenance; crisis intervention programmes are being put in place in each of the health board's treatment centres; a mobile methadone service has been introduced; a treatment service has commenced in Ballymun; education officers are being recruited to work with &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people; an information database is being set up; and the board's management has been restructured.  The Eastern Health Board is confident that the implementation of the measures outlined above will result in the provision of services for about 2,500 drug misusers by the end of this year.  This will be a significant contribution to addressing the drug misuse problem.</P>
    <P>The total amount of money allocated annually to health boards for HIV/AIDS and drug treatment and prevention services has increased steadily since 1992.  For example, the allocation to health boards for these programmes in 1995 was approximately £13 million. This figure will increase by £4 million in 1996.  It is not possible to put a specific figure on the allocation for drug treatment services by each health board because such services would range over a number of programmes, including psychiatric care and acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that services will continue to be developed and expanded to meet the threat posed by this scourge to society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response was very vague.  What I had requested were specific targets and budgets reflecting a focus on and response to the urgency felt among many communities, particularly those in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the methadone maintenance treatment services, which are being increased to include 2,500 addicts by the end of this year, in the week in which the methadone maintenance van was launched in this city what plans and <Col N="755" /> safeguards have been put in place in the dispensing of methadone by this mobile unit?  What safeguards exist to ensure a proper medical decision will be taken on the appropriateness of methadone maintenance in the case of individual recipients, given the danger experienced in other countries that the dispensing of methadone in this manner could well become part of the problem?</P>
    <P>In regard to treatment by methadone maintenance, has there been a corresponding increase in resources to residential drug-free therapeutic programmes in this city?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Underlying the Deputy's supplementary is a suggestion that there are better types of programme available than methadone maintenance, that perhaps this is not the route we should follow.  There has been international debate on this over many years but it is now accepted international practice to run methadone or other analogous programmes as representing the only way forward.  Of course, the ideal would be to have a drug-free society but we are a long way from that.  As I understand it, the same Protocols will apply to those being dispensed methadone from the mobile clinic as apply at present in the case of fixed centres.  Our biggest problem is that the supply of methadone provided through the health services is not sufficient to meet the demand.  Even on the official waiting list, which is not a true reflection of the real position, there are 500 people awaiting methadone.  In the Eastern Health Board area we are moving very rapidly, under the guidance of a new programme manager, to implement this programme with all due speed.  We are playing catch-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Leader of the Opposition this morning lecture the Taoiseach about the evils of heroin, asking what services should be provided, when his constituency was the place first visited by this problem, which has obtained there for many a long year. <Col N="756" /> The Deputy was a Minister for seven years from 1987 and must have been a Minister for 12 of his 20 years in the Dáil.  When he had the wherewithal to do something about this problem &mdash; which is a huge one in his constituency &mdash; as Minister for Finance the resources were meagre.  When I looked for extra money in 1996 for the methadone programmes and drug treatment programmes in Dublin &mdash; this is not meant to be a criticism of civil servants &mdash; there was no real awareness of the problem in the Department of Finance at official level.  It seems to me that whatever way we deal with this, it will not be dealt with on a party political basis.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in Dublin both on the supply and treatment side.  I am the first to admit that, even though I moved very rapidly when I became aware of the magnitude of the problem.  We are still trying to catch up, in the face of great resistance from some communities. Everybody says heroin is causing frightful problems in Dublin, but if Deputies just try to negotiate a location for a clinic they will see the kind of pressures that will come on the methadone programmes.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives have been put in place and we are achieving results. We have made improvements but the services we are now providing through the Eastern Health Board have not yet reached the stage which I would consider adequate to meet the need.  We are moving rapidly on this issue and it is a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree this is an issue which in terms of urgency and political commitment transcends any party political boundaries and the Minister has my support in his efforts in this matter. I asked the Minister about a cross referenced list of registered addicts.  There is some uncertainty as to whether persons are showing up a couple of times on the same lists in the methadone clinics. Does the Minister not accept it is very important to have an up to date data <Col N="757" /> base so that we know what we are dealing with in terms of the methadone maintenance facility?</P>
      <P>In July the Government promised that rehabilitation places would be increased from 60 to 250.  Has that happened in the light of the ongoing crisis? In response to the Minister's comment that I was criticising the increase in the methadone maintenance programme, I accept, as does the Minister, that it is not a perfect solution.  It is only suitable in the short-term for chronic drug abusers.  It should not be the main plank of any Government's response to our drugs crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I stand over the methadone maintenance programme because it can prove very effective. Methadone is a drug but both from a health and a social point of view, there are enormous advantages to having people on a drug which is not destructive rather than them being on a drug, such as heroin, which is very destructive to their health, to their family and to their associates.  On the question of rehabilitation and detoxification, I will send the Deputy the Eastern Health Board programme which is very detailed and I will also send a copy of the latest progress report I received on implementation of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to that progress report, a four step rehabilitation programme is being initiated in each treatment centre. Together with this, extra rehabilitation is being provided at Soilse, in Henrietta Place.  Voluntary services are being funded to provide extra places so that an overall target of 250 places can be provided in 1996.  They are confident they will have 250 places by the end of this calendar year, although I cannot say exactly how many places are available at the moment.  In the past six months a total of 64 patients have been admitted to the in-patient detoxification unit in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Mechanisms are being put in place to evaluate and streamline this programme.  Negotiations have taken place with a voluntary agency to provide after care to <Col N="758" /> enable the throughput of the expensive in-patient unit to be increased.  An extra five beds are scheduled to be opened shortly.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of very specific detail in both the Eastern Health Board programme and the progress reports.  I will put a suitable pack of information together for the Deputy so she will have all the information she requests on the specifics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that up to 2,500 people will receive methadone by the end of this year.  Will the Minister guarantee that all of those people will receive accompanying counselling and therapeutic services as well as methadone maintenance?  Does the programme rely on methadone maintenance simpliciter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I cannot give such a guarantee.  The programme is that as soon as addicts who are put on methadone are stabilised in the clinics, they will be moved out to a GP.  As many of the addicts are GMS patients, it would be appropriate if they could be moved to their own GPs where they are listed.  The GPs provide counselling. Where the programme is working properly, it is working very well, but there are areas of unevenness in it.  Our policy is to move addicts towards the GPs.  I thank the GPs who have participated. Sometimes it is difficult for a GP to participate but we are getting very good co-operation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that rather than having clinics with large populations of methadone users calling twice a week, it would be much better if stabilised patients in very small numbers attended a very large number of GPs in different parts of the city so that the geographic intensity of addicts going to a clinic would be reduced.  Through that system we would get a greater community acceptance of what we are doing and less community resistance.  It is difficult enough to deal with addicts, but when local communities are pitched against trying to provide <Col N="759" /> health services, it becomes extremely difficult.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent reported difficulties between the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and its chief executive.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, this matter has now been resolved through the decision of the chief executive to resign with effect from 18 October 1996.</P>
      <P>It is primarily a matter for the board to identify and implement whatever steps are required to deal with issues relating to senior management, staff morale or subscriber confidence, and, more broadly, the challenges posed by competition in the private health insurance market.  I am confident such of these matters as may need attention will be addressed by the board as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The arrangements between the chief executive who resigned and the board of the VHI is a matter for the board in the first <Col N="760" /> instance because it was an internal matter. The resignation is effective from 18 October so Mr. Duncan is still the chief executive of the VHI, but I understand he does not intend to be active in exercising that function.  However, there is no vacancy until 19 October.  I await a proposal from the board of the VHI to see how they will deal with the vacancy. I will exercise my statutory function by ensuring that everything will be done properly and in accordance with best practice.</P>
      <P>It is very important that with almost 35 per cent of the population insured under VHI and most of us in this House committed to a mix of public and private medicine, the progress we have made in the VHI in the last 18 months or so would continue and that it be a thriving, effective health insurance organisation providing the best possible service to its subscribers.  Part of the agreement was that the terms would be confidential between the board and the chief executive.  I am prepared to come into the House at a future date and give those terms if Deputies insist, but I would appreciate if I was not pressed on the matter.  I am aware there is an issue of accountability when public funds are involved, but rather than announcing the information today I would ask Deputies to reflect on the matter and if they wish to be briefed privately I will do so.  If they want the announcement made publicly I will have to inform the people involved that, because there must be accountability for the spending of public funds, I may have to give the terms.  The terms are moderate and I do not think there will be an outcry about them.  It is always a personal tragedy when a man in such a position resigns, but in the final analysis it is in the best interests of the VHI that matters have turned out this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no personal interest in what were the settlement terms to the chief executive, there is an accountability issue here. When one considers the number of chief executives whose heads have rolled in <Col N="761" /> the past two years, it might be interesting to get a figure of how much it has cost the taxpayer in settlement terms.  I will be pursuing the matter with the Minister and will ask him to indicate in the House what were the settlement terms.  Does he believe that the VHI as a company is behaving in a manner that would be expected of such a company that is facing competition for the first time in its history?  Will he indicate why he felt it necessary to sanction a further 6 per cent increase in VHI premiums, bringing to 30 per cent the level of increase in VHI premiums in the last two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Voluntary Health Insurance organisation does not operate as an insurance company.  The basic legislation states that it will operate on the basis of community rating, and there are also other restrictions on it.  The key to normal insurance is that one hires actuaries to measure the risk and one charges premia in accordance with the expected risk.  That is the way the insurance industry works, regardless of the area of insurance involved.</P>
      <P>In this case it is a misnomer to even talk about insurance in the sense that it is money in and money out and because of community rating there is no measurement of risk.  Everybody can join at the same premium and can enjoy the same conditions.  The skills required to run an organisation such as the VHI are not necessarily those needed to run an insurance company, although many of the skills of insurance obviously would be applicable in the sense that there is a core of customers who pay premia and awards are settled in respect of items of service provided by hospitals, consultants and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On why it was necessary to award a 6 per cent increase, under the Act my role is to stop an increase if I choose to intervene, but after notification, if I simply do nothing, the increase comes into effect after a period of time has elapsed. After examining the demand for a 6 per cent increase and taking the advice of <Col N="762" /> the officials in my Department I thought that, in this instance, it was in the best interests of the VHI, its subscribers and its service providers not to intervene. Since the nature of the business is money in and money out, it is not acceptable that the VHI should run its business on the basis that it continually increases premiums on the one hand so that it receives more income and, on the other, tries to restrict services so that less money goes out.  That becomes a self-defeating strategy.</P>
    <P>While competition, because of community rating, is very limited in terms of price now that BUPA is coming into the market, the VHI will have to compete in the attractiveness or otherwise of the packages of service which it puts before the public.  Because of community rating it must increase its market by ensuring that larger numbers of the young and healthy, low liability people are involved in paying premia so that they will fund the draw-downs by people who, as they move on through life, use the health services to a greater extent. It is in that area the weakness exists in the VHI.  Regardless of who takes over as chief executive or what arrangements are put in place, the company must compete at that level.  It is not acceptable that it would run simply on an accountancy basis of money in and money out. That was acceptable when there was a monopoly, but since there is no longer a monopoly it will have to compete on the attractiveness of the product.</P>

      <P>The Minister has confirmed a report in the national newspapers that the chief executive would not participate actively in the running of the company.  I framed my previous supplementary incorrectly when I asked who was acting as chief executive officer, but that question is still relevant.  Who is acting as chief executive officer now that Mr. Duncan has decided he will not be an active participant? Is the company rudderless?  In view of the fact that it is facing competition for the first time, it is important that somebody assumes control and <Col N="763" /> responsibility, given that Mr. Duncan is not acting in that capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 24 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>A series of initiatives relating to cancer, which includes a national cancer strategy, have been circulated to other Departments for their comments.  It is my intention to bring these initiatives to Government in the very near future and I hope to be in a position to publish the national cancer strategy without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national breast screening programme is one of the initiatives which <Col N="764" /> forms part of the National Cancer Strategy and it is intended to commence the first phase of the national programme in the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the recent survey to which the Deputy refers.  However I know that breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women in Ireland, accounting for approximately 650 deaths every year.  The aim of screening is to detect breast cancer at an early stage, when it is amenable to treatment, before it has had the chance to spread.  Medical evidence has shown that mortality can be reduced by up to approximately 25 per cent in women who attend for screening and that the benefit is greatest in women aged between 50 and 64 years.</P>
    <P>A major factor affecting the success of a screening programme is the establishment of a population register, which will reach over 70 per cent of the target population, because at least 70 per cent of the target population must participate in the screening programme if the programme is to significantly reduce mortality.  However, there are difficulties under current data protection legislation in obtaining names and addresses from existing data sources &mdash; e.g. the VHI, and the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; of women who should be offered screening.  Following discussions with the Department of Justice and the Data Protection Commissioner and advice from the Attorney General, I am satisfied that the matter can be resolved by a minor legislative amendment under the Health Acts.  I am giving this amendment immediate priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the initiatives circulated by way of memo to other Departments, when did circulation take place and how long did the Minister give each Department to respond?  We are all aware that some Departments are very good at responding while others would take forever if they got away with it.  We have discussed the national breast screening <Col N="765" /> programme with the Minister on a number of occasions including during Question Time.  What do the words &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; mean in terms of the commencement of the first phase?  From the last information we received from the Minister and the Department, I thought the first phase would be up and running at this stage and that the second phase would commence at the beginning of 1997.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that women present very late with the disease, does the Minister believe that the full range of services should be available outside the capital and not confined to a number of hospitals in Dublin?  We have discussed this matter before.  I am not saying that services such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy which are available in Dublin hospitals should be available in every hospital throughout the country but they should be available in at least two centres outside Dublin for convenience and equity reasons, if for no other.  When does the Minister expect to be in a position to announce his decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The timing of the announcement will depend to a large extent on the decision of my Cabinet colleagues.  The memo was circulated to other Government Departments in mid-August.  We have received the observations of all Departments except the Department of Finance which comes as no surprise.  I hope to be in a position to go to Government in October and make an announcement shortly thereafter.  There will be financial implications.  The issue of centres of excellence is relevant and was addressed in the memorandum.  It will be a matter for the Government to agree or disagree with my proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the national breast screening programme is not up and running.  Screening is of benefit to the woman concerned but, in terms of a national screening programme being effective as a preventive measure and in reducing mortality rates, <Col N="766" /> at least 70 per cent of the targeted cohort need to be screened.  The targeted cohort is women in the 50 to 64 age group or post-menopausal women, the group for whom screening proves most effective.</P>
    <P>When those responsible for the programme in the Mater Hospital had discussions with the Department to try to put a national population register in place to select women in that age group we looked around for a database.  The VHI and the Department of Social Welfare have extensive databases and between the two were satisfied we would have a database of sufficient precision which would allow us to do what is necessary but we immediately ran into a difficulty as, under the data protection legislation, the information contained in the VHI and Department of Social Welfare databases is confidential.  There is a need for a minor technical amendment to the Act which would allow us, in the interests of public health, to access databases for this sole purpose.</P>
    <P>I may be in contact with the Deputy. Deputy O'Donnell and others to see if this amendment can be made to the accountability Bill on Report Stage.  I am in discussions with the Department of Justice which is responsible for the primary legislation to see if it will allow us to do so.  That is what is stopping us from getting the programme up and running.  Screening for which money has been provided in the Estimates cannot commence until that happens.</P>
    <P>I will not wait for primary legislation to solve all of the problems which have been identified in recent years regarding data protection legislation.  If I can make the necessary arrangements and receive the co-operation of the House I will make this minor technical amendment to move the matter forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has run into a technical difficulty in the establishment of a database because of the confidentiality provisions.  Has this impacted on other areas such as the establishment of the database on drug <Col N="767" /> addicts in Dublin?  Is it of general application or confined to the national breast screening programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is of general application but has impacted in particular on the proposal to implement a national breast screening programme. While screening is of benefit to the women concerned in the relevant age group, in terms of a policy strategy succeeding in its objective, that is, reducing mortality rates, there needs to be a high take up, in excess of 70 per cent, in the relevant age group.  To achieve this one must have access to a database to inform women that we would like them to avail of this service.  We do not have such a database in the Department and if we were to use the material in other databases we would cross the legal line. The advice of the Attorney General is that we cannot do this and that an amendment is needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>What does screening entail?  Is it confined to mammography where the false positive-false negative rate can be as high as 10 to 20 per cent? The Minister said that the targeted cohort is women in the 50 to 64 age group.  Many women have complained to me that they are not eligible because they are in a certain age group.  Will the Department make it clear that it is not healthy for women under 50 years of age to undergo screening because of the negative effects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Unlike the Deputy I am not a medical doctor and can only give a layman's explanation. The Deputy touched on one of the reasons we are not implementing a national programme immediately.  The issue of the false positive-false negative rate would be aggravated if the programme were introduced simultaneously in all parts of the country.  The techniques and Protocols necessary to keep false negatives and false positives to a minimum can be guaranteed by controlling its expansion.  In the pilot <Col N="768" /> programmes the false positive-false negative rate was not as high as 15 to 20 per cent, rather it was kept very low by putting the right procedures in place.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, mammography is not effective in accurately identifying breast cancer in women who are not post-menopausal.  While there is a risk in the use of any medical machinery involving rays, that is not the primary reason, rather it is the breast of younger women as against post-menopausal women which causes the difficulty and creates the inaccuracy when mammography is used for screening purposes in younger women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that in seeking to formulate the database a problem has been encountered with the data protection legislation. Is that one of the reasons the database on drug addicts in Dublin has not been finalised?  There has been a delay in finding a reliable database for use in devising policy and implementing methadone maintenance and other programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is not primarily the problem and it is not the problem that has been brought to my attention.  There are a number of difficulties in respect of databases of, say, drug addicts in Dublin.  Many drug addicts, unfortunately, are quite happy to continue in their search for heroin. They are not in any system where they can be listed as persons either looking for treatment or available for treatment. There is the additional problem of people attending clinics as well as their GPs.  It is not a question of the same name being on the lists of a number of clinics; that would not be difficult to cross-match.  The difficulty arises when names on GPs lists, which are confidential, cannot be matched with those on clinic lists.  I do not want to give data in the House which would suggest that the waiting lists for methadone are exaggerated. On the contrary, they are understated but even in the understated figures there is some degree of duplication <Col N="769" /> with regard to people on the official waiting lists.  We are working on the problem but we have not yet come up against a data protection legislation barrier and, to be frank, I do want to raise the issue until somebody tells me to the contrary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that 1,500 to 1,800 people in the Southern Health Board area contract breast cancer every year, that the figure nationally is 8,000 to 10,000 and that it is possible that 8,000 to 10,000 people die every year from cancer?  Regarding the national cancer strategy, I understood that report was to be published five or six months ago.  Will the Minister say when the report will be published? Finally, there is no medical oncologist available to people living in the Southern Health Board areas of Cork and Kerry.  Given that there are approximately 2,000 cases of cancer per year in that area, will the Minister indicate when we can expect the appointment of an oncologist in that health board area?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy has asked a number of questions to which I have already given answers to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  I do not intend to repeat the replies in the interest of moving on to other Deputies' questions.  In general terms, the answers to the questions the Deputy raised will be included in the cancer policy.  As I said to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn earlier, I will be taking that to Government in October and I hope my Cabinet colleagues will agree to publication immediately thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The difficulty is that there had not been any <Col N="770" /> overview of policy in respect of cancer treatment until I initiated this programme which will range across the area of screening programmes and preventative methods through treatment methods including, where appropriate, centres of excellence for certain forms of treatment as well as the whole area of palliative care.  I do not intend to announce piecemeal what is properly a matter for an overview, but it is vitally important that we have a cancer policy because the incidence of mortality from cancer in Ireland is approximately 15 per cent above the European average. That suggests to me that the range of our services are not up to average best practice in our Community neighbour countries.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware, the talks between my Department and IMPACT on behalf of speech and language therapists are complex. However, direct negotiations are ongoing, under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency, with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances any further comment on my part would not be appropriate or helpful at this point. Deputies are aware that a series of negotiations are taking place between relevant Departments and public servants either in their direct employ or in the agencies.  Deputies will be pleased to learn that clerical and administrative staff in local authorities and health boards, through their union IMPACT, have voted to agree a wage offer. Deputies will be pleased to hear also that last night the nurses' alliance recommended acceptance by their members of the latest offer from the independent arbitrators.  A ballot on the <Col N="771" /> offer will be held in October.  While there are many disputes at different levels of negotiation, one public service dispute involving clerical and administrative officers in health boards and local authorities has now concluded on acceptable terms to both sides.  I hope we will have a good result from the nurses' ballot also.  On the management side we are making a formal offer and the nurses' alliance, which consists of the four unions representing nurses around the country, have issued a joint statement to their members recommending acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of success in the negotiations, particularly with the nursing profession.  Is the Minister aware that the European Court of Justice has ruled on a case in the United Kingdom that low pay rates for the predominantly female profession of speech therapists could constitute sexual discrimination? In relation to the ongoing problem of agreeing pay and conditions with a range of public service workers, would it not be possible to devise a more simple grading structure in the health service which would reduce the amount of time and energy spent on processing relativity claims to which the Minister referred?  Also, in a written reply on 8 May the Minister said that the speech therapists' claim was being processed and the management side was available for further discussions.  Has any progress been made in this protracted dispute over the low pay of speech and language therapists compared to other persons of similar qualifications?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I know it is a predominantly female profession but I understand the issue in the case in England was whether the profession was exclusively female.  Here there are men in the profession; therefore it is not possible to prove that there is sexual discrimination.</P>
      <P>A large number of groups are currently in negotiation under the third round of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  While the first and second round of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> nominated fixed percentage increases on fixed days across a range of grades, in the case of the third round there is a negotiation where one can go above the line in trade-offs for restructuring, along the lines the Deputy mentioned, or productivity. That process is taking a long time but it must be done under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the teachers' dispute which is ongoing; that comes under phase 3 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The same applies to the CPSU dispute, on which there was a vote recently which was again defeated.  The good news, however, is that one group has now accepted the offer put to it.</P>
      <P>The issue the Deputy raises is significantly more serious as it involves regrading, simplification and so on.  The current discussions are partly concerned with the degree to which restructuring can be introduced but workers are not prepared to accept major restructuring for small amounts of money.</P>
      <P>To return to the question, the reason I am introducing the other areas is that this is very similar.  It is simply another process of negotiation under phase 3 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  Talks are ongoing and the Health Service Employers Agency is involved. We hope the talks will come to a satisfactory conclusion but I assure the Deputy I am aware of the excellent work being done by this small, dedicated group of professionals and I am actively seeking a negotiated settlement.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The area within the health board where the services of speech therapists are being used has been extended.  There are language disorder units in a number of health board areas.  In the acute hospitals, speech therapists are being employed for patients who are recovering from strokes, for example. Trinity College is the only college that trains speech therapists.  There are probably vacancies because the supply is not sufficient to meet the demand.  There are also employment possibilities in the private sector.  In addition, right across the professions, many young people, particularly young women, like to travel for up to five years after qualification. Even though sufficient people are being trained to meet a perceived need, they do not all stay in the country.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this group was established by the Southern Health Board in May 1995 to review the organisation and delivery of accident and emergency services in Cork.  The group met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Mr. Stephen Cusack, accident and emergency consultant at Cork University Hospital.  The group completed its report in March 1996 and the draft report is currently being considered by the Southern Health Board.  I expect to receive a copy <Col N="774" /> of this report in the near future and I will then be in a position to examine the recommendations in detail.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When I read the question originally I was not sure of the Deputy's direction.  I understand there is a joint emergency plan in Cork, produced and published by the Cork joint emergency planning group on behalf of two divisions of the Garda Síochána, the Southern Health Board, Cork Corporation and the county council. The plan was issued for the guidance of personnel in organisations who may be involved in a major emergency, with the aim of providing a basis for standard procedures and co-ordinated effort. Those who read the Deputy's question and put the file together for me were under the misapprehension that the Deputy was referring to the Cork emergency plan and wanted social workers involved with the local authorities, the health boards and the Garda.  That is why the answer is vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now understand the Deputy is asking that in circumstances where a victim of family violence comes in the middle of the night to the accident and emergency department of an acute hospital there would be some level of counselling available, as well as a medical service.  We misinterpreted the Deputy's question, and I have not been briefed to answer it in the way I would have done.

In one case a child who was brought to the accident and emergency department with marks on the body passed through the system and was again back at that hospital with disastrous consequences.  It was felt that if a dedicated social worker were in place such an incident could have been avoided.  I will refer the particular case to the Minister privately because it is of an extremely serious nature which the Minister would want to investigate fully.</P>

    <P>The House will be aware that I announced last Thursday that the Government has finalised the national alcohol policy.  The policy will be available as a full policy report and also in <Col N="776" /> executive summary form.  Both documents are being printed and will be in general circulation shortly.</P>

I have indicated however, on the basis of expressed public concern about the issue, that I intend to discuss the matter with promoters and the industry.  My intention is to explore with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and the relevant organisations the potential for managing the promotion, packaging and sale of alcoholic fruit drinks so that they are not attracting underage drinkers.  The national alcohol policy cites research evidence from the World Health Organisation which confirms that advertising has a small but contributory impact on drinking behaviour.  The impact of alcohol advertising on pre-drinkers was shown to influence belief and intentions to drink as adults.  I believe that the Irish drinks industry is willing to play its part in protecting underage drinkers and I would like to have discussions with them at an early date on the range of strategies which might be appropriate. The national alcohol policy refers to the role of the non-statutory sector in encouraging moderate use of alcohol and such a joint approach between public and private agencies is the way forward at present.</P>
    <P>The national alcohol policy specifically draws attention to the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland.  It deals with issues around adults working with children and young people up to the age of 18 years in Irish sport.  This code was recently published by the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport, Deputy Bernard Allen.  A section on substance abuse outlines good practices in relation to alcohol use by sport leaders and coaches, alcohol <Col N="777" /> free under age functions and sponsorship. With regard to sponsorship, the code recommends that &ldquo;sports leaders in children's sport should refrain from seeking sponsorship from the alcohol and tobacco industries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The national alcohol policy highlights the lack of controls over sponsorship of sporting and cultural activities.  A voluntary code exists with regard to regulating the nature and administration of marketing techniques.  The Advertising Association of Ireland, together with the Chamber of Commerce, have developed guidelines for sponsorship agreements but no specific guidelines on alcohol sponsorship are defined for the non-broadcasting media.  The view expressed in the policy is that a firm but workable voluntary code of practice should be established with the alcohol industry.  I will monitor the response by industry and other key organisations to the policy's proposal.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the alcohol industry and the other organisations concerned will, in the light of the publication of the national alcohol policy, look closely at the issues surrounding sponsorship and promotion.</P>
    <P>The position of tobacco is quite different.  Sponsorship expenditure by tobacco companies in Ireland is controlled by law.  Since 1986, tobacco companies have not been allowed to increase their sponsorship spending in real terms, and in 1996 I imposed a cut of 5 per cent in the allowable budgets.</P>
    <P>The negotiations were carried out by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who has this responsibility as part of his portfolio.  I thank him for his very effective work in this area.  Further cuts in future years will be considered.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are one of the few countries in Europe that has succeeded in getting agreement at Government level for an alcohol policy. <Col N="778" /> It is part of the policy of the World Health Organisation that countries should produce alcohol policies.  What is in the document is the Government's current thinking on the position.  It does not contain recommendations for a complete ban on alcohol advertising. Consequently, it is not the policy of the Government to advocate such a course of action.  Any attempt to dramatically change practice in Ireland where alcohol is so central to social and economic life would have little chance of success. Anything which would move us down the prohibition road would be more likely to create resistance than to get the co-operation of the people involved. While I would continue to stress that the abuse of alcohol is a serious health issue, getting Irish people to practise more moderate drinking rather than excessive drinking is the way to proceed. Cahills are publishing the document. My note indicates I will have the documents produced in a proper form on Friday, that is tomorrow, and I will have both the full document and the executive summary circulated to Deputies as quickly as possible.  It would be appropriate that one of the committees of the House would take up the issue because the document contains a significant amount of research.  It is a much fuller document than was communicated by way of some of the high profile issues which were the subject of controversy in the media.</P>

      <P>In a few months the people will be asked to make a judgement on the performance of the parties in Government as we face into a general election.  I have no doubt, for a number of reasons which I will outline, that the parties in Government will be rejected on such issues as crime.  On a nightly basis we have the spectacle of hundreds of residents marching to force suspected drug pushers out of their homes and their areas while the Garda stand by and do traffic duty and the Minister for Justice does nothing.  The position so far as law and order and the drugs problem are concerned, where contract killings are a weekly occurrence, shows a lack of Government action on the crime issues and it will be judged accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the economy is booming, despite the efforts of this Government, unemployment continues to rise. This Government and the Ministers are more intent on PR exercises and announcing new jobs than trying to maintain existing jobs as we saw with Semperit and in South Tipperary last <Col N="938" /> week where 1,000 jobs were lost.  We see the failure of this Government in relation to Northern Ireland where there was an opportunity to build on the peace process and ensure that talks started at the end of last year.  We see its failure in relation to the BSE crisis, the plight of the farmers and the contempt with which their plight is being treated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, who apologised here last night to the rest of the world for Ireland producing beef. The Leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, also treats them with contempt. Yesterday I tabled the following question:</P>
    <P>To ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs the specific action, if any, he has taken to help alleviate the problems being faced by the farmers in this country due to the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>In this era of openness, transparency and accountability he did what he always does &mdash; he transferred it to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The Government will also be judged on the national debt.  Despite a booming economy our national debt is £1.5 billion higher with 11 per cent growth in public expenditure.  We also have residential property tax and water charges. For all these reasons the Government will be rejected.  Instead of the crime problem, the farming crisis and the Northern situation being handled properly, these office holders &mdash; they are not really a Government &mdash; hold on and sit there but do not make any decisions.  If for no reason other than the sale of 20 per cent of Telecom by means of this legislation, the damage being done to the telecommunications industry and the jobs potential of the industry, it should be kicked out of office as I believe it will when the taxpayer realises the full extent of what is going on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> We are being asked to agree to sell 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann for £183 million, a derisory sum.  We are also being asked to allow the Minister to sell up to 49 per cent of the shares in this company without requiring him to come back to the House.  What is this all about?  Telecom Éireann needs a strategic, global alliance to ensure that it has the best technology available to it and access to world markets in the years ahead but we are getting a consortium of moderate sized Dutch and Swedish regional players in a global market and nothing else.  They bring to the table none of the technological advances we require, yet they are being given a share in Telecom Éireann for a knockdown price by this three headed Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the profits and turnover of Telecom and relate them to the price at which the Government is giving this company away.  In 1994 Telecom had a turnover of £871 million with a profit of £80 million.  In 1985 that turnover had been increased to £979 million while in 1996 it had increased to £1,094 million with a profit of £200 million.  At the same time the company reduced its debt from £1,027 million to £718 million. Yet the Government is prepared to give away a 20 per cent stake in this company, which is worth at least £2 billion, for a derisory £183 million, with no technological advances and no improvements. On top of that, it is doing so at the expense of the worker directors in the company by reducing their representation by half.</P>
    <P>This is being done by a Government which comprises not only Fine Gael &mdash; a party that never had a feel for the semi-State sector &mdash; but our socialist brethren of various hues.  During the last general election the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, referred to the plight of the semi-State sector and shed copious tears at Dublin Airport while outlining what he and his party would do to save the semi-State sector.  What does this <Col N="940" /> proposal amount to?  It is national sabotage of a company of which we should all, rightly, be proud.  It is a profitable company at the cutting edge of technology not only in the telecommunications area but in Cablelink and the mobile telephone system.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and his Labour Party colleagues have agreed to halve the number of worker directors in Telecom and to give away 20 per cent of a £2 billion company for £183 million.  The figure should be at least £500 million. They are the wrong partners at the wrong time and this proposal does not meet a national need.</P>
    <P>As for Democratic Left, I am glad we are graced by the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  When I sat in the seat in which Deputy Rabbitte is now sitting, every day I listened to him pour scorn on anyone who even thought of touching a semi-State company. If I had the time to look through the Official Report I am sure I would find numerous quotations by him on the rights of worker directors, the need for them and how any Government which even suggested touching a semi-State company should resign on the spot. However, both he and his party leader have become comfortable and are part of the Establishment.  They no longer care about the issues of concern to the people who voted for them, they only care about staying in office.  They are not concerned about what the people want or what is good for the country, all they are concerned about is what will keep them in their soft seats.  If the Labour Party had one inch of backbone between all its members it would demand the withdrawal of this Bill. Instead, Labour Deputies will vote in favour of this Bill.  They are being driven by their Democratic Left colleagues in Government who have sold out on whatever principles they had in whatever guise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> As regards the companies which we are told will be the saviours of the telecommunications industry, the 9 July edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> stated that Telia was awaiting EU deregulation and that Swedish Telecom groups were looking abroad as competition mounted at home.  It went on to state that Telia had long been touted as a candidate for privatisation and that management saw flotation as the best answer to its capital needs, a view unanimously shared by industry observers.  It also stated that Telia had demanded a cash injection from the Government of up to 10 billion kroner which is equivalent to $1.49 billion over the next five or six years as it could no longer fund internally its entire capital requirements of around 12 billion kroner a year.  On the question of its loss of business, the report went on to state that it sought to compensate by doubling prices for local calls since 1993 but this has been more than offset by a 50 per cent fall in tariffs for long distance calls.  This is the company which is supposed to be the saviour of Telecom and our future.</P>
    <P>The fire sale of Telecom by this three headed Government shows very little confidence in Irish workers, funding and ability.  Why is the company being sold in this way when pension funds of £15 billion are available?  Some £6 billion of this is invested abroad and £240 million is invested in British Telecom and other communications companies.  Even if Telia is floated on the stock exchange Irish pension funds cannot buy into it here, rather they will have to wait until it is floated on the Swedish stock exchange and buy into Telecom Éireann indirectly through that stock exchange. The Labour and Democratic Left parties should be ashamed of themselves for suggesting this option.</P>
    <P>In its reports Forfás deals with the hopes of the telecommunications industry and states that effective use of advance communications could provide 40,000 jobs by the year 2010.  Many <Col N="942" /> thousands of jobs are already directly linked to telecommunications, for example, those in the financial services area and many other areas within the economy, and these would not be there only for the work of Telecom.  Yet this company is being given away by the Government.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a worker director of a semi-State company who stated that recognition of the role of the worker shareholder in Irish State industry through representation on the boards of State enterprises had made a unique contribution to the necessary changes achieved in recent years.  The letter continues that, in the light of such positive achievements, it is disturbing that a new Bill is being hastily rushed through the Dáil which will effectively deny worker shareholders in Telecom Éireann 50 per cent of their representation on the board of the company.  In terms of the role of worker directors, if nothing else, this should be enough for the Labour Party and Democratic Left to pull out of Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, laughs about the role of worker directors being reduced.  It is sad to see such principles being washed down the drain.</P>

It is sacrificing and sabotaging the efforts to improve the job potential of the telecommunications industry by linking with a company which is in the state I mentioned earlier. From a technology point of view the economy has nothing to gain from the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If part of the company is to be sold, Irish pensions funds, which hold Irish workers' money, should be allowed to invest in it.  If there is to be a strategic alliance, it should be with a major global company &mdash; I do not mean Cable and <Col N="943" /> Wireless &mdash; and not a regional player. The idea of the reduction in the role of worker directors in the company, a matter which appears to amuse the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>In the national interest the Bill should be withdrawn immediately.  However, irrespective of whether it is withdrawn, the damage to what is left of the reputations of the Labour Party and Democratic Left has been done.

      <P>That is typical of Deputy Burke.  Prior to the election, not one penny was available for Aer Lingus, but <Col N="944" /> the Labour Party in Government secured £175 million for the company. Changes have been made in Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus, but without the Labour Party in Government, the company might not exist today.  Perhaps some of Deputy Burke's colleagues would prefer it in a different form entirely.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate and in particular to have the opportunity to refute the allegations made by Deputy Brennan about my party earlier.  His hypocrisy, and that of his party, regarding the semi-State sector beggars belief.  In power, some in Fianna Fáil, if not all, planned the destruction of the semi-State sector. However, in Opposition, they all pretend to be its friend.  Whether it involves Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann or other State companies, it is not to Fianna Fáil that workers turn when problems arise.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party does not believe in sterile debates about public <i>versus</i> private ownership for their own sake. However, the best way a major utility can be made responsible to its customers rather than its shareholders is through State control.  An example is the privatisation of water supplies in Britain.  Those private companies are, in effect, private monopolies, answerable solely to their shareholders.  The proponents of privatisation continuously make their arguments by referring to the benefits to customers.  In Britain, where privatisation has been Government policy for almost 20 years, customers have arguably suffered as much as they have gained.  If the proponents of privatisation were open to rational argument, this experience might lead them to believe that a company's performance depends on broader issues than its ownership, public or private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the comments of Deputies Burke and Brennan, I wish to repeat the statement made by Mr. David Begg, the general secretary of the Communication <Col N="945" /> Workers' Union on 12 June 1996.  He said:</P>
    <P>We positively advocated the formation of a strategic alliance on terms which would allow the company to retain its position as the major telecommunications company in Ireland and a player on the international market. Our decision to become a proactive agent of change was motivated by a desire to influence that change in a manner which could afford the maximum protection to our members, the staff and the company.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling those comments.</P>
    <P>The Bill maintains State control of Telecom Éireann.  This is not an issue because for some time the Labour Party and the broader labour movement has supported the concept of a strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and another company.  The clear purpose of an alliance is to maximise the potential growth of Telecom Éireann by opening it up to co-operation with a major player in the global telecommunications market.  As the Minister pointed out earlier, the world of telecommunications is perhaps the most rapidly changing industry of all.</P>
    <P>In the last decade, Telecom Éireann has invested approximately £2 billion in our telecommunications infrastructure. This investment has provided a modern and advanced telecommunications system comparable to any in Europe.  As a result, our competitiveness in areas such as telemarketing has increased considerably as has the number of jobs in that sector, which is an important aspect. This development has been aided by recent price reductions of up to 60 per cent in the cost of Telecom Éireann's international services.  Undoubtedly, Deputies Brennan and O'Malley will say these reductions were prompted by competition within that section of the voice telephone market.  This is the case, but the competition was only made possible by the investment undertaken <Col N="946" /> by Telecom Éireann over the last decade. It is not unreasonable that the company should receive a return on it.  Furthermore, the company's financial assets for the year ended 30 March 1995 show that turnover increased by 12 per cent. Investment in network development, provided entirely from internal resources, totalled £172 million, some 76 per cent of customers, the highest number in Europe, are now connected to digital exchanges and operating costs have been reduced.  The workers in the company have made a major contribution to the changes that have taken place.</P>
    <P>Despite Telecom Éireann's improved performance there is no time to rest on our laurels.  Investment in telecommunications must be ongoing.  I have no doubt about Telecom Éireann's ability to compete or maintain market share in some sectors.  The Left does not fear competition.  The Labour Party has always advocated competition, but it must be on a level playing pitch.  In a global sense Telecom Éireann remains a small company.</P>
    <P>The proposed strategic alliance will guarantee the company access to the most efficient technology and practices in the industry.  To cement that alliance, the Government decided that KPN/Telia should take a 35 per cent share in the company.  I have no difficulty with this, although it is incidental to the main function of the strategic alliance.  I welcome in particular the decision to grant employees share ownership.  Securing an equity and becoming strategic partners &mdash; even in a small way &mdash; is the best means by which staff can protect their future.  The Minister stated that the Government was willing to set aside up to 5 per cent of share capital for the employee shareholding scheme, but the unions are seeking in excess of 10 per cent.  The Minister should ensure that negotiations on this issue are satisfactorily resolved as soon as possible.  The Government <Col N="947" /> recognises the importance of company share owning schemes for employees. Such schemes have proven successful in the past and are further proof that the success or failure of a company is about more than the rate of corporation tax or employers' PRSI.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan tried to type cast the Labour Party.  He accused us of privatising Telecom Éireann, but he knows that is nonsense.  It was amusing to listen to the contributions from the Fianna Fáil benches today because, at meetings of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, those Members put forward a case for privatisation and doing away with semi-State organisations. I had to fight Fianna Fáil Members tooth and nail on the question of liberalisation at a meeting of that committee.  They wanted complete liberalisation rather than the compromise reached by the Minister, although I thought he would have agreed a five year period for liberalisation rather than what he accepted.</P>
    <P>The main difference between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil is that we have a general interest in the welfare and ongoing viability of semi-State companies, many of which, despite all the rhetoric from the private sector, are our biggest and best companies.  The Labour movement is united on this issue.  The maintenance of Telecom Éireann as a major telecommunications sector and the protection of the universal service obligations, which should ensure equal access to new technology for all citizens, is what is at stake here.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil shed crocodile tears about the effects of the BSE crisis on rural communities.  It is ironic, therefore, that because of its connections with the business community it cares little about whether rural communities get the same service at the same cost as their fellow citizens in the larger towns and cities.  I am familiar with its views on that matter because of comments at meetings of the <Col N="948" /> Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  That is the essence of the universal service obligation and it must be protected.</P>
    <P>The sad reality for Deputy Brennan is that his efforts this morning will not wash with the workers of Telecom Éireann or any other semi-State organisation. People will not forget Fianna Fáil's attempt to sell part of Telecom Éireann to its friends in Cable and Wireless.  That was Fianna Fáil cynicism at its worst.  Cable and Wireless were perhaps the worst potential strategic partner for Telecom Éireann to enter into an alliance with as it did not have a significant base in Europe where Telecome Éireann has to operate and compete. Cable and Wireless were actively opposed by Telecom Éireann unions, particularly by the Communications Workers Union, whose role during the negotiations about the company's future has been an example of how a modern progressive union should conduct itself. The Labour Party had to block that sale. Thus, it was Fianna Fáil, not the Labour Party, that established the principle to sell a section of Telecom Éireann.  In so doing it alienated potential partners who wanted co-operation on areas of expertise and mutual interest only.  It is ludicrous for members of Fianna Fáil to crib at the outcome of this process.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to recent statements from the Communications Workers Union about a reduction from four to two in the number of worker directors in Telecom Éireann under the new arrangements.  I was pleased to hear the Minister state that he would be available for consultation and further discussion on this matter.  Perhaps he would table an amendment in that regard on Committee or Report Stage.  While I understand his reason for adopting this position, I urge him to do everything possible to resolve the matter.  I also urge him to deal with the question of board representation in a forthright manner.  To <Col N="949" /> date, he has done a good job in difficult circumstances.  The remaining issues can be resolved through further consultations. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It is not my intention to delay proceedings by repeating what has been said by others opposed to the Bill. It contains many questionable and, at first sight, unacceptable provisions which require the closest scrutiny and these have been highlighted by previous speakers such as Deputies Brennan and Burke.</P>
      <P>I listened to the debate, including the Minister's speech and that of the two Government speakers, but none of them justified the about face by certain Government parties from their previous opposition to any suggestion of privatisation of State-sponsored companies.  In the past, as Deputy Burke said, the slightest hint of privatisation of or a strategic partnership for a State company was totally opposed by the Labour element in the House.  Yet it is now proposed to sell off one of our most successful and best semi-State companies, Telecom Éireann, to foreign companies at a sacrificial price.  Even to a layman, the proposed cost of £183 million does not approach a reasonable fee for the company.  Irish State pension funds are prevented from participating in the purchase of this share, which is totally mystifying. Not only that, the worker directorships in the new company will be reduced by half.  This is a great change in the ideological thinking and philosophy of the Left in this Chamber.  There has been no justification of the change or of their willingness to accept the sale at such a low price that it amounts to a financial sacrifice for taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for an increase in charges by the new company not exceeding the inflation rate.  Surely such a provision is an open invitation to <Col N="950" /> increase prices when the customer is already over-charged for this service. Several items in today's media show evidence of this over-pricing.  Ireland has higher charges for local and internal trunk calls than the European average, the highest VAT rate and the highest telephone rental fee in Europe, the latter a staggering 40 per cent above the average of other EU countries.  It is total folly to openly advise the new company to increase its charges in line with the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Another flaw in the Bill is its provision for the sale of a further 29 per cent interest in the company without consulting the Dáil.  In a transaction as important as this the Dáil should be consulted and I fail to see the purpose of or motivation for including such a provision in the legislation.</P>
    <P>My specific interest in the Bill concerns the proposal to appoint a regulator for the issuing of licences for the transmission and retransmission of television services.  What impact will that have on the ongoing dispute between those who operate the deflector system and the Government, Cablelink and those who operate the MMDS system?  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is present as he has first hand knowledge of this matter.  In my constituency and those surrounding it, people operate deflector systems which are community-organised and non-profit making.  They were put in place by local communities when commercial interests such as cable companies failed to provide them with a television service that is available in other parts of the country.  They set up community committees to deliver the service.</P>
    <P>The system was deemed to be illegal in 1988 and that was the case even before that date.  However, it was tolerated because the system which was supposed to replace it, MMDS, was not in a position to give service in many areas <Col N="951" /> which used deflector systems.  My constituency is a case in point.  Those systems and the community organisations which run them have had a turbulent existence.  They have been threatened with suppression, were put off the air and brought to court but they still operate.</P>
    <P>A recent High Court decision in Cork appertaining to the deflector system stated that it was incumbent on the Minister to give fair consideration to the licensing of those systems.  It is not the fault of the operators of the system that they are not licensed since they have applied for licences.  The High Court decision also stated that assigning the provision of the service to one system, MMDS, without adequately and impartially considering the merits of the deflector system and its licensing, reflects partiality and unfairness.</P>
    <P>During the last Cork by-election the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the people of Cork that one of the first things he would do would be to have the system licensed.  I have gone into this in detail because I fear that appointing a regulator is a way of ducking what is clearly the Government's obligation to this matter.  As stated by a High Court judge, it has a clear obligation to consider impartially the probability of licensing deflector systems.  The Government should be honourable and meet that obligation by ensuring that licensing applications for those systems are impartially examined.  Technology has changed a good deal since 1988 &mdash; we are aware of the pace at which it is changing in the communications field &mdash; and what was not practicable then might well be practicable now.  There is a strong possibility that if this system were licensed it could provide a service of the highest standard to many parts of the country, particularly rural areas which are a major concern of mine.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will be honourable and deal with this issue <Col N="952" /> fairly and will not hide behind a regulator, who the Bill states will be a civil servant.  As such his or her judgment of this issue will be burdened with the antipathy in the Civil Service to the licensing of deflector systems.  The old arguments will be trotted out again and scant reference will be made to technological advances since the subject was last debated in 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Education for an immediate decision to approve the necessary funding to allow work commence on the urgently required extension for Loreto secondary school in Balbriggan which has served the town for more than 140 years.  The children of the area, those from Dublin and north Meath have benefited from the efforts of the nuns and the loyal teachers.</P>
      <P>In 1983 a new school was opened which was planned to accommodate 500 pupils.  Through the years the teachers have offered high quality progressive education for girls in the north Dublin-Meath area.  They introduced such initiatives as a transition year for all, technology, computer studies and two continental languages.  Their excellent examination results are testimony to the dedication and commitment of the teaching staff, which now comprises 55 teachers, including those with higher diplomas and part-time staff, and four nuns from the Loreto Order who still serve the community.  Very good results have been achieved by the students.  My daughter was educated in that school. The families of the students educated there, particularly those of the present students, need the support of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> The school built for 500 students today accommodates 930 and they face a number of serious difficulties.  There are only three science areas for five science teachers and only one home economics kitchen for three home economics teachers.  Consequently, science and home economics are regularly taught in classrooms and portacabins.  There is a curtailment of art facilities, technology facilities, a serious lack of toilet facilities and it is impossible to introduce necessary initiatives such as leaving certificate vocational programmes.</P>
    <P>The quality of the school surroundings must be of the highest standard as students have only one chance of second level education.  Experience has shown that the students have teachers of the highest quality, but they also need proper facilities.  The value of that school is shown by the fact that parents have chosen to send 930 students to the school, which was built for 500.  They deserve the Government's support.</P>
    <P>A board meeting is to be held on 8 October at which the architect will advise and, hopefully, the board will appoint a builder.  The position is at the pre-selective process.  I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment in the House this evening that he is prepared immediately to sanction the necessary funds to allow work commence on this badly needed extension, which would relieve the anxiety of parents, students, teachers and the community at large in north County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for raising this matter.  It gives me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the extension project at Loreto secondary school, Balbriggan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give some brief details of the background to this case.  Loreto secondary school is an all-girls school with a current enrolment of more than 900 students.  Accommodation at the school <Col N="954" /> comprises a converted building erected in 1907, a new building erected in 1984 and some prefabricated accommodation. In June, 1994 approval was granted for the provision of 1,144 square metres of permanent accommodation to bring the capacity of the school to 750 places.  Architectural planning of this extension is proceeding and approval was granted to the school authority in July to proceed to stage five of this project.</P>
    <P>The Department has also approved the provision of six portable classrooms to alleviate the short-term accommodation difficulties which have arisen as a result of the introduction of the transition year in September of this year. This accommodation has now been provided. I assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the need for additional accommodation at the school.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the architectural planning for this project is progressed as quickly as possible. However, the commencement of construction depends on the allocation to be made for post primary building purposes in 1997.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter I call on the Minister for Justice to deal with the growing problem of knife attacks and declare a temporary amnesty to facilitate the surrender of knives to the Garda.  Last Monday, I attended the launch of the &ldquo;Bin your Blade&rdquo; campaign.  Deputy Eoin Ryan made a large input into the organisation of that campaign and it was appreciated by a great many people.  There was a display of vicious and lethal knives, cleavers, machetes, daggers and blades at the launch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attending the launch were two families who have lost sons through knife attacks.  Both families lived in my Dublin South-Central constituency but have had to move, in one case to Enniscorthy. <Col N="955" /> The permission of the parents has been obtained to mention their names for the record.  They were Keith Wall and Glen Ward and they were victims of unprovoked and unreasoned attacks.  It is possible that only for the availability of such awful weapons both young men could be alive today.</P>
    <P>Surprisingly, no data or statistics are kept on knife attacks.  However, I have no doubt that the incidence of such attacks is especially high in my area of the city.  In many cases young people carry knives as appendages to highlight a macho or tough guy image.  We must send a clear signal that the carrying of these weapons is neither macho nor hard; it is stupid and criminal.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to heed the call of the &ldquo;Bin your Blade&rdquo; campaign and its supporters.  Gardaí, taxi men, bus drivers, bar staff, shop workers and security staff highlight the dangers they face from knife attacks.  The New York police have called knives the most insidious of all weapons and have said that knives are much more dangerous than guns.</P>
    <P>The crime correspondent of <i>The Sunday World,</i> Paul Williams, has written at length on the subject in the past and has done a great deal to highlight the problem. I congratulate the various people behind the campaign, especially Deputy Eoin Ryan.  I also wish to salute the pop groups Boyzone and OTT for endorsing the call and being publicly associated with it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to implement the following four point programme which the campaign has formulated: first, amend the definition of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, to &ldquo;any object carried for an unlawful purpose and capable of inflicting injury&rdquo;. Second, declare a two month amnesty for the surrender of such weapons and provide bins at Garda stations into which these knives can be surrendered. Third, introduce a prohibition on the sale of such weapons to those under 16 <Col N="956" /> years.  It is ridiculous that a 12 year old can purchase a knife and be arrested by a garda for being in possession of an illegal weapon, yet it not illegal to sell knives to youngsters under 18 years of age.  This must be examined immediately. Fourth, a register of those importing or selling sporting weapons should be established.  This should include an obligation to record details of sales and purchases.</P>
    <P>I have long advocated a zero tolerance attitude to crime.  As a society we must be seen to come down on all forms of criminal behaviour.  There is already a huge problem with drugs in our city. The growing vigilantism which we are witnessing is born out of frustration at seeing so many crimes go unpunished. We must take every opportunity we can to demonstrate our intolerance of criminal activity and use every sanction at our command.  This is one such opportunity. In the UK there have been many examples of these campaigns and they have succeeded in taking these dreadful weapons out of circulation.  I call on the Minister to move in this area where reform and enforcement are so badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I thank Deputy Briscoe for affording me the opportunity to reply to this important debate.  In accordance with the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, it is an offence to have a knife or any other article which has a blade, which is sharply pointed, in a public place unless the person has a good reason or lawful authority to have same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act amended and extended the Firearms Acts, 1925-71, to control the availability and provision of offensive weapons and other such articles.  It specifically prohibits first, the carrying of knives or articles which can be misused in a similar manner to knives in places of public entertainment or resort; <Col N="957" /> second, the carrying in any public place of flick-knives and weapons made or adapted to cause injury to intimidate; third, having an offensive weapon while trespassing on private property and fourth, producing an article capable of causing serious injury to intimidate in furtherance of a crime or during a fight or dispute.</P>
    <P>The Act is intended to prohibit the carrying of these articles in public places, for example, places of public entertainment or resort, where people normally have no legitimate reason to have them or where there is the greatest danger of their being misused.  The manufacture, importation, sale, hire or loan of a high range of offensive weapons is prohibited by section 12 of the Act and also by the Offensive Weapons Order, 1991, made under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of concerns raised by the Deputy and the public.  It is a complex issue which needs careful consideration both by the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities. The points made by the Deputy are noted and will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have imagined that Governments of whatever complexion would by now have learned certain lessons in transparency and parliamentary accountability, especially where paedophile priests are concerned and bearing in mind that Ireland has experienced a range of scandals involving the mistreatment of children at State institutions such as Madonna House and Goldenbridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised, therefore, to read in a national newspaper on 18 September that the Minister for Justice had apparently appointed a retired judge to inquire into serious allegations that vulnerable youths were passed from State care into the control of a paedophile priest who was jailed earlier this year for committing offences against <Col N="958" /> boys.  I question whether this represents the proper legacy of the bitter political experiences of the past.  What level of transparency is there in secretly establishing such an informal inquiry into such serious allegations?  What prompted its establishment?  When were these matters brought to the attention of the Minister and her Department? What are the terms of reference of this so-called informal inquiry?  What powers, if any, has the retired judge to interview witnesses?  What records will be made available to him?  What findings can he make?  To whom will he report those findings?  The question arises whether he can make any findings at all in the light of the case <i>In re</i> Haughey. Is it in the public interest that an investigation into serious allegations in relation to public affairs be handled in this way at all?</P>
    <P>These are extremely serious allegations. If such awful things happened to vulnerable children while in State care, an appalling vista of State neglect and possibly liability against the State arises.  It is outrageous that such matters should be dealt with in this manner.  Is it true that one victim has issued proceedings for compensation against the State for the abuse he allegedly suffered while in the care of a State institution? Is it true that an employee of the Probation and Welfare Service has been suspended in relation to this matter?</P>
    <P>It is reported that the inquiry centres around allegations by a number of former residents of State-run institutions in the Waterford/Kilkenny area dating from at least the early 1980s.  There have been detailed accounts of rape and other sexual abuse.  There have been allegations by one former resident of an institution that he was sexually abused by two Catholic clergymen and a lay social worker in Dublin and at a State-run institution in Waterford where he had been placed on probation.</P>
    <P>There is a further report that the State ceded control of one victim to the priest in 1985, allowing the priest to allegedly abuse him over a ten year period. After a brief court appearance this <Col N="959" /> allegedly abuse him over a ten-year period. After a brief court appearance this year that priest was sentenced.  It is reported that statements were taken, not shown to the court, indicating that this priest had been afforded liberal access to State institutions, including one probation hostel and St. Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.  That report goes on to say that not only were complaints about abuse ignored by the authorities but that there were grounds for believing that the authorities had suspected there was a risk to residents.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state whether this informal inquiry is confined to one individual case involving the Probation and Welfare Service or if it has a wider brief?  Is there a Garda investigation continuing?  The very fact that this highly unusual informal inquiry has been established by the Minister would appear to indicate that these serious allegations could be true.  The fact that the priest in question has been sentenced for similar crimes lends weight to the veracity of the allegations.  That being the case, it is highly inappropriate that such a serious matter should be dealt with in a secretive, almost private, manner by the Minister and Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Serious issues of public accountability are involved.  When similar matters arose in relation to treatment by the health services in the Kilkenny incest case, the then Minister for Health established an inquiry team whose terms of reference were announced and whose report was subsequently published.</P>
    <P>It is highly inappropriate that a retired judge should be asked to preside over such an informal inquiry, without any terms of reference having been revealed, with ill-defined powers to carry out a full investigation.  I await the Minister of State's revealing whatever information he has to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I thank Deputy O'Donnell <Col N="960" /> for having raised this matter and affording me an opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>The Minister welcomes the opportunity to outline to the House her reasons for holding an examination into allegations made during a recent criminal trial.  During the trial of a person charged with the sexual abuse of young persons, the Minister was gravely concerned about allegations made against the Probation and Welfare Service. Newspaper reports indicated that one of the victims in this case had made complaints of sexual abuse to a probation officer and that the officer had failed to report the matter.</P>
      <P>On foot of these reports the Minister appointed a retired judge in early August to carry out an independent informal examination into allegations made by the victim in this case about probation officers' failure to report sexual abuse allegations which the victim had made.  He is also examining media statements indicating that the accused was well known to the Probation and Welfare Service to ascertain if this is factual and the basis on which referrals, if any, were made to the accused in the past.  He will examine the relationship and contacts that the accused had with the Probation Hostel, Lady Lane, Waterford and will report and make recommendations on these matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to allegations that the accused was well known to the Probation Service, the Minister wishes to explain that it is normal practice for the Probation and Welfare Service to refer persons under their supervision to workshops and day centres.  One such workshop was run by the accused.  The Probation Hostel, Lady Lane, is funded by the Department of Justice and is managed by an independent management committee on which the Probation and Welfare Service is represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this examination is to establish whether there were any short-comings in the Probation and Welfare <Col N="961" /> Service's handling of the matter and, if required, to recommend updated procedures for handling future cases of this nature.  The judge's examination is ongoing and the Minister understands that a number of people have been invited to private discussions with him on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that the House will agree that the right course, once she became aware of these grave allegations, was to have them independently examined without delay.  The Minister will take any necessary action following examination of the report.</P>

      <P>The recent oil spillage on the east coast highlights our vulnerability to any accident occurring at sea. Although this was termed a small oil leak it gave us some idea of the damage that would be done if it had been a much larger one.  It involved a large bird kill and severe damage to our ecological system.</P>
      <P>Various non-governmental agencies have asked me to raise their frustration at the fact that, while everybody wanted to do something about this most recent spill, once it had occurred they discovered there was no co-ordination between the various groups on how to minimise the damage.  They seek an inter-agency response to such accidents and are concerned that, in the case of a very serious accident, lack of co-ordination might well be catastrophic.</P>
      <P>They recommend that some type of emergency plan be put in place so that whenever such an accident occurs each agency will know precisely what are its responsibilities, ranging from the Department of the Marine to local authorities, non-governmental agencies and other groups who may wish to be involved so that any damage can be minimised and birds and other wildlife safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I am most concerned about the illegal oil spillage at the weekend.  I am determined to ensure that every effort is made to track down whoever is responsible for this appalling act of vandalism.  This Government is committed to the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle whereby persons responsible for pollution are liable for the costs associated with it.  The penalties for pollution at sea range from £1,000 to £10 million depending on the seriousness of the crime.</P>
      <P>Ireland is party to the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund &mdash; IOPCF &mdash; a world-wide intergovernmental organisation set up to provide compensation for pollution damage resulting from oil spills from tankers. The IOPCF operates within the framework of two international Conventions, namely, the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage &mdash; known as the CLC convention &mdash; and the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage &mdash; known as the Fund Convention.</P>
      <P>The CLC Convention deals with the liability of shipowners for pollution damage.  This convention lays down the principle of strict liability for shipowners and creates a system of compulsory liability insurance.  The shipowner is normally entitled to limit his liability to an amount which is linked to the tonnage of his ship.  The Fund Convention, which is supplementary to the CLC Convention, establishes a system of compensation for victims when the compensation under the CLC Convention is inadequate.  In cases where the polluter cannot be identified but where it can be proven to the satisfaction of the IOPCF that the pollution has been caused by a tanker, the IOPCF will pay compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department was notified of a <Col N="963" /> possible oil pollution incident near the Burford Bank in Dublin Bay.  IMES immediately activated the oil spill response contingency plan.  There is an emergency plan for dealing with oil pollution incidents and that is co-ordinated by IMES.  I will explain how that was activated over the weekend.  All relevant agencies were advised of the report.  The Air Corps was requested to deploy a helicopter to survey the area. Following confirmation that an oil spillage had occurred all relevant local and harbour authorities were asked to activate their contingency plans and to report on the extent of the pollution in their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Because no report of accidental oil discharge had been received it must be assumed the pollution resulted from an illegal discharge which had occurred during the night of 20-21 October. Using computer modelling and tracing the path of the discharge, IMES estimated the possible area within which the discharge had taken place and endeavoured to contact any vessels which might have been in the area during the night.  A marine notice was issued requesting all shipping to report any sighting of oil pollution.  Dublin Air Traffic Control was requested to have all passing aircraft monitor the area.</P>
    <P>IMES arranged a meeting of all response agencies and interested parties which included Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the harbour authorities, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  Aerial surveillance missions on Saturday by IMES revealed a number of pollution spots at sea and on the coastline from Howth to Killiney. Further aerial surveillance missions on Sunday revealed only one oily patch at <Col N="964" /> sea, south of Bray Head.  Much of what was originally thought to have been oil at sea and on the coastline was in fact dark, harmless algae, and the remainder of the oil appeared to have dispersed.</P>
    <P>Inspections on the shoreline on Sunday by IMES and Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council revealed minor oil pollution at Coliemore Harbour, Bullock Harbour, Dún Laoghaire Coal Harbour and Killiney Beach.  In Dún Laoghaire, the western corner of the coal harbour was boomed and the contaminated material removed.  Notices were placed at the beaches at Vico, Killiney, Corbawn and Quinn's Point advising the public of the possibility of oil contamination.  Up to 600 oiled birds have been recovered for treatment.  This aspect of the response was co-ordinated by the Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board has reported no trace of oil in Dublin Port. Onshore inspections carried out by the local authorities reveal that no further oil has come ashore and that very little residue is left in the affected areas.  The affected areas are being cleared by natural process and no intervention has been required.</P>
    <P>Samples of the oil pollution have been taken by the Fisheries Research Centre of the Marine Institute which can be used for prosecution purposes if the identification of the polluter can be ascertained.  IMES and the local authorities are continuing to monitor the situation on the beaches and at sea.  I will keep this matter under close review.  I assure the Deputy I will do everything in my power to ensure that the individuals responsible for this crime will be brought to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The strategy to deal with cardiac surgery waiting lists has been to provide additional facilities and infrastructure within the public hospital service to increase annual activity.</P>
      <P>To date this strategy has resulted in: an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed at the Mater Hospital where the annual activity for open heart operations has been increased by 250 per year to 1,000 per year; an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed to Cork University Hospital to increase the output from 200 to 400 open heart operations per year.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of this action will be to increase annual activity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital service to 1,400 per year, an increase of 47 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to further expand the public hospital capacity for cardiac surgery. I am fully committed to the provision of additional capacity including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public hospital system over the next two to three years.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high-cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.  In the interim my Department is engaged in the purchase of cardiology and cardiac surgery procedures from health care organisations at prices which are reasonable and affordable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of the longer term requirements for cardiac surgery is under way.  One of the matters to be considered, as part of this examination, is the location of the additional capacity within the public hospital system.  Four hospitals, i.e. the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, St. James's Hospital, Cork <Col N="783" /> University Hospital and University College Hospital Galway were asked to tender for this work.</P>
    <P>The four tenders are being examined by a group specially convened to produce a report on how cardiac surgery for public patients could be expanded by 500 cases annually.  The unit price per operation, capital costs required to provide infrastructure, etc, are among the factors which are being examined as part of this appraisal.  This group has been directed to report to me by the end of 1996.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The health risk from exposure to ionising radiation from whatever source is dependent on the amount and levels of exposure.  Nuclear radiation levels are associated with man-made sources such as nuclear power production, atmospheric nuclear testing and release of radionuclides into the environment from single events such as nuclear accidents.  Other exposures are received from medical radiation procedures, but the doses administered are carefully balanced so that the benefit to the patient far outweighs the risks involved.</P>
      <P>Excessive exposure to very high levels of nuclear radiation can have adverse health effects such as radiation sickness and longer term effects such as thyroid cancer and leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for monitoring radiation levels in the State.  Its studies show that contamination levels here are low and are not considered to give rise to a significant health hazard.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy may recall that I recently asked the Galway Hospice Foundation and the Western Health Board to enter into discussions on mutually acceptable uses for the in-patient facility in the purpose built hospice building.  To this end, I allocated a sum of £100,000 to the board to enable negotiations to proceed on a substantive basis.</P>
      <P>Following on from these negotiations, I have been informed by the Western Health Board that the Galway Hospice Foundation is prepared to open this in-patient facility on 1 December 1996, subject to confirmation from the board regarding ongoing funding.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I must remind the Deputy that the issue of the required level of funding for the hospice is a matter in the first instance for discussion between the foundation and the health board; and then, if appropriate, between the health board and my Department.</P>
      <P>The Galway Hospice Foundation has stated that it is willing to provide services in the wider palliative care area. This statement represents a positive step towards the integration of this fine in-patient facility with the Western Health Board's policy for palliative/ hospice care in the region and I look forward to an early outcome of the ongoing discussions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I intend to take Questions Nos. 15, 33 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service was published in November 1993.  The group, in its report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and Fire Service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnel are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the fire service personnel or indeed the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993. The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the <Col N="786" /> Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a range of productivity/efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity and flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication, in December 1993, of the report of the review group on the ambulance service which heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which had not been addressed in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from this, a set of proposals was agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995 SIPTU advised that the proposals had been rejected.  A number of meetings have been held since then to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion.  An intensive series of discussions have taken place in the last few months in which progress has been made on a number of the outstanding issues.  It is anticipated that one further meeting will be held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in the coming weeks at which it is anticipated the small number of remaining issues can be fully resolved.  With the monetary aspects of this deal already agreed, my Department is anxious to finalise the details of the productivity and flexibility measures at an early date.</P>

    <P>The collaborative study group on medical manpower was established in 1991.  The group produced a discussion document entitled &ldquo;Medical Manpower in Acute Hospitals&rdquo; which was published in June 1993 and has become known as the Tierney report.  This report analysed the existing medical manpower position and put forward a series of proposals for change.  The discussion document led to a wide-ranging debate on the issues raised.  This debate culminated in a consultative conference held in Limerick in March of this year. Officers of my Department are analysing the response to the Tierney report and the outcome of the Limerick conference. Some further analysis needs to <Col N="788" /> be undertaken and some further consultation is required before a new discussion document, which should contain specific proposals for change, can be produced.  I hope to be in a position to announce firm proposals before the end of 1996.</P>

I explained to them that the Government had not yet had an opportunity to consider the full implications of the report but that I expected the Minister for Finance would be making a submission to Government on the report shortly.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Before I came into office, the difficulties in the accident and emergency services were dealt with mainly by a series of once off measures. I was anxious that a more comprehensive and integrated approach be adopted and I have previously set out in this House the successful measures which were put in place for the winter of 1995-96.  The successful management of accident and emergency departments involves tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and the management of services provided by the acute hospitals themselves.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has carried out a detailed survey on bed utilisation in the six accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin with a view to identifying how admission and discharge policies can be improved to ensure a more effective service to patients.</P>
      <P>I have asked officials of my Department, in association with the Eastern Health Board, which chairs a steering committee responsible for the co-ordination of the accident and emergency services in Dublin, to review the position regarding the accident and emergency service in Dublin for the winter of 1996-97.  Membership of the committee is comprised of the managers and chief executives, accident and emergency consultants and nursing staff representatives of each of the six major Dublin accident and emergency hospitals.  It is my intention that as in the winter of 1995-96 a successful integrated programme of action can be put in place for the winter of 1996-97.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Precise medical diagnosis of asthma can often be problematic, and the term is frequently used to cover a range of respiratory conditions including bronchitis. In addition, asthma is not a notifiable disease.  For these reasons, national figures on the prevalence of asthma in the community are not available.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new public health departments in the health boards, with their emphasis on epidemiology, will greatly improve the level and quality of information on all diseases and conditions, including asthma, in each local area.  Accordingly, I have no plans to establish a national asthma register.</P>
      <P>The results of a three-year study of asthma funded by the Health Research Board as part of an EU concerted action programme are currently being finalised prior to publication.  Provisional results indicate an increase in asthma prevalence rates in the Dublin area between 1991 and 1995.  It was not possible to ascertain trends in rural prevalence rates since the study of rural areas was confined to 1993.  After controlling for age structure, smoking and other factors, no significant difference was found between urban and rural prevalence rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Research Board is also involved in an international collaborative research project on asthma called ISAAC, International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Children.  The Irish component of the study is based on a representative survey of more than 3,000 school children throughout the country aged 13 to 14 years.  Preliminary results were presented at the European <Col N="791" /> Respiratory Society Annual Congress, Stockholm, Sweden in September this year.  Based on preliminary figures, the results suggest an increasing prevalence with a current rate of 15.2 per cent in this age group, but show no significant difference between urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Further research, carried out under the auspices of the Department of Respiratory Medicine in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, obtained an estimate of 5.0 per cent prevalence of Irish adults who had physician diagnosed asthma and 2.2 per cent receiving active treatment for PDA.  No significant inter-county differences were observed.  The results, based on a postal questionnaire, were published in the Journal of the Irish College of Physicians and Surgeons in October 1994.  The relatively low response rate obtained for this survey, (43 per cent), makes it difficult to interpret these results with a high degree of confidence.</P>
    <P>In a recent study of asthma in the 4-19 year old age group, published in the January-February 1996 issue of the <i>Irish Medical Journal,</i> a prevalence rate of 11.9 per cent is reported.  This compares with a rate of 4.4 per cent from a similar study conducted in 1983-1984. The prevalence of asthma was not found to be significantly different between urban and rural areas in this age group.</P>
    <P>National results from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, HIPE, can be used to compute asthma hospitalisation rates by age group and urban/rural area of residence. An analysis of the figures for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995 indicate a concentration of asthma prevalence in the 0-14 years age-group and there is some evidence of an increased rate of hospitalisation for urban areas.  No overall trend in rates over the three years is evident.</P>
    <P>The above studies, together with other international studies, would <Col N="792" /> appear to suggest an increased prevalence of asthma.  This research would also suggest that the reported increase in prevalence may be due to some extent to earlier recognition of symptoms by clinicians and a relabelling of other respiratory symptoms.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £56.58 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-1996 which has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,300 day care places.</P>
      <P>Respite services are provided in a variety of ways; for example through the use of dedicated respite beds, residential places vacated by residents returning to their families at weekends and the use of other residential places as and when available.  Responsibility for the respite care scheme was transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to my Department at the start of 1995.  Funding of £500,000 was made available in each of the years 1995 and 1996 to provide grants to agencies and organisations to provide respite care. This scheme is administered through the health boards.</P>
      <P>The national mental handicap database collects figures on the number of people in receipt of a service rather than the number of beds available.  Provisional data indicate that the number of people in respite and residential placements in July was as follows:</P>

    <P>The issue of funding for the home help service has been raised a number of times in the recent past.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.  A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officer group forms the basis for this examination.</P>
    <P>Following on from these discussions, I have decided to have an examination of the operation of the home-help service carried out by an independent body which will advise on measures to ensure the equity and high quality of the service in respect of providers and recipients. I am pleased to say that my Department has invited tenders for this review.  It is expected that the review should be completed in three to four months.</P>

Central Statistics Office figures &mdash; provisional &mdash; for drug related deaths in 1995 provide details on the number of deaths which were drug related, but they do not always differentiate between legal and illegal drugs.  In addition, in some cases, death certificates issued by medical practitioners may list the clinical cause of death, rather than the circumstances which led to the death, which will not then be recorded in the &ldquo;drug related deaths&rdquo; category.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures supplied by the Central Statistics Office show that in 1995 15 deaths were caused by morphine type drugs, five by barbiturate type, one by cannabis, one by hallucinogens, and two by psychostimulants, which include ecstasy.  There are, as yet, no figures available for 1996.  The Health Research Board, in compiling these figures, will be working closely with the Central Statistics Office and other agencies in an attempt to produce more definitive information.</P>

      <P>This statement arose from a series of discussions which were held in the light of the failure of a number of groups in the public service to reach agreement on restructuring under clause 2 (iii) (a) of the Public Service Agreement on Pay, incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The statement also outlined the development of a framework aimed at achieving the continuation and successful completion of a number of outstanding sets of discussions. I immediately met with the nursing unions to ask them to consider their position in relation to the proposed new framework with a view to resolving the concerns of nurses in a positive way.</P>
      <P>Arising from that meeting a further series of discussions took place with the nursing unions.  As provided for within the framework, the parties agreed to refer the outstanding issues to adjudication. Both sides entered this adjudication process on the understanding that it represented the final stage of processing of the nurses' claim.  Submissions were made to the Adjudication Board on 22 July 1996.  The findings by the Adjudication Board on these issues were issued to management and unions on Monday, 23 September.</P>

    <P>Following a final meeting between the management and union sides yesterday, the unions have recommended the revised proposals for positive consideration by their members.  Their positive response is most welcome and I hope that this new package will meet with the <Col N="798" /> approval of nurses throughout the country. Subject to an early and positive outcome to a ballot to be conducted by the unions, it is my intention that the pay awards proposed be implemented at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The number of cases of meningitis notified to my Department to date in 1996 is 276 cases of bacterial meningitis and 50 cases of the less serious viral meningitis.  The number of deaths reported is 11.  The establishment of a communicable disease surveillance unit is being considered in the context of related developments, for example, the proposed joint North-South Institute of Public Health.</P>
      <P>While no specific money has been allocated by my Department for research into meningitis the expert group which I set up to make recommendations relating to the diagnostic, surveillance and preventive aspects of our approach to meningitis is, I understand, also looking at the area of research.  I expect to receive their report in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards public information I will outline the steps which I have taken to raise awareness of meningitis.  Earlier <Col N="799" /> this month I gave an interview to the national media to alert parents, the public at large and doctors of the importance of being extra vigilant for meningitis. I have issued press <i>Facts on Meningitis</i> to the national media.  My Department's health promotion unit has distributed a revised meningitis leaflet to the health boards.  A new leaflet for general practitioners is also being distributed to the health boards.</P>
    <P>This month the chief medical officer of my Department wrote to the directors of public health, on my behalf, requesting them to take all necessary measures to ensure that the highest possible level of awareness among professionals, parents and the wider public is maintained especially during the winter months.  The directors were also asked to circulate the press <i>Facts on Meningitis</i> to the provincial media and to consider what additional public information initiatives were required and decide what specific measures need to be taken in their areas.  In addition health boards were requested to liaise with parental groups working to raise awareness of meningitis to facilitate a co-ordinated approach.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand that the statement made by the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission was made in a personal capacity and it is one with which I disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government announced a package of <Col N="800" /> measures on 21 February 1996 aimed at reducing the demand for drugs. Included in these measures was a decision that there should be no relaxation in the current laws relating to the possession and consumption of controlled drugs.  The Government has, therefore, no plans to change the legal position in relation to such drugs including heroin.</P>
    <P>The demand reduction measures announced by the Government are aimed, <i>inter alia,</i> at informing young people about drugs through a series of drug education and prevention measures.  These include: the development of education and prevention programmes in conjunction with the Department of Education and other relevant agencies; a multi-media awareness and prevention campaign with the message &ldquo;drugs destroy lives&rdquo;; and the launching of information and awareness campaigns aimed at young people and their parents which focus on the dangers of drugs misuse.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy is aware funding has been made available for projects under the Community Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the six Border counties of Ireland and the Interreg 11 Resource Development Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Community Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation, funding is provided for projects under a number of headings.  Applications by health boards for funding fall under measures 3 (a) and 3 (b) which promote the adoption of co-ordinated approaches by public <Col N="801" /> bodies to common problems.  Applications for funding are co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Health boards submitted their proposals under the aegis of Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT), a cross Border initiative undertaken by four boards; the North-Eastern and North-Western Health Boards and the Western and Southern Health and Social Services Boards.  I am very satisfied with the number and quality of projects submitted by health boards and I should add that in the first round of grant approvals which took place in July six out of eight proposals submitted by CAWT were approved for funding.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment has the lead role for the INTERREG II Human Resource Development Programme, Training and Education.  Health boards submitted six projects for funding under the programme earlier this year, three of which were successful.  As with the projects submitted under the Community Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation I am very satisfied with the number and quality of projects submitted by health boards for funding under the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, requires health boards to take such <Col N="802" /> steps as are reasonable to provide accommodation for homeless children up to 18 years of age.  In preparation for the commencement of section 5, special funding was made available in 1991 and 1992 for the development of new services and facilities for homeless children. Since 1993 the Government has approved the development and expansion of child care and family support services, including the further expansion of services and facilities for the young homeless, at a cost of £35 million on an annualised basis.</P>
    <P>It is recognised across the health boards that an integrated range of measures is necessary in order to deal with the problem of youth homelessness. A number of solutions are required.  These include early childhood intervention to prevent children at risk from becoming homeless, greater provision of services for families and young people in the community, the provision of suitable and varied accommodation and back up services for young homeless people and accommodation and support services for children leaving care.</P>
    <P>The extent and nature of the problem of homeless children varies between health boards and between community care areas.  Health boards are at present undertaking a series of initiatives to address the problem locally and the responses are drawn up with due regard to the particular nature of the problem in these areas.  These services include the provision of emergency short-term places, emergency carer's projects, day projects for children who would otherwise be roaming the streets, supported lodgings, supervised accommodation and social work services.</P>
    <P>Each board has in place arrangements to facilitate access to its services by out of home children in emergency situations.</P>

      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tables.  I would point out, however, that the April <Col N="804" /> 1995 guidelines concerning the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and Garda require health boards to formally notify the Garda of all cases where they suspect that a child has been physically or sexually abused or wilfully neglected and not just those cases where abuse has been confirmed.  My Department has information on the number of cases notified to the Garda only since the introduction of the guidelines and this information is supplied in table 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>Since the allowance is intended as a recognition of the additional burden involved in caring for severely disabled children, it does not apply to children who live away from home while attending special schools or other institutions. At present there is no provision for a <i>pro-rata</i> payment in respect of children who are in residential care for part of the week.  However, if parents are experiencing financial hardship in caring for disabled children while they are at home they may apply to the health board for a supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The question of income support is one of the areas which has been covered by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to domiciliary care allowance will be reviewed in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>More than 200 submissions were received on the issues raised in the discussion document &ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo; and over 400 people participated in the conference which I hosted earlier this month.  I was very pleased with the extent of the response to the discussion document and the quality of the submissions received.  As might be expected, those who participated in the consultative process reflected the broad range of views on the complex issue of mandatory reporting.  The submissions and the views expressed at the conference reflected a spectrum of opinion, but the majority expressed reservations or opposition to mandatory reporting. There was widespread agreement that further development of our child care services is required to ensure that children and professionals can report abuse in the knowledge that appropriate investigations, treatment and support services are available to victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments surrounding mandatory reporting of child abuse are complex and concern such issues as the most effective use of resources, professional judgment, the types of abuse that should be subject to mandatory reporting and who should become mandated reporters.  It is because of the complexity and importance of these issues that I have engaged in a lengthy consultation process on the subject.  In coming to a decision in relation to improving arrangements for the reporting of child abuse, I will be assisted by the outcome of the consultation process, in particular by the submissions made in response to <Col N="810" />&ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo;, by the presentations made at the forum and by the input from the workshops at the forum. Detailed work analysing the conclusions of these workshops is under way.</P>
    <P>As I announced at the conference on 16 September, I will be making a decision in relation to mandatory reporting of child abuse by the end of the year.</P>

Accordingly, by law, the board is required to fix the amounts of its premiums to ensure that, after making proper allowance for reserves, depreciation and similar purposes, revenues are only sufficient to meet its costs.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, I received notification from the board of the VHI of its intention to increase premium charges to subscribers by 6 per cent with effect from 1 September 1996.  I am satisfied that the increase of 6 per cent is consistent with the board's statutory responsibilities relating to the fixing of premiums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment procedures followed by health boards in investigating alleged cases of child sexual abuse are in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Health.  Sexual abuse, as distinct from other forms of abuse, has particular features which require special attention and the child abuse guidelines set out a number of issues which must be borne in mind in such cases.  Procedures for the assessment of child sexual abuse are reviewed internally within health boards on a regular basis as part of the overall management of child care services.  As with the child abuse guidelines in general, any formal review at departmental level will have to await the outcome of the current debate on the mandatory reporting of child abuse as a decision to introduce such reporting arrangements would fundamentally alter the context in which such a review would take place.  I will be taking a decision in relation to mandatory reporting before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been made aware of any particular problems with regard to the current procedures for the assessments of alleged cases of child sexual abuse. Since 1993, additional resources totalling £35 million have been invested in the development of child care services. All health boards availed of this funding to strengthen their community care teams to protect children from abuse and specific measures were undertaken to improve services to assess the alleged victims of child sex abuse.  These included the expansion of services at the child sex abuse units at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street Hospital and Waterford Regional and <Col N="812" /> the development of the child abuse unit at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork.</P>
    <P>At present, parents and guardians are entitled to seek a second opinion on the results of the assessment process.  I do not consider that a formal appeals mechanism would be appropriate as the assessment procedure is one which involves the formation of a professional judgement or opinion and it is not an administrative function.  In addition, if a case goes to court, the court procedure provides an appeals mechanism in its own right.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome as it is otherwise known, is the subject of widespread international research in a range of medical and scientific disciplines with a view particularly to elucidating its cause which is at present unknown.  The Department of Health, and indeed the medical profession in general in this country, monitor this research with a view to incorporating any new proven findings in their diagnosis and management of this difficult condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, the Health Research Board is the main mechanism through which public funding for health research is channelled.  Although the board is not currently engaged in funding a research project in the field of myalgic encephalomyelitis, the board considers all applications for funding and allocates funding to projects on a competitive basis subject to the board's peer review process whereby experts in the field assess the merits of each individual project. <Col N="813" /> Any person or body seeking funds to enable research to be undertaken in the field of myalgic encephalomyelitis should submit a proposal to the board.</P>
    <P>Since ME is not a notifiable disease, national figures on the incidence of this condition are not routinely available. International studies based on survey techniques have not proved reliable estimates of prevalence due primarily to the lack of consensus regarding positive diagnosis of ME.  Statistics on hospitalisation include a diagnosis category of &ldquo;Unspecified Encephalitis&rdquo; which accounted for 46 cases in 1995. However, it should be noted that most cases of ME do not require hospitalisation and, furthermore, that &ldquo;Unspecified Encephalitis&rdquo; may include other forms of encephalitis in addition to ME.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for a system for the supervision and inspection of pre-school services.  New regulations are required to secure the health, safety and welfare and promote the development of children attending pre-school services.

The regulations will apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, creches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy has been received from the Western Health Board and is set out on the following table.</P>
      <P>I have stated on previous occasions that I do not consider the level of orthopaedic services currently being provided to the patients in the Western Health Board area to be sufficient.  The demand for this service continues to grow and is influenced by a number of factors which are outside the direct control of the health board, such as an increasingly elderly population, changing lifestyle patterns and advances in the specialty itself.</P>
      <P>In response to the problem of growing waiting lists, my Department allocated a sum in excess of £700,000 to the Western Health Board in 1995, which included moneys to target outpatient waiting times in orthopaedics.  As a result of this investment, the board was able to provide an additional 2,365 out-patient assessments/procedures to patients in the western region, bringing the total number of outpatients seen in that year to 15,718.  I understand from the board that an additional orthopaedic consultant took up duty in January 1996, and that this will have a positive impact on outpatient cover.  The board has further informed me that it is continuing to examine practical ways of alleviating the current situation, such as employing an additional locum orthopaedic surgeon.</P>
      <P>With regard to a solution to excessive waiting times in the longer term, the Deputy will recall that I gave approval last year for the inclusion of an orthopaedic unit in Phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital.  This planned development, which will consist of extensive theatre and inpatient facilities for orthopaedic patients, will also allow the Western Health Board to assess 1,400 new patients annually at outpatient clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the developments I have outlined above will help reduce the current excessive waiting times for outpatients in this specialty and enable <Col N="878" /> the Western Health Board to provide an improved level of service to patients in that region.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The appointment of medical consultant staff to health board hospitals is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards in the first instance.  Health boards must, in turn, obtain the approval of Comhairle na n-Ospidéal for each and every medical consultant appointment.  Comhairle na n-Ospidéal is the regulatory authority in relation to the number and type of medical consultant posts in public hospitals.  Once Comhairle na n-Ospidéal approves a post, arrangements are made through the Local Appointments Commission to interview candidates. Generally, replacement medical consultant posts are approved without delay.  However, the appointment of new/extra medical consultants is governed by the availability of funding and the priorities for new developments throughout the health service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Palliative care is the continuing active care of patients and their families at a time when the medical expectation is not cure and the primary aim of treatment is no longer to prolong life.  Such care can be provided in a number of settings including in-patient hospice units, day hospices, palliative care beds within general hospitals and in the patient's own home by home care teams.  Palliative care services are available in each regional health board area and are administered, in the main, by the eight health boards.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the cancer strategy, which I intend to launch in the near future, incorporates a review of the development of hospice care services throughout the country and sets out recommendations for the future development of such services.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which his Department resources and facilitates the operation of section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991 which requires health boards to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection; and if his attention has been drawn to an increasing need for such services in view of the fact that more children are speaking out about child abuse and as a result are being ostracised by their families.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 imposes a statutory duty on health boards to identify and promote the welfare of children who are <Col N="880" /> not receiving adequate care and protection and to provide child care and family support services.  It is, therefore, the cornerstone of the Act upon which its other provisions are built.</P>
      <P>To ensure that health boards are adequately resourced to implement section 3 of the Child Care Act and the sixty other sections commenced to date, additional resources totalling £35 million on an annualised basis have been allocated to the building up of the child care services since 1993.  This extra funding has facilitated such measures as the creation of over 900 new child care posts, the extension of family support services, the provision of hostels for children out of home and the provision of additional and more specialised residential facilities.  These measures provide an integrated approach to child welfare which allow health boards to meet their responsibilities under any of the sixty one sections of the Child Care Act commenced thus far.</P>
      <P>While the additional resources provided have led to a dramatic improvement in the ability of the health boards to promote the welfare of children in their areas, I am fully aware that more needs to be done.  To this end, the Government recently approved a new child care programme for the years 1996-99, the financial details of which are being examined in the context of the 1997 Estimates.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that in calculating the expenditure per head of population, all expenditure on health services in each health board region is taken into account and not just expenditure on services funded directly by the boards themselves.  This would include expenditure on voluntary hospitals and mental handicap homes.</P>
    <P>The expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average and does not take into consideration a number of demographic and geographical factors.  The differences in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialities, density of population and the present development of the services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service was published in November 1993.  The group, in their report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and Fire Service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work, approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnel are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the Fire Service personnel or indeed the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993. The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a range of productivity-efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision <Col N="885" /> in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity/flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication, in December 1993, of the report of the review group on the ambulance service which heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which had not been addressed in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from this, a set of proposals was agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995 SIPTU advised that the proposals had been rejected.  A number of meetings have been held since then to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion.  An intensive series of discussions have taken place in the last few months in which progress has been made on a number of the outstanding issues.  It is anticipated that one further meeting will be held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in the coming weeks at which it is hoped the small number of issues remaining can be fully resolved.  With the monetary aspects of this deal already agreed, my Department is anxious to finalise the details of the productivity and flexibility measures at an early date.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health boards provide a wide variety of services to all their staff in relation to stressful aspects of their work.  These services are made available either through the employee assistance programmes running in the boards; occupational health departments throughout the service or staff counselling and information services as in the Eastern Health Board region. With regard specifically to ambulance personnel, the boards have in place a range of local arrangements which are <Col N="887" /> constantly tailored to meet general requirements as well as specific incidents of post-traumatic stress arising from accidents of a particularly harrowing nature.</P>
      <P>Occupational Health Departments provide easy access to confidential, professional support and advisory services, including counselling services for those who may wish to avail of them.  The employee assistance service also provides for self-referral or for supervisory staff to refer individual members, or indeed groups of staff for assistance such as counselling, as appropriate. Many boards make use of their own psychology services or where necessary refer staff for specific post-traumatic stress counselling with specialists outside of the board.  In addition to these services boards also partake in seminars and courses in relation to post-traumatic stress organised outside the health service, for example, critical incident stress debriefing seminars organised by the Garda etc.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are sufficiently flexible to allow individual employees and supervisory staff options in relation to how they deal with such trauma. Every effort is made across the service to alleviate the stress associated with such incidents particularly when they are an everyday aspect of any staff members' duties.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Open heart surgery including heart transplants are carried out at the National Cardiac Surgery Centre in the Mater Hospital.  There is no lung or heart-lung transplantation programme in Ireland at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mater Hospital has submitted an outline preliminary proposal for a lung and heart-lung transplantation programme. The cost of the proposal from the Mater Hospital which would include additional cardiac surgery is: capital cost: £2.6 million; revenue cost: £2.4 <Col N="891" /> million per annum.  This would involve the employment of an additional 45 staff.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a successful transplant programme for any speciality is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  The Department's recent experience with the successful liver transplant programme bears this out.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients requiring lung or heart-lung transplants and I am considering options to alleviate these problems.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> St. Vincent's Hospital is funded to provide acute hospital services to the population of South-East Dublin and Wicklow.  In addition, as a tertiary referral hospital, St. Vincent's is funded to provide services in a number of designated national specialities e.g. liver transplant programme and cystic fibrosis.  It is not the responsibility of the hospital to treat patients referred from outside of its designated catchment area <Col N="892" /> for routine conditions unless as part of its national responsibilities.  This approach is consistent with the focus in the health strategy on the need for self sufficiency in each health board area in providing regional services.</P>
      <P>St. Vincent's Hospital is funded in 1996 to provide the same level of approved activity as in 1995.  The hospital has responded to some recent inaccurate media reports concerning 1996 activity levels and is continuing to treat and accept appropriate referrals from outside its catchment area of South-East Dublin and Wicklow.  This has been reiterated by the chairman of the medical board at St. Vincent's Hospital, who has recently confirmed in a public statement that there is no ban on consultants in St. Vincent's Hospital accepting patients from outside its catchment area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have received the report on the preliminary results of a HIV anonymous unlinked ante-natal screening programme.  The report was prepared by the HIV surveillance sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  The programme was conducted over a three year period from October, 1992 to December, 1995, in all major maternity hospitals.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of 160,679 tests, 25 were confirmed HIV positive, giving a rate of 0.016 per cent, confirming a lower prevalence in this population group than in other European countries.</P>
      <P>My Department will be circulating the report to health boards and hospitals and laboratories involved in the coming weeks.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> My Department has approved a salary level of £50,484 for the chief executive officer post in a number of major hospitals, including the new hospital to be opened in Tallaght. This represents the total salary payable from public funds for the post of chief executive officer as advertised and filled following public competition. The question of any supplement payable to the successful candidate by any, or all of the bodies referred to by the Deputy from their private funds in respect of any additional duties or functions to be performed on their behalf would be a matter for these bodies and the person concerned.  The same policy applies in relation to any similar arrangements in other similar hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A limited epidural service has been available at Sligo general hospital in recent years.  The desirability of continuing the limited epidural service at the hospital has had to be reviewed against a background of increasing demand and concerns about patient safety implications.</P>
      <P>The full service implication is being reappraised at hospital level with a view to putting in place a significantly enhanced epidural service from the beginning of 1977.  This will require the redeployment of some resources within the hospital.  In the interim the North Western Health Board is hopeful that some limited form of service can be reintroduced.</P>

      <P>My capacity to allocate resource teacher posts in any year is determined by resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.

      <P>The process of determining the number of additional posts available for allocation to special needs areas, including resource teacher posts, for the current school year has only recently been finalised.  The process of assessing needs and selecting schools for receipt of these posts is now at an advanced stage.  The needs of the schools in question are being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of children with the specific learning disability dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by percentual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.  Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.  In the current school year, a special pilot unit was established in a primary school, in Dublin, to cater for children with specific learning disability. I will be keeping the operation of this pilot unit under close review.</P>
      <P>At present, 53 primary schools in the south Tipperary area have a remedial teacher service.  This represents 58 per cent of all primary schools and 77 per cent of pupils in the area.  My intention is to continue to concentrate available resources on the development of school based strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education sets out a range of measures aimed at ensuring early detection and intervention where children with special educational needs are concerned.  The fundamental objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that children with disabilities will have access to suitable resourced education services in their own area.  To this end, the White Paper provides a continuum of provision ranging from specialised back-up services for children attending ordinary schools, to the provision of special facilities dedicated to children with more serious <Col N="907" /> needs.  The needs of children with specific learning disability will be addressed within the comprehensive range of measures set out in the White Paper.</P>

      <Quest>the reason pupils from the Skeheenarinka area of County Tipperary who attend secondary school in Mitchelstown, County Cork continue to be collected first each morning and are returned home last each evening in view of her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 91 on Wednesday, 6 March 1996.</Quest>

      <P>Pupils from the Skenheenarinka area of County Tipperary who attend secondary school in Mitchelstown are not subject to the operation of a double trip in the morning.  The school bus from that area operates a single trip only and arrives in Mitchelstown at 8.45 a.m.  These pupils continue to be returned home on a double trip in the afternoon as the bus concerned has to first operate a shorter route.</P>
      <P>In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 91 on that date, I indicated that there would be a change in double-tripping arrangements for pupils on transport in the Michelstown area on an annual rotation basis.  For effective operational reasons it has not been possible to rotate the evening double trip arrangement for pupils from the Skeheenarinka area.  However, pupils in this area are still regarded as having an excellent level of service in the overall context of the school transport scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total <Col N="918" /> of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the question refers applied for a widow's non-contributory pension in December 1993 and was awarded a pension at the reduced rate of £47.20 from January 1994.  The Deputy asked in October 1994 that a breakdown of the means assessed in the case be given to the pensioner and the information in question was given to the Deputy.  In April 1996 the Deputy requested a review of the case as the pensioner's circumstances had changed.  He was told that both he and the pensioner would be informed of the outcome.  Following the review, the rate of pension was increased to £60.50 plus living alone allowance and free fuel allowance.  However, through an over-sight, the Deputy was not informed at the time of the outcome.  A reply has since been issued to him.</P>
      <P>There is a huge ongoing volume of correspondence and contacts between public representatives and my Department and I have asked that the procedures be reviewed to avoid oversights of this kind in the future.  The Department tries at all times to give an efficient service.  In general, I am satisfied with the level of service provided and indeed, the attitude of public representatives, generally, to the service they get is a positive one.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of an EU <i>pro rata</i> widow's contributory pension of £21.80 per week.  This is the appropriate rate in her case and it is based on her late husband's combined Irish and British social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>The person concerned asked my Department recently to determine her entitlement to a widow's contributory pension based on her own PRSI contribution record.  She has a total of 186 social insurance contributions recorded over the 17 year period from 1951 to 1969 yielding a yearly average of ten. This is insufficient to qualify her for a widow's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to a widow's non-contributory pension is currently being examined.  The Department is awaiting details from the person concerned regarding her income from an occupational pension from the Department of Social Security in England.  The Department is also awaiting information it has sought from the Valuation Office as to the value of a site which she owns. When this information is provided, her entitlement to a widow's non-contributory pension will be determined without delay.</P>

      <P>The problem to which the Deputy refers arose in 1995 when a large number of livestock farmers, whose holdings comprised permanent grassland only, did not submit an area aid application in spite of the fact that a pre-printed application form was issued to them by my Department.  It appears that where farmers had no change in their holdings from 1994 to 1995, the purpose of the pre-printed <Col N="929" /> form was misconstrued and the application form was seen as merely a statement that the Department already had details of the current status of farmers' holdings and that no reply from the farmers concerned was required.</P>
      <P>To redress the problem, I succeeded in securing a once off concession from the European Commission whereby those farmers' 1994 area aid declarations could be accepted for 1995.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the person to whom the Deputy refers did not have the same holding in 1995 as 1994 and, therefore, could not benefit from the concession.</P>

      <P>The current EU support system for producers of certain arable crops does not operate under a quota system.  Arable aid payments may be applied for in respect of crops which are sown on eligible land, that is, land which was tilled for a crop (other than grass re-seeding) between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1991.  Under EU regulations eligibility for arable aid can be transferred temporarily from one field to another within a farmer's holding under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Since the regulation only permits transfer of eligibility within a holding, the eligibility transferred to the purchased land to which the Deputy refers reverted to the original donor plot at the time of the sale.  In other words, because the land sold had not been ploughed between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1991 it is not eligible land once sold.</P>

The same complaint had already been referred to my office in Dublin on 16 January 1996.  A response issued to the herd owner on 1 February 1996 and a copy of this reply was referred to the Deputy on the same date.
