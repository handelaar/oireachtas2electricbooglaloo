      <P>Le do thoil, a Cheann Comhairle, ar an mhaidin seo ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil le Michelle Smith.  Ní fhacamar a leithéid sin riamh in Éirinn nó ar fud an domhain.</P>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I should like to begin our proceedings by paying a heartfelt tribute, on behalf of the people, to Michelle Smith for the honour she brought to this country in her truly stupendous achievement of winning three gold medals at the Olympic Games in Atlanta.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Michelle's achievement is a lesson to everyone in showing that, if one is determined enough to achieve an objective and single-minded enough in pursuing it, it can be done. Michelle Smith has done it.</P>
      <P>I should also like to pay a special tribute to the dignified way in which she dealt with all the interviews and criticisms with which she has had to cope outside the swimming pool.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>She has brought as much honour to Ireland in the dignity <Col N="902" /> of her bearing in answering various questions and criticisms as she has brought by this truly stupendous achievement as a swimmer.  Irish women in particular, but all Irish people regardless of gender, are very proud to be compatriots of Michelle today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I should like to join the Taoiseach in congratulating and saying a big &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to the golden girl of these Olympic Games.  Michelle Smith's achievements have been outstanding, as have been the dedication, commitment and courage she has shown both inside and outside the swimming pool.</P>
      <P>I wish her, her husband and coach, her family and everybody involved in swimming in Ireland well.  Heretofore people who watched our swimmers competing in Olympic Games in other locations, who did not qualify, tended to be of the view they would never get anywhere. While we in this House may have been criticised for not providing adequate training and other facilities for our Olympic competitors, Michelle has proved that one can succeed against all the odds to achieve great fame for this country.</P>
      <P>We should not forget &mdash; as the commentators of some other countries appear to &mdash; that the true Olympic spirit is about participation, and remember all the other Irish competitors, including those who have already competed and those awaiting their turn, and wish them all success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in congratulating Michelle Smith on her remarkable success, she is truly a sporting heroine.  I am not usually stuck for words but it is difficult to find words to describe adequately what she has achieved both inside and outside the swimming pool.  I have known her and her family, very decent, sensible people, for a considerable length of time.  Although they are immensely <Col N="903" /> proud of her success, I am certain it will not go to their heads.  Indeed, without the support of her parents, Pat and Brian, Michelle could not have achieved or realised her immense potential.  As the Taoiseach and Deputy Ahern said, she dealt with the whispering campaign and innuendo with great dignity.  Michelle has adopted the sporting mantle with a sense of greatness and we wish her well.  There is now a new golden circle of Dublin South-West.  Michael Carruth brought home a gold medal to Greenhills on the last occasion and Michelle will bring home at least three, if not four, gold medals to the village of Rathcoole.  The success we are achieving augurs well for next year's general election, particularly for myself, since the women are doing better than the men.</P>
      <P>I compliment RTE on its coverage of the Olympics, particularly Gary O'Toole, who has done so well.  I feel so knowledgeable as a result of his panel discussions that I could nearly be a panellist on swimming.  I also wish the other participants well.  We are all immensely proud of what they are doing for Ireland.  They are great ambassadors for the country and we must not forget that.  As the Minister, Deputy Allen, said last night, we should ensure that, whether in sport, health or education, resources are targeted to the areas of greatest need.  Regardless of our success in the Olympics there must not be a knee-jerk response.  We must ensure that public money is wisely spent, and I am certain Michelle Smith and her family would want that too.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I add my word of congratulations to Michelle Smith.  Politicians on occasions are rightly criticised for trying to get on the bandwagon of other people's success.  I do not wish to be put in that position, nor does any other party, but it would be remiss of us not to recognise and acclaim this extraordinary achievement. In recent years achievements have been <Col N="904" /> made by Irish people in the cultural and literary field, by Séamus Heaney who won the Nobel Prize, and now in the sporting field.  We have seen what we can achieve as a people.</P>
      <P>I say to those who believe that there are problems over which we cannot triumph that although there are difficulties which will continue to defeat us we should take heart from the achievements brought about by people who decided what needs to be done and dedicated themselves to achieving it. There is a lesson of hope for all of us in Michelle Smith's achievement and I thank her on behalf of all the people for giving us the added impetus to strive for further achievements.</P>

Níl aon amhras orm faoi agus ní thugaim leithscéal d'éinne, mó chomhghairdeachas a ghabháil léi.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá leis na hiriseoirí sin a cheapann nach bhfuil an ceart ag polaiteoirí labhairt ar son na ndaoine go bhfuilimid uilig tofa ag na daoine agus go bhfuil an ceart againn labhairt ar a son ar ócáidí mar seo.</P>

I take this opportunity to put on record, since this is the only occasion we have to do so before the autumn, the tremendous achievement of Francis Barrett, a member of the travelling community who distinguished himself in the ring by a most decisive victory last night, in a contest which lasted the distance, and in his utterances outside the <Col N="905" /> ring of his pride at being a member of the travelling community.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take: No. 1 &mdash; Metrology Bill, 1996 &mdash; Amendments from the Seanad; No. 2 &mdash; National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, 1996 &mdash; Amendment from the Seanad; No 3 &mdash; Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996 &mdash; Amendments from the Seanad; No. 6 &mdash; Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 7 &mdash; Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Bill, 1996 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and Second and Remaining Stages; No. 8 &mdash; Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 19 &mdash; Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1996 &mdash; Report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and Report and Final Stages; No. 4 &mdash; Courts Bill, 1996 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second and Remaining Stages; No. 20 &mdash; Statements on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, or anything in the Order of the Dáil of 5 July 1996, that: (1) business shall be interrupted not later than 10.10 p.m. tonight; (2) the sitting shall not be suspended between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.; (3) the amendments from the Seanad to No. 1 shall be taken together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; (4) the amendment from the Seanad to No. 2 shall be decided without debate; (5) the amendments from the Seanad to No. 3 shall be taken together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; (6) the Second Stage of No. 6 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today; (7) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 7 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a <Col N="906" /> conclusion at 4 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; (8) the Second Stage of No. 8 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m. today; (9) the Report and Final Stages of No. 19 shall be taken today and, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; (10) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 4 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put to the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice and (11) No. 20, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.10 p.m. today; shall be confined to the Taoiseach and to the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Democratic Left Party; and shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case.</P>

      <P>We will support the Government on all these measures today.  Fianna Fáil is pleased to be back in session today, with a full membership of the House, to participate in this debate to try to do something about our appalling crime.  The Taoiseach talked about a lady of great courage and conviction, Michelle Smith, this morning but today's business is primarily about another lady of great courage.  The primary reason behind us being here today is the assassination of Veronica Guerin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saving a lot of time by not disagreeing with 11 items.  I received one of these Bills last night and another this morning.  This is not the way to treat an Opposition.  I will be brief and constructive but critical at the same time.  It is no way to treat us but because of the appalling situation, we must deal with this matter and be seen to do so.  We will support these measures and put forward amendments.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Fianna Fáil Bill is before the House.  There was a great deal of co-operation between the Government and the Opposition on it. It may be the only measure completed today.  The will and conviction of the Taoiseach and the Government in following through these various crime issues will be evident after today.</P>

If not, we shall proceed to the business of the House.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up too much time, but the Taoiseach should note &mdash; maybe he will take it into account on another occasion &mdash; the number of questions put down on today's Order Paper.  There are almost 1,000 questions from Members from all sides and parties.  It shows beyond all doubt the need to have parliamentary questions when the Dáil is not sitting.</P>

      <P>Contrary to media speculation, there is a very full turnout today.  I do not see many tanned faces so Members have not been on holidays. In relation to the forthcoming referendum on bail &mdash; I asked the Taoiseach about this matter four weeks ago &mdash; has the Government decided whether to hold a second referendum on the same day on Cabinet confidentiality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not made a decision on that &mdash; I understand the Deputy's anxiety that we should make that decision reasonably soon &mdash; but we will be looking at it very shortly.  I expect we will examine the bail proposals next week and we will look at whether we can run the two matters together at that point.  I hope we will be able to inform the Deputy about that matter and I will let her know as soon as a decision is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to take Committee and Final Stages of Nos. 7 and 8?  Can the Taoiseach confirm if the bureau created under No. 8 will be able to act in the absence of legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that the bureau will be able to act in the absence of legislation and it will go into action virtually immediately in anticipation of the passage of the legislation, but it should be underpinned by statute as well so there is absolutely no doubt as to its powers or to the respective responsibilities of the different participants and co-operators with the bureau. That legislation will be processed during the recess in the appropriate committee and I hope it will be enacted fully into law, as far as this House is concerned, immediately on resumption of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, is taken by the Minister for Finance.  What significance, if any, should we attach to this?  This Bill appears to be more proper to the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to Nos. 7 and 8 not being enacted today and I answered him on that basis.  That is not accurate.  All Stages of No. 7, the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and other Purposes Bill, 1996, will be passed today.  The only Bills being left for final enactment are No. 6, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, and No. 8, the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 196.  Both of those will be brought into law at the earliest possible opportunity after the recess and Committee Stage will be taken during the recess.  Having given slightly erroneous information to Deputy O'Dea I missed Deputy O'Donoghue's question for which I am sorry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996 being taken by the Minister for Finance?  It would appear to be more appropriate to the Minister for Justice.  Should we attach any significance to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What is of significance is that all relevant ministries &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare under the Minister for Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners under the Minister for Finance and the Garda authorities under the Minister for Justice &mdash; are co-operating.  In order that we would have the legislation quickly there was a division of the work.  We wanted to ensure that all resources would be applied at Government level in the best way possible to have the best legislation available within the short time between the original decision and this session.  I am very pleased at the speed at which this legislation has been produced and pay tribute to the officials, particularly the officials in the parliamentary draftsman's office, who have been so helpful and professional in assisting us in bringing so much legislation before the House so quickly. While it would be normal for politicians to claim credit for themselves, in this <Col N="910" /> instance a great deal is due to permanent officials in various offices for what has been produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that all Stages of item No. 7 will be taken today.  It is largely empty legislation; an enabling Bill.  When will the regulations and orders necessary to bring it into effect be implemented?  Can the Taoiseach give us a guarantee that this will be done within a specific timescale?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of work has already been done on the supporting regulations but they are not included in the principal legislation because of the requirement to have the maximum degree of flexibility to alter the legislation in the light of subsequent experience to maximise its effectiveness in achieving its objectives.  There will be no avoidable delay just as there has been no avoidable delay over recent weeks in preparing the major programme of legislation we will consider today.</P>

      <P>That legislation, the heads of which have been approved by Government, is being drafted and will be available when the Dáil resumes for immediate consideration.

The Bill will make a very sizeable contribution to the fight against crime, not least because a central part of its intention is to reduce the time spent by gardaí in courts and, as a consequence, make more Garda resources available for duty on the streets.</P>
      <P>Today the Dáil will deal with five Bills aimed at improving the criminal justice system, but it is right to do more. In particular, it is right that we should ask ourselves the question: where do these measures fit into serious reform? What are our long-term policy and strategy objectives?  Can it be said that all the changes we are making today, as well as changes announced in the past two years or so, and before, represent a coherent approach to the problem of crime in our society?  I will return to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal first with the notion, usually implied but at times expressed, that the problems we are dealing with are of recent origin.  No sensible person looking in on this debate believes that the problems in the criminal justice system sprung up in the last year or so.  The truth is that the courts have remained unreformed since the foundation of the <Col N="913" /> State, the Garda Síochána have not benefited from the sort of radical review demanded by the passage of time and the prison service has not always been allocated the resources it requires.</P>
    <P>No sensible commentator believes, either, that there are quick-fix solutions or that justice measures alone can deal adequately with the crime problem. Everybody knows, or should know, that it is simply nonsense to expect the Garda to round up suspects without evidence. The courts would rightly see to it that people rounded up in this way would be free again within hours.</P>
    <P>There is no merit, then, in calling for actions of this kind, but it is practical and understandable to call for other measures: more prison spaces and more probation and welfare officers; more and better deployed gardaí, regionalisation and civilianisation of the force, air support and information technology, a Garda national drugs unit, a Garda national bureau of fraud investigation, improvement of forensic science facilities, including DNA testing, and a fresh look at how to ensure the efficiency of the force; more judges and court sittings and a radically reformed courts system; bail laws which reflect today's needs; practical steps to tackle the drugs problem in our prisons; new measures to tackle drug trafficking and organised crime; and new schemes to divert youths away from crime.</P>
    <P>These measures have been or are being implemented by me and the Government.  The programme started 18 months ago, soon after I became Minister for Justice, included many of these measures.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Justice, I have been succeeding in the sometimes frustrating and painfully slow process of bringing the criminal justice system up to date.  It has been a long haul because, in many respects its development had been allowed to fall well behind what was required long before I became Minister.  I have not been diverted from this task, irrespective of events and divergent views as to why, how or who did what.  I have insisted on ensuring <Col N="914" /> that the process was accelerated and it has because there is a political will, inside and outside this House, to prioritise the battle against crime.</P>
    <P>There are times when ideas and changes gain sufficient support to be implemented.  Similar ideas were put forward before but not brought to finality.  It may be that the circumstances or the public mood at the time was not right.  It may have been lack of determination or conviction to proceed but we are proceeding now.</P>
    <P>As we genuinely share the same objectives, the Dáil has the opportunity to distinguish itself by making real progress on four Government Bills and one Bill put forward by the Opposition.  Our society cannot afford the &ldquo;politics of crime&rdquo; and if we engage in this today we will only distance this House from the people we are here to serve.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, there are two specific decisions I want to communicate to the House.  First, I have decided, as Deputies may be aware, that we should have a regular, and, if necessary, annual Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The purpose of this would be to facilitate the speedy introduction of measures which the Garda, legal practitioners and others involved in the working of the law and order system consider necessary to enable them to do their jobs more effectively.  I am in the process of setting up, and have already invited particular individuals with appropriate expertise to be members of an advisory group, to provide me with ongoing advice in this regard.</P>
    <P>Second, I received a proposal from the new Garda Commissioner earlier this week to have a Garda liaison officer located in Madrid and another in the Hague as part of the ongoing battle against drugs.  I am glad to advise the House that I have conveyed my agreement to this proposal and I have indicated to the Commissioner that I would be sympathetic towards any other practical proposals of this kind that may be made to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> Mention of the Garda Commissioner renders it appropriate and opportune for me to welcome Commissioner Pat Byrne to his new position as head of the Garda Síochána.  He takes up this position at a time when much is expected of the force he leads.  I am sure the House will join me in wishing the Commissioner well in his arduous task.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to former Commissioner Paddy Culligan whose services to this State as a member of the Garda Síochána for 39 years was exemplary.  His thought provoking statements, particularly in recent times, have helped to broaden the debate on crime, its causes and cures.  His emphasis on the need for reason and balance and, in particular, on the need for interagency involvement and co-operation was consistent and was also, given his considerable experience, something we would do well to regard as instructive.</P>
    <P>The Miscellaneous Provisions Bill is a critically important part of the very substantial response to the problem of crime during the lifetime of this Government.  I mentioned some of the main features of that response earlier. However, I want to put some hard facts and figures on it.  The response involves the recruitment of 400 extra gardaí from this month to December 1997, in addition to already planned recruitment this year and next.  It also includes the recruitment of 200 extra civilians to take gardaí from behind desks and release them for the duties on the streets for which they have been trained.</P>
    <P>In addition to 278 places already approved, there is Government approval for a new remand prison capable of holding at least 400 prisoners at Wheatfield.  The Castlerea main prison will provide 125 places and the new women's prison at the Mountjoy complex will accommodate 60 offenders. The response also includes the appointment of 13 additional judges and extra district judicial court posts have been advertised.  I am introducing legislation today to allow for the recruitment of three more Circuit Court judges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> While I am on the subject of legislation, I welcome, in particular, two Bills which will be introduced later by my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and into which my Department had a significant input.  The first is the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Bill, 1996, one of the central purposes of which is to facilitate a better flow of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda in relation to criminal assets.  The second is the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, which creates a new body consisting of Garda, Social Welfare and Revenue officials, to be headed by a chief superintendent, with the capacity to mount a sustained, united and focused attack on illegal criminal gains.</P>
    <P>The above legislation is based on the report of an interdepartmental working group chaired by an assistant secretary in my Department.  The group, established on 5 June, was addressed by the Minister for Finance and myself on 28 June when we stressed the urgency of the task on hands and I am glad to say the group produced its report two weeks later.  I compliment the group on its dedication and efficiency in completing this difficult task in what must be record time.  Their work was assisted by the fact that the Garda and Revenue had already identified in an earlier report, completed this year, the areas of agreement as a result of my drugs package of July 1995.  I myself will, of course, be dealing with other measures later today to tackle criminal assets.</P>
    <P>Turning to the main provisions of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, a number of sections of the Bill have as their objective the reduction of the amount of time spent by gardaí on court and court related duties, and the amount of resources accounted for by these duties. These sections will relieve gardaí as far as possible of non-operational duties in the courts and help to ensure a greater presence of uniformed gardaí in our communities.</P>
    <P>Section 5 allows gardaí to give evidence by certificate with the purpose of <Col N="917" /> relieving them from the obligation of attending in person in court to give such evidence orally.  In practice, this evidence is only very rarely challenged. Section 2 provides that the Garda may release a person on bail from a Garda station to appear before the District Court at the next sitting or any sitting within 30 days of the next sitting of the court in the court area in which the person was arrested.  This will give the Garda more flexibility with regard to court appearances than they have now under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>Section 3 extends from eight to 15 days the existing statutory limit for remanding an accused person in custody on that person's second or subsequent appearance before the District Court. Currently a considerable amount of Garda time is taken up with attendance in court for appearance of accused persons on remand and section 3 is aimed at reducing this.</P>
    <P>At present when an accused person is remanded by, for example, the Galway District Court, that person will normally be held in Mountjoy prison, and the next and all subsequent remand appearances of that person will be before the District Court in Galway.  The requirement that a remand appearance be in the court having jurisdiction in the case gives rise to a heavy commitment of Garda time and resources on prisoner escorts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 will allow the District Court having jurisdiction in a case to remand an accused person in custody to an alternative court in the District Court district where the prison where he or she is being held is located or in an adjoining District Court district.</P>
    <P>There are many statutory provisions empowering the courts to issue search warrants to enable the Garda to search premises for various items, including stolen goods, firearms, illicit video recordings and racist material. However, there is no general statutory provision for the issue of search warrants in relation to the commission of serious offences such as murder or rape.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> Section 9 removes that very serious impediment to criminal investigation by providing that a judge of the District Court, on the sworn evidence of a Garda inspector, may issue a warrant for the search of any place and any person found at that place where the judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of certain specified serious offences is to be found at that place.  This will enable the Garda to search for and seize evidence such as knives in cases involving, for example, murder or an offence involving serious bodily injury, false imprisonment, rape or any offences set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  I was very surprised to discover when I went into the Department that this amendment had not been made to our laws long before now.</P>
    <P>This Bill, along with the other legislative measures being introduced today, the specific announcements made earlier in my statement and various other initiatives I have also mentioned earlier, can fairly be described as perhaps the most comprehensive set of instruments ever introduced by Government, within a short period to tackle crime.  They complement the very extensive range of anti-crime measures which I have piloted through since I became Minister for Justice.  I do not need to list all of those measures, but it is important to mention some.</P>
    <P>The final amendments to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill which were agreed earlier, bring to an end a legislative process which has involved detailed scrutiny in both Houses over recent months.  It is worth putting on the record that the drug trafficking Bill, which, among other things, allows for detention of up to seven days in drug trafficking cases and restrictions on the right to silence, is one of the strongest pieces of criminal law ever introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill passed Second Stage in the Dáil last month.  It provides for more effective powers of arrest and provides a clear, statutory basis for powers of the Garda to enter premises in <Col N="919" /> order to effect an arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Bill is scheduled to pass all Stages in this House today and in the Seanad tomorrow.  It was extensively amended by Government in Select Committee this week.  I apologise for not being there to deal with it &mdash; I was at the talks in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say work is well advanced on new Bills dealing with non-fatal offences against the person, juvenile justice, criminal insanity and fraud.  I can assure the House that there will be absolutely no slowing down in the momentum which exists for criminal law reform and that this will be underpinned by the substantial progress which has been made, and continues to be made, on the major programme of criminal law reform which I initiated.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my statement I spoke about the direction of overall crime policy and strategy and I want to return briefly to that subject, because the real quality and value of what we are doing today and what has been done will be judged in ten or 20 years' time by its residual and long-term benefits for today's children and tomorrow's society.</P>
    <P>Different people have different ideas as to what our national crime policy and strategy should be.  In fact, crime is an area of human affairs on which we find very few people who have no theories. For some, the best solutions are to be found in totally draconian legislation, harsher sentencing and so on, and it is very understandable, especially in the wake of the appalling and tragic crimes which have hit the headlines in the past month or two, that solutions of this kind would find fairly widespread support. There are others, however, who take a different view.  They would point to the fact that approaches of this kind have not provided lasting solutions in other jurisdictions.  For them, there should be greater emphasis on the need to address the underlying causes, to understand that today's impoverished or neglected <Col N="920" /> child is tomorrow's criminal, to recognise that in many cases alternatives to custody can be as effective as imprisonment and so on.  Still others would lay emphasis on the need to maintain balance in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms.  They would caution against the risk of introducing, in haste, legislation which removes or modifies long-standing legal protections for suspects, only to find out later &mdash; and perhaps too late &mdash; that excessive haste has resulted in laws that are not only wrong in principle, but also quite ineffective in practice.</P>
    <P>The presence of so many conflicting views leads at times to suggestions that our crime policies are incoherent, badly focused, or, indeed, that there is no policy, in other words, that it is simply a matter of applying strips of sticking plaster here and there and hoping against hope that the law and order system as a whole will somehow hold together.  The fact that there are conflicting views, of course, and that different types of measures may be introduced to deal with different problems provides no basis for suggesting that the system simply trundles along devoid of policy direction or cohesive strategy. What the existence of a range of options and approaches does is to strongly underline the case for attempting to set down between two covers an overall statement on crime policy formulation and strategy.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier this year that the Department of Justice is working on such a document.  Deputies will understand that it is a difficult and complex task &mdash; being undertaken, incidentally, for the first time in our history &mdash; but I am glad to say that this work is progressing and that I hope to be in a position to publish a document in the autumn. This document will not attempt to argue that crime policy formulation and strategy now, or at any time in the past, is a model of foresight and cohesion &mdash; any more than in any other part of the world &mdash; but it will, I hope displace the notion that there is no policy or strategy. An attempt will be made to identify <Col N="921" /> gaps in our strategies and how they may be addressed, and it is my intention that the document as a whole will be published, not as an immutable blueprint but, in the first instance, as an aid to public discussion.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into details of the document at this stage, but I can say that one of its central proposals will be the establishment of a broadly-based crime council on the lines of those which exist in other jurisdictions.  The purpose of setting up this council will be to bring together, to the greatest extent manageable, a representative grouping of all elements of our society in order to facilitate broadly-based, well structured and well informed discussion on the whole subject of crime.  It will not be just another talking shop.  I would see the council as a critically important source of advice to Government on matters relating to crime policy and strategy.</P>
    <P>Finally, despite what some commentators might be tempted to suspect or even articulate, I have not today listed the extensive anti-crime measures of the past two years or so for the sake of trumpet-blowing, or to make political capital by striking contrasts with Government action or inaction during other periods in the history of this State. I have done it because it is important to remind ourselves in this House, as well as to say to the people we represent, that Government and legislators can act, that together we can say to those who do not respect our laws, who would destroy our children's lives, who would attempt to bully our citizens on the streets, or who would breach the safety and security of their homes and places of work that enough is enough, that we will never allow criminals to make a misery of the lives of our fellow citizens, that we will respect and value human rights and freedoms, including the rights and freedoms of those who err, but that we will not allow criminals to abuse our respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>Those of us who represent the law abiding majority &mdash; and it is the vast majority &mdash; may not see eye to eye at times as to how precisely we should <Col N="922" /> tackle wrong doing, but when the occasion calls for it we will not allow differences in our points of view as legislators to stand in the way of our fundamental duty to maintain law and order in this State.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Today's debate is about more than passing six tough anti-crime Bills in one day.  It is the culmination of the most concentrated month's work on one topic &mdash; crime &mdash; by all arms of Government in recent times.  The result of that work will mean that we will have 600 more gardaí on our streets.  It will mean hundreds more prison spaces, more criminals being caught and more criminals serving longer sentences.  It will mean more judges in our courts, working with better back-up, and less delay in hearing criminal cases.  It will mean criminals no longer being able to stash away the proceeds of their crimes for the rainy day, but these ill-gotten assets being pursued, identified and confiscated wherever they are hidden, at home or abroad.  It will mean the mobilisation of the best brains from the public and private sectors and from abroad to help modernise our police force, and it will mean an opportunity for people themselves to decide, in a referendum, if they want to restrict the right to bail in our courts.  In short, every area of the criminal justice system is being modernised with vigour <Col N="923" /> and determination.  We want law enforcement authorities that are so sophisticated technologically, and so focused and motivated organisationally, that they can outmanoeuvre and eliminate the small number of sophisticated criminal gangs operating here with the aid of their international criminal associates.</P>
      <P>The problem, however, goes beyond the criminal justice system itself.  What sort of Irish society are we trying to build?  We want a society in which everyone is willing to play his or her part courageously in the battle against crime.  We want people who will give information freely to the gardaí, who will take the witness stand and who will play their part in bringing back pride, beauty and security to neighbourhoods now blighted by graffiti, drug pushing and fear.</P>
      <P>We want a public that is honest enough with itself to recognise that there would be no drug pushers, no drug barons and no drug cartels if there were no drug users.  The money casually used to buy an &ldquo;E&rdquo; tablet, can end up being used to finance a contract killing. We want to change the direction of peer pressure on young people.  Instead of their peers urging them to seek oblivion in drug use, we want the peer pressure on Irish young people to work against drugs.  Peer pressure, even more than law enforcement and formal education, will turn the tide against the drug barons.</P>
      <P>The battle against drugs is a battle for public opinion, and it is a battle that is only beginning today.  We must have honesty in the political debate too.  Better law enforcement costs money.  Every new law requires new staff to implement it.  That means less money for tax cuts. Wherever there is a priority, something else must take second place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish society is willing to pay the price for the battle against crime, and I hope we all remember that when we come to discuss public spending, taxation and other matters.  These choices cannot be <Col N="924" /> separated from one another.  It will cost money to provide better and more constructive outlets for our young people. As a society, as individual families and in our neighbourhoods, we must be willing to provide that money, even if it has to be diverted from something else.</P>
    <P>When, some weeks ago, in the aftermath of Veronica Guerin's murder, I proposed this special Dáil session to discuss crime, there were criticisms on two counts.  Some said that delaying the holding of the session showed a lack of urgency.  Others said that in the short time available nothing of substance could be done today.  The schedule for today's session effectively answers both criticisms.  The Government's commitment to tackle the problem of organised crime with particular reference to drug trafficking is illustrated by the extent and nature of actions taken, culminating in decisions finalised in the past month. I pay a particular, personal tribute to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, whose energetic and imaginative approach since she took office has made possible the changes the House is enacting today, changes in areas which previous Ministers had left untouched for many years.  The office of Minister for Justice is the most difficult and emotionally harrowing job a Minister can hold.  Deputy Owen has held that office under sustained and hurtful attack with courage, serenity and a continued, fixed purpose, as befits the holder of such an office and somebody of her family background.</P>
    <P>The legislation for consideration confirms that the timing of today's session was right.  We are not meeting simply to debate and discuss.  We are meeting to deal with specific legislative proposals which are an integral part of the Government's programme to combat crime.  I will summarise the Government's main actions.</P>
    <P>Work on the strategic management initiative review of the Garda Síochána has commenced.  Mr. Tony Barry, Chairman of CRH, who has already presided over an efficiency audit of the Army, is chairing the review group looking into <Col N="925" /> the Garda Síochána.  He is assisted by distinguished and experienced people from the public and private sector including the recently retired Deputy Commissioner of the New York Police Department, Mr. John Timoney.  The review will be completed before the end of the year and the Government will take whatever action to reorganise the Garda Síochána arising out of the review.  The Garda have served this country well since the foundation of the State and will serve the country as well in the next century.</P>
    <P>There are proposals for other action in other areas of the Garda Síochána. On 2 July, the Minister for Justice announced and accelerated additional recruitment of 400 new gardaí.  The first intake of 70 of this extra 400 will begin training in Templemore on 29 July, less than four weeks after the Minister's announcement.  The Minister for Justice also announced the recruitment of 200 civilians to enable an equivalent number of gardaí to be released from clerical and administrative type duties to fight crime on the streets.  In all, over 600 gardaí will be released to fight crime by the decisions the Government has taken in the past month.</P>
    <P>Under the direction of Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, a task force has been looking at ways of speeding up the prisons building programme.  The latest available information is that 68 additional places will become available in the Curragh in September this year, 25 additional places will become available in Castlerea in October this year and 55 additional places will become available in Limerick in October next year.  A total of 125 additional places will become available in Castlerea in December next year.  By a greater utilisation of buildings already on this site, that tight deadline should be achieved. Equally important, by using the existing buildings, the cost of the project will be reduced from £20 million to £13 million. Fifty additional places will become available at the women's prison in Mountjoy in October, 1998 and 400 additional places will become available <Col N="926" /> at Wheatfield by the end of 1998.  Work will begin there next year.  These places are now targeted for completion almost a year earlier than originally announced.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, and his team for the work they have done in fast-tracking the prisons building programme.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, has, by legislation, provided for the appointment of 21 extra judges &mdash; three to the Supreme Court, three to the High Court, ten to the Circuit Court and five to the District Court.  This contrasts with the creation of only ten additional judicial appointments in the previous ten years.  That shows the Minister is doing something about the two year delays in hearing vital criminal cases.  The Presidents of the High and the Circuit Courts have arranged to hold additional sittings of their courts in September.  They have also agreed to a system of prioritisation so that serious crime cases are dealt with quickly rather than left to take their places in an undifferentiated queue.</P>
    <P>For some time it has been a source of scandal and concern that persons suspected of involvement in serious crime, including drug trafficking, have been able, without hindrance from the law, to accumulate significant assets.  To deal with this problem the Government is establishing a Criminal Assets Bureau to track and target the assets of criminals. The bureau is being set up with immediate effect and will use the provisions of legislation such as the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Bill, 1996, before us today.  It is proposed to provide a specific statutory basis for the bureau through the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996 which is introduced on Second Stage today.  The operational experience gained in setting up the bureau and the examination of the Bill on Committee Stage will be of benefit in finalising this Bill later in the year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the legislative measures <Col N="927" /> with which we are dealing today, the Government is also preparing legislation as follows: to hold a referendum on bail, and if that referendum is carried, to enact an appropriate measure to modify existing law; to strengthen existing bail laws; to deal with certain housing aspects of the drugs problem.  The Minister for the Environment announced the broad scope of the legislation and I can confirm that legislation to deal with housing will be available after the summer recess.  The measures, all of which I have outlined and referred to here, relate to the supply of drugs and to the reduction or restriction of same.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that action is taken to reduce the demand for drugs. As I said, without drug users there would be no drug barons.  The task of assisting, so far as officialdom is concerned, in reducing demand for drugs rests primarily with the Departments of Health and Education.  In addition, the Government has set up a ministerial task force under the chairmanship of Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to take an overview of the present arrangements for dealing with all the measures we take through different agencies to help or encourage less or no demand for drugs on our streets.  In the light of that review the group chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is being asked to report to Cabinet on any additional changes needed to ensure that as a State we do everything we can to encourage people to make what is, certainly in the first instance, a free choice not to use drugs.  Decisions will be taken on the report prepared by Minister Rabbitte's group at the end of September and we will be able to report on it to the House when it resumes after the summer.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government's response is carefully thought out, balanced and urgent.  It is not simply a law and order approach.  It deals with all aspects of the problem &mdash; demand as well as supply.  If, as time goes on, additional or changed responses are required, these will be forthcoming urgently.  I assure the House that I <Col N="928" /> regard the battle against crime and associated drug use as the number one domestic priority of the Government. All resources, material, intellectual or time, will be made available to deal with this problem.  As a society we are being put to the test by the pervasive availability of organised supply of illicit drugs.  We must pass that test.  The Government is determined that as a society we do so and I believe that in so doing, we have the support of the entire House.  I believe also that we have shown in our approach to this Dáil sitting that not only have we displayed, as a Government, urgency in preparing our own legislation very quickly but we have also shown a willingness to accept ideas and proposals from the other side of the House.  That is as it should be because in a matter of this kind the House must be seen, as it is today, to act in a cohesive way to express and give effect to the wishes of the people.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice has once again exceeded her own land speed record for political procrastination. The Bill which she introduces today is not, as she would have us believe, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996.  It is, in fact, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1995, which on 11 May 1995 she announced as being imminent when she stated: &ldquo;Preparation of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill... is at an advanced stage.&rdquo;  The Minister progressed from &ldquo;at an advanced stage&rdquo; to publication in 14 months.

      <P>In fairness to the Minister it should be stated that she has afforded the preparation of this Bill the same political priority as she has to other crime prevention legislation.  She has, at this stage, promised so many measures that her long finger resembles Pinocchio's nose.  Realising that she has become an object of political derision, she now seeks, in a political hop, skip and jump, to transform herself from the Minister who did not introduce any legislation to the Minister who introduced the most legislation on the one day.  It is regrettable that in seeking to achieve this transformation she left out the vital element of preparation.  This Bill shows all the legislative cohesion of a measure which was stitched together from the contents of the parliamentary draftsman's waste paper bin.  It is a curious collection of legislative quilt work held together with staples and string.</P>

      <P>What is particularly regrettable is that it is presented as an essential ingredient of the Government's anti-crime package.  The reality is that this Government does not have a crime policy.  It has no anti-crime strategy. What it has is a stampeded mess which it seeks to pass off as concerted effort.  Let us not forget that when this Government belatedly realised that action was needed on crime, its preferred option was the establishment of a committee.  Committees are established by people who want to be told what to do.  The Government wanted to <Col N="930" /> be told what to do because it did not know what to do.  It did not know what to do because it has no criminal justice policy.</P>
      <P>This shambles is the inevitable result of divisions within the Government.  It is not so long ago since the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was sent out with a borrowed thesaurus and a ticket for the Abbey to proclaim the true view of the rainbow &mdash; there is no need for legislation &mdash; crime is at an acceptable level &mdash; our inaction is justified.  The intellectual guru behind this school of jurisprudence is a full-time journalist and a part-time student.  His career might progress at a faster pace if he reversed those roles and learned before he speaks.  His philosophy was music to the Government's ears.  It justified its policy of paralysis.  Who on the Government benches now sings that song? What has happened to the ranks of comfortably complacent Ministers who repeatedly voted down legislation now proclaimed to be necessary and urgent? They need only look behind them to see the disspirited ranks of backbenchers who know that they are about to collect their last box of Oireachtas envelopes.</P>

Of course, <Col N="932" /> he is not alone in facing political oblivion and we should not forget those Labour backbenchers who have soared brightly and briefly in the political firmament. They are the people who voted against the constitutional referendum on the issue of bail and against making bailsmen financially responsible for the good conduct of accused persons.

They are the people who will troop through the lobbies in support of this Bill.  As they do this their chorus of &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo; will speed them to their electoral fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents yet another monumental ministerial oversight.  It is remarkable not for its curious contents but for its extraordinary omissions.

      <P>The actions which result from her examinations are cosmetic rather than substantive.  If and when this legislation becomes law the procedures which give rise to unacceptable court delays will still be in place.  A person arrested in Dublin today and charged with a serious criminal offence will still have to snake his way through a cumbersome court system before justice can be done.  His first appearance in court will result in a remand, most probably on bail.  The Bill proposes the deferral of that first appearance for up to 30 days.  While the entire Garda force is seeking to get criminals into court, the Minister is working out ways of delaying their inevitable appearance.</P>

      <P>In addition to proposing a 30 day delay before the first court appearance the Minister also proposes that the period of subsequent remand be extended from eight to 15 days.  So much for speeding up the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On his second court appearance the issue of the location of the trial will be dealt with.  If, as is likely in respect of a serious criminal offence, the trial will ultimately take place in the Circuit Criminal Court then there will again be a remand, this time for the preparation of a book of evidence.  The usual period of such remand is four weeks.  It is unusual for books of evidence to be assembled within this time and it is common for a further three or four weeks remand to facilitate the preparation of the book of evidence.  Once ready, the book of evidence is served and there is again a remand, usually for a fortnight, <Col N="934" /> to enable the accused and his lawyer to consider its contents.  On the next court hearing the accused is entitled, as his absolute right, to require the attendance of all or any prosecution witness to give evidence on deposition.</P>
    <P>The delay in finding courts available to take depositions now frequently extends to between eight and ten weeks. Once the depositions are taken the case is again remanded to a date when submissions are made as to whether there is, in the terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, a sufficient case to answer.  In deciding this the only task a district judge undertakes is to answer the question, &ldquo;if everything contained in the book of evidence or depositions were accepted by a jury would they be entitled to convict of the offences charged?&rdquo;.  A district judge conducting a preliminary examination has no function in assessing or weighing evidence or credibility.  If the answer to the question posed is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then the accused is returned for trial to the Circuit Criminal Court.  In 1995 this procedure was followed by the Dublin Metropolitan District Court in 673 cases.</P>

      <P>It resulted in orders of discharge being granted in seven cases.  How can it be contended that this cumbersome and costly procedure serves the interests of justice?</P>
      <P>What is alarming is that the Minister for Justice having examined the system, has chosen to leave this procedure in place.  In so doing she had, of course, guaranteed continued delays in serious criminal cases.  It is self-evident that the same end result could be achieved if, on the first occasion on which a person appeared before a court, there was an inquiry into whether the matter would be dealt with on indictment.  If it was to be dealt with on indictment then the matter could be sent directly to the court of trial where a date for trial could be fixed and the prosecution directed to serve the book of evidence within a set time period.  This would enable trials to take place within 90 days of arrest.</P>
      <P>The Minister has only one answer when it comes to the question of court delays.  She repeats parrot-like that judges will be appointed.  This has now been done.  The eight judges sworn in yesterday are her answer to court delays.  Their appointment was announced as a component part of the Government's anti-crime package. What is the position now that the Minister's solution is in place?  First, it should be noted that none of the eight new judges will sit on criminal cases in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court during September.  The reason for this is that no criminal business will be transacted by that court during September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that when the crime crisis confronted the Minister for Justice she and the rainbow Coalition Government sought headlines rather than solutions.  She was to be seen wearing a hard hat and perambulating around a building site devoid of all but public relations experts and invited journalists.  She was also to be seen peering over the shoulder of the new Garda Commissioner in much the same way as bold boys make television debuts.  It is no wonder that 14-month delays occur between a Bill being at &ldquo;an advanced stage&rdquo; and being introduced. What is a wonder is that the Bill was published at all, given that the Minister seems to spend every waking hour in search of a camera to smile at.  If she bothered to inquire about the substance rather than the facade of the criminal justice system she would have realised that, between the Central Criminal Court and the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, there are only five registrars permanently available for the conduct of criminal business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, to clear the backlog, the Central Criminal Court is to sit permanently in three divisions, only two registrars will be permanently available for Circuit <Col N="937" /> Criminal Court cases.  The net effect of the announced anti-crime package will be to further delay the conduct of serious criminal cases in the Circuit Court.  This court deals with all drug dealing and importation cases, as well as all armed robbery cases.  It deals with all offences against the person except murder, rape and aggravated sexual assault. This is apparently of no consequence to the Minister who sought political beauty board, with which she could cover up the crumbling shambles of her lack of policies, rather than real solutions.</P>
    <P>The same mentality gives us this largely ineffective Bill.  The Minister seeks the semblance rather than the substance of action.  After eighteen months of studied inactivity she wishes to present herself as a political whirlwind, sweeping all before her in a flurry of activity.  However, the reality is that when the dust dies down, the same cumbersome court procedures will still be in place with the same delaying effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has used this tactic in the past.  Her impromptu announcements of bail referenda have become legendary.  I congratulate her on getting the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare to grudgingly join in the most recent impromptu announcement. However, the pace of progress is characteristically slow.  On 14 March 1995, at column 1192 of the Official Report, the Minister told this House &ldquo;my Department has been examining the form of wording for a constitutional amendment to be put to the people on this issue&rdquo;. She went on to say that an option she would ask the Government to consider was holding a referendum on bail at the same time as the referendum on divorce. This is yet another proposal which adorns the Minister's long finger.  Is it possible that she could have worked at such a dizzy pace to contribute one word per week towards the proposed amendment?  If so, it would have been ready many months ago.  As of now it remains unpublished and unleaked.  If it had gone to Cabinet we would surely have read of the proposed wording in the newspapers.  There is certainly no <Col N="938" /> indication that the Minister, Deputy Lowry has been apprised of any such proposal.  It remains another area where the Minister's chant of &ldquo;nearly there&rdquo; is heard before the journey begins.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to crime can be examined specifically in the proposals contained in this Bill.  In section 2 she proposes to speed up the criminal justice system by allowing the first date on which an arrested person will appear before the District Court to be delayed by up to 30 days.  Section 3 sets about achieving a similar end by the same means.  It proposes to speed up procedures by permitting a remand for 15 days rather than eight days.  It is a curious logic which seeks to speed up proceedings by delaying cases coming before the courts.  In fairness to the Minister for Justice it must be said that it is consistent with her policies to date.</P>
    <P>This Bill could have been used as a mechanism to introduce meaningful reforms into the criminal law.  Instead, the Minister has introduced a collection of non-consequential amendments dressed up as a Bill to satisfy her quest for publicity.  The reason this legislation has not been used to implement meaningful reforms is that the Minister for Justice and the Government cannot think of any.  She and her colleagues in Government are clearly bereft of ideas and inspiration.  In so far as the public demand for action occasionally overwhelms the Government, as it did with the demand for a bail referendum, it is unable to overcome internal dissension to give direction.  <i>The Irish Times</i> was correct in its editorial last summer; the Minister gives the impression of stumbling from crisis to crisis.</P>
    <P>I accept that on occasions the Minister has been tripped.  The Tánaiste must bear much of the responsibility for this Government's lack of a criminal justice policy.  He has consistently opposed a referendum on bail.  He spearheaded last summer's Cabinet ambush which resulted in the effective cancellation of the prisons programme.  Whoever is to blame the end result is the same.  This Government has been a disaster when <Col N="939" /> viewed from the perspective of criminal justice.  Even today nobody can tell us what its policies are.  We know it is now in favour of policies it voted against last year.  At a time when the nation is crying out for reforms and innovation on the legislative front, this Government has singularly failed to accept its primary responsibility to enact laws.  It has adopted a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to crime and crime has prospered as a result. What message did it think the cancellation of the prison programme would send to criminals?  Does it think that message was received?  Does it accept responsibility for its consequences?</P>
    <P>This Government preaches openness, transparency and accountability, yet when anything goes wrong it refuses to accept responsibility.  It now espouses policies against which it voted last year. It is time we had a Government that knows what it wants to do.  Who will be accountable for the performance of the Minister for Justice since assuming office?  The Minister for Justice and her colleagues in the rainbow coalition Government every now and then come up with the old chestnut that Fianna Fáil was in power for eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last 16 years the Labour Party has been in power for longer than any other party in this country. Fianna Fáil introduced the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which was a real attempt to tackle the drugs problem. Recognising the seriousness of the prison problem, Fianna Fáil proposed to build prisons but they were cancelled in the absence of the Minister for Justice by the Minister for Finance, who comes into the House today to introduce the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996.  Why has the Minister for Finance introduced the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, a criminal justice measure?  The answer is quite simple and clear.  In a frantic attempt to catch up with the pace set by the Fianna Fáil Party on this extremely <Col N="940" /> serious issue the Minister for Finance, the Labour Party adviser, Mr. Finlay, and the Tánaiste have decided they had better take on the Minister for Justice at her own public relations game.  I wish them every success in that.</P>
      <P>Bad as things are under this Minister for Justice, it would be extremely regrettable were a Labour Party TD to become Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Finance who cancelled the prisons projects in the absence of the Minister for Justice ensured, together with his colleagues in the Labour Party and in Democratic Left, that there would not be a referendum on bail.  He has a brass neck, to say the very least of it, to come into the House now and try to give a semblance of action when inactivity and frozen indifference have been his hallmark throughout his period as Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Justice in the future seeks to criticise Fianna Fáil's record on criminal law and practical criminal measures, she would do well to remind herself she is the Minister for Justice, that she has been the Minister for Justice for a long time now and that there have been 12 very serious gangland killings since she came into office. She has done nothing about these killings and as a result this type of violence has started to spill over into civilian life.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice would do well to remember that Fianna Fáil did not cnacel the prison building programme. Fianna Fáil did not take months to introduce the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  Fianna Fáil did not allow natural wastage in the Garda Síochána to outstrip recruitment.  Fianna Fáil did not announce and then cancel a bail referendum. Fianna Fáil did not vote down restrictions on the right to bail in this House last year, no more than Fianna Fáil refused to set up a national drugs agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did not allow a legislative drought to occur in the Department of Justice.  Fianna Fáil did not allow the <Col N="941" /> State pathologist's office to run down to its present condition.</P>

For the past 18 months we have suggested that resources should be made available for that purpose.  The last Book of Estimates I completed in November 1994, in conjunction with the Labour Party, contained proposals for prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy, additional gardaí and other matters, but this Government dismissed them.  The Taoiseach is lecturing to Members on his side of the House, not to Members on this side.  I am sure journalists will note the relevant paragraph and reflect on whom he was referring to.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I congratulate the new Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I hope his tenure of office is successful and, irrespective of our position in parliamentary politics, we will assist him in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This week will see the enactment into law of Fianna Fáil legislation which provides for the freezing of assets suspected of resulting from criminal activity.  I confidently expect that within days of that statute being enacted the assets of the leading drug barons and gang leaders will be frozen by order of the High <Col N="943" /> Court.  I expect the Minister to move on that forthwith.  I hope the public will provide the gardaí with the information necessary to turn these people out of their estates and mansions.  If necessary, information can be supplied on a confidential basis.  Depriving criminals of the proceeds of their crimes will represent a substantial first step in the war against organised and systematic crime.  All the legislative measures with which we are dealing today represent only a first step in the battle against crime.  The war we are determined to wage against organised crime must continue until the last penny has been taken out of the pockets of criminals and all of them are locked behind bars.  We are pleased Government time has been provided to discuss this legislation.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, it is an example of democracy in action.</P>
    <P>The action has just started.  The legislation which will become law within days is merely the first shot in the war against organised crime.  Much remains to be done.  Fianna Fáil has a clear view of what needs to be done.  During the past 18 months we have sought to advance our vision of what is necessary to reform the criminal justice system through the introduction of a series of detailed Bills.  In the week in which the Fianna Fáil Bill to seize criminal assets is due to become law it is worth noting that this Bill is a component part of an overall detailed legislative plan we put forward.</P>

      <P>When this Government took office we said if it introduced necessary legislation we would support it, but if it failed to do so we would introduce it.  We delivered on that promise but, unfortunately, the Government did not accept all the legislation we introduced.  It is a sad political fact that legislation, particularly in regard to bail, we introduced and was voted down by the Government has been adopted as Government policy.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil believes the momentum created by the impending enactment of the legislation on the seizure of assets must be maintained.  We must show criminals that we are serious about reform and send out a strong message in that regard.  Certain measures are necessary to maintain that momentum. Neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach referred to gardaí on the beat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the legislation about ridding estates and flat complexes of criminals which the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is preparing. Those matters should have been dealt with today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters which must be dealt with during the next Dáil session include the reform of the Criminal Justice Act to guarantee trials within 90 days of arrest and a constitutional referendum to remand accused persons in custody pending trial for up to 90 days, if the High Court is satisfied that the person may commit a further indictable crime while on bail.  A witness protection programme must be established and there must be a ten year minimum sentence for people caught in possession of controlled drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more.  Arrangements should be made to hold criminal court hearings throughout the year and sufficient court staff should be provided to hold permanent sittings for three divisions of the <Col N="945" /> Central Criminal Court and five divisions of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>We must also establish a commission on crime and modify the right to silence in respect of all criminal offences so that a person who remains silent when questioned and later seeks to rely on a fact which he could have disclosed at trial may have an adverse inference drawn against him.  We must also amend the licensing laws to permit the Circuit Court to immediately suspend the licence of a premises where controlled drugs are being distributed and reform the law relating to criminal insanity to provide for a verdict of guilty by reason of diminished responsibility.</P>
    <P>Unacceptable delays will continue to occur until antiquated criminal procedures are modernised.  In the 1995 criminal procedure legislation Fianna Fáil propose that the entire system of premliminary examination should be abolished and replaced with a system that would guarantee a trial within 90 days of arrest, unless the High Court ordered a postponement in the interests of justice.  Under the system we proposed a person could be brought before the District Court on arrest where an inquiry would take place as to the seriousness of the offence.  If the case were ultimately tried by a jury the accused could immediately be sent to the court of trial where a date for trial would be set and the prosecution would be required to serve a book of evidence on the accused within six weeks.  This simple reform would reduce the number of court appearances from approximately eight to two, permit trials to take place within three rather than 12 months, save on court time and legal costs and free gardaí from attending unnecessary court appearances.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has exceeded his time by some minutes.  The Taoiseach and the Minister also substantially exceeded their time.  The Chair is in a predicament in its desire to be fair to all parties and to balance the time allowed.  However, because the order of the House deems it necessary for the Minister to be called on to reply at 1.15 p.m. we are eroding the time allowed to the Progressive Democrats.  That is the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I will finish if the Progressive Democrats allow me a few minutes.</P>
      <P>One of the factors which has contributed to the delay in hearing serious criminals cases has been the insufficient number of judges.  The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, provided for the appointment of nine extra Circuit Court judges.  The Act became law in December 1995.  As the Minister and Taoiseach know, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, had announced that legislation and the extra appointments.  Financial provision was made for all those appointments.  It is a little hollow to say today that they were not appointed under the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

The Government announced the names of the new judges 15 days ago as part of the anti-crime package.  It is unprecedented for the swearing in of judges to be delayed for this period &mdash; it has never been the normal proactice.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in announcing these appointments as an anti-crime measure, seeks to perpetuate the illusion that immediate action is being taken to free the court logjam in serious criminal cases.  I will not go over the details of what Deputy O'Donoghue said this morning, but the Minister knows that what he stated is correct, although she refused to accept it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the witness protection programme, the main difficulty which has bedevilled the efforts made to obtain convictions against drug barons and organised criminals has been the reluctance of people to come forward and give evidence against them.  At least a part of this reluctance is due to the climate of fear which these people perpetuate. If we are to seriously tackle organised crime we must take whatever steps are necessary to protect witnesses. Of necessity, the details of such a programme must remain secret.  However, it is clear that a successful witness protection programme is in operation in the United States of America and a similar programme should be introduced here. We have details relating to such programmes if the Minister wished to look at them.</P>
      <P>I have given the details of our proposals on minimum sentences in drug cases, court sittings and staff in my prepared text.  We think it is necessary to have a commission on crime because our system of criminal justice stretches across many different agencies.  It involves the Garda, the Prison Service, the Judiciary, the legal profession and the probation service.  Those agencies, in addition to the public, should be allowed to make submissions on which we could get agreement.  We could also look at addressing the issue of how far we can move in terms of civil liberties. We could address those issues through such a commission and reach a balance which would be acceptable to society.  I have mentioned the right to silence and the licensing laws, which I have dealt with in greater detail in my circulated text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Thank you, Sir, for giving me extra time.  I will speak in greater detail later on the Fianna Fáil Bill.  I seriously believe that this Minister and the Government, who have not listened to what we have been saying for the past 18 months, are now shedding crocodile tears.  Veronica Guerin was assassinated by murdering drug barons which shocked people into acting.  It would be well worth the Government's time to examine the legislation which we have put forward for 18 months &mdash; and to take whatever other steps are necessary, which will get our support and constructive criticism &mdash; rather than trying to shout down our spokesperson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin, debate in Dáil Éireann and outside it has been quite properly dominated by the need for this House to revise its laws and to introduce new ones, driven by political will and fuelled by public outrage, to enable the State to effectively tackle escalating and increasingly organised criminality. It was very obvious after Veronica's murder that our citizens were frustrated by routine condemnation of crime when they came in large numbers to leave flowers outside this House.</P>
      <P>They sent a very strong message to us, as legislators, that the time for routine condemnation is over and that they wanted action.  They are tired of a creaking criminal justice system which does not serve them or us in this House. Our body of law and procedures is hopelessly out of date and riddled with inefficiencies and contradictions.  Our citizens are bamboozled by the arguments on the sides of civil liberties and, at the same time, the compelling logic of the need to have a system of justice which, quite simply, works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Often, as spokesperson on justice, I write speeches on injustice caused by deficiencies and structural defects within the system which claims to protect the safety of the citizen from crime. It has become a cliché, but also an excuse for inactivity, to point to the fact <Col N="949" /> that crime is a multifaceted problem requiring a multifaceted response.  That is the same argument as saying that a difficult decision should not be made because it is difficult.</P>
    <P>I agree with comments by the Taoiseach today, whom I had not expected to contribute to the debate, but I am glad he did.  He stated &ldquo;the money used to buy an &ldquo;E&rdquo; tablet can end up being used to finance a contract killing&rdquo;.  It was very important that he made those comments today.  As he said, &ldquo;the battle against drugs is a battle for public opinion&rdquo;, particularly that of the young. I am glad he made that contribution and I commend his comments.</P>
    <P>We have suffered from political paralysis which is why we are urgently debating measures, the need for which has been glaringly obvious for years, but in respect of which all of us &mdash; the political establishment &mdash; have been incapable of delivering solutions.  I have said before that in the politics of criminal justice a clear head and a steady hand on the tiller are required.  Of all Departments in any Government, that of Justice requires cohesion in the Cabinet.  It is not a Department which prospers from ideological differences within a Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, but not impossible, to predict the creativity of the criminal mind.  With increasing sophistication and the benefit of an ineffectual criminal justice system, organised crime has prospered.  Their activities have demoralised the Garda Síochána and scandalised our citizens.  Perhaps because we have had to cope with 25 years of paramilitary subversion and because so much of our resources have been ploughed into confronting that threat to our security, as a direct byproduct organised crime has developed and prospered to the extent it has.</P>
    <P>These sophisticated criminals consider themselves to be above our laws. They confront us brazenly with arms and terror when people get in their way, be they fellow criminals or courageous journalists.  They care little for the civil liberties of law abiding citizens, yet they claim the protection provided by civil <Col N="950" /> liberties and due process when they are caught or being investigated.  They rob banks and then launder the proceeds of that crime through the same institutions. They avail of tax amnesties provided by foolish Governments.</P>
    <P>Our criminal justice system has three traditional aims; punishment, deterrence and reform.  In the case of the socalled untouchables, it seems we have failed markedly on all three counts.  We cannot link them to their crimes.  When we catch them we have to give them temporary or early release because we do not have enough prison spaces for them.  In the case of hardened criminals who have made crime their life's work, perhaps it is time to acknowledge that reform is rarely a realistic option.  Traditional methods have failed.  That being the case, we must deploy new ones, particularly in relation to organised crime.  If we cannot punish, deter or reform them, we must set a new aim of stopping them from plying their evil trade.</P>
    <P>As well as laws to obstruct their operations &mdash; and we will later be putting the final touches to the Fianna Fáil Bill to seize and dispose of the assets of criminal activity &mdash; we need to restructure our criminal prosecution service, change our bail laws, modernise and speed up criminal court proceedings and bring our laws on sentencing up to date.  We also need a prison system that works and a self-confident, expert police force. I join Members who congratulated the new Garda Commissioner.  He has an unenviable task and I hope he will set about it with great vigour and with the encouragement of the House today.</P>
    <P>Yesterday a murderer escaped from Mountjoy jail on his way to a workshop. I doubt if there will be political or any accountability for that.  We can no longer ignore such issues.  In February 1996 I tabled a Progressive Democrats' Bill which set a real and genuine agenda to reform the system for prosecution and punishment of criminal offences.  It provided for major changes in our laws relating to the prosecution of offences, <Col N="951" /> criminal procedures, the reform of the right to silence, bail law, control and management of the prison system, sentencing and the law relating to remissions and temporary releases.  The philosophy of the Bill was integrated and dealt with speeding up trials, modernising criminal procedure and eliminating loopholes not only those discovered by me in 1996, but those known to everybody for the past 20 years. Some of those measures unceremoniously voted down by the Government in February 1996 were adopted in the immediate aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin.</P>
    <P>This Dáil debate is taking place approximately one month after Veronica's murder.  It should be noted that nobody has been questioned about that crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Such is the extent of the problem we face.</P>
      <P>Very soon after the murder, a story emerged which has become known in journalistic circles as &ldquo;the story that dare not speak its name&rdquo;.  Paul Williams wrote it last Sunday in the <i>Sunday World.</i>  It is that Veronica's murder was linked to two stories she was researching, one a gangland murder and the other an alleged corrupt garda. Nobody in the House has any information as to the veracity of that story, but we ignored matters about which she wrote for years and that is why we are here now.  Is that story being investigated? Is it a pack of lies, a total fiction or is there any truth in it?  If there is, it should be investigated.  It is not sufficient that these matters should be peddled in the newspapers.  Our citizens, including gardaí, are reading it.  I want a response from the Minister on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that none of the measures before the House today would be before us but for the murder of Veronica Guerin.  None of the Bills which have been drafted and published and <Col N="952" /> hot off the presses today would have been presented were it not for the message sent to the Oireachtas by those who ordered or organised the murder of Veronica Guerin.  She was not even buried before the predictable bleating started of those who want to hold on to the failed <i>status quo</i> and who forecast the wrecking of civil liberties if we introduce radical legislation.  There are those who write long articles about crime prevention. There are those who seek to convince us that there is not any escalation in crime.  There are those who will say that by legislating and introducing radical legislation we are acting in haste and in a knee-jerk fashion, but I challenge that.  Those are the same people who for 20 years opposed a change in our bail laws.  We have the most liberal bail laws in the common law world. Nowhere is there a system such as the one we must endure here, where a person has an absolute guarantee of liberty even if it can be shown, as a matter of probability that he or she will commit crimes while on bail.  That is an absolute nonsense.  It is dangerous and reckless. It fails to vindicate the right of the public to be safe.</P>
    <P>There are those who will say that we must look to the root causes of crime; that poverty, social deprivation and alienation must be tackled before we adopt the criminal justice approach to rising criminality.  There are good points in that argument, but the two concepts need not be mutually exclusive.  One must not be postponed for the other. Both can be tackled because while we earnestly study the root causes of crime, the criminal godfathers are taking full advantage of our distraction.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered there is a Supreme Court precedent and licence to us as legislators to be constitutionally adventurous.  The Supreme Court said that the potential damage to society from the use and distribution of controlled drugs is so great and constitutes such a pernicious evil that the Legislature has a very wide discretion when reconciling the rights of the common good with individual rights.  I believe <Col N="953" /> that.  I also believe that this Dáil, representing the people, has the capacity, authority and duty to reconcile and balance the rights of the people to live in safety with the rights of those who threaten them.</P>
    <P>On preventative detention, the O'Callaghan Supreme Court judgment, which was described as a liberal bridgehead was a liberal bridgehead too far. It has caused paralysis in much needed reform of our bail laws.  I welcome the Government's announcement that it will move to change the bail laws by constitutional referendum and legislation and I have no doubt the people will give their consent to that change.  I also welcome the other tax related Bills before the House today.</P>
    <P>I support all the measures in this Bill, many of the reforms in it are in accordance with Progressive Democrats' policy including, empowering a judge to remand a person in custody for more than eight days; allowing an accused to be remanded before a court other than the one before which he or she originally appeared; allowing a garda to give evidence of certain routine matters by way of certificate rather than orally; requiring the consent of the DPP to summary disposal of certain offences and the taking into consideration of offences when sentence is being imposed; extending the power of the District Court to issue search warrants in respect of evidence; extending the range of offences in respect of which documentary evidence is admissible.</P>
    <P>More importantly, very good measures are being consolidated today imposing express obligations on financial institutions to adopt measures to prevent and detect money laundering offences.  The latter proposal in section 10 gives effect to Article 91/308/EEC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering.  I recall the dabate on other provisions of that directive and the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 and, recently, motions on money laundering and drug trafficking were taken in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>International co-operation is vital to <Col N="954" /> assist individual States to protect their citizens from organised criminality and subversion.  There is a need for morality and the public interest to pervade the professional and commercial world. Organised criminals and terrorists can and do avail of the professions and commercial institutions to launder money and property which derive directly from crime.  Professionals here and elsewhere around the world have turned a blind eye to that.  Casinos, betting offices, property companies, haulage firms, lawyers, tax accountants and banks must reconcile the public interest with their ethical professional duties to their clients.  If there is conflict, the public interest must win out.</P>
    <P>We must continually seek to establish how effective these regulations have been to date.  Are they being adequately enforced?  How many orders have been made under section 32 of the 1994 Act which places an obligation on banks to report suspicious transactions?  I welcome the measures being introduced to spread the responsibility to a wider range of designated persons to report suspected criminality in monetary transactions.</P>
    <P>We need a single computerised database on criminals in Europe.  We need formal co-operation between member states' forensic science laboratories to enable police to track illegal drugs through the EU and to scientifically determine their source.  We need agreement among European states on jail sentences for drug trafficking.  We must establish adequate co-operation on the protection of our external borders in the union.  We need an EU funded Irish coastguard service to police our waters, borders and ports.</P>
    <P>Money laundering is a most important front in the battle against organised crime.  It is the means by which criminals can legitimately enjoy the proceeds of their crimes.  The more successful the criminal is, the more likely the need he has for money laundering. Money launderers use a wide variety of techniques including, currency smuggling, the conversion of cash <Col N="955" /> into negotiable instruments, the creative use of facilities offered by tax and financial havens, the use of shell companies, currency exchanges, brokerage houses and casinos.  There is also a very simple procedure of making large cash bets in bookies and insisting on payment by cheque.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act imposes certain obligations on what it describes as designated bodies to report suspicions of money laundering, but betting shops and on-course bookmakers are not designated bodies for the purposes of that Act.  I wonder if the Minister has considered bringing in regulations to make the betting industry subject to reporting obligations under the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>The tax amnesty introduced by a previous Administration could not have been better designed for money laundering if it had been done by the criminals themselves.</P>
    <P>While welcoming all the above measures which the Government introduced, I would like to point to a couple of issues mentioned by Deputy O'Donoghue which have not been dealt with. The preliminary investigation procedure has been criticised as being anachronistic, time consuming, expensive and irrelevant.  It is all of these things and we know it.  The present system under the 1967 Act is a revision of the Indictable Offences (Ireland) Act of 1840 and the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act of 1851. It is ridiculous that we still have this onerous, protracted preliminary investigation procedure.</P>
    <P>The system of preliminary depositions which has become useless and irrelevant predated those Acts, but prior to them the function of preliminary depositions was to gather information for the court of trial.  The aim of this procedure was that a person should not be put on trial on an indictable offence unless a <i>prima facie</i> case was made against him at an early stage. However, since the mid-19th century, many other safeguards have emerged for the citizen.  Firstly there is a constitutional guarantee of a fair trial and the <Col N="956" /> introduction of the Director of Public Prosecutions whose decision to prosecute is based on an open-minded assessment of the legal and factual merits of the case and is, in itself, an effective filter for unsatisfactory cases.</P>
    <P>A defendant now has criminal legal aid and finally, it must be remembered that in the mid-19th century where the preliminary investigation procedure was the norm, there was no appeal from the verdict of guilty on a trial on indictment except where it involved an exceptional point of law.</P>
    <P>In February 1996 when we tried to change this anachronistic procedure in our Prosecutions of Offences and Punishment of Offences Bill, the Minister acknowledged that the matter was in need of consideration.  In many cases, the accused waives the right to a preliminary hearing but a procedure has to be provided for him to waive that right. Our proposal allowed the Director of Public Prosecutions a discretion to dispense with the preliminary examination, but it would protect the accused by giving a right to a pre-trial motion in respect of the absence of a preliminary examination.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of that and of some of the measures being introduced today, is to speed up the criminal justice process in the interests of the accused and society.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of this Bill makes a slight technical change to section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the power of the Minister to remit fines and sentences, but it does not achieve any substantive change.  In the recent case of Brennan <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice, the High Court expressed concern that the power to remit sentences was being exercised as &ldquo;a parallel or alternative system of justice&rdquo;.  The High Court also warned that the Minister should exercise her power only in very exceptional cases in circumstances where she believed the judge's decision to be wholly insupportable.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill does not make any attempt to reform the existing unsatisfactory procedure.  In our Prosecution of <Col N="957" /> Offences and Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996, provision was made for the Minister to fully account for the exercise of the power by informing the relevant court and publishing details in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>The Government came under ferocious pressure arising from the murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin.  Because of that pressure, the Minister accepted an amendment to the Drug Trafficking Bill in relation to the right to silence, an amendment, incidentally, which she had voted down ten days earlier.  In doing so, the Government accepted one aspect of my amendment to the right to silence but not the other.  My amendment dealt with two aspects of the right to silence, (a) the right to remain silent while in police custody without a court drawing an adverse inference from that silence and (b) the right to remain silent while on trial without any adverse inferences being drawn from that silence.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted a change of the law in drug trafficking cases in relation to (a) but not (b).  This, of course, is illogical.  The Minister is now saying that if, at your trial, you rely on facts which you did not mention when questioned, an inference can be drawn by a jury which corroborates any other evidence of guilt.  It makes sense to change the law to allow a guilty inference to be drawn against a person who, at least, makes some defence and participates in the trial and, at the same time, the Government allows no inference to be drawn from a person who sings dumb throughout his or her trial.</P>
    <P>An amendment on the right to silence needs to be extended to all serious crimes.  We believe that at the end of a prosecution case of a serious crime such as murder, when the State has presented all its evidence against the accused, and unless the accused is entitled to a direction on the grounds of insufficient evidence, the judge has to inquire whether the accused proposes to participate in the trial.</P>
    <P>If the accused, having been called upon by the court to give evidence, fails <Col N="958" /> to do so, the court or jury is permitted to draw an adverse inference.  For those who say that the right against self-incrimination should be paramount, I say it is time that the right should be curtailed with safeguards such as the videotaping of police interviews.  Of course, there is always the safeguard that the procedure is subject to judicial discretion at all times.  We do not say that the accused should be forced to give evidence at his trial or held in contempt by failing to participate in the trial, but it is common sense to allow a court and a jury to draw its own conclusions from that failure.</P>
    <P>Talking about illogicality, at the same time as partially accepting the amendment to the Drug Trafficking Bill on the right to silence, the Minister voted down an amendment which was vital to go along with the curtailment of the right to silence.  That was to provide safeguards by allowing the videotaping of interviews between the person detained and a member or members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>We also proposed that there should be provision of medical treatment for persons detained, particularly if they have a dependence on controlled drugs. An independent audio-visual record of any interview is vital if the absolute right to silence is to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>In her reply the Minister said there was a pilot scheme for videotaping interviews.  The 1984 Act provides for this measure and yet we are still at the pilot stage.</P>
    <P>No debate on the criminal justice system would be complete without mentioning our failed prison system which costs a fortune.  It costs twice as much to run as the British prison system and is well out of kilter with international standards. We have more prison officers than prisoners as well as an inexplicable overrun of annual overtime budgets. The mismanagement and maladministration in our prison system was outlined in our policy document earlier this week, and yesterday a murderer escaped from Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>Given the seriousness of the situation facing this country with regard to crime, our criminal justice system and some of the appalling recent tragedies, I had hoped this debate would be conducted in a way which would give confidence to the public that we are all combining to ensure that long overdue and necessary reforms of our criminal justice system are put in place.  Sadly, the cheap, pathetic political point-scoring by the Opposition spokesman for Fianna Fáil has damaged the debate.</P>

      <P>It has sent a message to the public that the purpose of the Fianna Fáil Party is to try to get political brownie points for their speeches in the House.  They have no more responsibility, concern or interest in real and effective reform of our criminal justice system than they showed for years in Government when Fianna Fáil Ministers held the Justice portfolio.  I hope the public will continue to tell them that their irresponsible attitude is not what they expect from the largest party in this State.  Recent opinion polls show that their attempts to personalise, vilify and attribute every fault in our criminal justice system to me and this Government <Col N="960" /> are not gaining public credence.  Deputy O'Donoghue's attempt, within the shortest time, to win an award for the greatest number of similes, the best mixed metaphors, the best skills in onomatopoeia and any other linguistic language and methods he used today cut very little ice with the general public who are suffering and demanding action from us as legislators.</P>
      <P>The Bills published by the Fianna Fáil Party in the past 18 months would have had more credibility had they been published within the eight long years between 1987 and 1994 when there were three successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice.  I had hoped not to have to remind Fianna Fáil today of the £150,000 spent by a former Minister for Justice, Deputy Séan Doherty, on a personal letter he circulated and literature he had published by a private consultancy firm.  I had hoped not to have to remind this House of another former Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, now MEP, Gerard Collins and his expenditure of large resources almost 20 years ago, to fly around the world to examine the possibility of an air support unit for the Garda Síochána.</P>

I had hoped not to have to remind him of that but it is necessary to restore some reality to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech I endeavoured to demonstrate to the public that this Government, in union with all legislators here, would work to bring about long overdue reforms.  I thank Deputy Liz O'Donnell for her more considered approach to this debate and her clear understanding of the objectives of the provisions of this Bill.  I am deeply disappointed at <Col N="961" /> Deputy O'Donoghue's clear lack of understanding &mdash; perhaps he did not have time to peruse the Bill thoroughly &mdash; of its provisions.  Perhaps his party leader might consider appointing someone from his backbenches with greater skill in examining and analysing legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I will not renege on my responsibilities, rush through or be coerced into introducing legislation that I and my advisers consider to be flawed, that would not achieve the desired objective but conversely perpetrate or implement further mistakes in our criminal justice system. Therefore, I will take on the chin the type of personal vilification in which Deputy O'Donoghue enjoys indulging. Perhaps it goes down well on Kerry Radio or in some of the Kerry papers.</P>

      <P>Whenever I have been in a position to do so, I have taken on board any Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats Party legislative proposals or changes.  I gave a commitment that I would examine all of the points made by Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell about the overall preliminary examinations procedure, the preparation of the book of evidence and the pre-trial disposition of admissibility.  These have been under examination by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. Were it easy to implement legislative changes by a mere flick of the fingers, would the House not consider that some of my predecessors would have made some?  These are serious court practices and precedents requiring examination before being carefully and judiciously altered to match the needs of today's Ireland.  As Minister for Justice I have done and will continue to examine court practices and precedents until this Government goes to the people who will recognise that serious efforts have been made to amend or introduce appropriate legislative provision to meet the needs of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> To those who ask where is the relevant legislation and so on, I would remind them that in 1967 the Criminal Law Bill was published by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  Thirty years later it has fallen to me to publish and introduce a Bill to remove an anomaly with no bearing on today's criminal justice system, thus ensuring that those who commit serious offences cannot hide behind an antiquated and outdated interpretation of a &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;. That is real, not mere sticking plaster justice reform which appears to be the only thing Fianna Fáil believes will work here.</P>
    <P>Within the past 17 years, when almost all Ministers for Justice have been members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Henchy report on mentally ill and maladjusted persons was published.  Yet within my term of office the insanity Bill is being prepared for publication in the Office of the Attorney General.  While Fianna Fáil published an insanity Bill, with studious tardiness, it was not introduced in this House.  Deputy O'Donoghue knows the reason, because his Bill &mdash; the origins of which I will leave others to decide for themselves &mdash; is identical to one in the Department of Justice in 1991 which was subsequently altered because of different court decisions.  Within 18 months of assuming office I have brought to a head the need for improvement in our laws on insanity.  I will not listen to the type of political point scoring Fianna Fáil enjoys.  That is not what the public expects of this debate.  They expect to hear what has been and is being done.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate Deputy Bertie Ahern referred to the fact that Garda recruitment just about matched natural wastage.  It was his party's Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who, when in Government, proposed that an additional 350 gardaí be recruited annually between the years 1994 and 1997.  It was I and this Government who recognised precisely what was the result of that party's policy which is why, at my suggestion, the Government <Col N="963" /> approved the recruitment of an additional 400 gardaí.</P>
    <P>Many of the points made in the course of this debate smack of political amnesia.  While the previous Government announced the construction of a prison in Castlerea, not one single practical step had been taken before it left office.  In addition, that Government announced the erection of a women's prison in Mountjoy; yet, the only practical positive step taken was the establishment of a planning committee, comprised of representatives of women's organisations.  This Government's decision to postpone the building of the Castlerea prison for a few months has been the subject of much debate.  That postponement enabled me to undertake a serious, in depth analysis of prison places, to ensure additional prison places would be provided this year and more will be provided by the end of 1997.  Not one single prison place would be available in Castlerea now had this Government continued the Fianna Fáil proposal, the reason being that patients remain in the hospital in Castlerea. Unless that party intended building a prison around them, its proposal was not feasible since those patients are only now being moved from there.  It is better that Members do not attempt to rewrite history but rather adhere to the truth in these matters.</P>
    <P>I have already announced the publication of a comprehensive paper on crime, something not undertaken by any previous Government.  Utilising the provisions of the drug trafficking Act, I have already amended some laws relating to dancehalls and intend introducing others and I have announced a crime council to be established next autumn.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy O'Donoghue to list delays in court hearings but it would be well for him to remember that they built up during his party's time in office.  Indeed I must correct something the Deputy said.  The courts will sit an extra three weeks in September during which time every Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court, will <Col N="964" /> hear cases.  It is estimated that an average additional 100 to 120 cases will be dealt with in each of the eight Circuit Courts in those three weeks, the first time ever that the Presidents of the courts have arranged for judges to sit those extra hours.  I thank those judges for foregoing some of their otherwise free time.</P>
    <P>While mindful that the Progressive Democrats announced a large programme on prisons, the compilation of prison boards and services, it is interesting that within Fianna Fáil's three and a half year term of office there was not a single mention of prisons or a single prison place provided. Even during the Progressive Democrats' time in Government and thereafter there was not a single reference to a prison board or prison service.  I welcome the fact that those parties now see the advantage of dealing with these matters.</P>

The Deputy is a lawyear with considerable skill.

      <P>I most certainly retract what I said.  I did not mean to say that the people concerned had availed of the amnesty; what I meant to say was that they had politically reaped the benefit of the amnesty.  I was told by people whom I trust that I used the term &ldquo;avail&rdquo;, but I hope the Minister accepts that I did not mean that.  If for one moment I sought to convey that a Minister or individuals in this House availed of the amnesty I would have made that much clearer.  I regret very much if the remarks I made today on the radio <Col N="966" /> tended to suggest that the Minister or any of his colleagues had availed of the provisions of the tax amnesty Act.

He stated that I and my friends in the Labour Party who availed of the tax amnesty were warned at the time by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy McDowell in the Dáil time after time that major criminals would use that means to launder their money.  It was outrageous to suggest that I and my friends in the Labour Party, of which I am unequivocally proud, had availed of the tax amnesty.  To make that statement in such a manner is beneath contempt, and the Deputy did not have the guts, at the end of the programme, to apologise.</P>

As the Minister well knows, what I meant to convey &mdash; I have said this on many occasions &mdash; was that the Labour Party had defended the amnesty and expenditure of the proceeds of the amnesty.  That is all I intended to convey and if I gave any other impression I unreservedly withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Fewer than 100 people present today have heard that unreserved withdrawal and I trust the Progressive Democrats will ensure that a wider audience, equivalent to that which listened to this morning's programme, will hear it also.</P>
      <P>One of the steps the Government has taken to counter major organised crime, particularly in the drugs area, was to set up a special group to examine ways of targeting the assets and proceeds of criminal activities.  This group which was chaired by the Department of Justice comprised representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare.  The group made a number of proposals aimed at improving co-operation between State agencies in their fight against organised crime and to remove any obstacles which would hinder their efforts in tracking and targeting the assets of criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the group put forward a series of measures to allow for free pro-active exchange of information between Revenue and the Garda Síochána in the case of suspect assets and activities than is allowed to date by law.  Changes were also recommended to secure the anonymity, and thereby the personal safety, of Revenue officials in pursuing tax assessments of suspected persons, and to allow for the use by Revenue of <Col N="968" /> Garda intelligence information in making tax assessments without disclosure of the source of this information, unless authorised by a senior Garda officer.</P>
    <P>The group also recommended a number of amendments to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  The purpose of this Bill is to implement the important and necessary legal changes recommended by the working group and thus clear the way for closer and more concerted co-operation between the State agencies in the fight against organised crime.  The implementation of these measures will form a useful part of, and has to be seen in the context of, the overall action we are taking.</P>
    <P>As part of this it is necessary to amend and extend the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  There is a doubt whether information or material obtained under the &ldquo;money laundering&rdquo; provisions of that Act could be used by the Garda Síochána and Revenue in relation to other criminal offences or Revenue offences.  The money laundering provisions of the Act were passed specifically to meet the obligations of an EC Directive.  The Directive itself, however, permits the use of &ldquo;money laundering&rdquo; information or material in the investigation and prosecution of other offences provided specific legal provisions is made to do so.  This Bill includes a suitable amendment to the 1994 Act to allow for the wider use of money laundering information.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act already makes provision regarding applications to the courts by the Garda Síochána for search warrants for purposes related to drug trafficking and related offences.  Under existing law the warrant may be issued to &ldquo;a specific member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána as the member thinks necessary&rdquo;.  In the context of the proposed attack on criminal assets it would clearly be desirable that the warrant should allow for any non-Garda person working in or with the proposed Criminal Assets Bureau, including Revenue and Social Welfare officials, to take part in the search.  A <Col N="969" /> suitable amendment to the 1994 Act has been included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Further, the Bill also makes certain changes, which I will outline later, to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, relating to access by the Garda to the books and records of all relevant financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual sections of the Bill.  The first four sections amend the Garda Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  Section 1 inserts a new section into the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  This new section allows Revenue to provide information to a garda not below the rank of chief superintendent or to a body set up under statute or by the Government to target the assets of criminals.  To release information the Revenue Commissioners must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the information relates to a person who has derived profits from an unlawful source or activity and that the information will assist in a relevant investigation.</P>
    <P>This provision will allow for exchange of information without requiring a court order and, at the same time, provides reassurance for ordinary law abiding taxpayers.  The section maintains existing safeguards for information received by the Revenue Commissioners from another state under a double taxation treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in two respects.  First, it ensures that documents and materials concerning the identification of customers and transactions are retained by the designated bodies for use as evidence into any offence and not solely money laundering offences as provided for at present.  Second, it inserts a new subsection to enable the Minister for Justice, in prescribing a designated body by order under that section, to exempt that body from some of the obligations generally imposed on designated bodies by the 1994 Act.  This will basically allow any such order to deal with the issue of legal professional privilege where an order is made extending, for example to <Col N="970" /> solicitors, the obligation to report money laundering.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is related to section 2 and it amends section 57 of the same Act to permit information reported under that section to the Garda Síochána to be used not only in any investigation concerning money laundering but for an investigation into any other offence.</P>
    <P>The working party considered the question of extending the list of bodies and professions to which section 32 and 57 of the 1994 Act dealing with money laundering apply.  The group, and indeed the Government, acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of the members of these professions are law abiding people who would be horrified if they thought they were involved in laundering the proceeds of crime. Nevertheless, the group was firmly of the view that the extension of the money laundering reporting requirements in this way would be of considerable assistance in the fight against organised crime.  The Government has decided, therefore, that the reporting requirements of the money laundering provisions of sections 32 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, should be extended to solicitors, accountants, auctioneers and estate agents.  This can be done by the Minister for Justice by order under the 1994 Act but will take place only following detailed consultations with the professional bodies on the operational procedures and standards to be applied by the professions in question.  This will ensure effective reporting and allow for the practical operation of the requirements at professional firm level.  For the information of the House, there have already been discussions between my Department last year and the bodies representing solicitors and accountants on the operation of the existing money laundering provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 64 of the 1994 Act to enable a member of the Garda Síochána carrying out a search under a warrant issued under that section to be accompanied by any other persons, for example, a Revenue or <Col N="971" /> social welfare official, rather than, as section 64 currently provides, only other members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 to 9 are alike, making similar provisions in relation to a number of different tax heads.  Section 5 amends section 184 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section provides for the making of an assessment to income tax in the absence of a return or in circumstances where the inspector has received information as to the insufficiency of any statement received from a person. Section 5 puts beyond doubt that the inspector may, in making an assessment, use information received from the Garda Síochána.  It also provides that where Garda information is used the origin of the information is not to be revealed except with the permission of a Chief Superintendent, to protect Garda intelligence gathering.  Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 make similar provisions in relation to corporation tax, stamp duty, capital acquisitions and residential property tax, respectively, as section 5 does for income tax.  Sections 10, 11 and 12 provide for anonymity for the Revenue officials in particular circumstances. Section 10 amends section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983, which provides that where an inspector of taxes has reason to believe that an account in a financial institution is being concealed by a person for tax purposes, an authorised officer of the Revenue Commissioners may apply to the High Court seeking information regarding the account.  The changes now being made provide that, where the court is satisfied that it is in the public interest, any documents relating to an application or order under the section will omit the name and address of the authorised officer, and in any cross-examination or depositions made, the name and address of the authorised officer will not be revealed in court and the officer may give evidence in the sight and hearing of the judge and only in the hearing of anybody else.</P>
    <P>Section 11 amends section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, which provides for the assessment of tax of profits or gains <Col N="972" /> arising from unknown or unlawful activity.  The amendment related to the investigation by any body set up to target the assets of criminals and provides that where, following an investigation by such a body, an assessment is raised under section 19 of the 1983 Act by an inspector who is a member of that body, the assessment may be issued, and the tax due demanded, in the name of the body rather than in the name of the individual officer.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also relates to the anonymity of Revenue Officials involved in any body established to target criminal assets.  In particular, the section provides that, when exercising his or her powers and duties on behalf of the body, a Revenue official will not be required to identify himself or herself but will be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána who will confirm that the official is an officer of the body. Furthermore, the Revenue official will perform written duties in the name of the body and not in his or her name.</P>
    <P>Moving on to sections 13 and 14 of this Bill, it is also proposed to amend the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879 in three ways.  The purpose of these amendments is to allow the Garda greater and speedier access in a criminal investigation to documents and records in the possession of financial institutions and other entities.</P>
    <P>Under the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, the High Court may grant, on the application of a garda of superintendent rank or higher, an order permitting the Garda to inspect and take copies of the books and records of licensed banks, the State banks and building societies. However, as pointed out by the Advisory Committee on Fraud established by the Government and chaired by Mr. Peter Maguire SC, the Act can be used only in relation to a limited number of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, accordingly, in section 13 to extend the application of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act to allow the courts to make an order allowing the Garda to inspect and take copies of the financial records of credit unions, Stock <Col N="973" /> Exchange member firms, investment intermediaries, moneybrokers, <i>bureaux de change</i>, life assurance undertakings and futures exchanges.  It is also proposed to provide that the Minister for Finance may, following consultations with the Minister for Justice, add to the list of entities to which the Bankers' Books Evidence Act applied.  The list of entities is broadly similar to the list of designated bodies in section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, on which duties in respect of suspected money laundering are imposed.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 amends section 7 (a) of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, in two ways and in line with the recommendations of the Maguire report.  First, it extends the definition of a &ldquo;banker's book&rdquo; to cover documentation associated with or related to a bank's books and records, including such documentation in electronic form.  This means it will be possible for the Garda, on foot of a court order, to inspect letters and other documentation in the possession of a bank or other entity defined in the amendment to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, contained in section 13 of this Bill.  The reason for this amendment is that the Garda currently have access to the books and records of financial institutions but not to the underlying documentation on which such records are based, such as letters and lodgement slips.</P>
    <P>Second, this section provides that the Garda may apply to the District Court or the Circuit Court as well as to the High Court for an order allowing it to inspect and copy extracts from the documents of an entity to which the Bankers' Books Evidence Act applies.  This amendment will speed up the process of applying for an order under section 7 (a) of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these provisions is an urgent, measured and important part of the overall package we are introducing in response to crime.  The Bill establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau, which is before the House, will <Col N="974" /> consolidate the effectiveness of the measures in this Bill.  At the same time, this Bill will clear the way for the operational parameters of the bureau to be put in place now in advance of the enactment of the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill and for on the ground action and co-operation to take place.  I am grateful to the House for its agreement to take all Stages of this Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>The initial stages of this debate were taken up with an altercation between the Minister and Deputy Michael McDowell.  I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the car radio.  While Deputy McDowell was disingenuous in the comments he made about the tax amnesty provisions with which I will deal later, the Minister was disingenuous when he accused Deputy McDowell of trying to suggest that the Labour Party availed of the tax amnesty provisions.  Even before the apology was announced at the end of the programme I clearly understood that was not Deputy McDowell's intention.  In the interests of fair play, I do not believe for one moment the Minister thinks Deputy McDowell made that allegation.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister for Justice reply to the earlier debate and to the Minister for Finance, a man of eminent commonsense, I am convinced that a general election is just around the corner.  If there is to be such hysteria, if we are to tie ourselves in knots and get so upset in July 1996, an election is much nearer than I anticipated.  If not, I am afraid that between now and the time an election is called the level of debate in this House will sink to a low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill which I welcome would strike most ordinary people as being quite odd.  Even persons such as me who are accountants by profession appreciate the need for many of its measures to preserve evidence and allow for co-operation between various organs of State.  We must operate an unusual system, because ordinary people assumed this was being done.  Most ordinary <Col N="975" /> people and most politicians find it extraordinary that Bills have to be introduced to allow happen the things the Minister outlined.  At Question Time and on the other occasions with representatives of the Revenue Commissioners I argued for greater co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners and various reasons were given as to why this could not be done.</P>
    <P>There is a need for some of the detailed sections of the Bill because eminent counsel and solicitors all over Ireland have succeeded in protecting their clients when they should not have. It is an enabling measure only which allows for anonymity for inspectors of taxes who may have to give evidence in court.  Why is it necessary to do this?</P>
    <P>The interesting debate on crime in recent months has brought home to me a few stark facts.  I now see things in a different light and have begun to question the way middle-class Ireland thinks. The death of the journalist, Veronica Guerin, brought home to everybody, including the media and politicians, that something had to be done about crime. Many Deputies and journalists, in well researched articles, have preached this for a long time.  Other journalists have raised the issue of civil liberties and argued there are only certain steps we can take.  It was only when something happened to one of our own that this House decided it had to be seen to do something about the crime problem.  We respond in dramatic fashion when one of our own is affected.</P>
    <P>This is not directly related, but by way of analogy, the Minister and I were members of a Government which made some adjustments to the residential property tax.  In the order of £2 million would have been collected as a result of those adjustments which were made by Deputy Ahern as Minister for Finance. It amounted to tinkering at the edges.</P>
    <P>I have been an opponent of the residential property tax from the day it was introduced, but the interesting point is that this caused a furore, although for <Col N="976" /> many the adjustments meant an increase of 50p per week.  The reason it caused a future was that the adjustments affected a small group of influential people, many of whom sit in the gallery of this House and write for newspapers which report its proceedings. They did not affect ordinary men and women.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for reversing the adjustments last year.  He is well aware of my view that the residential property tax should be scrapped. The reason the adjustments were reversed was that a small group of our own were affected.  The assassination of Veronica Guerin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should not use the word &ldquo;assassination&rdquo; which was used by somebody else earlier.  It does not give it legitimacy but more &ldquo;respectability&rdquo;. Because Veronica Guerin was one of our own we decided that something had to be done and are now bending backwards to be seen to do something.</P>
      <P>All political parties in this House want to ensure they are stronger and tougher than other.  When one goes down that road it is inevitable major mistakes will be made.  Legislation which has not been properly thought out will be put on the Statute Book and we will come to regret it in time.  It is not that Deputies are stupid or self-serving, as implied by many commentators who write about politics, or ask themselves each morning what grandiose scheme they can think up to fool the people, politicians elected to this House, whether on the far right, the far left or the pragmatic centre, try to represent their constituents as best they can.  The attitude of those who write about politics and public affairs amazes me on occasion.  If they think about it further, they are doing a disservice in some of the articles they write.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which makes the necessary changes to allow for greater <Col N="977" /> co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. The issue of motivation is of as much concern to the Revenue Commissioners as it is to the Garda, the offices of the Department of Social Welfare and whatever officials will operate in this area.  We can introduce all the Bills we like from now until the year 2010 and close up every loophole, but unless we have highly motivated officials at the coal face we will be at nothing.  That is as important as putting the legal framework in place.  It is never viewed as politically popular to say these things, but it is not usual to say them either.</P>
    <P>We have to face up to a number of basic simple facts.  Prisons are for keeping prisoners; they are not for the benefit of prison officers.  Schools are for teaching and educating children, not for the teachers.  Hospitals are for the sick and people who are in need of treatment, not the consultants and those who work there.  That may seem to be logical, but it is lost on some people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that presently.  Those comments had to be made.</P>
      <P>In responding to the crime problem people think that something great will come out of shouting down others to prove who is toughest.  Unless we have highly motivated people who are given responsibility by legislators to do that job we are at nought.  That is one of the reasons I welcome the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It is one way of encouraging highly motivated people to work in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might as well face the fact that a large number of the gardaí lack motivation as much as most of the population. The good garda is asking why he or she is wasting time and effort to bring criminals to book when before he or she gets home in the afternoon the criminal is back home laughing at the garda.  That puts the garda off as much as it does the <Col N="978" /> victim of the crime.  A few simple comments like that must be made.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Minister for Finance opposed the building of prisons is that regardless of the capital cost, whether it is £10 million or £40 million, he knows that the ongoing costs will outweigh the capital costs in a few years time.  That is what the officials will tell him.  More procedures will have to be put in place and trade unions will require that there be X number of prison officers with Y days off for most of the year.  That will be the cost.  The burden on the taxpayer will mean that fewer gardaí will be on the beat because more money will be going somewhere else.  We should face these facts.  It might not be possible to say that on all occasions.</P>
    <P>The objective of this legislation is to allow for a certain level of co-operation between the different organs of State and lead to successful prosecutions.  In recent days some newspapers have headlined this Bill as an extension of the whistle blowing provisions applicable to solicitors, accountants, auctioneers and so on.  The involvement of the Revenue Commissioners meant that this Bill has to come under the auspices of the Department of Finance.  However, its provisions relate mainly to amendments to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 which dealt with money laundering.</P>
    <P>I know the Department of Justice will have read the recent comments of Mr. Justice Carney, president of a European organisation which deals with this issue and I hope the Department of Finance will also read them because it is important to examine the question of money laundering, not just in an Irish context but in a European and international context.  Only the most stupid of the drug barons and major criminals will put cash in banks and financial institutions here.  They would want to be pretty thick to do so, even under existing legislation.  Combating this type of activity requires co-operation between all European and international agencies, otherwise we will not be successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister is only giving himself <Col N="979" /> power in this Bill to designate some professionals as whistle blowers in the future.  I understand that consultations will take place between the professional bodies and the Ministers for Finance and Justice regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>I may be accused of not declaring my own professional interest.  As I am sure everybody knows, I am a practising chartered accountant and I have no objection &mdash; neither can I safely say does the Institute of Chartered Accountants &mdash; to any legislation which would require accountants to report money laundering.  There is a big difference between this provision as it relates to money laundering and the provision in its raw state which the Minister for Finance introduced last year.</P>
    <P>Any reputable accountant who would condone or not report any criminal activity or money laundering which he encountered in the books or accounts of a client would be failing in his duty as a professional accountant.</P>

    <P>I would be concerned about one issue and I hope the negotiations between the Minister and the professional body of <Col N="980" /> solicitors will attend to it.  Regardless of what a person has done, he or she is entitled to the best legal representation he or she can afford.  I have always been of that liberal view.  I did not like comments I read in recent weeks which seemed to imply that barristers and solicitors were somewhat negligent in their duties in not reporting people and also when they defend certain people.  If that is taken to its logical conclusion, one can see that we are heading down a very slippery slope.</P>
    <P>Down the years I have been very critical of the legal profession, particularly barristers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>It would be detrimental if as a result of the current crime problem measures were adopted and legislation put in place which would hinder barristers and put the lives of those whose job it is to defend criminals at risk.  The president of the Bar Council said recently that some of his members had been telephoned by irate citizens complaining that barristers had defended some of these people.  No politician worth his or her salt should go down that route.  While one may have legitimate criticisms of the legal profession it would be a bad day for this House if we did anything to jeopardise people receiving a fair trail and the best representation possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What brought the taxation system into disrepute as it relates to the criminal fraternity is that the compliant small businessman who goes to the trouble of starting up a business, mortgages his house and puts everything on the line receives letters from the Revenue Commissioners within weeks about PAYE, VAT, PRSI, corporation tax etc., and from the local authority about the planning laws.  The Revenue Commissioners give him a tax number and go after him if they think he is evading taxes.  They will keep after him day and night and persecute him until the end, and take his business from him.  The local authority <Col N="981" /> will do the same regarding planning. Likewise, the Garda Síochána will go after the person who has no tax or insurance on his car.  That should come as no surprise.  Politicians do the same. They go where they think most of the votes are.  The Revenue Commissioners go after what I term the compliant taxpayer because they can nail him.  We are trying to give the legislation enough teeth to allow the State to go after people with whom others do not want to be involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which protect the anonymity of Revenue officials because the Revenue Commissioners are charged with the care and management of taxes, not with going after criminals.  I hope when the new bureau is set up people will be allowed to volunteer to join it &mdash; there are people in the various organisations who will want to have nothing to do with it, but there are others who are anxious to be involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the matter of the tax amnesty this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  I defended Deputy McDowell against the Minister's unjustified allegations here in this House.  However, Deputy McDowell, with whom I generally agree on most issues, is wrong about the tax amnesty. I recognise that Deputy McDowell opposed the tax amnesty at the outset and has been consistent in his opposition to it since it was first introduced by the Government.  I admire his consistency in this regard.  However, I believe he is wrong in what he said during the past few weeks and on radio this morning.  To give him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he genuinely believes what he is saying in regard to this provision. On the other hand, perhaps he is being as disingenuous as I accused the Minister of being in his comments this morning.  The purpose of the tax amnesty was to give an amnesty in regard to taxation.  It was never the intention that it should apply to the proceeds of criminal activity.  There is nothing the Revenue Commissioners can do about taxes owed by a person <Col N="982" /> involved in legitimate business who availed of the tax amnesty.  On the other hand, if the Revenue Commissioners investigate assets which they suspect are the proceeds of criminal activity and the person involved produces a tax amnesty certificate, the Revenue Commissioners can discount it because the assets being investigated are the proceeds of criminal activity.  With Deputy McDowell's intellectual brightness I suspect he can work that out as easily as I can.</P>
    <P>The tax amnesty provided for anonymity, but in the recent past some journalists have said that particular criminals have availed of it.  I do not know whether that is correct and it cannot be proved one way or the other, but if journalists can speculate so can I.  I understand that perhaps one criminal involved in drugs availed of the tax amnesty.  However, that is speculation as is the suggestion that many criminals availed of it.  I agree with what the Minister said in his interview this morning about the tax amnesty, but I disagree with the political allegations he made in the House against Deputy McDowell.  I think he knows they were just political allegations because Deputy McDowell never intended what the Minister said he intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it goes and I hope it will close any loopholes which are being exploited to prevent close co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána.  On behalf of us all, I wish success to the people who will be pursuing the criminals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under no circumstances would I make an accusation which imputed any impropriety to the Minister of whom I am fond and whom I admire.  I was driving home when I heard what he calls a mealy-mouthed apology from RTE.  It was the first I heard of it and the first I had heard that any such inference could be drawn from any remarks that were made on the radio.  When I checked to find out whether it was I or the interviewer who was supposed to have said the offending <Col N="983" /> words.  I was told by colleagues whom I trust that I had said them.  I have to accept, therefore, that I used the words the Minister quoted me as saying.  Let me say definitely &mdash; and I hope &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; will make use of this statement &mdash; that under no circumstances did I ever intend to imply or in any way insinuate that the Minister or anybody connected with him had personally availled of the tax amnesty in respect of their own tax affairs.  I never intended to make such an implication and, in so far as anybody drew any such inference from what I said, I unreservedly withdraw it and regret that any inference was drawn.  I agree with Deputy McCreevy that it was obvious that my sense was different, but when I hear the words in the way in which the Minister repeated them in the House, I clearly accept that some people might have drawn another inference from what was said.</P>
      <P>The Minister will know that nobody in this House can have any knowledge of these matters.  Therefore, I would never assert on the public airwaves something which I did not believe, least of all about a person whom I admire and in whom I have trust and confidence with regard to his personal and professional integrity, my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I regret if anything I said upset him or suggested that I suspected him or anybody close to him or connected with him of having availed of the tax amnesty in the conduct of their tax affairs.  I would never say such a thing and I hope that is accepted.  I would not attempt to imply such a thing either.  I hope the Minister will accept the substance of what I said this morning and that I never wished to say anything such as that which the Minister inferred from my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy and the Minister suggested that the tax amnesty, in so far as people make declarations under section 2 (3) (iv), is fully proofed against abuse to launder criminal assets.  On paper one might think that is the case. <Col N="984" /> My difficulty &mdash; perhaps it is a subtle point but it is not disingenuous &mdash; is that my regarding of sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Act suggests that the only circumstance in which a certificate can be assailed in respect of the illegitimate source of the moneys which were the subject of the certificate is if it is proven that they were the proceeds of an unlawful activity.  However, if proof such as would permit the certificate to be cancelled in those circumstances exists, the people involved would be liable to other, more stringent and radical procedures both in criminal and civil law.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy and Deputy O'Dea, who is taking a close interest in this matter, should consult the 1993 Act carefully.  There is a separate procedure to permit reopening a case where it is suspected that people may have under-declared their tax liability. My point, and I am confident I am correct and that it is not in any way disingenuous, is that if there is an assault on the certificate under section 2 (3) (iv) of the Act, an investigation cannot be started until there is proof of abuse.  The provision is fine on paper because one can say, as the Minister did this morning on radio and as Deputy McCreevy started earlier, that the Act is proof against abuse of this type.  However, if the illicit nature of the moneys which are the subject of the amnesty and the certificate must be proven before the special collector can be asked about the documents that were furnished, and if proof is a prerequisite to investigation involving the divulging of any information under the Act, the apparent safeguard is effectively illusory.</P>
    <P>One of my constituents wrote to me, and probably to the Minister, outlining what Deputy McCreevy said today. However, one must look at the minutiae of the provision.  It appears &mdash; and I would be happy to be disabused of this view although I am convinced of its truth &mdash; that the only circumstances in which the special collector or the Revenue Commissioners can refer to the records relating to the tax amnesty and <Col N="985" /> see what money was laundered or dealt with under the Act is on a charge not of under-declaration but that the moneys were illegally obtained.  The only circumstances in which the matter can effectively be reopened is where it is proven that the declaration that the money was legally obtained is false.</P>
    <P>The Act should be amended.  I opposed the principle of the amnesty and I always believed that the apparent safeguard that people who obtained their money unlawfully can in theory be investigated is much less than it appears because a precondition to reopening of the matter is proof that the relevant declaration under section 2 (3) (iv) is false. It requires proof in the accepted meaning of that term which includes evidence that it is so and not mere suspicion.</P>
    <P>In that context my amendment to this Bill comes into play.  It proposes that the issue as to whether somebody should have their tax amnesty affairs reopened should not require proof of the falsity of the declaration as a precondition, but should require that where somebody who is responsible, a relevant person within the meaning of section 1 of this Bill, certifies to the Revenue Commissioners that he has grounds to believe, or reasonable grounds to suspect, that the funds to which a certificate relates were illegally obtained, he should be able to break the secrecy provisions of the amnesty with a view not to sustaining the matter by proof but investigating whether it is true.</P>
    <P>I accept that the principle of an amnesty is to provide certainly, draw a line under somebody's affairs and say that there will be no fudging or uncertainty about the effect of the amnesty. Otherwise people probably would not proffer their money under an amnesty. However, in a case where there are good grounds for believing, particularly in the case of an individual who was quoted in the newspapers as saying that he had availed of the amnesty, that there may have been a false declaration under section 2 (3) (iv) of the Act, it should be open to somebody in authority to reopen the issue without <Col N="986" /> proving as a precondition the falsity of the declaration in question.  That is my main point and it is not fanciful, contrived or disingenuous.  It is my understanding of the Act.</P>
    <P>I also draw the attention of the Minister and Deputy McCreevy to the different provisions which allow a matter to be reopened on grounds of under-declaration or misdeclaration.  A specific provision regarding the illegal origin of moneys was included which erects a higher procedural onus of proof on those who wish to reopen a matter on those grounds alone than exists in respect of other matters.  This is an important point.  I am open to persuasion that I am wrong about this and I would welcome being persuaded that I was wrong, but my reading of the Act is as I have described.  It affords much less protection than was imagined at the time.  The use of term &ldquo;proven&rdquo; to be false demands a standard of proof which we should never have permitted in respect of somebody who was later suspected of having abused the amnesty to launder the proceeds of crime.  That is why I tabled the amendment.</P>
    <P>On the wider principle of the Bill, I agree with Deputy McCreevy that, in general terms, this is an overdue provision. I congratulate the draftsmen for putting such ingenuity and commitment into drafting it in such a short period.  I know from the Finance Bill each year that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have an invaluable resource in terms of skilled draftsmen to produce legislation very rapidly.</P>

      <P>Remarks were made today about the division between Labour and the Department of Justice. I can see the hand of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners draftsmen throughout this Bill and I commend them for their comprehensive approach to the problem. Why has it taken until now for us to do <Col N="987" /> this?  I am not making any points because this problem has existed for a considerable period, and virtually every party in this House has been in office at some stage during the period in which the problems which this Bill is trying to deal with arose.</P>
      <P>It is sad that anonymity has to be granted to Revenue Officials and that we have to provide in law for the erection of screens in the appeal commissioner's courtroom and in any other courtroom. It is a sad degradation of the administration of justice in public that these provisions are being brought before us but certainly they are necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not blame Revenue officials for being reticent about becoming involved in a high powered agency to pursue bosses of organised crime when one has regard to what has happened in the past to inspectors and Revenue officials who have attempted, without such protection, to pursue their duties.  It is true, as Deputy McCreevy has said &mdash; and it is probably correct in one sense &mdash; that they concentrate their efforts on where the greatest reward is available, because that makes common sense in terms of maximising the State's revenue.  By the same token, the State must be careful and jealous to ensure that no hint of intimidation or threat has the effect of procuring immunity from taxation, social welfare laws or the ordinary criminal laws, for a small minority.  Lamentable though it may seem to some, that people will give evidence from behind a screen and much though we have deprecated people in Northern Ireland giving evidence from behind screens perhaps in circumstances where there was not adequate justification for it, we now find ourselves dealing with a situation where such protections are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency &mdash; the Minister will agree because he shares the same constituency &mdash; there have been occasions when hardened criminals have done things to our constituents, both individually and collectively, which would normally speaking, evince some <Col N="988" /> condemnation by their local elected representatives. There have been occasions when I have been careful to consider whether I would make a statement in public or condemn in public particular activities, because of the same feeling that, doubtless, the Revenue Commissioners officials have.  It is all very well to say something in public and to issue a press release but it is a different matter to deal with an annonymous note about the route your child takes to school.  Politicians, including me, should not by anything we say suggest that these lamentable but necessary provisions might not be necessary if others were willing to do their duty.  That is not the case.  One cannot expect ordinary people who serve the State well and diligently in every respect to expose themselves and their families to the kind of blackguardism and the savagery that has been meted out to some.  Some people have been seriously injured orhave lost limbs.  I refer to a former forensic scientist who was seriously mutilated for taking on not subversive crime but organised crime.  Other people in the Department of Social Welfare paid a very heavy price in terms of assaults on their person for similar activities. Others have had their property destroyed when trying to carry out their duties under the social welfare and taxes Acts.  In that context we have to be realistic.  If we are to get tough on crime, let us at least give every decent protection to those whom we expect to be the front line soldiers in the pursuit of the assets of organised criminals.</P>
    <P>This is well thought out legislation. Doubtless there are aspects of it which could have been improved if more time had been available.  By the same token I fully appreciate the position in which the Minister found himself.  A year after inter-agency co-operation was announced as desirable in principle and was about to be put into practice, he found there were genuine obstacles to procuring such co-operation which had to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Politics being what it was, if he had spent months preparing this legislation <Col N="989" /> and allowed months between each Stage and months sending it through the Seanad he would probably have got a fair amount of stick from this side of the House.  I have to concede there is an element of urgency about getting on with this process which this Bill will adequately address.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions of the Bill but, for the Minister's and Deputy McCreevy's benefit, the amendment I have tabled is solely required because my interpretation &mdash; it may be an erroneous interpretation &mdash; and my conviction is that there is an error in the tax amnesty legislation.  Although the tax amnesty legislation provided that somebody could not avail of it in respect of illegally obtained money and required a declaration to the effect that all moneys, subject to the amnesty, were not from an illicit source, the Act also provided that the certificate granted under the amnesty was liable to revocation if that were not the case.  Unfortunately an overly high standard of proof was required, that the Revenue Commissioners or whoever wanted to reopen the matter had to prove the falsity of the declaration made under section 2 (3) (iv) of the 1993 Act.  That requirement conferred an immunity in practice &mdash;which was probably not the intention of anybody who drafted the legislation &mdash; except in the most unlikely of circumstances where proof becomes available to the Revenue Commissioners which would enable them to reopen the matter.  A lower standard of proof should be required to reopen the tax amnesty legislation on this point.  Under a lower standard of proof, someone who is in a responsible position, such as a relevant person within the meaning of section 1 of this Bill &mdash; which will be inserted in the 1994 Act &mdash; could in a certificate, state that he had reasonable grounds to believe there had been an abuse of the tax amnesty to achieve the laundering of illegally gotten moneys and that in those circumstances he would be entitled to inquire into the circumstances and the representations made by the person claiming the <Col N="990" /> amnesty and the benefit of the certificate, not merely to revoke but to investigate whether revocation of the certificate was appropriate in any particular case.</P>

      <P>It is with some reluctance that I contribute to this debate as I am very much afraid there is a danger that one is participating in a kind of gadarene rush to legislation without really examining what we are legislating for. Last Sunday I was struck by the remarks of the new Garda Commissioner when he recalled the simple fact that our legal system requires that in order to obtain a conviction matters must be proven in court and that the Garda Síochána must produce evidence.  I am not accusing the Minister for Finance of trying to subvert this requirement but there is very much an atmosphere that wants to do away with it.  However, we would do away with such a requirement or interfere with it at our peril.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the immoderate language we have heard recently about the need for legislation has shown the dangers of this.  For example, yesterday on radio Deputy O'Donoghue made the most amazingly idiotic statement that no Bill had ever been brought before this House about which there was the slightest constitutional doubt.  If that had been the case we would hardly ever have heard from Deputy Michael McDowell whose stock-in-trade is to come into the House and say there is a constitutional doubt about a Bill.  There is room for doubt about a Bill which will be before us today.  Some days ago I read the remarks by Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; one of the great proponents of legislation in this case &mdash; about this other Bill and if she is not getting cold feet then she at least has some chilliness in her toes because she now accepts there may be some constitutional difficulties. <Col N="991" /> That is the danger of rushing into legislation in cases like this.</P>
    <P>The Bill illustrates the opposite difficulty. I would like to know &mdash; I ask the Minister for Finance to speculate a little on this &mdash; why this action has not been taken before now, particularly as some provisions in the Bill build on provisions put into our legislation at various times since 1983 to deal with criminal activity. One of the provisions in the Bill builds on a provision I put into the Finance Act, 1983, and which was specifically designed to deal with the problems now facing us.  There is no evidence that that provision has ever been acted on with any particular energy and I would like to know why.  I would like to hear successive Ministers for Finance since 1987 say why this is so, given that it is not only this year we have had difficulties and a public outcry that some people with large amounts of unaccountable income seem to get away with it and have not been hassled or harassed by the Revenue Commissioners in the same way they have hassled or harassed many ordinary law abiding citizens, including old age pensioners who happen to have an income from a pension other than a State pension, and who a few years ago got assessments from the Revenue Commissioners for amounts of tax assessed to be due which they could not possibly owe.</P>
    <P>I understand that there have always been difficulties in inter-agency co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda.  It is a scandal that the Minister for Finance now finds, a year after this was expressed as firm Government policy, that he has to deal with the obstacles.  What is worse is that although this problem had been identified as long ago as 1983 neither the Revenue Commissioners nor the Garda seem to have worked out what their problems are in practice in the meantime. This is not to blame successive chairmen of the Revenue Commissioners or successive commissioners of the Garda; it is due to the fact that a succession of Ministers for Finance did <Col N="992" /> not spend the time to annoy and provoke successive commissioners of the Garda Síochána and successive chairmen of the Revenue Commissioners to make the system work.</P>
    <P>Section 1 enables the Revenue Commissioners to delegate their functions to certain authorised officers.  What was the reason for the delay in enabling them to do that up to now?  This is not to say that I oppose the measure.  I support it and welcome the fact that at long last the Fianna Fáil Party also supports it.  It is curious that between 1983-87 &mdash; and I speak with knowledge of the facts &mdash; every provision of this kind proposed in a Finance Bill, and many were proposed and legislated during that period, was opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party. It would make a cat laugh to now hear the moral indignation of that party about the length of time it has taken to do these things.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains a new provision under which members of the Garda Síochána who are carrying out a search in certain conditions can be accompanied by another person rather than a garda.  This is a key provision and I would like the Minister to outline the persons other than members of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners he might have in mind.  As the section is now drawn, the Garda Síochána could decide that anybody else would accompany them.  I am not against this as it would be useful for them to have members of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners accompanying them, but does the Minister for Finance think there are other people who should be authorised in this way and why?  I cannot offhand think of any other branch of the State administration which should accompany the Garda but I would like to know if there is another group the Minister thinks should accompany them in those circumstances.  I ask this question because, as it is framed, the section is very wide and we should not leave it so wide that it could be used for a purpose not intended by the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends section 184 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, it provides extra <Col N="993" /> powers for the Revenue Commissioners to make assessments and builds on a power they already have.  Will the Minister for Finance say to what extent the Revenue Commissioners have used their existing powers and, if they have not used them up to now, why not?  This is a fault many Members on all sides of the House and the public have seen up to now.  The difficulty in the public perception of tax administration is that it seems the only people who have been pursued up to now are those already in the system.  People who are not in the Revenue system were not pursued and it cannot be argued that they were not pursued because we did not know they were there.  There has been enough talk over the past 15 years about this problem, including unregistered contractors and unregistered people of all kinds, to have altered the Revenue Commissioners and successive Ministers for Finance, the people with whom I have an argument, to use the powers and go after them.  It may well be legitimate to expand the powers but the lesson we should learn from the situation which has existed on up to now is that it will be incumbent on the Minister for Finance for as long as he is in office &mdash; and long may he reign &mdash; and every one of his successors to make themselves systematically obnoxious to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioner to make sure they use the powers they are being given in the fashion intended.</P>
    <P>The evidence is that both arms of the State have been failed to use powers they have been given since 1983 in a way which would have made some inroads in dealing with this problem.  If those powers needed to be amended in the way we propose to amend them today we could have had those amendments in place long before this debate took place, as we should have if there is a real need for them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell's last comment.  Provisions in this Bill provide anomymity for some of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a measure of the problem that has existed <Col N="994" /> in this State for many years that we have to do that.  That has been the position in regard to Customs officers for a long time.  I am delighted we are adopting this measure so those officials can operate properly in conjunction with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to today's important debate on crime.  The drugs epidemic is a crisis facing Dublin and many major urban areas.  Organised crime here is represented by a group of vicious and ruthless individuals.  However, we are fortunate that this group is still relatively small and can be tackled effectively with the right measures and sufficient determination.  It should be emphasised that, according to the most recent information available, the number of recorded crimes in this State has fallen.  A number of years ago elderly people living in remote areas in my constitutency and indeed, throughout the west, were terrified by gangs carrying out a campaign of terror of robbing and plundering pensioners' homes in rural Ireland.  However, thanks to the joint efforts of people in rural communities and the Garda, the number of such attacks has been reduced dramatically.</P>
      <P>In essence, we are talking about the drugs crisis today.  It is clear that the interaction between organised crime and drugs is the major threat.  However, it must be said that the legislation before us taken in isolation does not and cannot provide the answer to all our problems.  It is only part of the overall package and until such time as all aspects of the package are put in place we will have difficulties in overcoming the drugs crisis.  It must be emphasised &mdash; unfortunately many Members of the Opposition tend to ignore this &mdash; that the drugs problem has its roots in poverty, unemployment and social disadvantage. Its effect is to ravage communities already blighted by other problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the most draconian law and order legislation will not resolve the drugs problem if genuine efforts are not made to reduce social disadvantage and <Col N="995" /> poverty and if further efforts are not made to provide employment opportunities for thousands of our young people.  It is obvious that in Dublin the drugs problem has ravaged whole communities already plagued by other social problems.  Statistics show that more than 80 per cent of those being treated for heroin addiction in the Dublin area are unemployed, yet what positive proposals are put forward in this House to address issues of inequality when increased funding is allocated to public and social housing, health and social welfare services, improved education services and employment creation?  The same Opposition Deputies who called for action on the drugs problem are the first to call for cuts in public spending.</P>
    <P>On this legislation it should be noted that concern has been rightly expressed on the issue of civil liberties and the need to protect the rights of citizens. Many Members remember the activities of the infamous heavy gang, a group of thugs who destroyed the reputation of the Garda Síochána in the 1970s.  All Deputies have an obligation to ensure that there will never be a return to the tactics of the heavy gang, and in this context it would be most useful to review the anti-drugs legislation from time to time as the fight against the drug barons continues.</P>
    <P>The drugs epidemic is a crisis facing Ireland.  It demands a crisis response. The growth of organised crime also demands that we be prepared to fight fire with fire and to do so without undermining our democratic institutions. The interaction between organised crime and drugs is the major threat. We are not dealing with small time pushers or a small time problem.  The base from which we must start is that the corruption of young people through hard drugs is the key to a lucrative business for the people involved in the trade.  We know that they are prepared to stop at nothing and our response must be as determined.  However, it must also be measured and accountable. I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support this legislation and congratulate the Minister for Finance on introducing it.  Ironically, this legislation could have been in place more than 12 months ago were it not for the opposition of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil at that time to section 153 of the Finance Bill, 1995. Both parties have behaved with incredible hypocrisy.  They vociferously opposed that section which allowed for the curbing of tax evasion by requiring tax advisers, accountants and solicitors to disclose any evidence of tax evasion to the Revenue Commissioners, at the time of its introduction.  If that measure had been adopted we would not have to introduce legislation to deal with the matter today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear that this measure, and the provisions in this legislation, emanated from the beef tribunal and from the Minister for Finance's financial legislation 18 months ago.  We are delighted that at last everybody is of the view that the legislation is appropriate and that it will deal with the problems of tax evasion in areas that have not been dealt with before.  All tax advisers, accountants, solicitors and so on will be required to disclose any evidence of tax evasion to the Revenue Commissioners and that is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the package produced by the Government.  There is a serious intent by the Government to introduce legislation but, at the same time, I acknowledge that we have severe legislation that could be described in most democracies as draconian.  There is provision for seven day's detention, the right to silence has been limited and there will be a constitutional referendum on bail in the future.  However, unless we implement that legislation in the manner in which it is intended, we will not make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána approached legislators after the previous administration took office in 1992, and demanded that we introduce a public order Bill that would allow them to move on or arrest people loitering at street corners which is where the drug pushers meet and peddle drugs.  This legislation has been in place for nearly three years and it has scarcely been used.  The reason the Garda wanted it <Col N="998" /> was because the old law of loitering had been found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The new legislation has scarcely been used for the purpose for which it was intended.  Unless we have targeting of suspects by the Garda, a willingness and determination by the Garda and efficiency and direction of resources by the Garda this legislation will be dangerous and futile.</P>
    <P>This is only one part of a package. The other part is at least as important. If we do not introduce measures to deal with poverty and unemployment, provide treatment, education and estate management services and hand power back to local communities to deal with the problem at a local level, as many communities are anxious to do, this part of the package will be useless.  While the provision of £60 million is important, the other half of the package is equally important.</P>

This legislation will enable the Minister for Finance extend to the professions the provisions of the money laundering legislation which currently exist for financial institutions. That is an entirely different provision from that contained in section 153.  As Deputy McDowell correctly stated, that section was withdrawn by the Government after the Attorney General said it was unconstitutional.  It was not accepted by all sides of the House.  I did not accept it, but I cannot speak for <Col N="999" /> other members of my party, whom I am sure will stand over what they said at that time.

      <P>The Minister stated that section 2 of this legislation will enable him extend money laundering provisions to the professions. This will be done by order following consultation with the professions. While I welcome the provisions of section 2, will the Minister clarify whether the House will have an opportunity to debate the order?  The Minister accepts that it will not apply to the professions in the same way as it applies to the financial institutions under the 1994 legislation, there will be exemptions, exceptions and so on.  A debate on this matter is currently taking place with the professions.  As the order will institute far-reaching changes, the House should have an opportunity to debate it when it is finalised.</P>
      <P>I do not have a great deal to say about this legislation mainly because I received it only last night.  While I appreciate the Minister's difficulties in this regard, as the Bill contains significant, but desirable changes, we should have had more time to examine its details.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we should get more notice of legislation we are expected to pass in one day.</P>
      <P>The legislation basically provides for the free flow of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána.  The Minister may be aware that this was the subject of a Law Reform Commission report in the early 1990s which stated that such a procedure might present legal difficulties. This was dealt with in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which provided that an application had to be made to the District Court for an order to allow the Revenue Commissioners provide such information to the Garda.  Has that provision ever been used?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Has an application in that regard been made to the District Court and, if so, how often?  There are hundreds of pages of legislation giving greater powers to the Revenue Commissioners but they are reluctant to use them.  I can recall many cases in which they could have used all those powers without exposing anybody to danger, but they did not do so.  I recently tabled a question to the Minister for Finance outlining the powers that have been in existence since 1983 and asking how often the Revenue Commissioners used them.  In most cases the answer was &ldquo;never&rdquo;.  They availed of one of the minor provisions approximately three times.  Why do they not use these provisions? Fear cannot be the only explanation. I recall circumstances in which the power to enter premises and seize <Col N="1001" /> documents could have been used without exposing anybody to danger, but it was not.  Deputy McCreevy is correct in stating that this legislation will only be as good as the officials who implement it.  The Revenue Commissioners constantly demand these powers.  It is pointless enacting legislation if its provisions are not implemented.  Perhaps the new bureau will assist in this regard. The attitude of the Revenue Commissioners must change.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall give the Garda certain information.  To do so a Revenue official will have to form the opinion that the information will assist the Garda in their investigation of a crime and that it is in the public interest. What would happen if the official did not believe the information would be in the public interest or assist in the investigation of a crime?  A mechanism should be built into the legislation to break such a logjam.  Time will be of the essence in implementing the provisions of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The legislation states that the Revenue Commissioners will accept as reasonable an assessment of residential property tax if it is submitted within 30 days after the date of the assessment made by the commissioners, but that does not apply to other forms of taxation. Is there a particular reason for inserting that additional provision in respect of residential property tax?</P>
      <P>Sections 5 to 9 will allow the Revenue Commissioners use information they receive from the Garda in making assessments.  As there were some legal doubts about the extent to which they could use such information, I am glad sections 5 to 9 clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this legislation provides for the free flow of information between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners, what section compels the Garda to supply information to the Revenue Commissioners for tax assessment purposes? The legislation compels the Revenue Commissioners to supply information to the Garda, but there is not a corresponding provision which compels the <Col N="1002" /> Garda to supply information to the Revenue Commissioners when they request it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983.  As far as I can deduce, the only amendment in this legislation is to protect the identity of the authorised officer conducting the investigation, which is necessary with the establishment of the bureau, and in light of the current crime situation. However, how often has section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983, been used since it was passed 13 years ago?</P>
    <P>Section 11 amends section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983 which allows the Revenue Commissioners to raise income tax assessments where they are uncertain of the origin of the proceeds or where they think they may be &mdash; or are certain they are &mdash; from an illegal source.  How many times has this provision been used since the Act was passed?</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy McDowell said about the tax amnesty.  I have not had an opportunity to consider his amendment and I cannot comment properly on his argument without looking at the sections to which he referred. However, a parallel argument has been advanced outside this House to the effect that the tax amnesty would somehow put a barrier in the way of investigations in an application to freeze the assets of suspected criminals.  Let nobody be under any illusion that that is not so.</P>
    <P>The position under the legislation initiated by Fianna Fáil in relation to the freezing of assets is that if the Revenue Commissioners or the Garda Síochána form the opinion that these assets represent the proceeds of crime they can apply for an interim order which will last for seven days <i>ex parte</i>&mdash; the respondent will not be told about it. After those seven days have expired, the State can apply for an interlocutory order which will freeze those assets for up to seven years.  After that period has elapsed, the State can apply for a disposal order to sell them.  If the person who owns or controls the assets wants <Col N="1003" /> to retain them he will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that they do not represent the proceeds of crime. Everybody here can be certain that the production of a certificate stating that the person has availed of the tax amnesty will not discharge that burden of proof.</P>
    <P>It is fairly common knowledge that the offshore subsidiaries of the four main banks, particularly those in the Channel Islands, are being used on a wide scale by criminals for money laundering purposes.  Have the four main banks and their offshore subsidiaries ever been audited by the Revenue Commissioners? If not, why not?  Will the Minister give us a guarantee they will be audited now?</P>
    <P>Under the Finance Act, 1986, the Revenue Commissioners have the right to inspect the register of offshore accounts.  It is my information that the Revenue Commissioners have not availed of this power, which they have had for a decade.  Will the Minister confirm or deny that?  If not, why not?</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of an overall package.  I welcome it and compliment the officials in the Department of Finance on drafting it so quickly.  It is one part of the legislative response to the crime problem.  Neither the legislative nor overall response, in so far as we have heard the Government's intentions, will be sufficient.  We need a response, not just on the legislative front, dealing with policing methods, the prison system, the rules of evidence etc. which will not just create the illusion that we are trying to get to grips with the problem or just trying to score political points with the public and the media, which have understandably been affected by the death of the late Veronica Guerin.  Today's debate and the legislation we are passing must be part of the process of putting an end to the phenomenon of untouchability in Irish society.  The public will accept nothing less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw a television programme last night presented by Mr. Derek Davis, the message of which was quite remarkable.  It indicated to me, and other viewers, the dreadful problem this community faces.  The message from the &ldquo;Davis&rdquo; programme was that this is a national emergency.  At the end of the programme Deputies and Senators were urged to go to a meeting at Buswells Hotel in Kildare Street this afternoon between 1.30 p.m. and 3 p.m.</P>
      <P>I went to that meeting and was startled by what I heard there.  We had a very serious drugs problem in Dún Laoghaire which I was very involved in trying to exterminate, but which is tragically beginning to rear its ugly head again.  The meeting in Buswells Hotel was presided over by a number of inner city community representatives.  The communities are doing their best to deal with this emergency in the inner city and on its periphery.  I was startled by one figure they provided, which is that £260 million is exchanged annually in the so-called drugs industry among the hierarchy of drug barons, peddlers, pushers and addicts.  This Bill is part of the mosaic of legislation to deal with this industry with which we are being asked to deal in a rather hurried fashion today, unfortunately.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the Minister has produced a Bill which we are being asked to pass without examining it.  I take the Minister's point that certain members of my party saw the Bill in advance, and probably sufficiently far in advance to study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my appreciation to the people who held the meeting in Buswells Hotel for the work they are doing on a voluntary basis.  They are dealing with a growing problem and this House has an obligation to support them.  They said the package of legislation produced is worthwhile to the extent that it will effectively remove the drug barons.  However, it will not deal with another fundamental problem which must be dealt with by treatment, education and supporting the local communities to deal with the problems in their own communities &mdash; the old Sinn <Col N="1005" /> Féin policy of &ldquo;we ourselves&rdquo;.  The people want to deal with this problem but they need support.  That is the message from the meeting in Buswells Hotel, for which I am deeply grateful.  The important message is that while the questions of bail, prisons and extra gardaí must be addressed to deal with this huge emergency, other matters are not being dealt with at present by this House.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the civility of the Minister for Finance but he should teach the Minister for Justice a lesson in good manners.  If we are to deal with this problem, can we do so on a consensus basis?  Can we deal with it as a House rather than have this constant confrontation? I find it quite unacceptable and tedious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said when I was on the Opposition benches; it is not an exaggeration to say that the drugs and crime problem is the greatest epidemic since the outbreak of TB and unless we treat the crime problem with the necesary seriousness, we will not solve it, irrespective of what laws we pass.  There is an element of point scoring and political game playing associated with it, but they do not contribute to solving the problem.  I am thankful such game playing has been largely absent from this debate and I do not seek to inject it into it.</P>
      <P>We need a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem and some elements of it are in place, but by no means is it complete.  A meeting of the ministerial task force chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, of which I am a member, will take place at 5 p.m. and will consider another element of that plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An implementation council is also required.  We must call a spade a spade if we are determined to solve this problem. Many people who are not elected politicians are playing politics with the crime problem.  People outside this <Col N="1006" /> House play games and play one Member against another and some of them are well remunerated to do their jobs. Officers of this State who are remunerated to do a particular job should be made more accountable.  We should seek to ensure that politics are left to the politicians; this is an issue on which Mr. Justice Carney commented during the week.  The leaking of evidence to journalists which could prejudice a case, as in the case of a dispute between Garda management and Garda trade unions where somebody gets a favour which can be called on at a later stage, is not the way to run the Garda force, but such games are being played.</P>
    <P>I will repeat what I said a few weeks ago.  There was a time when a TD could have a garda moved, but now a garda can have a TD moved.  It is time we had the courage to stand up and say that; it is what we are all saying <i>sotto voce.</i>  We must not put the cart before the horse. The Garda force must be fully supported, but we are entitled to require that its members behave in an impartial, non-political manner and keep their noses out of politics, whether they are members of Garda management or Garda trade unions.</P>
    <P>I wish the incoming Garda Commissioner well.  He has a difficult task ahead of him.  He should keep away from high society receptions and meet the ordinary people.  If Garda management spent more time meeting the local community &mdash; this was not possible on many occasions in the past although there were exceptions &mdash; and less time at high society functions, it would get a feel for people's concerns about crime. People, be they politicians, civil servants or members of the public, are saying <i>sotto voce</i> that the present Garda operation is not contributing fully to solving this problem.  For that reason the examination of the Garda force is important.</P>
    <P>When the elements of the plan are fully in place an implementation council, similar to the European co-ordinating committee chaired in the past by Deputies Kitt and Geoghegan-Quinn <Col N="1007" /> and which I chair now, should be established where those responsible for elements of it can come together and shortcomings can be dealt with by directing people to address them. Unless there is such accountability, we will fail to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>The crime problem is associated more with order than with law.  The vacuum in the law is largely being filled by the type of Bills introduced by my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Finance.  We can pass as many laws as we like but we will still have a serious problem if there is no order.  By &ldquo;order&rdquo; I mean that any offender sentenced to prison by the courts should serve the full sentence handed down.  Offenders should know that there is a prison place for them.  Any person who does not need to be in prison should not be sent there.</P>
    <P>The prison system should not be part of the problem, it should be part of the solution.  Mothers accept that their sons have done wrong and that they should serve their sentences but they plead with me to ensure they do not serve their sentences in Mountjoy.  They tell me their sons do not take drugs but, if they are sent to Mountjoy, they will come out of prison taking drugs.  They ask if their sons could be sent to Cork Prison and that they would travel to see them.  That is the prison system which this Government administers.  I and both sides of this House are part of the problem because we have allowed it to develop.  When talking about providing more prison places, we must also talk about prison reform.  If people say we are bleeding hearts, they are also part of the problem and we must give them leadership.</P>
    <P>I would favour the appointment of an independent prisons inspector.  I am not talking about somebody being remunerated: It could be a former bishop, ombudsman, an honest broker who would tell it as it is.  The prison system is not part of the solution, it is part of the problem.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the housing <Col N="1008" /> committee of Dublin Corporation for 16 years, Lord Mayor of Dublin, a Member of this House since 1981 and a Minister of State with responsibility for local development, and, consequently, for training for tenants in the context of the local partnership.  Two weeks ago I wrote to Dublin Corporation about a house in my constituency.  The essence of my letter was that there is a house which is owned by the corporation; the elderly tenants on either side are terrified; the house is open day and night, the lock is broken; there is a drug pusher living there and all types of people are frequenting it and the people next door find needles in their gardens. I pleaded with the corporation to do something about the problem.  I received a letter from Dublin Corporation a fortnight later thanking me for my representations.  I was told that if I could get four local people to put the complaint in writing, the corporation would investigate it.  I rang the person in charge of the housing department and asked him what he would do if the house was privately owned by him.  I said I was sure he would secure his premises.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Dublin Corporation given that this type of estate management is tolerated?  Where is the order in that?  We are not being heeded. Officials in Dublin Corporation, and perhaps in other authorities, whether in management or trade unions, are thumbing their noses at us and getting away with it.  I was Lord Mayor and I failed to deal with this problem and the housing committee of Dublin Corporation continues to fail to deal with it. We will not solve the problem unless we bring the management, the local authority tenants, the Garda and the trade unions involved together.  We have the funds to train them together to manage their estate.  All that is needed in complexes such as Dolphin House, Fatima Mansions or St. Teresa's Gardens, where there are 400 flats, is one or two drug pushers or other criminals and the complex becomes run down because nobody is in charge.  The people living <Col N="1009" /> there are terrified and decent tenants move out and these complexes become the centre of criminal activity.  People travel from Dún Laoghaire and other nice areas by bus or taxi to such areas to buy drugs because we do not insist on establishing order, not law but order. Who takes responsibility?  The City Manager, the City Council and all those people who are paid in the Custom House should take responsibility and the Government and the Legislature are entitled to ensure that they take responsibility.  If we restore order in the prison system, in estate management, in the Garda Síochána and throughout the system, we will help solve the crime problem.</P>
    <P>We have created an unprecedented number of judges.  It was recommended by the Denham Committee that we might consider establishing a court services authority, which I favour.  I want a tough person appointed chief executive of such an authority who will stand up to the judges and say that the administration of the courts will not be at the mercy of the judges who are there to serve the people, not the judicial system. The judges have got away with murder for long enough.  They have a well remunerated if difficult job, they are honourable people but they must be called to account.  They are paid out of the public purse and we are entitled to require that they deliver a service and furthermore, they should mix with the people whom they do not live among. Some of us do not reside in our constituencies but we are there all the time.  One of the faults of this parliamentary system is that we are among the people so much.  The judges are not out there among the people.  In the past they required Dublin Corporation to produce four witnesses and written evidence which was totally unrealistic.  We are entitled to say to the judges that we have had enough of their interfering with the Legislature and the Executive. The tail will have to be wagged a bit and judges will have to change the way they do their business.  That is what is called <Col N="1010" /> establishing order.  There will, of course, be a strong lobby against that.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about law and order, let us talk about being tough enough to call public servants to account whether they be judges, civil servants or Garda management.  We must ask them what they do to earn their keep.  It is not just about law, the Dáil and the elected politicians, including the Minister for Justice. There is a serious absence of order.</P>
    <P>I have not heard enough in this debate about the absence of social justice. We have had an unprecedented growth in material wealth.  Never at any stage in our history has the country been as materially well off as it is now.</P>

      <P>Yet, there are terrible divisions in society.  We are in danger of doing what centuries of invaders have never done; creating a two nation state of haves and have nots. Our primary vehicle for trying to turn around disadvanaged communities is called local development.  Few Members understand local development, perhaps it is too new a concept.  Deputy Seán Haughey was complimentary about it recently.  He has a pilot scheme in his constituency and he understands it. Members should try to understand it.  It is an integrated plan because it supplements education and training facilities in poor communities.  It assists in removing environmental dereliction which brings down a community.  It provides money for training tenants in estate management and for the creation of jobs in local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will facilitate targeted communities in creating over 8,000 jobs in the coming four years.  These local development plans are tailored to communities so that one for a part of Dublin will be different from one for Donegal. Because local people are involved it empowers them, but it also requires them to take responsibility.  We must breed the taking of responsibility. People are quite capable of running their communities if we give them the <Col N="1011" /> power to do so.  We cannot, however, give power without responsibility or responsibility without authority.  Local development is an exciting Irish concept we can actually make work to bring about a greater sense of social justice.</P>
    <P>In the inner city part of my constituency some 15 per cent of people have access to third level education.  What view would Members have of themselves if they lived in a community where there was no access to third level education, huge unemployment and where housing estate management is left to go to rack and ruin?  Would they identify with the establishment?  Would they feel themselves a part of the system? That is the sort of society we are running but local development and local authorities can do something about it.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has a plan for treating drug addicts.  I used to be horrified by the idea of exchanging needles but I have overcome that fear because needles are being abandoned everywhere.  In church grounds and school yards young and old alike can prick themselves with such needles and must then worry about whether they have contracted HIV.  At least with a needle exchange you get the needles back.  A priest in my constituency tells his helpers when they are cleaning out the yard to wear rubber gloves when cleaning behind barrels, etc.  People heat heroin over candles in church.  This is the sort of society we have.  In broad daylight people are extracting all sorts of drugs from private orifices.  They swallow drugs and then vomit them up again.  These are terrible words to use but it is the reality of life in inner city Dublin.</P>
    <P>The health board has come up with a plan.  I do not know if it will work but we should give it a try because it was proposed by qualified people.  We should keep it under review and should be able to amend it or adjust it if we have an implementation council. However, although it is a community-based approach, the resistance to this <Col N="1012" /> plan is coming from the very communities, for example, the Eastern Health Board is trying to help.  As elected representatives in those communities we are all over the place but we would perform a public service if we stopped going to meetings where all sorts of irrational nonsense about these issues is applauded.  Instead, the health board should consult people by way of public information days from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. I gather the Eastern Health Board is about to do this and in that way cannot be descended upon by large numbers. People can come in twos and threes to have their questions answered instead of being drummed up into a frenzy by some chairman who says &ldquo;Get it off your chest so that we can block the attempt to deal with the drugs problem&rdquo;. The health board needs to approach it in that way.  They have a plan so let us work at it and keep it under review.  That is also called order.</P>
    <P>We have moved greatly towards filling the vacuum with some of the laws we have put forward but it will not work unless we also tackle the order problem and unless there is somebody tough and determined enough to upset a few people.  I am sick and tired of listening to permanent paid officials lecturing the Legislature and the Executive.  It is time we gave them a lecture and told them to do the job for which they were appointed.  It is time we had accountability from the system so that the problems I have outlined will be attended to.</P>
    <P>I hope that some of the matters I mentioned will be implemented as a follow up to what happened in the last few weeks.  People think that being a law and order Deputy is to be right wing but I am not a right winger.  Law and order means social justice to me.  If there is no law and order the person who suffers most&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is natural in the adversarial system that we have to try to score points off one another but when we talk privately we know what the problem is.  It is time for us to seek the solution from the system. Much more reform is needed before we can have a complete plan in place.  It is not the responsibility of any one Minister. Part of it is my area as Minister of State with responsibility for local development and for European affairs.</P>
      <P>While the problem is mainly one for member states the European Union could do much more collectively to deal with the problems at source.  There could be centres of excellence for member states to feed off for best practice in implementing national rules.  It is time that more Members understood the problem.  This is the worst epidemic we have had since TB and unless we take the same serious approach to it, not just a fire brigade service, we will not overcome it.  We have shown we have the elements of that in the legislative area but we now also need to cover other areas in a comprehensive plan which will be overseen and implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for the way they have dealt with this issue.  I apologise that, of necessity, legislation was brought in without much notice.  I accept some Members of the Opposition did not have the time they would normally require to review the legislation but I do not take their comments or criticisms as being negative because of that.  Nevertheless, there is a necessity to move on this matter.  I will cover the points that have been raised as quickly and succinctly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is part of an overall package and has to be seen in that context. I am not suggesting that this legislation alone is the solution to that problem. My colleague, who represents an adjoining constituency but lives in mine, has clearly indicated the extent of the problem, the comprehensive way in which it has to be analysed and addressed and the obligations upon us <Col N="1014" /> all to do so.  The legislation should be looked at in the context described by the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>This legislation has not been rushed because of the murder of Veronica Guerin.  A working group to look at the comprehensive nature of this problem was brought together by the Government at a meeting in July 1995 with representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise and various Government Departments.  Organised professional criminals have professional advisers.  Every profession has its own set of rogues and these rogues advise and assist criminals in ensuring they maximise their position in the legal and civil system.  The complexity which organised criminal groups have brought to this issue requires a more sophisticated and complex response to resolve and ultimately defeat this scourge.  I should inform Deputy McCreevy that this legislation is not a response that was put together in the last four or five weeks.  It has been worked on over the last 12 months.  However, it would be wrong and misleading to say that the murder of Veronica Guerin did not add an additional sense of urgency to the work we were doing although it was not its sole cause.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy referred to criminals putting money offshore with the assistance of their professional advisers. His colleague Deputy O'Dea referred to the four associated banks in Ireland and seemed to suggest they were actively assisting, if not colluding, in placing money offshore.  He specifically mentioned money in the Channel Islands which they knew or suspected was criminally obtained.  Under the EU directive on money laundering and the 1994 criminal justice legislation, the banks would be in breach of the law if they knowingly facilitated that activity. In many cases the banks have already reported deposits of sums of money they suspect may come under the provision to the appropriate authorities.  I will get the precise number in the course <Col N="1015" /> of the debate.  We are not talking about half a dozen cases &mdash; from memory, it is a couple of hundred.  As the expertise of bank officials and their sensitivity to this kind of activity develops that incidence will increase.</P>
    <P>The core of this legislation and the next Bill which this House will discuss is the mutual exchange of information obtained separately and independently by different sections of the apparatus of the State.  This was previously, and in some respects still might be, covered by confidentiality clauses or the Data Protection Act, 1988.  We must ensure information obtained by one section of our society and by our systems of Government can be properly and promptly exchanged with another section to track and confiscate the assets of criminals.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea is absent although he is probably monitoring this contribution or will read my response to his comments. He asked why the gardaí do not give information to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of matters they come across.  The inference was that the Revenue Commissioners would then be able to demand tax.  These measures are not about improving the efficiency of the Revenue Commissioners to obtain tax revenue.  This measure and the next Bill are designed to confront and deal with the problem of criminals who use various devices to launder money they have obtained criminally.  It will enable us to catch them for related offences because they have distanced themselves successfully from the supply and distribution of drugs and put them behind bars.  Their property will be confiscated and I hope they, their families and associates will be impoverished so that everybody will see that crime does not pay.  This is the message we must convey as part of the overall package.  This measure alone will not deal with the relics of addiction and human dereliction resulting from heroin and other kinds of drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy also suggested that our sense of urgency has resulted from the middle classes being affected by this <Col N="1016" /> particular issue and that we have been galvanised into action by what a former Minister for Finance from Deputy McCreevy's party referred to as a &ldquo;well-heeled, articulate group of people&rdquo;.  He had a particular gender in mind at the time.  I think the late Deputy Colley's reference was to a particularly influential group in society and similarly, Deputy McCreevy suggested if it was not because of this particular group we would not have this hype and publicity. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, that we have been talking about constituencies affected by this problem for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been done but the problem has worsened.  I was a Minister of State on the task force from 1983 to 1985, when we dealt with the first generation of heroin drug addiction in this city and the infamous Dunne family were imprisoned.  At that time, the cost of heroin on the streets was prohibitive. We dealt with it at that point.  The criminals have returned with more sophisticated methods and distanced themselves from drug distribution.  This factor, combined with the dramatic drop in the cost of heroin and its artificial substitutes, has resulted in a new form of drug addiction which did not exist in the early 1980s.  A problem which was partially resolved has returned in a new manifestation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, referred to people smoking heroin and using candles in churches to light it.  The form of smoking heroin through tinfoil did not exist as a phenomenon in the early 1980s.  A much younger age group are now using drugs.  Parents have no cultural, physical, organisational or social relationship with them to help them understand the addiction in their family.  They know when a child is sick because of excessive drinking or smoking a cigarette when they are too young.  Parents can relate to these kinds of experiences because they can read the warning signs but <Col N="1017" /> there is a generation of Irish parents who cannot relate to the drugs problem because they have no direct experience of the type of drug abuse now occurring and the side effects or symptoms that manifest themselves.  This can be seen in relation to raves, ecstasy tablets and the way water is used.</P>
      <P>A good deal of work has been done, but much of it not as effective as we would like.  I refer again to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  Such issues as needle exchange, treatment centres and community response as an antidote to the concerned parents type of response have been in the air for a long time. Deputy McCreevy is not correct in saying that this has only come about because of the murder of Veronica Guerin on the one hand and a highly articulate group of middle class people who own, if not control, the pages of either the <i>Sunday Times,</i> Irish edition, or the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> Irish edition, and that we, the politicians, are not aware of this situation.  That is not the case.  Deputy Michael McDowell made a considerable point on the question of the amnesty and referred to his amendment. With respect to the Order of the House, I propose to deal with that when we discuss the amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with the conclusions of Deputy McCreevy.  I have notes here which have been supplied to me by the Revenue Commissioners and by my departmental staff to confirm the points we will make.  Rather than get into the issue on Second Stage, I will deal with it comprehensively and to the satisfaction, I hope, of Deputy McDowell and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made a number of points, going back as far as the Finance Act, 1983, when he talked about legislative changes he introduced and asked why these have not been used as much as people would like.  It is interesting to note that section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, provides that &ldquo;Revenue may assess a person to tax on the gains or profits which have been derived from an <Col N="1018" /> illegal or unknown source.&rdquo;  This legislation was introduced to deal with a situation which arose as a consequence of a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Hayes <i>v.</i> Duggan.  In that case the Supreme Court ruled that the profits of an illegal activity were not taxable.  I do not think Deputy Dukes &mdash; and he has been inspired by many things &mdash; was particularly inspired by a sudden realisation to do something on this issue because of the manifestation of his knowledge that this happened.  This, like a lot of Finance legislation derives from the consequences of court cases.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to get more information in the course of this debate. If not, I will write to the Deputy because he posed a number of questions about frequency of use and other matters. Since the introduction of legislation the Revenue Commissioners have used it on a number of occasions.  While no record has been kept of the precise number of cases in which it has been used, seven cases have been identified where recoveries of approximately £1 million were made.  It is not known whether the profits assessed in those cases were derived from illegal activities. In recent months, the Revenue Commissioners have entered miscellaneous income assessments on a number of individuals who are suspected of having derived profits or gains from drug trafficking.  It is considered that the criminal assets bureau will, with the assistance of information provided by the Garda, be in a position to establish the basis for raising section 19 assessments in other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can assist the Minister so that an erroneous impression will not be given.  Section 19 has been used in the past to settle ordinary back duty tax cases, not in relation to criminal activities.  It suited everybody, including the Revenue Commissioners, to issue an assessment under section 19 because the taxpayer concerned, for one reason or another and with the agreement of the Revenue Commissioners, did not want to say <Col N="1019" /> what the activities were but those were by no means criminal.  It would be wrong to give the impression that the seven cases mentioned by the Minister were related to criminal activities.  In my view none of them did.  I am sure the Minister can confirm that with officials from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for that professional and well informed intervention.  Deputy Dukes made two other points.  In section 4 of the Bill before us there is a general power for the Garda to be accompanied by revenue commissioners and other such persons and the Deputy asked who would be the other persons.  It must be borne in mind that the object of this bureau is to attack criminals and to deprive them of their assets and that can only be done under due process of law.  I am not for one moment, nor is anyone in this House, suggesting that we abandon due process of law.  On the contrary, we have to consolidate it, but its consolidation must ensure that there is proper evidence to achieve a successful prosecution and not have cases which, while considered proven would be dismissed on a technicality as has happened in the past.  It is necessary, for example, that when gathering information following a raid on a premises, competent people are involved, people who know what to look for and how to look for it.  Such people could be scientists, forensic experts, accountants or computer specialists because much of the information could be on electronic data.  In the latter sections of the Bill, I refer to the amendment of the Bankers' Book Evidence Act, 1879, to include all of these things.  Regrettably, but perhaps fortunately, and on balance I use the word, &ldquo;fortunately&rdquo;, our courts ensure that people can be convicted only if the law is properly interpreted and applied. Therefore we need a belt and braces and, as the late Frank Cluskey might have said, &ldquo;bicycle clips as well&rdquo; approach to this kind of legislation.  We <Col N="1020" /> need to ensure that all facts, eventualities and descriptions are specified in law and that is why we want the power. We do not want some technicality emerging in a prosecution where the person who acompanied gardaí on a successful raid was not lawfully there because they happened to be a particular kind of chemical expert who could clearly state that the substance in question was not some form of high degree fertiliser but was a heroin substitute and an illegal drug substance.</P>
      <P>Deputies McDowell and Dukes referred to the tragedy of the need for anonymity in the introduction of the legislation.  Minister of State Mitchell talked about the intimidation that people endure with regard to estate management.  I share a constituency with Deputy Eoin Ryan and with Deputy McDowell.  We could give this House, as we have given Dublin Corporation, chapter and verse in relation to intimidation.  In two estates not a million miles from where Deputy McDowell lives and where I have my clinic, I have volunteered to go to court on evidence because our collective constituents, who had been to see all of us, were simply terrified to go to court themselves.  Yet when this is said to Dublin Corporation officials they enumerate difficulties and one finds there a certain reluctance on their part.  Part of this is because officials of the district courts which deal with eviction cases &mdash; I am referring to eviction cases or repossession by Dublin Corporation of property that is being improperly used &mdash; either do not feel sufficiently motivated to do their job or have been intimidated. There are examples of such intimidation, hence, the need for anonymity. Tragically, in the short-term that anonymity will probably be more necessary than has previously been the case but it will be balanced by ensuring that the rules of the court will be observed, that the judge will see fully the face of the person giving the evidence, will be able to ensure that the evidence is given properly, is not some kind of trumped up set of evidence, simply because the police or a group want to get a particular individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> I could not agree more with Deputy Bree when he talked about the outrageous behaviour of the heavy gang in the 1970s and the way in which they discredited the entire reputation of an honourable force, the Garda Síochána. We have to learn from the abuses of power and the illegality that was associated with activities of some members of the Force acting as they, perhaps, believed in the interest of the State but acting clearly outside the law.  We have to balance the legal rights and entitlements of every citizen with the need to protect society itself and that is what this law is trying to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for that and hope the House will bear with me.  I was not trying to be evasive with regard to the question of the amnesty.  I take the point the Deputy has made and he has consequently put down an amendment. I do not see the need for the amendment proposed by the Deputy nor am I as pessimistic as he is about the possibliity of dealing with the cases he has in mind.  The amnesty legislation specifically provided for denying its benefit to cases of false declaration whether in respect of the amount or the source of the income.  As regards the source of income, the 1993 legislation required a declaration to the effect that any income being declared to the chief special collector for the purposes of the amnesty was not from an unlawful source.  If such income was declared it would not be protected under the amnesty legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two provisions of the amnesty legislation are relevant where false declarations are made.  First, the amnesty provides a specific and readily usable <Col N="1022" /> mechanism when an inspector of taxes has reasonable grounds to believe that an improper declaration as to the income being declared has been made. He or she can seek permission from the appeal commissioners to inquire further into the case and thus break the special confidentiality arrangements.  If the appeal commissioners are satisfied that the grounds are reasonable, they will permit further inquiries and actions to be taken by the inspector.  &ldquo;Reasonable grounds&rdquo; in this instance could include information from the Garda that income declared for the purpose of the amnesty was from an unlawful source.</P>
    <P>Where the appeal commissioners permit further inquiries to be taken the inspector can establish a false declaration and can raise tax assessments to ensure the proceeds are brought fully into charge to tax.  This mechanism is already being used and the appeal commissioners have allowed.  Revenue to conduct inquiries unrestricted by the amnesty in a number of cases &mdash; I do not have the exact figure here.</P>
    <P>Second, there is a further provision which the Deputy pointed out.  If it can be proven that a false declaration has been made as to the source of the income being declared for the purpose of the amnesty, the benefits of the amnesty are denied and full tax interest and penalties will apply.  The arrangements we are putting in place, including the proposed Criminal Assets Bureau, will significantly enhance the prospects for establishing the necessary proofs which can be pursued through the courts as required.</P>
    <P>Abuse of the amnesty is an offence in its own right which can give rise to penalties ranging from a fine of £1,200 to a term of imprisonment not exceeding eight years where the amount of tax evaded is significant.  It is the latter end of the scale which could apply if and where large amounts of income from unlawful sources are declared for the amnesty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For some time there has been a clear call from many quarters to ensure that the forces of the State were better coordinated so as to combat crime.  The Labour Party, in a recently published policy document on combating the drugs and crime issue, proposed the establishment of a special agency with specific powers to take decisive actions against the professional criminals and the drug barons.  The three parties in Government, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, separately and collectively, are fully in favour of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that other parties and some Independent Deputies are also in support of measures along these lines being implemented by the Oireachtas. For too long, many people, whose families or community were ravaged by the havoc caused by drug abuse, perceived that known or suspected criminals enjoyed a lifestyle which was not based on any real job or business.  They, and their own families appeared to enjoy the <Col N="1024" /> rich proceeds of crime and drug dealing with apparent impunity from the law. They appeared to be untouchable.  This Bill will end that.</P>
    <P>From now on, the families, friends and partners of criminals will not be able to hide behind their own names while at the same time enjoying the proceeds, the property, the assets and the money which the criminals obtain illegally.  All such assets will be capable of confiscation, if they can be proven to be connected, directly or indirectly, to criminal activity.  This new measure will confront, defeat and impoverish the criminal drug barons.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up on a statutory basis the special unit to target criminal assets which the Government announced on 2 July 1996.  The unit will be known as the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It will be headed by a Garda Chief Superintendent and its objective will be to track and target the assets of criminals or suspected criminals. As Deputies will see, the bureau will comprise Garda, Revenue and Social Welfare officials working as a team in pursuit of criminal assets and the identification, seizure, or taxation of those assets as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The bureau is being set up following a detailed review by a special working group consisting of officials from the Departments of Justice, Finance, Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners and senior Garda officers.  I wish to express the Government's appreciation for the speed and efficiency of that group of officials in clearing the way and putting in place the necessary arrangements to allow it proceed with the establishment of this bureau, and to all concerned in the Revenue and in the Attorney General's office for the expeditious drafting of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The working group recommended that pending the enactment of a Bill, the bureau should commence operations as soon as possible and that the head of the unit should be appointed without delay. The Bill dealing with the disclosure and exchange of information between Revenue, Garda and Social Welfare officials, which the House has agreed to pass today, will enable the team of <Col N="1025" /> officials to become operational without waiting for the passage of this Bill.  The two Bills can be viewed together as important parts of the overall package.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious that the legal obstacles to the co-operation between existing agencies should be immediately removed so that the operational framework of the bureau should be put in place now.  All three agencies are committed to the success of the bureau and to a concerted effort to deliver on the Government's anti-crime measures.  There has been no lack of commitment in the past but the difficulties which have arisen from different agencies tackling the problem within their own functional remit and in accordance with existing legislation have become apparent.</P>
    <P>The criminal activities of major criminals are multi-faceted and our response to these require new ways of directing the resources of the State and new structures through which the dedicated and determined efforts of the Garda, Revenue and Department of Social Welfare can be channelled most effectively.  The challenge of finding new structures for more effective team working between Departments and agencies is a broader issue which is being tackled as part of the Strategic Management Initiative. We have a model here which is capable of being replicated where a concerted response is required from the State.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a statutory bureau is a clear manifestation of the Government's determination to defeat the crime bosses.  The establishment of the bureau, as I have said, is entirely in accordance with the SMI approach of ensuring effective and efficient management by having a clear statutory delineation of responsibility and accountability. This is especially so when dealing with cross-departmental issues where various statutory powers are being exercised.  The essence of the bureau is that each of the three agencies will bring their own powers and expertise to the bureau and, by means of <Col N="1026" /> section 8 of the Bill, will exercise these powers in a mutually supportive and concerned manner.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to give the Houses a full opportunity to discuss and debate this important initiative and to explore fully how best this statutory bureau can be made most effective in discharging its role.  In the meantime, the bureau can go ahead on an operational basis.  Indeed, the experience gained from the bureau's operation on the ground may be help inform and shape the final statutory provisions that the Houses will pass.  It is the Government's intention that Committee Stage be taken as soon as possible by the relevant committee and passed by both Houses early in the new session.</P>
    <P>Before going into details on the sections, it will be helpful to the House if I sketch out the operational arrangements for the bureau as recommended by the working group.  The bureau will be an operational body of 30 staff or more made up of gardaí and expert civil servants from the Revenue Commissioners, including the Customs and Excise Service, and the Department of Social Welfare and any other specialists recruited as necessary.  The chief bureau officer will be a Garda Chief Superintendent who will be appointed and take up duty in the near future.  He will proceed to organise the personnel and other resources to enable the bureau to become a reality in the next few weeks. The management of the personnel, the determination of priorities, co-ordination activities and direction of operations will be the responsibility of the chief of the bureau.  Arrangements will be put in place to secure the safety and security of the bureau and its personnel.</P>
    <P>There will also be a legal officer appointed to the bureau who will report directly to the chief bureau officer.  The legal officer will be responsible for providing legal expertise to the bureau.  The appointee's role will be to participate fully in the work of the bureau in formulating strategies not just to ensure that the criminal assets are successfully tracked and targeted but, equally <Col N="1027" /> importantly, to process matters for prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions so that legal action to deprive the persons in question of the criminal assets, or to deny them the benefit of these assets, will produce the results desired.</P>
    <P>The legal officer will therefore have a pro-active and central role, working in conjunction with, and reporting directly to, the chief of the bureau.  The legal officer will also perform such other functions as decided by the chief bureau officer from time to time.  The Government has in mind the appointment of a particular individual who has the expertise, the ability and the dedication to ensure the bureau meets with success in its endeavours.</P>
    <P>The Garda, Revenue and Social Welfare personnel will bring to the bureau their own powers under the relevant criminal, taxes and social welfare legislation. The assignment of non-Garda staff to the bureau will be on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I will give a brief resumé of the principal content of particular sections. Sections 1, 2 and 3 deal with the interpretation of the Bill and provide for the statutory establishment of the bureau. Section 4 sets out the objectives of the bureau which are: to identify the assets of persons which derive or are suspected to derive directly or indirectly, from criminal activity, to take whatever action is necessary under the law to deprive criminals or suspected criminals of their assets or to deny them, in whole or in part, the benefit of those assets; and to carry out investigations and the preparatory work for legal proceedings in pursuit of the above objectives.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the bureau will be pro-active and interventionist.  Under the functions assigned to it by section 5 the remit of the bureau involves confiscating, freezing or seizing criminal assets, ensuring that criminal proceeds are subjected to tax and investigating and determining claims for benefit or assistance under the Social Welfare <Col N="1028" /> Acts by criminals or suspected criminals. Section 5 also makes it clear that nothing in the Act will interfere with the powers and duties of the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Social Welfare.  Thus the Garda, Revenue Commissioners and Social Welfare officials in the bureau will retain their ordinary powers and responsibilities.  Being a member of the bureau will not therefore prevent a Garda officer from exercising his general law enforcement powers.</P>
    <P>Section 6 allows the Minister for Justice, by order after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to confer such additional functions on the bureau as the Minister sees fit.  It is important to have this power to ensure that the bureau can respond to new situations or circumstances that may emerge in the conduct of its operations.  Given the nature of the enemy to society with which we are dealing, we should equip ourselves with the necessary powers to respond speedily and flexibly.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the appointment of the chief of the bureau, to be known as the chief bureau officer.  The chief officer will be appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána from amongst the officers of the Garda of the rank of chief superintendent.  The chief of the bureau will carry on, manage and control the administration and business of the bureau.  Provision is also made for an acting chief to be appointed by the Commissioner in the event of the illness or absence of the chief officer.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the powers and duties of the officers of the Garda, Revenue and Social Welfare who will be the bureau officers.  Each will have their own powers as a Garda, Revenue or Social Welfare officer.  The powers will be exercised in the name of the bureau under the direction of the chief bureau officer.  Section 8 enables the bureau officers to assist each other and, where necessary for the purposes of such assistance, to share powers as appropriate when co-operating in this manner.  Provision is made to ensure that information, documents or material obtained <Col N="1029" /> by officers or officers assisting each other may be admitted in evidence.  The bureau officers will be able to share information with each other and to disclose this information or material to their &ldquo;parent&rdquo; authorities.  It is important for the effectiveness of the bureau to maintain these links especially in the case of the Garda, as such information on the activities of criminals or suspected criminals will be of material use to the Garda authorities generally in discharging their responsibilities for combating crime.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the appointment of other staff of the bureau and for the appointment of the legal officer, to whom I referred earlier.  Section 10 provides for anonymity for bureau officers when, for example, making tax assessments, visiting premises or residences, conducting investigations, and giving evidence in court and appeal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes it an offence to delay, obstruct, impede, interfere with or resist a bureau officer in the exercise or performance of his or her powers or duties.  Section 12 makes it an offences to threaten or menace a bureau officer or member of staff or other families. Section 13 makes it an offences to commit an assault.  Substantial penalties are provided for in the case of all these offences.</P>
    <P>Section 14 sets out the arrangements for the transfer of staff to the bureau and the application of compensation arrangements under the Garda Síochána compensation schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 15 authorises the Minister for Justice to provide the bureau with its own budget.  It will be important to enable the bureau to be resourced to whatever level is necessary to discharge its functions.  Section 16 provides for all tax collected by virtue of the bureau's operation to be paid to the account of the Revenue Commissioners and accounted for to the Collector-General. There are already provisions in the other relevant legislation as regards the disposal of the funds that may arise <Col N="1030" /> from other actions, such as confiscation, that may be taken by the bureau.</P>
    <P>Section 17 requires the bureau to provide a report each year to the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice on its activities and for this to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Justice may also require the bureau to furnish information at other times on the general operations of the bureau.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is the usual standard expenses clause in all Bills and section 19 recites the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a forceful measure which will deliver a coherent and focused response to organised crime.  We owe it to the memory of the late Veronica Guerin to make sure the Bill succeeds in its objectives and defeats the drug barons.  I am sure the House will want to go into some details on the provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I will welcome a comprehensive and detailed Committee Stage debate drawing on expertise, both professional and political at constituency level.  The Government's objective is to ensure that not only will a statutory established bureau operate as quickly as possible but that it is one which will be properly equipped legally to do the task we all wish it well in implementing.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue who raised this point on the Order of Business this morning.  It is somehow ironic that the Minister for Finance has introduced a Bill which more properly should be introduced by the Minister for Justice.  If I recall correctly, it was the Minister for Finance who masterminded the decision to cancel the prison at Castlerea, County Roscommon, and the women's prison at Mountjoy Prison when the Minister for Justice was abroad.  The Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Deputy John O'Donoghue, described this accurately on one occasion when he said the Minister for Justice waded around the corridors of power telling everybody who was foolish enough to listen, that this was done to contain public expenditure. It is perhaps correct to assert that the Minister for Finance, in the light of his own portfolio, had a hand in depriving the Minister for Justice of many positive proposals she had with a view to tackling the escalating crime problem which now besets the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminals Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, has been presented as a panacea for all society's ills.  It is a necessary adjunct to Fianna Fáil's assets' freezing Bill and is somewhat consequential to it. It has been inspired by the Fianna Fáil Bill and the vacuum which would have been left by the Government's proposals. It must not be forgotten that the <Col N="1032" /> Minister for Finance and the Government have consistently rejected any notion that there should be a national drugs enforcement agency in this country. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, said during Question Time a month ago that such an agency would only fragment the fight against drugs and that there was no need for it.  Times have changed.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for the establishment of a body to be known as the criminal assets bureau.  It defines its functions and provides for related matters. For many months we have called for the establishment of an agency which would present a unified and professional front in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking.  In that respect, we welcome the general thrust of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10(2) and (3) provide that where a bureau officer, who is not a member of the Garda Síochána, exercises any of his or her functions or a member of staff assists in the exercise of such functions, they shall be accompanied by a bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána who shall identify them as either a bureau officer or a member of the bureau. When it comes to an effective and productive bureau, one must not forget that the late Veronica Guerin was a one woman criminal assets bureau.  She was probably more effective in following clues and leads than this bureau will ever be on the basis of the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <P>Will crime bosses be quaking in their shoes because of the criminal assets bureau?  I do not know but I agree with a unified approach.  People are amazed that State agencies have not been in a position to co-operate with each other. I defend the right of anyone to get the best legal advice and to pursue their case through the courts so that justice is done.  However, I thought all State agencies could have been fused together many years ago to pursue known criminals. Perhaps that is a tribute to our legal system.  It is past time to establish such a body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> This Bill will set up a new unit comprising the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and officials from the Department of Social Welfare.  I welcome the anonymity given to members of the bureau who are not members of the Garda Síochána.  When people join the Garda they must know that their job is to fight crime and that they will be in peril from time to time.  They should not join the Garda Síochána if they do not know the rules of the game.  Officials from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare are not trained in this regard and they did not think when they were first employed there that they would have to put their lives at risk.</P>
    <P>Shortly before I became Minister for Social Welfare a deciding officer in the Department was kidnapped from his home, brought to a railway track, shot in both legs and left to die.  This is well documented in the book by Mr Paul Williams, which is well written and gives a clear insight into the minds of criminals and the level of criminal activity in Dublin.  People who think they may be doing the State a service by leaking the names of people who may have had their tax affairs investigated to the newspapers put the lives of people in the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners at risk. The deciding officer in the Department of Social Welfare who was kidnapped and shot in both legs had nothing to do with the case of the criminal who was denied social welfare.</P>

      <P>Deciding officers are appointed up to the level of higher executive officers and the person who makes the decision may not be the investigating officer.  This person had nothing-to do with that case.  However, somebody was able to find out his name, where he lived, the number in his family, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can hardly blame officials in the <Col N="1034" /> Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare for not wanting to put their lives at risk.  Some people would do so but the vast majority have their own lives to lead.  I would not ask anyone to do what I would not do myself.  At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, it was obvious that the Revenue Commissioners did not feel it was their duty to pursue criminals and put their lives at risk.  I understand why they feel like that but it is different for the Garda.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which will bring together the powers of various State agencies.  As the Minister for Finance said, this may be used as the model to overcome problems in other Departments. Anyone who has been a Minister or a Minister of State will have learned the first rule on appointment from the officials in the Department and the agencies under their control that the Minister's job is to protect their patch even if it has outlived its usefulness.  It is regarded as an honour for the Minister to be able to defend that even at budget time, although there could be good reason for getting rid of it. Journalists will write that a Minister is weak if they cannot protect their patch. That says more about the competence of journalists than that of the Minister.</P>
    <P>When people in various Government agencies are brought together in a subcommittee, a working group or an interdepartmental group, rule number one for the official who has been sent from the Department to the meeting is not to give way to the other person and never give way to the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The blackest sin of all is to allow the Department of Finance to have its way.  This would make the Minister a laughing stock.  The officials will take newspapers with them to show that a certain Minister is weak because he or she could not defend their patch. When interdepartmental meetings take <Col N="1035" /> place under the rules 1 to 10 officials should not give way.  An officials who returns to his or her Department and states he or she gave way is held in disgrace.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister's officials for briefing me on the Bill.  I am anxious that officials involved in the bureau will retain their individual powers but that the bureau itself will also have powers.  A fused approach is the correct route to take.  The bureau can learn from Departments and their activities.  Legislation relating to children falls within the remit of a number of Departments.  Perhaps we could use that model to overcome problems in a wide range of areas.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, the bureau will not operate correctly if the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Welfare are asked to appoint a specific number of people.  It will not work if staff associations and trade unions stipulate that one assistant secretary, one HEO, one AP, etc., must be appointed. I advise the Minister not to allow this to happen.  I discussed this issue privately with officials of the Revenue Commissioners during the past 18 months and the Minister is aware, from our time in Government together, that I support the establishment of bureaux such as this.  The approach I advocate would be to invite people to volunteer to work in the bureau and then vet them for appointment.  Certain people, not all of whom are in the top ranks of the Civil Service or working together in the same Department, are suited to this type of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> One of the sections in the Bill can be interpreted as meaning that people in the bureau might be remunerated in a better manner than they would in the general service.  That section gives the Minister for Justice power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to organise affairs in this regard.  If the bureau is to work, rewards must be given.  Some people are motivated by striving toward the greater public good but others are motivated by money.</P>

      <P>No, they do not. People working in the bureau, be they members of the Garda Síochána or officials from the Department of Social Welfare or the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, must be highly motivated. I am glad to note the bureau is empowered to hire lawyers, accountants and other experts.  This issue was discussed during the debate on an earlier Bill, but it is included in a particular section of this legislation.  In the area of financial transactions, there are many sophisticated products that experts in the field cannot keep up with developments. Amazingly, however, one often meets the best experts, with knowledge of social welfare entitlements and ways to circumvent the social welfare and tax systems, while sitting in a pub. The most uneducated person in an area knows perhaps more than anyone about operating the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the earlier Bill I mentioned the issue of international co-operation and referred to Mr. Justice Paul Carney's recent comments regarding money laundering.  It is becoming more difficult to deal with the area of the financial management of criminal proceeds.  Due to Ireland's membership of the European Union there is absolute free movement of capital and almost 100 per cent free movement of people within the countries of the Union.  The articles of the Maastricht Treaty provide for free movement and people should be able to move freely throughout the <Col N="1037" /> EU without their passports.  However, there are reasons this has not come totally into effect.  With the free movement of capital and people, problems with controlling money laundering are exacerbated.  A 1994 Act made money laundering an offence and the bureau must be given access to the relevant expertise which will enable it to trace the proceeds of crime and where they are being used.</P>
    <P>It would strike outsiders as unusual that the law is so complicated that the Garda Síochána, officials from the Department of Social Welfare and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and people who act on the State's behalf were not able to use information in concert. However, it is not unusual in Ireland because we are great at protecting our own patch.  For example, there are divisions even within the ranks of the Garda Síochána.  I am aware of a number of cases where there is an unbelievable lack of co-operation between certain sections in the force whose work overlaps.  The Minister for Justice is wasting her time banging heads together because this has been the position for a great number of years.  There are also divisions and internal rivalries between members in certain sections of the Garda Síochána who do not co-operate with each other.  A similar situation obtains within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare and this is based on the premise that one must protect one's own patch.  In my experience, this occurs to a lesser degree in the Department of Social Welfare than in the other two agencies.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of establishing a bureau for the three agencies to come together to exchange information. However, it is amazing that, if Deputy O'Dea were a member of the Garda Síochána and I was an official of the Department of Social Welfare and we both worked for the bureau, a law must be enacted to enable us to exchange information and act on each other's behalf.  An ordinary member of the public would assume this was <Col N="1038" /> already the case but, apparently, it was illegal to do so.  That said, in the past I would probably have been first to object to the Revenue Commissioners giving out information about the affairs of individual taxpayers.  It is time this type of legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be an opportunity to discuss the various sections of the Bill on Committee Stage.  However, we will be able to gauge whether the legislation is effective following a period of one year.  One section of the Bill provides that a report be laid before each House. I do not expect that report to be very detailed in terms of it stating that &ldquo;Mr. X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ms Y&rdquo; were investigated. However, it will be interesting to see how people from the different agencies work together.  It is for this reason that the first year will be critical because organisations develop their own organic drive and ethos after a period.</P>
    <P>The bureau officer, the chief legal officer and the other members of the bureau will have a great responsibility. Great care will have to be taken in vetting applicants for the position of bureau officer.  I favour the approach of seeking volunteers from within the different agencies for the bureau.  After that, great care should be taken to select those who can work together and give the bureau a good name.  If done properly that system can work.</P>
    <P>In setting up the bureau, the Government must have considered another approach such as the establishment of an independent body like the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.  I favour the Government's approach.  If it fails we will have to look at another method.  Its success will depend on the driving forces behind it and the key people involved.  If it goes the way of many other agencies, protecting its patch and not co-operating with other sections, it will be a waste of time. In my contribution this morning I highlighted many of the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell.  We need properly motivated people supporting it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether to laugh or cry <Col N="1039" /> at some of the commentary on issues affecting the public or the way politicians are held up to abuse.  We bring much of the criticism on ourselves by some of the ridiculous poses we strike and the way we try to score points off one another.  We have so many laws, recommendations, task forces and select committees that we would need an area as large as Croke Park to house them all.  Members of this House are trying to do their best.  Properly motivated people are needed, whether they are in the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Health.  I have come across officials in the health area fighting for their patches.  Some officials forget why they were appointed in the first place.  There are many officials in the agencies involved who are prepared to give the bureau their best shot.  I wish the bureau well.  I have liked the idea of setting up such a body for some time.  If it does not work, we will have to consider the issue again.  If this approach does not work I do not know what will, but it will be a commentary on Irish society, as much as on politicians, commentators and organisations, that people paid for specific work are not prepared to do it.  I hope the bureau works well; I believe it will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up where the Minister left off on the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993.  When I made my comments on this in the media over recent weeks, I carefully checked out the position.  I also examined these areas, as did others more expert than me, with a view to ascertaining whether a problem existed with the tax amnesty legislation.  Since the Minister had a short period towards the end of the debate on the last Bill to deal with the issue, I will take slightly longer to make my point so it can be dealt with here, elsewhere or on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avail of the tax amnesty, a person had to deliver a declaration in writing to the Chief Special Collector.  It <Col N="1040" /> had to be under section 2 (3) of the Act: (1)  it had to be made and signed by the individual; (2)  it had to be on a form prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners and approved by the Minister; (3)  it had to contain in relation to the individual &mdash; I ask the Minister to pay close attention to this &mdash; a full and true statement of the respective amounts, referred to in the Act as &ldquo;the declared amounts&rdquo;, of the income and the chargeable gains referred to in subsection (2); (4)  it had to declare that neither the declared amounts nor any part of the amounts arose from or by reason of an unlawful source or activity other than the evasion of tax or the noncompliance with the provisions relating to exchange control and (5)  the individual had to pay the money before the relevant date.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken in this House today about the capacity to reopen the tax amnesty in certain situations. The law relating to that is set out in section 5 (1) of the Act.  It states that a Revenue official is,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;precluded from continuing with or commencing the said inquiries or continuing with or commencing the said action unless, on application by him to the Appeal Commissioners, he shows to the satisfaction of those Commissioners that</P>
    <P>(a)  inquiries or actions taken in respect of liability to tax (within the aforesaid meaning) of the individual for any period commencing on or after the 6th day of April 1991, indicate or</P>
    <P>(b)  there are other reasonable grounds which include&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question is, what they indicate?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that a declaration made by the individual to the Chief Special Collector under section 2 (3) (a) or 3 (6) (b) did not contain a full and true statement of the declared amounts or the amount of value-added tax comprised in the arrears of tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only basis on which the Appeal <Col N="1041" /> Commissioners can reopen the matter under section 5 is if the declared amounts were not fully and truly stated. The only basis on which the Appeal Commissioners can reopen the matter on the instance of an inspector under section 5 is where the return does not contain a full and true statement of the declared amounts.  That is the point I made carefully because if the Minister looks at section 4 he will see it states that a declaration given by the Chief Special Collector under section 2 (3) (a) shall be void on one of two grounds. The first is that it did not contain a full and true statement of the kind referred to in paragraph (iii) of the subsection &mdash; the full and true statement of the declared amounts &mdash; or second, it is proven to be false as far as the requirements of subparagraph (iv) of the subsection are concerned.  I reiterate the points I made earlier with greater confidence having spent the last half hour poring over this, that there is no jurisdiction for the Appeal Commissioners to reopen under section 5 an inquiry or to allow it to proceed at the behest of an inspector, or any action to proceed on any other basis other than that the declared amounts were not fully and truly stated.</P>
    <P>A person could be correct in the amounts, could say he has, £3.5 million in a bank in Jersey, it is all he has and wants to bring it to Ireland.  The other declaration a person has to make about the amount is that it is not the proceeds of an unlawful activity.  That does not have anything to do with the power of the Appeal Commissioners under section 5.  That is the point I have been making for a number of weeks.  I regret if I have not made it as clearly as I ought to.  Perhaps I should have written to the Minister and made the point in those clear terms.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely certain, having read the Act, that the power of the Appeal Commissioners to authorise the continuance of an inquiry or an action under section 5 of the Act relates to <Col N="1042" /> cases where there has been a subsequent failure on the part of the taxpayer to furnish returns of income after 6 April 1991 or where there are other reasonable grounds which indicate that the declaration in respect of the declared amounts was not a full and true statement.  Those are the only circumstances in which a certificate can be declared inoperative or void and have no effect or concealing the unlawful nature of the moneys which have been truly stated.  The only circumstances in which that happens is where it is proven that the declaration in question was false.  It is not only my view but that of people whose judgment is based on much more experience than mine, that section 5 does not apply to a situation where somebody represents that money which they asked to be declared under the tax amnesty was lawfully obtained when in fact it was unlawfully obtained. The consequences are that to invalidate a certificate one must prove that the declaration as to the legality of the source of the income is false.  If it was simply a question of under-declaration of declared amounts or misstatement of declared amounts under subparagraph (iii) of the relevant provision I fully accept all that would have to be done is for the Minister to go before the Appeal Commissioners and say there are reasonable grounds to believe there was such a failure to make a full and true statement in respect of the declared amounts.  If it were not so, the wording of the Act would be quite different.  I am not scoring points here.  This has concerned me considerably recently.</P>
    <P>The reason I took advice on this was that having considered all the recent controversy about crime bosses, I went back to the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, to satisfy myself of what I thought was the case at the time, that they would not be able to reopen the investigation, in the hope that they would.  I was advised by others who know more than I do about this but I am absolutely satisfied, having read the relevant provisions, that they are correct and that there is no power <Col N="1043" /> to reopen on the basis of a false declaration as to the legality of the income. The only reasonable grounds for reopening a case is an application to the Appeal Commissioners where there is a suspicion that the declared amounts are not being fully and truly stated.  That is a serious flaw in this legislation because it means that the onus of proof is radically different when it comes to robbing someone of the benefit of the tax amnesty by reason of their failure to make a truthful statement as to the nature of the activity that gave rise to the money, as distinguished from their failure to state the declared amount truthfully on the relevant provision.  The Minister replied while I went carefully through the section.  I am quite satisfied that the advice I received is correct and that it is not possible to go to the Appeal Commissioners and say: &ldquo;Although the amount of tax declared by A or B was correct, I now understand, it was not the proceeds of, for example, undeclared dealing in beef or cattle.  I now have reasonable grounds to believe that it is the proceeds of drug pushing.&rdquo; That cannot be done and I ask the Minister to look carefully at the problem I have identified to see whether it is satisfactory that proof of falsity should apply in one case where reasonable grounds to suspect under-declaration is sufficient to reopen the issue.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy McCreevy's knowledge of the organic politics of the Civil Service institutions and Departments and I fully accept his colourful description of the basic laws that motivate many of them.  I also agree with the Deputy that if one is to have co-operation between Departments, agencies and institutions to succeed one needs to create a separate institution for co-operation. Normally I would be the first to object, as an ideological watchdog perhaps, to the creation of another quango. Yet it is essential on this occasion that a group of people who have much in common with each other, a collective sense of purpose and a clear statutory basis and mandate for co-operating with <Col N="1044" /> each other to come into existence on the basis suggested in this Bill.  I would rather have this than avoid the proliferation of State agencies, which is what would normally worry us.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy McCreevy that the fundamental test for this is the determination to do something about exercise of these powers.  Deputy Mitchell's speech was both convincing and a high point of good rhetoric when he got to the distinction between order and law.  One can have a super abundance of law and if one does not have the determination to implement it there is, as the Deputy put it, virtually no order.  I have one particular instance in mind.  When one remembers that Deputy Broughan and others referred to the Beef Tribunal and the section 153 controversy, it reminded me of the distinction between the law and the willingness of the agencies to implement it. The chairman of the beef tribunal, Mr. Justice Hamilton, now Chief Justice, arrived at a number of conclusions which he expressed in clear and explicit terms.</P>
    <P>For all the length of the report there were few enough hard conclusions which identified certain individuals. One was that in the Goodman organisation, he said there was a highly professionally organised tax evasion operation. He identified the tax loss as being in the region of £10 million.  I appreciate that we live in a world in which it is one thing to express that view as the finding of a tribunal but it may be a different matter to institute criminal proceedings but surely the persons responsible for that fraud could have been dealt with under the Companies Act, 1990, which provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions is given a non-criminal function of applying to the High Court to disqualify people from acting as directors or shadow directors of companies where they have engaged in major fraudulent activity.  Thinking along those lines I wrote to the then Taoiseadh, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the <Col N="1045" /> Minister for Enterprise and Employment drawing their attention to this particular tribunal finding, and the fact that nothing appeared to have been done about it about one year later.  In fact I recollect it was the present Taoiseach to whom I wrote.  Suffice to say I have not had an adequate response from anybody as to the reason no further action was taken about the £10 million tax fraud, even to implementing the ordinary civil code of company law, disqualification from holding a directorship or acting as a manager or shadow director of a company.</P>
    <P>On one occasion a I was upbraided by a journalist who was present this afternoon for not having done anything about this.  I told him I had a file as thick as his arm of letters seeking implementation of this law.  I think he half disbelieved me.  The journalist asked to see the file.  I gave it to him, he looked through it and wrote an article in the newspapers.  Indeed, the only indication I had that an article would be published was when I received a letter from one of the people to whom I had addressed my correspondence to the effect that I would be receiving a further letter very soon.  That was about six months ago.  I have not received that further letter, yet the heat is off.</P>
    <P>The only reason I bear down on this issue is that it is one thing to give people powers; as the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Mitchell said, it is one thing to pass laws, to enact powers in statutory form, but a very different matter to go after somebody, to devise a co-ordinated approach to implement those laws.</P>
    <P>In 1990 we all bent over backwards to say how wonderful it was that rogue directors at last would be brought to book.  A tribunal of inquiry found that the top management of one group, and their professional advisers, put together a £10 million tax evasion scheme and, as far as I know, nobody has been brought to book for that.  Even more appalling, the tax amnesty applied to the whole <Col N="1046" /> caboodle.  Is it any wonder that I sometimes lose faith in our ability to implement our laws.  It is one thing to pass a law stating that directors cannot behave fraudulently but, whenever it is found to have happened and no action is taken, that seems to cut at the very foundation of public confidence in the administration of law and, for that matter, in the political process.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am entirely supportive of the creation of this bureau.  While some people may contend it is a reaction to recent events &mdash; perhaps it is in some measure &mdash; as the Minister said on the last Bill we dealt with, it represents the culmination of a good deal of thought on these issues.</P>
    <P>I am also particularly glad that we are not taking all Stages of this Bill today because, from a quick examination of its provisions, it appears some amendments are required.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that the Bill extended the provisions of the Garda Síochána compensation code to officers, staff and members of the bureau.  Nonetheless sections 12 and 13 have been somewhat inelegantly drafted.  Section 13 (1) states:</P>
    <P>A person who assaults or attempts to assault a bureau officer or a member of the staff of the Bureau or any member of the family of a bureau officer or a member of the staff of the Bureau shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>It does not specify who is &ldquo;a member of the family&rdquo;.  That needs to be more thoroughly defined.  To some extent, it must be tied into the bureau's activities. There is need for a provision to verify that the attempted assault took place in circumstances giving rise to the reasonable inference that it was related to the activities of the bureau.  It appears that one does not need the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions to implement the provisions of this section. To imprison somebody for ten years for assaulting a member of the family of the bureau, without such protection, might be perceived by some to be somewhat draconian.  Certainly, a fine of £100,000 <Col N="1047" /> would be very strange.  What would happen if one member of the family assaulted another member of the family? Would the guilty person be sent to jail for such a long period?</P>
    <P>Other aspects of these provisions could do with some improvement or tightening up.  Introducing this Bill today was a worthwhile exercise although the Minister said he could establish the bureau without legislation. He said the establishment of the bureau would not be delayed by reason of the slowness of the Legislature to consider this provision.  Presumably, it will make all its preparations and establish all its procedures provisionally while awaiting the enactment of the necessary legislation. It is important that it be demonstarted publicly &mdash; this is not just spindoctorism &mdash; that, in the Bill debated earlier, we are not simply creating new powers without allocating them to people who will have a specific mandate to yield results.</P>
    <P>On foreign assets, while it may not be necessary to say so, I hope the bureau, either in its own terms or by necessary implication, carries the function of investigating the issues and instigating inquiries inside and outside the country, that its mandate will not be confined in any sense to this country.  I know we cannot start freezing assets or raiding people's premises in Jersey and so on.  I am not suggesting that, but it should be made clear in section 4 or 5 that nothing in those sections precludes the bureau from making inquiries, collating information or following assets with a view to co-operating with other EU member states in putting those assets into some form of official captivity.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy mentioned earlier the phenomenon of people suggesting that, in certain circumstances, lawyers are part of the problem.  I agree fully with what the Minister said, that there are some rogue lawyers &mdash; I presume there are also some rogue accountants but I do not know about them &mdash; who actively assist in their clients' affairs to the extent of setting up accounts for <Col N="1048" /> them, laundering their money and advising them how to avoid any legislative loopholes.</P>
    <P>On section 153 of the Finance Act, 1994, I might point out to Deputy Broughan that I am referring to a solicitor, or anybody else, who assists in moving the proceeds of crime.  Unfortunately, from time to time, a solicitor, as part of his duties, will be approached to render a service to an accused person or a suspect who is actively participating in the handling of either stolen money &mdash; usually drugs money is stolen money &mdash; or the proceeds of an illicit trade.  No solicitor has any mandate, moral, legal, or under the Constitution, to carry out that function.  There has been comment, some of it in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> about barristers representing people who have been in the eye of public controversy in recent times.</P>
    <P>It is opportune to finish by expressing my views about such comment.  Of course lawyers use arch language and are over defensive on occasion of what they consider to be their rights and others see as their privileges.  I accept that a time cannot come when the media can seek to embarrass honourable people from discharging their basic fundamental professional duty, that is, if they practise criminal law, to represent any client, irrespective of who that client is, on a taxi rank principle.  If we go away from that principle how are we to ask, for instance, the lawyers of England of 20 years ago to stand up for the rights of the Birmingham Six if they can be publicly embarrassed by people asking who these people are who vociferously put their clients' case and use all their ingenuity on their behalf?</P>
    <P>There cannot be a double standard in this regard.  I say this particularly of barristers and solicitors who represent clients in criminal matters.  They cannot be fairly subjected to pressure or innuendo in that by standing up in court and representing their clients fearlessly in accordance with their clients' instructions they somehow become part of the problem.  The problem would be <Col N="1049" /> immensely worse if barristers or solicitors felt under public pressure to abandon or refuse to act for people whom a newspaper informs us is or is not a prime suspect for a certain crime, regardless of how outrageous the crime is.</P>
    <P>I stand up on behalf of my profession, which is very much a castigated profession, to say that I totally distinguish between the role of a corrupt solicitor &mdash; it would not arise in the case of a barrister because they never see these things &mdash; who advises a client on how to launder his money and the professional duty of a barrister who practises criminal law to take any case that comes and never to refuse to act in a case because they would be embarrassed to look in the eye of their friends, neighbours or someone in the media and say that this person was so much the subject of public obloquy or suspicion that they should not be represented in court.</P>
    <P>I strongly identify with what Deputy McCreevy said about the danger &mdash; I do not wish to become arch about this or excessive on the subject &mdash; of some journalists writing articles calculated to expose people who are doing their job to the best of their ability, to the highest professional standards and in accordance with basic professional duties, not judging their own clients.  We would expect any barrister or solicitor representing us not to act as our judge.  I object strongly to journalists who try to excite public hostility towards those people based on the fundamental misconception that those barristers would not be just as happy to take the Director of Public Prosecution's brief to prosecute the individuals in question as they are to defend them.</P>

There has been <Col N="1050" /> much debate on this matter and I hope at the end of the day we will have achieved the respect of people who believe that we are going about this matter in the right way.  I hope we are not selling them a pig in a poke and that after passing the five or six Bills introduuced today the public will feel a little more secure in their beds at night.</P>
      <P>It is dangerous in politics to be cynical, but while welcoming particularly the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill and the legislation on the freezing and seizure of the assets of criminals, I hope the support that has been evident for other Bills today will be equally forthcoming in regard to the issues of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  Since the tragic death of Veronica Guerin we have tended to react to events, and one cannot help doing so, but it turns one's stomach to hear the Fianna Fáil spokesperson chide and deride those of us on this side of the House for apparent inactivity.  We inherited a society that has been moulded and cultured by Fianna Fáil since the inception of the State.  In the past 18 months we as legislators have tried to tackle problems that have been allowed to fester and get out of control because of the inactivity of Fianna Fáil and its partners in the past.</P>
      <P>For example, the drug barons who are destroying communities which I represent did not appear suddenly in the last 18 months.  What did Fianna Fáil do, for example, in the mid-1980s when the heroin problem was at its peak and in St. Teresa's Gardens parents of children addicted to drugs pleaded for assistance and understanding by the political establishment?  There was not even a treatment centre at that time.  Today we are reacting to the inactivity of previous Governments, particularly Fianna Fáilled governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are collectively responsible for this problem.  We inherited a society that was nurtured and moulded by the politics mainly of Fianna Fáil down the years.  I hope the Government will have the full and equally vocal support on this issue which has been forthcoming <Col N="1051" /> from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on other issues.  Taxpayers' money should be spent on addressing what I would refer to as the spore body in society which continues to grow in size, the huge numbers of long-term unemployed, who did not become so in the last 18 months, and their families, those who have succumbed to drugs and those who have lost children and parents from AIDS because of intravenous drug use.  I hope this bureau will be evident throughout my constituency at houses which have been purchased by known drug dealers.  I hope there will be a public display of bureau officials circling buildings in a murder-type scenario so that the neighbours can applaud them for finally removing the scum who have destroyed their communities and returning them to the poverty whence they came.</P>
    <P>Unless we seriously address the society from which these people come, we will not resolve the problem.  We will be putting a soother before the electorate and saying that we have solved the problem because we are building more prisons, taking on 600 extra gardaí, compelling people to speak when arrested, introducing seven day detention and so on.  Where are the policies to deal with bestowing full citizenship on this marginalised underclass?  One should look at the under-resourced schools in which they are trying to have their children educated and the local authority slums in which they live.  Why have they been ghettoised in these numbers?</P>
    <P>We have heard laudable appeals for a 50 metre swimming pool which might cost £20 million to build.  I argue, and I am sure those involved in swimming might agree with me, that if £20 million is available, it should be targeted at marginalised communities crying out for simple things like communities centres.  It would be wrong to spend £20 million on a swimming pool when that resource could be far better used to upgrade the quality of life for thousands of people who are living in abject poverty without <Col N="1052" /> even having access to their local swimming pool, which are few and far between.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak deeply or sincerely enough about the type of society in which we are living.  It is a two tier society.  The main body is these marginalised communities.  They are there because the local authorities have placed them in these ghettos in great numbers and we continue to turn a blind eye.  We all live a nice middle class lifestyle.  Deputy Mitchell said that few TDs can comprehend the misery of an existence that is lived by hundreds of thousands of people in this city.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that 12 and 13 year olds are getting involved or being seduced into the drugs scene today by either acting as lookouts, couriers or runners when they see their former older friends having made a good life out of drugs, moving into £100,000 houses and driving 1996 registered cars. We should provide them with work and give them some sense of hope of which they have been deprived since their birth.  I saw young people coming out of Hollyfield buildings when I first became involved in politics and the parish priest in Seán MacDermott Street &mdash; the insult when the Pope bypassed there was a telling indictment of Roman Catholicism at that time &mdash; said to an audience, it may have been politicians, that he baptises these children and knows their ultimate destiny will be Mountjoy jail.  As politicans, we must look into our hearts and ask why there is so much alienation, marginalisation and a large and ever increasing underclass.</P>
    <P>While it is easy for people to argue for spending up to £1,000 million on law and order issues &mdash; this must be spent &mdash; if we only see that as the solution to the problem it will not happen.  The next generation of young Fagins and drug barons are now out on the streets.  One can only resolve that problem in a proactive rather than a reactive way.  I hope my words are proven wrong in ten years' time but I doubt it.  Unless the resources are deliberately injected into those communities and that portion of <Col N="1053" /> our society which is growing numerically, I am afraid the battle will continue to be lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Mr. Shortall Mr. Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for sharing his time.  I warmly and enthusiastically welcome this Bill which provides for the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  We have before us a package of criminal justice mesasures designed to tackle the drugs and crime problem which currently pervades the whole country.  However, this Bill is by far the most significant of this legislation.</P>
      <P>For too long we have been hearing about the activities of the main players in the drugs and crime trade.  They are all well known to us.  We know their nicknames and hear about their properties, cars, and foreign holidays.  Veronica Guerin devoted much of her career to exposing these people.  One must also recognise the role that many other courageous journalists have played in that regard.  In reading about these criminals, the public is affronted by the fact that while all the details about the criminals' activities and careers were known, it appeared they were untouchable.  This has rightly and understandably angered and incensed most ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The abandon with which many of these criminals seem to be able to operate provides the most appalling example to a great many of our young people living on the fringes of society, the kind of people referred to by Deputy Byrne. Many of them are addicts and have become addict dealers.  They have little in terms of life opportunities and are living on the fringes.  At the moment it appears that getting involved in crime is a good risk.  We must change that situation radically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last few years there has been a great deal of talk in this House and elsewhere about the need for greater cooperation between the various agencies involved; the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the Department of Social Welfare.  Unfortunately, much of this <Col N="1054" /> has been only talk.  The Revenue Commissioners have been less than enthusiastic about getting involved in this area and their reticence is understandable. We must recognise the kind of people about whom we are talking, they are the most dangerous imaginable.  They have all the necessary resources to provide their own professional advice and protection. Most of the people working in the Revenue Commissioners are administrative workers who have not been afforded the kind of protection given to members of the Special Branch or the Drugs Squad.  The are ordinary people, many with families, who understandably fear for their safety.  In many ways it has been unfair and unrealistic to expect people in the Revenue Commissioners to get involved with these dangerous people.</P>
    <P>I have always thought we should set up a dedicated unit which would incorporate the expertise of the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the Department of Social Welfare and have the extensive powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  There has been much talk about granting special powers.  Sufficient powers already exist and are vested in the Revenue Commissioners but we need to extend them to the people working in a dedicated unit.  The people who will work in the unit will have to be afforded full protection.  It will probably be necessary for them to be armed or, at least, to have armed protection at all times.  I will deal with this matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.  It should go without saying that the question of funding should not arise.  This will be a dedicated unit which will have to do extremely dangerous work and it should be provided with whatever resources are necessary.</P>
    <P>It will be possible for the Criminal Assets Bureau to systematically target all known criminals and drug dealers and to pick them off one by one.  One may ask why the Garda Síochána have not been able to do this.  One of the reasons is that most of the main drug dealers operate at a sophisticated level and are in receipt of top professional <Col N="1055" /> advice.  They rarely dirty their hands. This makes it very difficult to catch them for their involvement in the drugs trade and organised crime, including the sale of contraband cigarettes and the supply of guns.</P>
    <P>We are taking the right approach in setting up this unit which will have the same powers as the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána. These people should be asked about the property and assets they have accumulated during the years and to provide evidence of the sources of their wealth. As time passes, we will find that the strength of the unit will have to be increased.  There is a tendency to underestimate the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which has not received sufficient attention, the numbers of gardaí involved in drugs detection. The Garda Síochána accept that up to 80 per cent of crime is drug related but, despite this, only 1.5 per cent of Garda personnel are directly involved in drugs detection.  I hope this matter will be looked at by the new Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>There is another role that the Criminal Assets Bureau could play which is closely related to the work of the drugs squad in dealing with the smaller dealers.  The drugs squad does not always find drugs when it carries out raids on houses or flats, it sometimes finds money.  As things stand, the Garda Síochána are powerless in dealing with such cases and they should be able to refer them to the bureau for further investigation.</P>
    <P>The criminal justice measures we are considering today are only one aspect of the solution to this huge problem.  We have to seriously consider &mdash; I regret that we are not in a position to make proposals &mdash; greatly increasing the number of treatment facilities available for those already addicted to drugs.  Parents demand that we take action against the drug barons and this bureau will be a major plank in tackling them.  Parents also demand that we provide treatment facilities for their sons and daughters for <Col N="1056" /> whom they are trying to buy substitute drugs on the black market.  The provision of treatment facilities for the large numbers who require them is an equally effective way of tackling the drug barons.  We need to hit them where it hurts by eliminating the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Rourke and Woods. The Minister has kindly agreed to cede five minutes of his time.</P>
      <P>I enthusiastically welcome the Bill.  I will not get involved in a dispute with the Labour Party which claims paternity but this course of action has been recommended by individuals on all sides of the House for some time.</P>
      <P>We had the usual <i>cri de coeur</i> from Deputy Eric Byrne about poverty and deprivation in his constituency.  He should be aware that the problem is not confined to his constituency, let alone Dublin or Ireland.  Politicians on all sides of the House must be committed to solving the problems he identified as much drug related crime originates in that way.</P>
      <P>The public is demanding an immediate response on the justice and law and order front.  That is the reason I enthusiastically welcome the legislation and we support it.  I agree with Deputies McCreevy and McDowell that it will be as effective only as the people who will be employed to implement it.  They must have the will and obstacles must not be placed in their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell about the beef tribunal.  Let me mention an analogous but more general case.  In 1990, after much deliberation, we passed legislation to enable, among other things, company directors to be disqualified in certain circumstances. there have been tens of thousands of liquidations, voluntary or otherwise, since then.  I do not know how many instances involve fraud but I was informed in response to a recent parliamentary question that only two directors have been disqualified under that legislation.  This reinforces the point made by Deputies McDowell and <Col N="1057" /> McCreevy.  Even though I had some doubts initially, on reflection I agree with the approach the Government is taking to delay Committee Stage until we see how it operates in practice.  Certain amendments may be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is frightening that we have to write in provisions in this legislation to provide for giving evidence anonymously behind a screen, whether in the appeal commissioner's office or in court.  The last instance I can remember was where members of the SAS were prosecuted following the deaths in Gibraltar.  There have been instances in Northern Ireland.  This shows what this country has come to.  It is, however, necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>A gentleman who used to work in the Department in which Deputy Woods was Minister was taken to the Dublin Mountains and shot because he disqualified somebody from receiving unemployment assistance.  He was later transferred to the section in the Department of Justice for which I was responsible.  This caused great trauma and distress for his family.  A very good friend of mine in the special investigations branch of the Revenue Commissioners has been subjected to death threats on a number of occasions.  It is, unfortunately, necessary to provide for anonymity.</P>
    <P>There is a general provision which states that everything that is reasonably possible should be done to conceal the identify of the members of the bureau. There is no harm including it but as this is a small country I doubt if it will be very effective in practice.  I ask the media to be responsible in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not hold his breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to the point made by Deputy Shortall.  I thought it was the Government's intention that the members of the bureau would have protection at all times but there is no reference to this in the legislation. It might be an administrative matter and it might not be necessary to <Col N="1058" /> write it into the legislation, but I would like some reassurance.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy said he thought there was something in the legislation which would allow these people to be paid over the odds.  I have scrutinised the legislation in the short time available to me and have not found any such provision.  However, people who are asked to take the front line should be compensated adequately, there should be provision for that.  We compensate members of the National Treasury Management Agency in recognition of the work they are doing on behalf of the State.  I would like a little more detail as to how this will operate in practice, but I suppose we will discover that by trial and error.  From that point of view, I agree with the postponement of Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The solutions to poverty, unemployment, inequality, the problems of the underprivileged are long-term.  These problems are world wide.  However, Deputy Byrne should know that there is something his Government could be doing now.  There are 7,000 heroin addicts in this city and less than one in 15 is receiving treatment.  There are queues at the treatment centres on a daily basis.  The Minister for Health, who is a member of the Government supported by Deputy Byrne's party and who has responsibility for these matters, spends his time tilting at windmills, international tobacco companies and so on.  It would be far more useful for the Minister to put some effort into providing therapeutic facilities for people who have consciously made the difficult decision to come off drugs.  That is the sort of action we expect from this Government rather than long-term &ldquo;Creda cares&rdquo; about solving problems that have bedevilled society since its inception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for giving time to allow us contribute to this debate.  It is a remarkable day but it is a very unreal day.  I welcome the legislation with which our spokesman, Deputy McCreevy, has dealt very adequately as has Deputy O'Dea.  I wish it luck in its manisfestation. It will need a hands on approach <Col N="1060" /> and I know the Minister will ensure that is the case.</P>
      <P>I return to my original comment that this is an unreal day.  We have five pieces of legislation and promises of additional gardaí and prison spaces. Suddenly we have extra everything, and rightly so.  This day can be seen as a day of retribution when extremely punitive and proper measures are introduced against those who have benefited from depravity and people's sad situations.</P>
      <P>It is a day of ire and anguish on the part of people who seek to express what they wish to vent on people who have lived and preyed off the community and, in particular the more vulnerable. It is right that on this day we should introduce all of this legislation.  It is seen as a day when blows can be targeted against criminals, in the main those engaged in drug related activity, who will hopefully get their just desserts.</P>
      <P>There is another side to the coin. Lest.  I be denounced as a wimp, a wet, on the left or any of those terms which are used in situations like this to pour scorn on people, I am none of those.  I recognise that severe measures are needed, but I also recognise that this problem has its roots in poverty and long-term unemployment.  There is no point denying that we will hear of people from good areas who had jobs, leaving certificates, decent parents and so on but who have fallen prey to criminals. Of course, that happens, but in the majority of cases we are talking of people who have no hope in life.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne talked about Fianna Fáil being in office.  I am not trying to be smart, but in the past 23 years we have been in Government less than have Fine Gael or Labour.  I do not mean that as castigation, but it is a matter which should be corrected.  The Deputy talked about culture, but that is a plain statistical fact.  I admit that the Deputy's party was not in Government, but those with whom it is now in Government have been there more often in the last 23 years than we have so we are all responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a cycle in this life.  There are <Col N="1061" /> insiders and outsiders.  Insiders have jobs, respectability and status, but most of all they have hope.  Outsiders have none of these.  They have no reason to get out of bed, but they have reason to fall prey to pessimism and a feeling that there is nothing in life for them.  It is easy to talk about fortitude, a &ldquo;get up and go&rdquo; attitude and other characteristics when one has a full belly and a modicum of a salary at the end of a week.  Then one is able to cope with those strictures, admonitions and castigation. I have always admired fortitude, but one cannot preach to those who do not have the basics in life to enable them to get up and go.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to this problem. There are the punitive measures which we must put in place and which I applaud today and there is the other side which is the accumulative growth in long-term unemployment over the last 18 months.  Deputy Byrne does not like that and neither do I.  I do not say so in a tone of glory but as a statistic.  Each person who is long-term unemployed represents one who is daily losing more faith in his or her destination.</P>
    <P>Let us look at strong, cohesive measures to tackle long-term unemployment. There should be one Minister with responsibility for it, not eight, and one Department, not eight sections of Departments.  There should be a focused attempt to get to grips with the problem of long-term unemployment rather than be constantly prating about it as I do every month.  I welcome the punitive measures, but I want to see the other side of the coin addressed as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of Deputies on all sides of the House.  This is important legislation and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education, the community and the family are fundamental.  Rehabilitation is also fundamental and the crime package forms the third part of the equation. I was familiar with this area when in the Department of Social Welfare and I have been keen since then to see the establishment of a unit of this kind.  I <Col N="1062" /> called for it on different occasions, the most recent being the debate on the Criminal Law Bill in May 1996.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I called for a special action force.  The people involved must be highly paid and I plead with the Minister to provide for that.  It should also be anonymous for which the Minister is providing.  The people concerned must be protected, not just part of the time but all of the time.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Social Welfare when an officer of the Department was shot by criminals.  I spoke to him at that time.  He knew what he was doing and he was very brave.  He behaved as the first class public servant he was before, both during and after the experience.  I will not repeat his name here because it should not be repeated, but I knew him particularly well at the time.  Those officials must be protected at all times from the vicious criminals who know exactly what they are doing and will wait for their moment.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to discuss this legislation further on Committee Stage.  One of the points I made on a previous occasion was that, other than members of the Garda, the Bureau should consist of people assigned to it on a voluntary basis.  That may even be necessary in the case of the Garda.  I ask the Minister to consider a three year term which may be desirable for many reasons.  Specialists should also be available.</P>
    <P>We can examine these issues on Committee Stage and see how the Bill can be tightened up to constitute a comprehensive and complete response from this House.  There are only about 40 drug barons and key criminals and they must be targeted and pursued.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will accept that as time is short I cannot do justice to all of the contributions that have been made.  I want to make some general points though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the support that has been forthcoming for the legislation.  We will <Col N="1063" /> get into the detail, of the Bill on Committee Stage which, I expect, will take place some time in September.  It is our intention to put the Bill through both Houses in October.  The regulation provision is a mechanism to enable us to add additional functions which will be derived in the light of experience, which was the thrust of the Deputy's argument. We will be informed by everybody's experience.  An annual report to this House by the bureau would not be a bad idea.  We will look at this in detail.</P>
    <P>Regarding the integrated balanced package we are introducing, of which this is, as Deputy O'Rourke said, the punitive side, Deputy Eric Byrne, whose on the ground experience and knowledge I recognise and respect, made a couple of points with which I do not agree.  I do not support the Californian theory that the reason one does not get out of bed in the morning is that one's grandfather was unhappy in his marriage. That kind of excusing people for not doing things is one of the cruellest forms of dependency culture one can put upon them.  There are many reasons people take drugs, but no excuse.  If one were to take Deputy Byrne's logic further, one could say that every person who is long-term unemployed is a potential drug victim, which is patent nonsense.  In my constituency, which adjoins Deputy Byrne's people in fulltime, permanent public service employment became heroin addicts.  One cannot say that long-term unemployment <i>per se</i> is the cause.  It is a contributory factor, a reason, but let us not say that people have an excuse for becoming drug addicts and are, therefore, not responsible for their own actions.  There are parents who will be in pubs tonight who do not know where their young children are.  That is their responsibility and nobody else's.  That kind of responsibility, about which Deputy Jim Mitchell spoke earlier, has to be part and parcel of the overall solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy, in his comprehensive contribution, spoke about motivation and commitment.  This legislation, <Col N="1064" /> when enacted, will be a partial solution to a complex and comprehensive problem. It will work only if the people who form the bureau are committed to making it work.  For our part, we will do everything necessary to remove perceived impediments.  Deputy Woods referred to them &mdash; anonymity, proper remuneration for risk, provision for taking people off the pitch after three years or less, or provision for simply removing them without explanation because they are at risk etc., proper security for themselves and their families and everything associated with that.  This is not new territory. This State has experience of these things.  Sections of the Garda Síochána have had to live with this reality from the very beginning.  This House has such experience &mdash; when the first Government members of this State went to Cabinet, some of them lived under permanent security in Government Buildings.  Sadly, we are not strangers to that kind of risk for being in the public service.  While it is a sad reflection on society and the modern world, it is, nevertheless, a reality with which we have to cope.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Byrne that the corruption of society in recent times has been compounded in no small measure by the Prove culture of violence to which the criminal classes in Dublin have latched on.  It would be a mistake, however, to suggest that the existence of Provo violence and the availability of guns is a unique factor.  There are guns and violence in other European states that have no political overspill such as we have from the problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised in a more detailed way the question of the amnesty and the interpretation of the legislation.  I have taken additional advice, and the points I put on record earlier stand.  I dispute the Deputy's interpretation.  However, I will, when we have had time to reflect on it, get definitive legal advice on the Deputy's interpretation as against ours.  If it appears there is some legal ambiguity, it behoves all of us to ensure it is resolved.  Let us <Col N="1065" /> be clear about the focus of attention. We are not talking about criminals who have availed of the amnesty and, therefore, cannot be touched.  We are talking about people who are known to lead a lifestyle that could not be sustained by any visible means of support.  That is the points Deputies Shortall and Byrne made.  Through the establishment of the bureau we can do precisely what Deputy Shortall suggested, which is to draw up a plan of campaign to systematically address the issue.</P>
    <P>Of course, politicians cannot and should not be involved.  It is hoped that the media will be helpful and responsible in this matter.  What we are talking about is a social scourge that kills people including, sadly, a member of their own profession.  There has to be room for manoeuvre.  The last thing to help would be a competition among journalists to try to find out who the members of this group are, what they are being paid, how their rates of expenses compare with those of other groups, and all the things that excite and titilate the imagination and, effectively, immobilise the bureau.  This legislation and the previous legislation which has passed all Stages, for which I again express my appreciation to the House, is a belt and braces operation.  When the Seanad passes the previous Bill there will be clear statutory provision for the valid, legal and proper exchange of information between different organisations of the State.  This will maximise the possibility of successful prosecutions. Deputy McDowell will be readily aware that in many cases people who, in the eyes of virtually everybody in the court, are, in all probability, guilty of the offences charged, were able to get off on a technicality, which was cleverly identified and used to good effect by the lawyers, the professional advocates, the intellectual mercenaries who were hired for their skills.  The legislation we are about to pass will, it is hoped, ensure that information obtained through the activities of social welfare officers, tax inspectors, customs officials or the Garda Síochána can be properly used. <Col N="1066" /> This Bill and the role of the legal officer are particularly important.  The legal officer will ensure that every operation planned and executed by this bureau will be planned in such a manner as to maximise the probability of a successful prosecution and conviction.  That is why we have put such stress on this post and why the clear reporting relationship this person will have to the bureau's chief officer is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of operational issues in relation to the legislation that can be properly addressed on Committee Stage.  I invite the Opposition, whose commitment in this area I do not doubt for one second, to take some time to look at the Bill, to consider making whatever observations they wish by way of correspondence or considered amendment.  I assure the House that we will engage in proper, careful and constructive legislative work in September when we meet in Committee to deal with this to ensure that this new bureau will carry out the task for which it is being established and for which everybody has indicated full support.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell tabled an amendment to section 16 on Committee Stage, which has been resubmitted on Report Stage, to provide for the addition of the words &ldquo;or an interest in&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;property&rdquo;. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, undertook on Committee Stage to look at whether it was necessary to tidy up all references to an interest in property.

      <P>This amendment arises from a point raised by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage.  Its effect is to specify a further ground upon which the court could, on the application of the respondent or any other person claiming ownership, discharge or vary an interlocutory order.  Under section 3 (1) the court is prevented from making an interlocutory order &ldquo;if it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice&rdquo;. It is logical to provide for the discharge or variation of an interlocutory order on the grounds of injustice where the serious risk of injustice is a ground for not making the order in the first place.  The amendment makes clear in section 3 (3) that where it is shown to the court's satisfaction that an interlocutory order causes injustice, the court may discharge or vary it as appropriate. The amendment meets the point raised by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this matter in some detail on Committee Stage.  The principal non-semantic difference between the version contained in the Bill drafted by Fianna Fáil and the amendments tabled by the Minister were contained at the end of section 3 (1) of the amended version which states: &ldquo;Provided, however, that the Court shall not make the order if it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is part and parcel of our jurisprudence that the High Court should never make an unjust order.  The High Court is not there to make unjust orders; it will surprise nobody to learn that it is there to make just orders.  That is not, <Col N="1070" /> however, my principal concern about section 3.  It concerns me that it is not explicitly stated that the onus of establishing that there would be a serious risk of injustice rests on the respondent.</P>
    <P>I suggested on Committee Stage that inserting the words, &ldquo;by facts adduced in evidence by the respondent&rdquo;, after &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; would meet my concern. The provision would then read: &ldquo;Provided, however, that the Court shall not make the order if it is satisfied by facts adduced in evidence by the respondent that there would be a serious risk of injustice&rdquo;.  The legislation as it stands is not explicit in this respect.  This amended wording should be considered. If it cannot be accepted in the Dáil, I ask the Minister to bring forward an amendment in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is of considerable importance that the Bill be explicit about where the onus of proof should lie.  The onus of proof at freezing order stage under this legislation is on the respondent.  The Minister moved an amendment to provide that it would also be on the respondent when the disposal order was being made.  I welcomed that amendment, provided it was within constitutional parameters.  In the case of Clancy and McCartney <i>v</i> Ireland and the Attorney General in 1985, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1985, was tested in the courts.  Mr. Justice Barrington held that the legislation represented a delimitation of property rights but did so for the common good and, as a consequence of it being done for the common good, it came within the parameters of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to point out that aside from the extension of the terms of the legislation to include all criminal assets or assets gleaned or obtained by means of criminality, the provision whereby the onus of proof was shifted on to the respondent at disposal order stage represented and does represent the highest possible compliment that could have been paid to the constitutionality of the legislation.  In that context some unattributed person <Col N="1071" /> leaked to newspapers that the legislation was unconstitutional and that the Attorney General had advised the Government this was the position.  I am not pointing the finger in any direction as to who was responsible.  It would not matter much now if it was not for the fact that it has implications for worthwhile legislation introduced by any Member in future.  It is of fundamental importance to our legislators and axiomatically the people &mdash; that legislation which is constitutional, which is worthy of consideration by the House, irrespective of its origin should not be undermined by a person or persons unknown in that fashion.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gleeson is one of the finest legal brains of this or any other generation of Irish lawyers.  I know full well there are no circumstances under which he would advise the Government that the legislation was unconstitutional.  I know that few are as well acquainted with the 1937 Constitution as Mr. Gleeson because he lectured me on the subject and did so extremely well.</P>

The attempt to undermine the legislation in this manner was what I can only describe as an act of national sabotage and whoever was involved should be ashamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate the importance of a clear and implicit statement in the legislation on whom the onus of proof should lie when we are considering whether there would be a serious risk of injustice.  It <Col N="1072" /> not only enhances the amendment, it would be of considerable assistance to the Judiciary in dealing with the legislation because it is important to have certainty in statute law.  In so far as one can achieve that objective it would be my wish and request that this be achieved where it can.  I humbly suggest that the form of words I put forward on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage gives the type of clarity which the legislation deserves.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue again rehashed much of what he said on Committee Stage regarding the involvement of the Attorney General in the matter.  It is most unfair, as it was on Committee Stage, to speak of the Attorney General's involvement in the manner which Deputy O'Donoghue has done.  Is he saying the Attorney General gave advice on this matter or is he saying the Attorney General did not?  He has been skirting around some type of smear campaign on both his Bill and on the Attorney General without producing a shred of evidence.  We are dealing with amendments to the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill, originally the Proceeds of Crime Bill, permitting the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners to seek a High Court order to freeze and subsequently dispose of certain assets by applying the civil standard of proof, the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal standard of reasonable doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer Deputies O'Donoghue and Ahern and members of the Fianna Fáil Party to what happened when the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn passed the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, a few short years ago.  I am sure it has not escaped the collective memory of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench. This Act provided for the confiscation of assets after, and only after, a criminal conviction had been obtained.  The <Col N="1073" /> freezing of assets by way of court order, in anticipation of confiscation, which could be applied for even before a charge was made, could be granted by the court only if it was satisfied that proceedings would be brought and confiscation might consequently be made. This Criminal Justice Act introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, followed the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime which was published as far back as January, 1991.  The Law Reform Commission did not recommend the freezing of assets separate from a criminal conviction.  It stated it was somewhat fearful in advising that the civil standard of proof would be applied and used.</P>

      <P>That is an historical fact. I deny Deputy Flanagan's suggestion that my party is in some way engaging in a smear campaign against the Attorney General.  Despite 16 and a half pages of amendments to a five and a half page Bill, the substance of the legislation is still in place.  The Government introduced a number of changes to the Bill on Committee Stage, which I welcome. These include the expansion of the definition of crime to include all crime and not just organised crime and the expansion of the definition of the assets which can be seized.  The connection between the owner and the assets is even more tenuous as a result of these changes.  At the disposal stage we put the onus of proof on the State but this has not been shifted to the respondent.</P>

      <Col N="1077" /> I agree with those changes but I think Deputy Flanagan will accept that they make the legislation more draconian. The legislation has been cleared by the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson. However, in spite of this there was a report in the 7 July edition of a Sunday newspaper to the effect that the Attorney General had described the less draconian Fianna Fáil legislation as unconstitutional.

The Minister for Justice should have the gumption to come into the House and apologise to the Attorney General for the activities of that anonymous Svengali who was dispatched to the media as part of a campaign of guerrilla warfare against this legislation simply because it emanated from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I am totally confused. Did the Deputies want the Bill to be accepted?  Almost all the Bill required substantial amendment.  In recognising the need for these amendments Deputy <Col N="1078" /> O'Donnell clearly has good legal advice which highlighted the many flaws in the legislation.  I do not know who the Fianna Fáil legal advisers are and I will not cast any aspersions on them.  Suffice it to say that in order to ensure that the legislation was effective I had to substantially amend it and increase the number of sections from eight to 18.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission reported in 1991 but it took until the end of 1994 for the then Fianna Fáil Government to introduce the legislation. I took a lot of stick for taking a few months to consider the Law Reform Commission report on bail.  I have made an announcement about it.  The Opposition has some check to complain when the Law Reform Commission report on criminal assets was on the desks of Deputies O'Dea and Geoghegan-Quinn's for three and a half years.  Some people have forgotten that Deputy O'Dea was a Minister of State in the Department of Justice.  I found very little trace of him or his activity around the Department.  The Opposition must make up its mind.</P>
      <P>The Government, in a spirit that was not manifest when Fianna Fáil was in Government, decided to take the principle of that party's Bill on board but we made it clear that the immediate advice to us was that it required substantial redrafting.  The Law Reform Commission, after studying this issue, warned that using this particular method might cause constitutional problems. My job, and that of the officials in my Department and the Attorney General's office, was to introduce amendments to ensure the efficacy and constitutionality of this Bill as far as possible. It does not want to bring legislation before this House, from any source, if there is any doubt about its constitutionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final word on constitutionality rests with the courts.  The President has the power to refer any Bill to the courts. It is unfair to imply that somebody was trying to diminish the Fianna Fáil Bill by suggesting that there were flaws in it. <Col N="1079" /> That was not the purpose of any amendments. I said openly from the start that I was very concerned about sections of the Bill and my concerns have been well founded.  The amendments have been passed.  If my amendments were so bad why did Fianna Fáil not vote against them?  Perhaps eminent lawyers, such as Deputy Lenihan and others, told them the Bill the party presented was flawed.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Deputy O'Donoghue would use this debate to cast aspersions on the eminence of the Attorney General.  This morning he did so again.  He criticised the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and described it as a hotch potch Bill, that it was thrown together.  No legislation that I bring into this House is thrown together.  It goes through the full rigours of the Attorney General's office.  By criticising that Bill, the Deputy is criticising the Attorney General and casting aspersions on his expertise.  Shame on the Deputy for doing that to any Attorney General, particularly this Attorney General who is so eminent.  I do not pay any attention to the Deputy quoting articles from a newspaper for which I have no responsibility.  I am not Emily O'Reilly, I never will be an Emily O'Reilly and I do not know what Emily O'Reilly wrote on that day.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Donoghue proposed this amendment on Committee Stage he received an answer.  Perhaps he is using it as a way to attack the Attorney General. It is clear that the amendment I am proposing covers Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment by the use of the expression, &ldquo;if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court&rdquo;.  There is no danger that it will be the State's responsibility to do what Deputy O'Donoghue says will be necessary.  I am satisfied that I do not need to accept his amendment. The Bill, as drafted, puts the responsibility on the court.</P>
    <P>I do not see the need to introduce an amendment when I go to the other House tomorrow with this legislation.  I am hoping there will be no further amendments so the legislation can be <Col N="1080" /> signed into law.  Deputy O'Donoghue may think an amendment is necessary but I may not think so.  The Deputy is essentially saying that he does not mind if this legislation is not enacted until the next session because as the Dáil will not be sitting, it will be impossible to return with amendments from the other House.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the amendment is not required so I strongly recommend that the House accept amendment No. 5, as Deputy O'Donnell has.  The advice to her on Committee Stage and now is that the Government amendment is sufficient to satisfy all the requirements of this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, line 7, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may be used to promote awareness of the dangers associated with controlled drugs within the <Col N="1081" /> meaning of section 2, subsection (1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, or may&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment of Committee Stage and it gained the support of all members of the Select Committee.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that any proceeds seized and disposed of by the court under section 4 should be ploughed into programmes to promote awareness of the dangers associated with controlled drugs within the meaning of section 2, (1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The section currently provides that money raised from the sale of assets to be paid to the Exchequer.  Such seized proceeds of crime should be used for something more directly related to the issue of crime, such as educational or rehabilitation campaigns relating to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In February 1994 the Dáil passed the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Act, 1993, which permits the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and, in particular, of drug trafficking when a conviction has been secured.  I wonder how effective this has been, how many orders of confiscation have been made and where the money, if any, has gone.  When debating that legislation, proposals were made on Committee Stage by Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats to the then Minister for Justice, and again on Report Stage, to stipulate the use to which such confiscated money could be put.  All Deputies supported this principle and felt that money confiscated should be used in the fight against drug abuse through a combat drugs fund.  The argument made then is as valid now in relation to this legislation. I am revisiting this concept today to ensure that any proceeds seized and disposed of by the court should be ploughed into such programmes.</P>
    <P>This concept was rejected by the then Minister for Justice in 1994 in relation to an earlier Bill on the grounds, amongst others, that the Minister for Finance saw difficulties from the point of view of departing from the normal Estimates procedures and that it would <Col N="1082" /> create accountability difficulties of concern to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, when dealing with this amendment on Committee Stage, and responding to the unanimous support of the members of the select committee present, referred to the compelling logic represented by this concept and indicated that he would endeavour to respond favourably to my amendment on Report Stage.  I regret that I see no indication by way of amendment by the Minister to reflect that endeavour, but perhaps I will be surprised.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, the Minister of State was obliged to read out reasons why this was not possible and they were identical to those heard in 1994.  This is an example of bureaucracy and a blind adherence to the <i>status quo</i> which so bedevils our efforts in this House.  Such designated funds are widely used in other jurisdictions &mdash; in the United States for example.  Why is it not possible to have such flexibility on this amendment now?</P>
    <P>Those, and there are many, who would condemn our efforts today as representing a one-sided approach to the drugs problem by saying, for example, that the criminal justice response is a one-sided response on the supply side, have the opportunity to vote for an amendment which seeks to integrate the efforts on the criminal justice side with the chronic needs on the demand side.</P>
    <P>Today Deputies were invited to the Dublin city-wide drugs crisis campaign which launched a comprehensive set of proposals aimed at tackling the drugs abuse crisis in a meaningful way.  They recommended that the problem should be dealt with in a co-ordinated fashion, including the treatment and rehabilitation of existing addicts, addressing the conditions that create a drugs culture and adopting a realistic approach to removing drug profiteers from our communities. The best way to respond to the call for an integrated approach is to support this measure.</P>
    <P>The proof of this legislation will be in <Col N="1083" /> its implementation.  If it is successful a sizeable amount of money will be collected, but why should it flow into the black hole of the Department of Finance? Why not devise a relevant plan for the use of seized moneys?  This compelling logic was supported by every member of the committee on Tuesday. The Government recently gave the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, responsibility for proposals and initiatives on the demand side.  This is long overdue and I am sure he will do a good job.</P>
    <P>A total of £7 million has been allocated this year for drug rehabilitation purposes.  Why not allow the proceeds of crime to help drug victims?  The real victims are the generations of young people and their families who have had to live with the drugs epidemic for more than a decade.  The 1994 empirical research carried out on people receiving treatment in Dublin demonstrates the links between drug abuse and poverty. It showed that more than 80 per cent were unemployed, 60 per cent had left school without a minimal education and that 20 per cent lived in the north or south inner city.  We also know the high percentage of offenders who are drug addicts.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt successive Governments have failed to respond adequately to the needs of communities that have suffered from the drugs epidemic since the 1980s.  There are waiting lists for treatment and inadequate health and rehabilitation programmes, particularly on the residential side.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is to be successful and a product of integrated political and administrative thinking, the systems and <i>status quo</i> in Government Departments should bow to the common sense which underlies it.  Similar legislation was introduced in the UK.</P>

      <P>I am not making a Second Stage speech.  I am trying to convey the purpose of the amendment which is to provide for an integrated approach to the problem.  In the UK £20 million was confiscated between 1986 and the last date for which figures are available.  We could do a great deal with such funds if they were confiscated. That is the purpose of this amendment which was supported by all parties on Committee Stage.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>Because the legislation was presented in a spirit of magnanimity, I indicated at the outset that my party would be open to accepting any constructive amendments and our leader reiterated that on many occasions.  The fact that it was accepted with begrudgery is now a matter of history, but the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Donnell is worthy of support. The victims of ruthless criminals and traders in human misery should be the benefactors of assets seized under the legislation.  In most cases we are talking about run-down areas and the underprivileged in society.  It is in keeping with the spirit of this legislation that moneys seized should be utilised for those who have suffered at the hands of drug dealers, traffickers and traders in human misery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Culligan, stated recently, the Department of Justice alone cannot resolve the drug problem.  The Departments of Education and Health have responsibilities in this area, but they are not being discharged in a proper fashion.  The Department of Education should have sufficient resources to enable it to implement an education programme in primary schools on the dangers of illegal drugs and this amendment supports that concept.  The importance of a stay safe programme in our schools has been recognised by many politicians and commentators on this subject.  It is equally important that primary school children are educated on the horrific dangers of illegal drugs.  It is <Col N="1085" /> a sad fact of life, whether through a lack of resources or otherwise, that treatment centres are insufficient and that we as a society have presided over a State institution, Mountjoy Prison, a haven for illegal drugs.  If we cannot control illegal drugs in our prisons one might be forgiven for asking whether we are capable of controlling the supply of drugs on our streets.</P>
    <P>It is vital that more funding is provided to tackle the drugs problem and this amendment would go some way towards achieving that objective.  This society &mdash; certainly the Government &mdash; has not woken up to the fact that the subculture of drugs and organised crime requires a response that reflects a much different society from that which existed 30 years ago.  Deputy O'Donnell's amendment would assist in achieving the intent and principle of the legislation, the five pillars of which are fully intact, despite the parliamentary prolixity of certain sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, as I did on Committee Stage, for a number of reasons.  I very strongly support the principle that the assets of drug dealers should be used for the benefit of their victims.  Their victims are the thousands of young heroin addicts, particularly in Dublin, whose stories were heard by any Members who took the trouble to go to the meeting in Buswells Hotel today by the city-wide campaign against heroin.</P>
      <P>They heard the tragic stories of the parents of young people who committed suicide due to their appalling situation and who saw no way out because there was no treatment or support agencies available to them when they went for help.  Similar stories were told to us last week about mothers and other relatives bringing young addicts who were in a suicidal state to hospitals and being turned away, and being told by one agency after another that no emergency facility was available to them.  In that context this amendment is very important.</P>
      <P>There is a strong belief, particularly among voluntary and statutory groups working in disadvantaged areas, that the emphasis of the Government's approach is one of law and order based on legislation.  There has been little or no reference to what must be the other half of the fight against drugs.  There has to be a parallel programme of health and support services in the areas where heroin has become virtually part of young people's lifestyle because of its ready availability.  If the Government accepted this amendment it would, at least, be a gesture of recognition of the need for such a parallel programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued for a long time for many of the provisions in these Bills.  I support them and am delighted they are being brought in, although I very much regret that some of them probably <Col N="1087" /> would not have seen the light of day but for the awful murder of Veronica Guerin.  Nonetheless, I believed that, used effectively, they can achieved justice in the context of getting after the drug barons who flaunt their wealth on the streets of this city while their victims are dying.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is rejected it will add to the view that the Government is only interested in a law and order approach and does not recognise that the problem of young addicts, in particular, who go looking for treatment is the same today as it was a year ago when the Minister launched her first package to deal with the drug problem. If there is any difference today, it is that the waiting lists at the treatment centres are longer, the availability of heroin in Dublin is more widespread and the number of young people smoking heroin in disadvantaged communities throughout this city is far greater than it was a year ago.</P>
    <P>I know what we will be told in relation to the difficulty of achieving the objective of this amendment because we were told it on Committee Stage and at other times in the past.  However, I strongly believe that if the political will is there to achieve this &mdash; and there was consensus by all parties on Committee Stage &mdash; a mechanism can be found to achieve the objective set by this very worthy amendment.  Such measures have been introduced and used effectively in the United States, as have many of the initiatives in the Bills which came before the House today.  I fail to understand why, if there is agreement that this is a correct course of action to take, a mechanism cannot be found to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw attention to the fact that some of the community and voluntary groups have been carrying the fight against drugs without any support from the State.  Many of these groups have a greater and deeper understanding than any of us of the problems of drug addiction and how to deal with it, yet they are not represented on any <Col N="1088" /> State structure or on the national coordinating committee set up by the Government.  There needs to be direct representation of these voluntary agencies and community groups because they confront this problem, know its extent and how to deal with it much more than any of the specialist agencies involved in the battle against drugs.</P>
    <P>Two very simple measures should be taken to give recognition to the work of people outside this House who are organising and trying to draw attention to the other aspects of the drug problem which need just as urgent an address as the law and order side.  If members of the Government had listened in Buswells Hotel to the stories of mothers whose children had died or committed suicide and to the awful anguish they expressed, then perhaps we would have what I have asked for &mdash; a parallel programme of treatment services and backup support in the areas which have a serious heroin problem.</P>
    <P>It took the murder of a journalist to get some of the measures we have before the House.  It can equally be said if we really listened to what is happening in the disadvantaged areas of Dublin and really cared about the victims of drug dealing, we would make sure that when a parent or an addict look for help and treatment that it is readily available to them.  However, that situation is no nearer to being achieved today than it was a year or five years ago.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I support this amendment.  It is the only aspect of all the legislation before the House today which addresses, or even points in the direction of, the need to recognise the role of community groups which are fighting the drug problem alone.  The amendment also recognises the need to provide treatment support facilities in areas of major heroin addiction.</P>
    <P>Resources must be invested in disadvantaged areas in Dublin and this amendment is a gesture in that direction. I drew the attention of the House to a disadvantaged area in the north <Col N="1089" /> inner city where the Department of Education under the present Minister is reducing the allocation of teachers to schools.  The measures being debated in the House today will be ineffective because a reduction in the allocation of such resources fuels social disadvantage and that leads to heroin addiction.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy O'Donnell for taking the initiative and tabling this amendment, which I strongly support.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Under section 3 (3) a person can challenge an interlocutory order to establish his or her innocence.  It does not seem proper that assets should be left in the possession of such a person for seven years during which time he or she may not make any effort to prove his or her innocence.  Should people who acquire illegal goods through illicit means be allowed enjoy the comfort of a luxury house with, perhaps, a swimming pool, for seven years?  There is no punishment in that.  If one of those people has a luxury car is he or she entitled to use it? The section provides for freezing such assets.  If such a person had a car, he or she would most likely use it and after seven years it would not be worth a great deal.  Similarly a person who owns a yacht could sail around the world for seven years.  Will the Minister explain why seven years was chosen?  Surely two years would be sufficient time to seize goods technically regarded as illicit.  The provision would appear to encourage the people concerned to enjoy the use <Col N="1090" /> of illicit assets for seven years.  We were told previously that under Department of Finance regulations the Minister could not accept money to help those suffering from drug addiction, but if she could accept it, I would support such a measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this useful amendment to the Bill introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue.  While it refers to promoting awareness of the problem, more treatment support facilities are needed in communities who are facing up to the problem in a much more realistic way than they did in the past. Today Members met groups from the north, centre and south west of the city outside the gates of the House.  Anyone who took the trouble to go to Buswells Hotel had the opportunity to have further discussions with the groups involved.  I am familiar with a number of them as they come from my constituency and I know the reality of the problem they face.  It stems from difficulties within the community relating to family, lack of self-esteem, education, disadvantage and a plethora or other problems within those communities but which they are facing up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Fianna Fáil-Labour Government left substantial money for the health board to expand its services in this area and this Government has continued to provide funding.  In the short-term the main problem was to establish treatment centres, not one of money.  Following a good deal of work at community level, especially by community groups and health board officials as well as the input made by officials in the Departments of Justice and Education, an increasing number of treatment centres were established in communities. People have agreed to the principle of the establishment of treatment centres in their communities.  This has overcome a major problem, the rejection of the rehabilitative programme which provided for the establishment of such centres.  Addicts are <Col N="1091" /> now seeking initial and follow-up treatment and there is a healthy development among communities spearheaded by themselves but they require additional resources to develop their work.</P>
    <P>The intent of this amendment is to target additional funds in that direction and to promote development of an awareness of this problem and the distribution of information.  In the early eighties the Health Education Bureau was established under the Department of Health and a great deal of the bureau's work was concentrated in this area.  That bureau was considered not to be sufficiently targeted and that aspect of its work transferred to the Department of Education which has a unit that promotes awareness of this problem.  It is time to establish an independent health awareness and education unit that would have a clear function, that would work with communities and have a set brief and resources.  A great deal of work must be done in this area.  We need a more focused approach to it.</P>
    <P>We need to adopt a holistic approach, that of providing the necessary services, and information and education which will prepare people for employment and we also need to provide assistance to enable them obtain jobs.  That is being undertaken by some community groups with considerable success.  One must address community issues, the real issues underlying this problem.  The money could not be put to better use.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the approach suggested by Deputy O'Donnell whose amendment I support.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what other Deputies said, although I am aware that the points made by Deputy Gregory are particularly important.  The devastation of our youth is something that people thoughout the country do not understand. The Bill is a focal point around which many of these developments are taking place.  One might not think so, but there is co-operative work across the House even though there might also be constructive criticism.  In that context <Col N="1092" /> we must now use this opportunity to do all that is necessary to tackle the problem. Deputies on both sides of the House realise that it does not all rest with the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>It is not about most of the things that Deputy Gregory mentioned, or many of the things Deputy O'Donnell spoke of.  If the Deputies opposite really wanted to do that they should have said it in the amendment.  While many of the speeches we heard are very much to the point in dealing with drugs, they are not to the point in dealing with the Bill.</P>
      <P>All the uses of public funds the Deputies mentioned are ones in which we should engage and they should certainly be undertaken.  They should not depend on the arbitrary happenstance of revenue being available on the seizure of assets provided for in this Bill. We should have more funding for awareness programmes and treatment centres but we should vote the money in this House, the way we do with all public expenditure.  I fully support all the Deputies who want more money to be made available.  I would like to see it done as a matter of course, not depending on whether we happen to have assets available from people who are suspected of having revenue from illicit activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong of Deputies to pretend that an amendment is part of the solution to the groups they spoke about earlier.  It is not.  The way to meet the needs identified by those groups is to vote public moneys whether they come from road taxes, income tax or VAT.  If we want money to be spent it should be voted in the normal way all expenditure is voted.  Let us get rid of the <Col N="1093" /> notion, attractive as it may seem to Deputies who want to make a superficial political case, that there is any particular virtue or point in using earmarked taxes or revenues opportunistically like this.</P>

      <P>My speech will be very short and I will not repeat anything said by previous speakers.  I supported the amendment on Committee Stage and I am happy to vote for it tonight.  Deputy O'Donnell has made, in effect, an unanswerable case.  It is almost as compelling as the case made by Deputy Gilmore in relation to a similar proposal in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment simply states that the sale of assets seized under this legislation may be used to promote awareness of the dangers associated with controlled drugs.  There is no compulsion. Deputy Dukes is concerned about whether this Bill will give rise to any <Col N="1094" /> revenue for the State.  I would not be as pessimistic as that because if no revenue is yielded to the State as a result of this Bill then it will not work and will be ineffective, but I do not believe that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried about that.  I just have no patience for the kind of cosmetic rubbish the Deputy and his colleagues come up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill will make a difference.  If I can anticipate the Minister, the excuse she will probably advance is accounting difficulties in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, that is a pretty poor alibi for refusing to accept this amendment when one considers we are dealing with assets of the overlords of drug related crime.</P>
      <P>In so far as we can identify them, those people originated in deprived inner city areas.  Their rise to wealth and opulence has been fuelled by creating a generation of addicts, mostly in the same areas.  What could be more appropriate when the assets of those people are seized and sold off by the State than that they should be disposed of in such a way as to prevent the army of addicts from growing further?  Young people in these areas should be made aware of the dangers associated with controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke put it eloquently when she said that if people in deprived areas have no jobs and no hope they are easy prey to drug pushers and peddlers. Surely it is fitting that assets nefariously acquired by these people at the expense of the addicts should be disposed of to prevent more people from turning into addicts.  There is an unanswerable case for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intellectually dishonest of Deputy Dukes to talk about awareness campaigns depending on arbitrary happenstance. Nobody is suggesting that. No reading of the amendment could lead one to the conclusion that normal <Col N="1095" /> funding would not also be there for drug awareness programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to record my support for Deputy O'Donnell's amendment which I too recorded on Committee Stage.  Every Member present at that meeting of the select committee indicated his or her broad support for it.  Some of the points made by Deputy Gregory on funding may not be covered by this amendment.  Deputy O'Donnell no doubt will recognise that promotion of the awareness of and dangers associated with controlled drugs may not allow for the implementation of some of the measures which would have been possible were her amendment accepted.</P>
      <P>We are dealing simply with where the proceeds of seized assets should go, whether they should be channelled directly into the Exchequer &mdash; provided for in the Minister's amendment &mdash; or whether they should be ploughed into tackling problems associated with drugs. Those moneys should be expended on additional law enforcement measures, perhaps to better equip the Garda Síochána to deal with these drugs problems and, equally important, in reducing the demand for drugs by helping local communities who suffer from their adverse effects, so eloquently stated by Deputy Gregory.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We are talking about pigeonholing.  In so far as legislators can statutorily pigeonhole funds, we should do so now, since this amendment provides us with that opportunity.  This has proven to be effective in other jurisdictions. Whatever about pigeonholing, the bottom line is represented by the hard decisions to be taken by the Government on the allocation of finance to deal with cutting the supply lines and reducing demand for drugs.</P>
      <P>We hear much about tax concessions in the next budget, about allowing for the voting of varying amounts of annual funding.  The hard decision to be taken by Government this week &mdash; since this House will have devoted so much time to dealing with the crime issue &mdash; will be of little use unless it is also prepared to vote appropriate funding to deal adequately with the problem, in which exercise this amendment will be helpful. I hope the Minister can see her way to pigeonhole the proceeds of forfeited assets; I do not know anything about the amounts involved &mdash; and, perhaps, Deputy Browne is correct in saying that they will be negligible.</P>

      <P>As many Members have said, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said on Committee Stage he would re-examine this amendment to ascertain whether there was any technical method to achieve the intent of this amendment.  I have had discussions with him about this issue.  As Members will know, the Government has acknowledged the importance of promoting awareness of the dangers of drug abuse.</P>
      <P>As it evoked, the debate moved into aspects of health and education.  Since I am neither Minister for Health nor Education, I shall be unable to reply definitively to a number of the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> Suffice to say that, since this Government took office, the Ministers for Health and Education, have taken a number of actions to tackle that aspect of the drugs problem.  As many Members said, it is not simply a matter falling within my remit as Minister for Justice.  Despite the type of criticism to which I have been subjected, the more thoughtful contributions here, the more thoughtful articles in newspapers and presentations by people such as the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Culligan, recognise that tackling our overall drugs problem needs much more than legislative provisions to lock people up or seize their assets.  It also requires the thoughtful, careful implementation of policies on the treatment of drug addicts, for which purpose the Ministers for Health and Education have been putting proposals and resources in place.</P>
    <P>A programme is being introduced in primary schools to warn children of the dangers of drugs and of the extension of treatment facilities.  Deputy Woods referred to a problem about the latter. Funds are available to the Eastern Health Board for the extension of treatment centres, some of which have been extended in addition to new ones being opened.  The Minister for Health has also arranged for the involvement of more general practitioners.  It is a slow process; doctors are not always willing to take on drug addicts, nor are communities always able or amenable to having a treatment centre opened in their area, thus leading to yet another problem.  The congregation of drug addicts around a treatment centre presents problems for local people. Despite the best efforts of the Garda and health board officials to keep treatment centres clear of people who should not frequent them, people do congregate at them and cause trouble for local people.</P>
    <P>Tackling this problem involves all members of sociey taking responsibility; it is not merely a matter of throwing money at it or taking decisions.  Some <Col N="1099" /> decisions have been taken and improvements implemented.</P>
    <P>For example, since the Minister for Health took office, the number of pharmacists involved in assisting drug addicts in Dublin alone has risen from three to 21.  In addition, the number of general practitioners providing treatment in their clinics &mdash; which I consider to be the direction in which we should be going &mdash; has arisen from approximately ten to 55 over the past six months.  The Minister proposes, with the co-operation of the IMO, to get approximately 400 doctors to prescribe for and deal with drug addicts in order to dissipate associated problems and ensure that people do not have to travel great distances to obtain treatment.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with Deputy O'Donnell's amendment.  Indeed, she was right to remind me that a similar amendment was tabled in 1994 when I was in Opposition and for which I voted.  She also reminded the House that at that time Deputies O'Donoghue, O'Dea, Power and Woods &mdash; I cannot remember whether Deputy Moffatt was a Member &mdash; voted against that amendment. I am sure that was done on the advice of their then Minister which was to the effect that that type of ring-fencing was very difficult to achieve in such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell's amendment has been based on the premise that demands for funding of drug awareness programmes can be segregated from competing demands for other Government funds.  While the concept and motivation behind this amendment are worthy, unfortunately I have a problem with it since, as tabled, it would not achieve Deputy O'Donnell's desired objective.  There is no point in accepting such an amendment if it will not achieve its desired intent.  Deputy O'Donnell has not proposed the amendment of another section which specifies that all of the assets from implementation of the provisions of this Bill will be allocated to the Exchequer.  The result is that this amendment merely states generally that <Col N="1100" /> some money may be used to promote awareness of the dangers of drug abuse. While the spirit behind the amendment is laudable and worthy of support, it would not allow for a court to transfer any property to the Exchequer or Minister for Finance.  It simply provides that the proceeds may be used to promote awareness or paid to the Exchequer.  In the amendment the Deputy is content to give any proceeds of criminal assets to the Minister for Finance and leaves it to the Minister to decide whether to pay the money into the Exchequer or to use it for drug abuse programmes.  Let us be absolutely clear about this.  I do not know whether that is Deputy O'Donnell's intention, but that is what would happen.</P>
    <P>From what I imagine to be the objective of the supporters, the amendment would not advance the position in any real sense.  Any proceeds paid to the Exchequer would be at the disposal of the Minister for Finance for whatever purpose the Government decides.  Any additional moneys coming into the Exchequer would give the Government the potential to provide equivalent resources to drug programmes or other worthy crime-related programmes such as victim support and other areas that require funding.  The Government has shown, not only in the recent past but previously, its commitment to give funding to drug programmes.  There are not enough of those programmes and that matter is being acted upon.  Deputy Gregory, probably more than anybody else in this House, is living day to day with the results of inactivity and inaction of recent years, but action is being taken during the term of this Government.</P>
    <P>Nobody can object to the intent of the amendment.  I asked my Department to look at other areas of legislation such as the Road Traffic Acts to see is there is any mechanism I could copy in this regard.  I have been a member of a council for 15 years, like many Members, and on occasion it has been stated that road tax should go directly to county councils to be spent on roads, but instead it goes <Col N="1101" /> to the Exchequer and is then given back to the various local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right to say that drugs awareness programmes and others not covered under this amendment should depend on whatever money comes in under this legislation. Deputy Browne is right in that following passage of this legislation there will not be a single brass penny for a number of years because assets cannot be confiscated until after seven years to allow people to go through the proofs and so on.  In Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill there was provision for two periods, five and seven years, and on examination I have provided for seven years.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell's intention is not clear from the amendment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is chairman of a special ministerial task force on the whole issue of the demand for drugs.  That is further proof that the Government recognises the multifaceted approach needed to tackle drugs. Deputy Rabbitte has assured me that this issue will be examined by the committee to see if there is a mechanism to ring-fence some of the moneys from criminal justice legislation.  No Act ring-fences money, nor would Deputy O'Donnell's amendment ring-fence money in the way she intends.  Deputy Dukes, as a former Minister for Finance, put his finger on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be clear about this matter.  Why did Deputy Ahern, a solicitor, vote against a similar amendment in 1994?  He did so because he knew there was no mechanism to make it work.  Deputy Rabbitte will examine the desired intent of this amendment.  Between now and seven years' time when the first money will become available for this legislation perhaps there will be a change in the way the Exchequer is run.  There is no precedent for ring-fencing money.  Perhaps when the assets are sold and the money comes on stream in six and a half years there will be a mechanism to amend this legislation, but I have not found a way to do so at this stage.  As a Government we will deal in September with Deputy Rabbitte's report on the reduction of the demand for drugs.</P>
      <P>Lest anybody thinks that because I am Minister for Justice and not for Health and Education I am not fully aware of the problems outlined to Members by the groups they met across the road today, last week I met ICON, with which Deputy Gregory will be familiar, as well as the new umbrella group formed under the trade union movement. The Department of Justice is giving funding to ICON and to other people dealing with drug addicts.  It is also funding a large number of youth diversion schemes to try to stop young people getting into a life of drugs.  More needs to be done and as part of my crime package I have got more money to extend those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave a commitment at the meeting with the umbrella group that I would seriously recommend that the representatives of those groups become members of the national co-ordinating committee.  Those people will be members of the under strategy committees that will be set up and the time has come for them to be members of the national co-ordinating committee as well as the regional committees.  Progress has been made.  I listen to groups <Col N="1103" /> who come to talk to me and I have made it my business to invite a number of groups and individuals to the Department of Justice so that I can get an overall view of the problems they face.</P>
    <P>Although I understand the intent behind the amendment, I cannot accept it.  It would not do what the Deputy says.  I have not been able to find a mechanism which would ring-fence the money, which I think is the Deputy's intention.  The money will go to the Exchequer in seven years' time, but by that time I hope this Government, and the next, of which I hope to be a member, will have made great strides in this regard, which were not made in the late 1980s and 1990s when Deputy O'Donnell's party was in Government.  Very little was done at that time about the drug awareness programmes, in which Deputy O'Donnell and Fianna Fáil are now so interested, and there is proof of that.  It is not today we should be teaching our children of the dangers of drugs; that should have been done many years ago.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the drafting of my amendment is defective, that because there will be a lapse of seven years before any money is disposed of by the court, to go into the big maw of the Exchequer, my amendment would achieve nothing.  She knows well, <Col N="1104" /> and has indicated such by tabling and accepting amendments to meet the principle I put forward in other amendments, that if there was political will, that side of the House would accept in principle the terms of my amendment, which would allow the proceeds seized from crime to be ploughed back into assisting on the demand, rehabilitation, prevention and awareness sides.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows full well the intent of this amendment &mdash; she has indicated such by accepting and tabling amendments to meet the principle I put forward in other amendments &mdash; that if there was political will on her side of the House to accept in principle the terms of my amendment, which seeks to allow the proceeds seized from crime to be ploughed back to assist in the areas of demand, rehabilitation, prevention and awareness, she would table an amendment of her own.  The Minister knows well the principle and intent of this amendment.  If she really agreed with it and if there was some clout behind that support, she could have tabled a Government amendment to match the principle I sought to achieve by way of my amendment.</P>

      <P>This Minister is nitpicking through the terms of my amendment to allow her to vote down the principle. If the Minister and the Government supported the thrust of my amendment, which is plain and has received the unanimous support of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, including its chairman, she could have brought forward her own <Col N="1106" /> amendment to tidy it up.  I am no genius at drafting amendments but the principle in my amendment is clear.  The principle of putting down an amendment on Committee and Report Stage is to press the Government to come forward with better alternatives if it can.  It cannot come forward with better; it has come forward with nothing.  It is the product of a lack of imagination and a failure to have integrated thinking, which is the whole purpose of this Bill, and I regret that this Government has taken that approach.</P>
      <P>Having heard the contribution of the Minister of State to the Government, Deputy Rabbitte, I had expected more. He will do a good job in his new brief to work on reducing the demand for drugs and is a good person to be chosen for that role.  However, this was an opportunity for the Government to show some integrated thinking and imagination.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil is pleased that this legislation has been passed through the Dáil.  We did no less or no more than could have been expected of us.  We said more than once that if the Government did not introduce legislation which was required, we would introduce it and that where legislation was introduced by the Government and was required, we would support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> I thank the Government for accepting the legislation and the Minister for Justice and her staff.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate, which was constructive, and we will have fine legislation on the Statute Book as a result.  It was an historic moment because it was the first time an Opposition Bill was taken in Government time and accepted.</P>
    <P>In thanking the Government I am reminded of the words of the founder of Fianna Fáil, the late Eamon de Valera, who, when subjected to a verbal assault in this House, said that he would break stones but that if he ever got any assistance he would not regard it as charity. In the same way, while we thank the Government for accepting our legislation, we recognise how important the legislation was and we do not regard the actions of the Government in accepting our legislation as representing any form of charity.  However, we appreciate the precedent which has been established and hope it will be a happy one.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Many developments have taken place in relation to the courts since I took office.  One of the serious deficiencies I had to tackle was the need for more courtrooms.  I am pleased to announce that extra court accommodation in Dublin will be provided in part of the former Richmond Hospital which is being leased for conversion to court use.  The extra courts provided in this manner will be available for use after the Christmas recess.  Other options for courts are also being explored including the development of courts on the Four Courts site itself.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, was to tackle the problem of arrears of cases and appeals awaiting hearing in the courts through the provision of extra judges and other measures.  That Act has made a substantial contribution to alleviating the pressure on the courts system.  We can already see the results of the appointment of extra judges and the results of a number of other sections of the Act relating to court procedures.</P>
      <P>Three additional Supreme Court judges were appointed on 15 April 1996. That court can now sit in two divisions and as a result two appeals can be heard simultaneously.  Since these appointments, 85 appeals have been heard, 70 of them in the Trinity Term since 5 June 1996.  By comparison, in the 1995 Trinity Term 29 appeals were heard.  It has gone from 29 appeals to 70 as a result of the appointment of those extra Supreme Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two additional High Court judges were appointed on 9 July and a third on 19 July.  While it is obviously too early <Col N="1111" /> to quantify the impact their appointments are making on delays in the hearing of cases in the High Court, I am confident that these appointments are already contributing to the elimination of arrears.</P>
    <P>I have had cause to look again at the position with regard to arrears of cases before the Circuit Court.  In the light of this, I decided to bring forward this Bill to amend the Courts Acts to increase the maximum statutory limit on the number of judges of the Circuit Court by three to 28 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court.  It is intended that these additional appointments will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and the 1995 Act, provide for an additional ten Circuit Court judges, an increase of more than 50 per cent in the number of judges of the Circuit Court.  Three additional judges of the District Court will be appointed as soon as possible.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is currently assessing the applications.  Under the 1995 Act, we have already seen serious criminal cases being finalised in Cork Circuit Court which heretofore would have been delayed by transfer to Dublin. That was a mechanism used and favoured by criminals who wanted to get extra time out while waiting for their cases to be heard in Dublin.  That lacuna in the legislation has now been closed.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in last year's report on the law of bail points out that one way in which bail offending could be reduced is by reducing the length of time persons are at liberty before trial.  In this context the commission recommended that a real attempt should be made to address the root cause of delay.  The commission concluded that the appointment of more judges with appropriate court staff and back-up services would address the current situation where cases which are ready to proceed have to wait their turn because there is no judge to deal with the case.  I am satisfied that providing for the appointment of more judges in the Circuit Court will help to address <Col N="1112" /> the problems associated with the length of time at the disposal of those persons remanded on bail who commit offences while waiting for their cases to be heard. To that extent this Bill forms part of the Government's constitutional and legislative response to the problem of offending on bail.</P>
    <P>Developments in the family law area in recent years and changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts in 1991 have had a major impact on the amount and complexity of business coming before the courts system.  The growth in the number of cases and appeals arising from these factors has been particularly acute at Circuit Court level.  There are unacceptably long family law lists, as pointed out by the Law Reform Commission in its report on family courts to which I will again refer in a moment. Those awaiting the hearing of personal injuries actions in the Circuit Court face long delays.  Not only has the workload been expanding, the trend is towards more complex and, therefore, more time-consuming cases.  Inevitably there is pressure too on the disposal of criminal business in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Appointing judges is not of course the only response available to deal with the problem of delays.  Other measures can also play an important part in alleviating delays.  The 1995 Act, for example, conferred additional powers on county registrars which will have the effect of saving a considerable amount of Circuit Court time as they are now empowered to deal with many motions that formerly only judges of the Circuit Court could handle.</P>
    <P>I announced on 2 July that I had obtained the agreement of the President of the High Court, in relation to the Central Criminal Court, and the President of the Circuit Court for sittings of both courts in September of this year for an extra three weeks.  I already indicated this morning that an extra 100 to 120 cases would be listed in each of the eight circuits during these three weeks as well as cases in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> Overall I am confident that this combination of allocating resources in key areas and practical legislative and administrative reform will quickly equip the courts system with the means to make inroads on delays in hearing cases and appeals.</P>
    <P>The courts system must also have a strategy for its longer term development. A comprehensive examination and review of the entire courts system was needed.  That is why I set up a working group on a courts commission at the end of last year.  It is chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and seeks to review the operation and financing of the courts system with particular regard to the quality of service provided to the public.  I also asked the group to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in line with the commitment to that effect in the Government of renewal programme.</P>
    <P>Last spring, the working group submitted their first report to me on the management and financing of the courts.  The Government has approved in principle the primary recommendation of the report that an independent and permanent body to be known as the court service be established on a statutory basis to manage a unified courts system.  I have asked the working group to submit a further report on how the establishment of the new courts service can be progressed.  The working group will also be continuing its work on the review of the day-to-day operation of the courts system, and it will be submitting further reports to me as appropriate. This is valuable work and I would like to take this opportunity to again thank Mrs. Justice Denham and the other members of the working group for the very important work they have undertaken in this area.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its recent report on family courts examined the type of judicial and court structure that would be most suitable for dealing with family law cases.  This report is <Col N="1114" /> being actively considered.  These recommendations straddle the responsibilities of my Department and the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The report is, I understand, also being examined by the Working Group on a Courts Commission as part of its examination of the courts system in general.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying that I have put much emphasis on the reform of the courts system since becoming Minister for Justice &mdash; tackling immediate problems and implementing a long-term development strategy.  Without both I do not believe we would be doing the job properly.  The benefits of these reforms, along with other initiatives that I am taking in relation to our system of criminal justice, will ensure for the future that the courts and the other key elements of the system will have the capacity to respond effectively to changing circumstances generally and developments with regard to crime in particular. The concentration of resources and long-term planning is crucial to the operation of an efficient system of justice, criminal and civil, which, after all, is the hallmark of a truly democratic society.</P>
    <P>Let me finish by saying that I believe, despite statements to the contrary, that the work done in our courts is as much an integral part of our criminal justice system as any legislation we might pass. Without an efficient, effective and speedy court system we will have the difficulties we are now facing, that I have inherited and that I am now taking action to improve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact that the number of Circuit Court judges is to be increased. However, the Minister was a little less than magnanimous towards the end of her address to the House when she stated that she inherited this problem.  I do not for one moment suggest that the Minister, like other Ministers for Justice, was not faced with a problem or problems on becoming Minister. However, she did inhert as well the Courts and Court Officers Bill which was enacted into law subsequently.  Let it be remembered that this legislation was in the course of preparation prior to the Minister's entry into office, because there was, and still is, a recognition that there was an absence of the number of judges required to speed up the criminal trial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair I should say that this system is in a state of chaos as I speak. The Dublin Circuit Criminal Court has at present three judges dealing with up to 1,000 serious criminal offences every year, by which I mean offences other than murder and rape.  Obviously, three judges could not possibly hope to get through the amount of business with which they are faced in any reasonable time, and the benefactor is the criminal in society.  If there are two things wrong with the Irish criminal justice system &mdash; and there are more than two &mdash; without any doubt it is the present situation on bail and delays in the courts.  There would be no point in having a referendum on bail to provide that if an individual is likely to commit another serious criminal or indictable offence if admitted to bail he should be refused bail for that reason alone unless we can ensure that trials will take place within a reasonable period.  There would be no point in having such a referendum <Col N="1116" /> unless we had a sufficiency of prison places.  That much is evident to anybody interested in the subject.</P>
    <P>I understand that the present position is that dates are now being fixed for serious criminal trials in this city for February of next year.  What does this mean, and what are the consequences for society?  An obvious consequence is that because of the liberal nature of our bail laws the individuals concerned, often hardened or habitual criminals, are walking the streets.  The corollary of that is that the sufferers, those who must endure all of this, the ordinary law abiding citizens, all too often see their homes, their motor vehicles and their property interfered with, stolen or destroyed.  I would contend, and make no apology for it, that in the hierarchy of obligations the protection of people's lives and of their property is a superior obligation and that it is clearly the bounding duty of Government to implement any measures which are required to ensure that the obligation is fulfilled.  I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement this morning that resources would be utilised in tackling this problem, and his recognition that this would have implications in relation to taxation.  I very much regret that it took so long for him and his Government to realise the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>What we have witnessed today is a reaction to a frightful event in Irish life. When a working journalist is gunned down in a street in a democratic state it is clear that the problem is extremely serious.  Unfortunately, there are people in Irish society who believe they are above the law.  They have been dubbed the &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo;.  The Fianna Fáil legislation passed this evening is the central plank of the response that has been debated in the House today, in that it achieves the objective of touching the untouchables.  Appointing judges is welcome.  However, unless back-up staff are appointed by the Government, it will be apparent to everybody that the courts will be unable to function properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> I remain firmly of the belief that the hands of judges will remain tied in so far as delays in criminal trials are concerned for so long as the preliminary examination system continues to exist in our District Courts.  The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 reflected a society which did not have, to any great degree, a subculture of organised crime and drugs. Unfortunately, we now have that subculture and it is prevalent in certain parts of this city.  In those circumstances, it should have been obvious that the preliminary examination system, which is expensive, promotes delays and does not promote justice, should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I outlined in graphic detail this morning why I believe it should be abolished. At present, an accused person can insist on having his or her evidence at preliminary examination stage or the evidence of any person giving evidence before the court taken down in longhand by the District Court clerk.  There is no need in this technological age for me to put the case any further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its purpose is to increase the maximum number of ordinary judges of our Circuit Courts from 24 to 27.  This is a welcome development.  Delays in the Circuit Courts have caused great hardship to legal personnel, the litigants and, in the case of criminal trials, to people awaiting trial.  There is a constitutional right to a speedy trial and the availability of that would reduce the number of crimes committed by people while on bail.  Murder cases can take two years to come to trail because of delays in our courts system.  Delays undermine our system of justice and increase the cost of litigation, particularly in civil cases.  In both criminal and civil cases the trauma for the persons involved is considerably increased by long delays in determining the outcome of cases before the court. Part of the problem is that delays have been built into the system.  I am glad the Government has taken initiatives to reform the courts service and I look forward to the next report of the courts <Col N="1118" /> commission.  I hope an executive courts service will be established with an independent role in providing and managing an efficient court service.  That is crucial for the justice system.</P>
      <P>Our higher judges are badly resourced in terms of their back-up supports. It is useful to compare their supports with the range of services available to Cabinet Ministers who have the Civil Service, in addition to programme managers, advisers and other intellectual supports.  Our High Court and Supreme Court judges need more research support to help them in writing judgments.  The court service has been the Cinderella of the justice system over the years.  I am glad that progressively there has been an awareness in the Bar, in the legal profession generally and among politicians that the courts have been neglected for too long.  I welcome this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to appoint an additional three Circuit Court judges.  However, I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that there had never been a fundamental review of the courts system since the foundation of the State.  The Circuit Court was a big innovation in the courts system in that period.  It was established to decentralise justice and, as far as possible, to make justice of the highest quality available to the ordinary litigant in decentralised venues around the country.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas in recent decades has imposed a vast jurisdication on the Circuit Court in matrimonial litigation, criminal trials and in extending its ordinary civil jurisdiction to £30,000.  The result is that the vast bulk of serious litigation in the State is now conducted in the Circuit Court.  The delays in both civil and criminal cases have become intolerable in recent years.  The delays in civil cases in Dublin in particular are very serious.  The Circuit Court judges in Dublin are to be commended for managing to dispose of a huge amount of criminal business with a limited number of judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> We cannot have more Circuit Court judges without more courthouses.  I was glad the Minister made an announcement in that regard, although it was somewhat vague.  I am not satisfied that there is sufficient court accommodation. I wish to make a final plea about court accommodation and it relates to the District Court more than the Circuit Court.  I hope the Minister will be sympathetic to my plea.  There is a need to develop district courthouses in suburban Dublin.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would be grateful, as we did not realise this was the last sitting day before the retirement of the Captain of the Guard, Commandant Cathal Ó Laoghaire, if we could interrupt proceedings briefly so that the Members of the House who worked with him since he came here in April 1977 &mdash; I remember it well &mdash; could pay tribute to him to mark his imminent retirement.</P>
      <P>Commandant Ó Laoghaire served this House very well.  He managed the affairs of the House, looked after the security of Members and staff with all the care one would expect of someone who has given distinguished service to this State in the national army.  He served in the Defence Forces for 25 years; in the first Irish Army contingent he served in the Congo, he served twice in Cyprus, in the Middle East as a company commander and was assistant officer commanding the military defences at Government Buildings prior to his appointment as Captain of the Guard.  Prior to all that he had a very distinguished career in another capacity. He was a member of the Dublin All-Ireland winning team of 1958 and is the holder of six Leinster championship medals.  Those were the days when Dublin could count on winning championships regularly.</P>

      <P>I hope they will not do anything untoward next Sunday. Cathal also won four Railway Cup <Col N="1121" /> medals.  He has not ceased to be an athlete. I believe he is the niftiest golfer in the House and I have no doubt he will continue to join Members of the Oireachtas golfing society on their outings in the future.</P>
      <P>The last 19 years have been an eventful phase in the life of this House.  Commandant Cathal Ó Laoghaire was here during very tense moments when he was able to help defuse many a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>I also recollect, though some of the more well behaved Members of this House will not have had this experience, the tact with which the Captain of the Guard advised us it was time to close the bar in Leinster House.  That was also one of his responsibilities.  I wish Commandant Cathal Ó Laoghaire a very happy and, I have no doubt, an active retirement.  I thank him for the service he has given to the House and to the State through the military career.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to Commandant Cathal Ó Laoghaire.  I am used to seeing him in the House and it is always sad when someone who has been here for many years retires.  Cathal Ó Laoghaire was always here.  Those of us who have been in Government over the years had a few words with him every day.  He was a good friend and adviser in the House, particularly in the early years when people are not anxious to let you in on secrets.  They all say they will help but it does not work in practice.  You have to depend on Members for advice and knowledge but Cathal Ó Laoghaire was always helpful to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach outlined his many distinguished careers before he came to work here: his distinguished military career abroad and his great sporting career which he still maintains.  He will probably have more time to have his handicap cut over the years.  He is among the skilled golfers of this House. I am not sure how Members and those who work here manage to be such good golfers.  As somebody who knows very little about golf I will try to find out <Col N="1122" /> about it in my later years.  I appreciate all that Cathal has done for members of the Fianna Fáil Party over the years and the concern he has shown for Members of the House.  He had to put his foot down now and again about various rules but we have never had too many arguments or rows when I was Whip or otherwise.  I always found Cathal approachable and I wish him, his family and all his friends well.  I hope he enjoys a long period of active retirement. Being a former member of the Dubs all those years ago ensures he will be fit for many years to come.  I wish some of the present team were as fit.  He is probably one of the fastest individuals we ever had on a Dublin field.</P>
    <P>Another member of the Staff, Dermot McCarthy, is also retiring after almost 30 years' service and I wish him well.</P>

I thank him for his services here and for his great courtesy to Members at all times.  I wish him well in his retirement and envy him the opportunity to play golf seven days a week, if he wants to.  I am sure his many successes over the years will be multiplied by the fact that he is retired.  I hope his memories of this House will be pleasant and even if he had a little too much excitement at times that, overall, he found it a pleasant and interesting experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the recent developments in the Northern Ireland situation, it would have been inappropriate to have a Dáil session today and not devote some time to a discussion of what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> A statement issued by the Church and Government Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland this week began with the stark sentence: &ldquo;There are widespread feelings of fear, pain, confusion and stress throughout Ireland caused by the events of the last few weeks.&rdquo;  The statement went on to identify decisions on parades as the immediate cause of the fear, pain, confusion and stress.  It went further and pointed out that &ldquo;the present situation requires the political process to be pursued positively which will involve courage and the taking of risks.&rdquo;  The heart of this problem, as every Member of the House knows, is the failure to reach an accommodation around three sets of relationships: between the two communities in Northern Ireland, between both parts of Ireland and between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The difficulties created, for example, by parades is but one manifestation of the underlying political problem and for this reason all our major efforts are directed towards negotiating agreement on political structures which will accommodate the three sets of relationships in a fruitful way.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the current political process I would like to reiterate some points about the parades and the severe difficulties which can arise as a result of handling them.  I have already made my views known about the handling of the parade in Portadown.  The authorities of a democratic state &mdash; any state &mdash; cannot afford to yield, or to be perceived to yield, to force or to the threat of force, cannot afford to be inconsistent and cannot afford to be partial in the way in which they apply the law.  These basic tenets of democratic statecraft were, I have argued, breached in the case of the Portadown parade.</P>
    <P>As is now clear, there is a deficiency in the regime for dealing with controversial parades in Northern Ireland.  In this respect Northern Ireland is not Surrey, Dublin or Galway.  It is a divided <Col N="1124" /> community with a long history of confrontational marches.  That is why I have been pressing for a review of the arrangements for dealing with parades and marches, and I welcome the recent announcement by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State that the current arrangements are to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>At present the arrangements do not allow for sufficient weight to be given to the overall interests of community relations and to the damage that may be done to these relations by allowing people to parade through areas where they are not welcome.  At present there has to be a morally offensive auction between competing threats of violence and disruption.  The RUC is placed in a position where, in the interests, as it sees it, of minimising harm, of achieving the least bad outcome, it has to make a calculation which essentially involves yielding to the greater threat of disorder even though the price of that may be a lesser degree of disorder.  That is not an appropriate position for it to be in.</P>
    <P>The parades arrangements clearly need to be revised to accommodate the issue of the likelihood of a parade resulting in long-term damage to community relations, something which has happened in recent times.  In making decisions of this nature it might be profitable to study South African legislation which takes into account factors such as preventing &ldquo;the causing, encouraging or fermenting of feelings of hostility between different population groups or parts of population groups&rdquo;.  It should be possible to have arrangements put in place in Northern Ireland under which the identities of the two traditions can be recognised and accommodated in this way in regard to parades or demonstrations which can be offensive to one or other of them.  Together with the Tánaiste, I will continue to monitor the parade situation closely.  We are currently in discussion with the British authorities about possible upcoming flashpoints.  We must not have a repetition of what happened on the Garvaghy Road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> No action or inaction on the part of the British Government in relation to Portadown justified the murder, intimidation, destruction of property and general mayhem which followed it right across Northern Ireland.  Democracy fundamentally depends on the principle that people are free to argue against, disagree with and criticise the decisions of the lawful authority, but they are not free to disobey such decisions.  I wish to quote the following from the Presbyterian Church statement:</P>
    <P>...the properly constituted authorities of the state are to be obeyed. Only under the most extreme circumstances can this obligation be refused. We do not believe that such circumstances obtained in recent times.</P>
    <P>That is a direct reference by the Presbyterian Church to the events in Portadown. I would go further and say there has not been, nor is there now, any justification for the use of violence to achieve political objectives.  This is particularly so when negotiations are already taking place and for which the only entry qualification is that participating parties reject violence or any support for violence.</P>
    <P>Of course all of us are frustrated at the pace of progress in these negotiations. After 40 days formal agreement has not yet been reached on the rules of procedure or on the agenda.  This delay must at the same time be placed in the context of 25 years of violence and hundreds of years of division, supermacism, misunderstanding and fear in the northern part of this island.  Procedural arguments which can appear superficial or almost irrelevant to outsiders can at the same time provide a means through which the participants acquire a sense of ownership of the process, thereby facilitating eventual agreement, and, perhaps, easier agreement, on issues of substance when the substance is eventually reached.</P>
    <P>There have, however, been some recent encouraging developments in the <Col N="1126" /> talks.  While I am inhibited by the confidentiality of the proceedings from giving details, I can say that we are working towards a situation where it might be possible to reach agreement before the holidays on many of the outstanding procedural issues and to pave the way for negotiations on the substantive questions after the short summer recess of the talks.  These negotiations, involving the assistance of Senator George Mitchell, General de Chastelain and Prime Minister Holkeri, represent by far the best opportunity that has existed in out lifetime to arrive at a political settlement to accommodate the three relationships which have not worked in so far as this island is concerned and its relationship with its neighbour.</P>
    <P>All the relevant parties are at the talks except Sinn Féin and all its members have to do to take their seats is persuade the IRA to restore the ceasefire.  All the relevant issues are on the table at the talks and any participant can add any additional issue which he or she feels it is necessary to discuss.  Both Governments have done an enormous amount of preparatory work to facilitate a successful outcome to the talks.  During the past 40 days at the Belfast talks the Irish Government has shown its willingness to work with the other parties to the negotiations to accommodate their viewpoints.  It is important that the political parties in the talks each take on their own responsibilities.  The bigger the party the bigger the responsibility, not to its own supporters but to the entire community.  The gainers in these talks will be those parties which take additional responsibility on their shoulders rather than those who try to pass off the responsibility for the hard, risky or difficult decision to another participant.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to emphasise three key points: the negotiations are serious and comprehensive and both Governments are committed to achieving a successful outcome; we will not allow decommissioning of arms to derail the negotiations &mdash; it will be tackled but only in parallel with other <Col N="1127" /> issues in the negotiations; and both Governments will do everything possible to promote confidence building during the talks.  This has been explicitly recognised in the communiqué which Prime Minister Major and I issued in London on 28 February last.  I hope these three points will reassure the Republican movement and finally convince it that now is the time to restore the ceasefire and to give the political process a chance.  There has never been a better or more appropriate time to do this.</P>
    <P>To the Unionist community, I repeat a message already articulated many times by me and by all of my recent predecessors as Taoiseach.  The principle of consent as set out in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Joint Framework Document is sacrosanct.  There can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland unless and until a majority of the people there freely so decide.  There has never been a more favourable climate or more constructive arrangements available for a successful negotiation. Again I say to Unionists, &ldquo;You have seen the economic prospects and the security which 18 months of peace brought.  How much more glittering is the prize which a lasting settlement of the cause of the division would bring? We on this side of the Border respect your traditions, heritage, beliefs and allegiance.  We understand your fears and anxieties.  We ask only that you respect the traditions, heritage, belief and allegiances of your Nationalist neighbours and that you, too, understand their fears and anxieties.&rdquo;  As the Presbyterian Church statement made clear, the achievement of success in the political negotiations will involve courage and the taking of risks.  I assure the representatives of unionism with whom we are currently in negotiations that this Irish Government has courage and is ready to take risks.</P>
    <P>I also assure everyone on this island and in Britain that we are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to reach a settlement.  I know the British Prime <Col N="1128" /> Minister and his colleagues in Government share this commitment and, despite our recent disagreement, both Governments are continuing to work closely and constructively together to achieve the settlement that has eluded so many generations of Irish and British politicians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As democrats, it is our duty to continue to work for peace, stability and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, regardless of whatever setbacks we may encounter.  Other peace processes in the Middle East, South Africa and Bosnia have suffered huge difficulties from time to time.  Often it would have been too easy to give in to despair and to conclude that the problems are so intractable that they can never be solved.  So it is with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Few people could fail to be depressed, after the high hopes that lasted for 17 months, at how swiftly the peace process has seemed to unravel before our eyes.  Mistakes made a year or more ago and past mishandling have snowballed into the current crisis.  Equally, there have been acts and threats of violence that show a frightening irresponsibility, although at other times there has also been a commendable restraint.  The right steps taken by the two Governments, leading to the all-party talks which finally started on 10 June, would have had far more beneficial and confidence-building effect if they had happened a year previously when the momentum was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, on top of the difficulties created by the renewed IRA campaign and the snail's pace of progress in relation to both the talks and the Northern Ireland Forum, we have had the mob violence sparked off by the Orange parades through the Garvaghy and Ormeau Roads.  There has unfortunately been a serious deterioration in community relations which we deplore. The state, which buckled under the threat of violence, is apparently no longer able to hold the line, and therefore cannot in practice guarantee the rigorous impartiality and parity of <Col N="1129" /> esteem promised in the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>We face a prospect of further débâcle, violence and inevitable death, unless we use the shock of recent events constructively to arrive at a new basis for progress and accommodation.  I would like to think that the two Governments and all the northern parties are urgently engaged on this task.  Although public feelings and anger are very strong we must be measured in our recriminations and try to use the painful lessons of recent events to create a better future. There are deep-rooted feelings and frustrations in both communities which must be identified and dealt with in an understanding and sensible manner. There is a way forward, and that is where both Government's efforts can best be focused.</P>
    <P>In the Downing Street declaration, the British Government committed itself to working actively to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of agreement.  That was a cornerstone of the peace process which cannot be abandoned.  The peace process and the talks leading to a settlement were always intimately connected.  The ceasefires needed to be underpinned by engagement in early negotiations. Indeed, the understanding that meaningful talks would happen within a few months was the basis of the ceasefires. Does anyone in Northern Ireland seriously believe that a secure peace can be had without any willingness to engage in serious negotiation, leading to the creation of a structured settlement? Equally, it was wrong of the IRA to call off its ceasefire while efforts were still continuing to try and organise inclusive and comprehensive political dialogue.</P>
    <P>Ths violence has left Sinn Féin, despite its enhanced electoral mandate, outside the Stormont talks.  There is nothing to be gained by a return either to the communal or paramiltitary violence of the past 25 years.  Neither community will gain and both stand to lose very heavily.  It is not likely that this part of the country will remain untouched. Continued IRA violence, to the extent <Col N="1130" /> that it may provoke a loyalist reaction, puts Nationalists at risk in the North and also jeopardises the safety of the people of this State in a very tangible way.  The only way to tackle the deep seated problems of the North is in a concerted, dignified and democratic way, with the two Governments giving the lead as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Since we went into Opposition, Fianna Fáil has tried at all times to sustain the peace process, to find ways around difficulties and to encourage a political way forward.  We have been able more easily than the Government to keep direct lines open to Sinn Féin at the highest level.  We would not be willing to do this if we did not believe that most of the people with whom we have dealings are genuinely committed to reestablishing a viable peace process with a reasonable time scale.  At the same time we do not underestimate the formibable task of persuasion and the ingrained scepticism they face.</P>
    <P>The entire premise of the peace process was that a proper IRA ceasefire would enable Sinn Féin to go into talks. However, as former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, stated in the Dáil after the Heathrow bombing on 10 March 1994, column 700 of the Official Report: &ldquo;Let there be no illusions.  There is a place at the negotiating table only when violence ceases for good, not before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we in this House are united on this point, we must be equally unwavering in ensuring that there is a place at the table for Sinn Féin as soon as IRA violence stops for good.  I am glad that so far the response of the IRA to the provocations of the Garvaghy and Ormeau Roads has not been the planting of further bombs, which cause such dismay, destruction and sometimes death, as well as such injury, hurt and anger.  The stopping of violence for good has to include an end to the barbaric punishment beatings, which are a disgrace to all the organisations which carry them out, and which are a gross violation of human rights. That is what they are and no verbal gymnastics can change that fact.</P>
    <P>If paramilitary violence is <Col N="1131" /> unacceptable, so also is the street violence provoked by the Orange Order and their defiance of the rule of law. Democratic leaders may not stand at the head of large and angry crowds and threaten to break the law if they do not get their way.  The leaders of unionism were <i>prima facie</i> in breach of the fourth Mitchell principle, which requires them to renounce the use of force themselves, and to oppose any effort by others to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the course of the outcome of all-party negotiations.  Organisations that make bomb threats are also in breach of this principle.</P>
    <P>These actions raise the question of what sanctions are available against those who breach the Mitchell principles. The resort to physical force on the streets undermines trust and confidence, not only in the rule of law, but in the strength of any compromise settlement achieved at the negotiating table, given the history of democratic decisions being overturned in 1912 and 1974.</P>
    <P>It must now be clear that Northern Ireland can only be made a viable political entity on the basis of mutual consent and accommodation.  That is why the forcing through of Orange marches through overwhelmingly Nationalist areas where they are not wanted was so wrong.  What sort of civil and religious liberty blocks off roads and streets, keeps people of another religion imprisoned in their homes, denies access to them, and has no respect for the feelings of a local religious minority?  The Orange Order makes a hollow mockery of its own ideals in these instances and in so doing damages its own country.</P>
    <P>The Christian Churches, whether Catholic or Protestant, should not become involved in sanctifying defiance of the law, and should strongly encourage a basic respect for the rights of the other tradition.  In this regard, I welcome the measured wisdom of the Presbyterian Moderator and his Church in recent days.  In the present tense situation measured and understanding <Col N="1132" /> words are a true sign of leadership and public bravery.  It is indefensible that people anywhere in Northern Ireland should be driven from their homes because of their religion or that churches or community halls on any side should be attacked.  Sectarianism must be combated vigorously.</P>
    <P>All communities, where they are in a minority, are especially vulnerable.  I call on the Orange Order to play its part in reconciliation by entering into negotiations with local residents in areas where there are problems, seeking agreement and consent, where necessary. We cannot afford a further repetition in a few weeks' time, or next year, of the orgy of destruction that has already taken place.  Independent commissions may do good work, but unless the Orangemen are prepared to accept the rule of law and acknowledge the need for consent, the same problem will recur over and over again.  If the Orange Order is not prepared to do this, political and community leaders must intervene and exert their influence to demonstrate that public order, community harmony and cross community relations are of a higher order than unfettered tradition.</P>
    <P>When that has happened new police structures will be required in Northern Ireland.  Fundamental policing reform must be on the agenda for the talks.  The RUC has lost the trust of the people, following much good work in recent years to improve the image and reputation of the force in the community by many individual officers.  It is clear that the decision to hold the line in Portadown was undermined from above and below and that the RUC as currently constituted is not capable of exercising rigorous impartiality or ensuring equality of treatment between the two communities.  Much more police violence and intervention was exercised by the police against the Nationalist community, in terms of batoning peaceful protesters, firing plastic bullets and sealing off areas.  It should be a matter of <Col N="1133" /> grave concern to the British Prime Minister that, unlike in Surrey or in the coal fields when Arthur Scargill and the miners were on strike, the police in Northern Ireland are not capable of maintaining impartiality and the rule of law and have abjectly given way to mob violence.  The world has once again been shocked by recent events.</P>
    <P>Our primary concern must be to ensure there is not a repetition of trouble on a similar or worse scale by the Apprentic Boys' march down the Ormeau Road or in Derry on 10 August.  That is why I wanted to learn at first hand last week the true position from residents in different areas.  That is why a presence of international observers and members of political parties from this House, from the European Parliament and elsehere should act as a moderating and restraining influence on both sides.  If we have the will, we can do a great deal in this regard.</P>
    <P>We must remove obstacles to a fruitful talks process.  The filibustering over procedures must stop so that substantive talks can begin.  There must be a clear assurance that Sinn Féin will be admitted to talks as soon as the original ceasefire is reinstated.  In the light of recent events, the two Governments should recognise that an absolute insistence on parallel up-front decommissioning, however desirable, is no longer realistic and that it must be dealt with as an essential part of an overall settlement.  Acceptance of those three points would significantly enhance the chances of a new ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The freeing of the logjam on substantive talks is timely and welcome.  No firmer sign of political leadership could be given in the current tinderbox of community tension than that the leaders of democratic parties in Northern Ireland begin meaningful negotiations on the future of the relevant relationships in the North, in Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain.  I am conscious of the vast amount of hard work done behind the scenes by officials of the Irish, British and US Governments in trying to facilitate a positive <Col N="1134" /> outcome at this vital time.  They deserve our highest commendation for their work and continued efforts.</P>
    <P>We must not witness again in our time a Nationalist community under siege to an Orange Order group determined to force its way on the community without discussion, consent or consensus, Let Drumcree and the Lower Ormeau Road be the end of that, once and for all.  When we return after the summer recess I hope real talks will have started, that there will be an end to the violence and that the position will be much brighter than it is tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, is en route to Australia on an official visit.  He asked me to address the House on this issue on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to reflect on the events of recent weeks and to take stock of their impact not just on Northern Ireland but on relations between the Nationalist and Unionist traditions on this island.  The events surrounding the celebration of the Twelfth were a stark reminder to all of us of the real divisions which exist between the two communities in Northern Ireland and the powerful nature of the feelings which can be aroused on the issues of culture and identity.  They also brought home to us the difficulty &mdash; the crucial importance and sensitivity &mdash; of all our efforts to make progress towards lasting peace and reconciliation.  It behoves us all to tread carefully and weigh our words well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enormous efforts have been invested in the search for lasting peace and reconciliation in recent years.  After 25 years of violence, the killing stopped in August 1994 and the peace endured for some 18 months.  During that time, there was a glimpse of the reservoir of goodwill and hope among the ordinary people that could be drawn on by political leaders seeking to build a better and brighter future for both communities in Northern Ireland and for better <Col N="1135" /> relations in Ireland, North and South. Fear was banished from the streets of the North.  Investment moneys, public and private, began to flow into Northern Ireland's economy.  Financial contributions to building the peace increased from the United States and Europe and cross-Border travel increased dramatically.  Political leaders could take hope and courage from the public expressions of support and the obvious potential offered by the ceasefires.</P>
    <P>This surge in hope and optimism found a focus in the visit of President Clinton at the end of the year.  The welcome accorded the President and his wife Hillary, in Northern Ireland and in Dublin, was a fitting tribute to his enormous personal commitment to the search for lasting peace on this island. We all shared in that optimism.  That and the knowledge that the United States stood ready to assist, further encouraged us in the search for an agreed political solution.</P>
    <P>The ending of the IRA ceasefire was a setback to that search and a profound blow to the optimism that an enduring peace lay in the not too distant future. It was a moral travesty and an affront to the wishes of the vast majority of people on this island.  It was also a profound political mistake.  No amount of dissatisfaction at the political response to the ceasefires could even remotely justify a reversion of violence.</P>
    <P>That the ending of the IRA ceasefire has not resulted in the sustained resumption of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland has caused many to continue to hope that a return to a futile cycle of violence might be averted and the ceasefire restored.  That the loyalist ceasefire endures is an important and praiseworthy achievement and offers further encouragement that peace can be fully restored.  The Government and the vast majority of people on this island hope that this proves to be the case.  For the good of all the people who share this island, for the good of the next generation who have to bear the burdens of our mistakes and failures <Col N="1136" /> and for the purposes of a lasting settlement emerging from the talks process, the sooner the ceasefire is restored the better.</P>
    <P>While the Government is actively seeking the unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire of August 1994 which would pave the way for Sinn Féin to enter the negotiations, this process cannot be held in abeyance while we wait for this to happen.  The current negotiations are part of a process in Anglo-Irish relations, aimed at achieving a lasting political settlement based on consent. The Anglo-Irish Agreement set the pattern of close co-operation between the two Governments which led to the joint declaration and a new framework for agreement.  It remains the necessary condition for the resolution of a conflict which has proved so costly in human and material terms to both islands.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the achievement of stability regarding Northern Ireland and has helped to steady many volatile situations. It has also imparted a crucial degree of comfort and support to political leaders in Northern Ireland engaged in the search for peace and reconciliation and who may be prepared to explore options for accommodation in that context which they might otherwise fear to do.</P>
    <P>The work of both Governments is predicted on the evident truth which the leader of the SDLP, John Hume, has so consistently identified as the defining reality in the political landscape within Northern Ireland, that the problem of Northern Ireland arises from the division between the people of this island. The resolution of the problem, therefore, lies with bridging the divisions between our two traditions.  That can only be achieved through agreed relationships based on the consent of both communities &mdash; relations between them within Northern Ireland, relations between North and South and relations between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> The key to the process of agreeing and constructing this architecture of political consent lies in the current political talks.  I take this opportunity of recording the Government's appreciation for the patient and unstinting efforts of Senator George Mitchell as chairman, assisted by Harri Holkeri and John de Chastelain, to move the process through what has been a difficult and protracted opening phase.  Their contribution has brought us to a position where there is now some real hope that the negotiations will move before too long from matters of procedure and agenda to issues of real political substance.</P>
    <P>For many, including the Irish Government, progress in the talks has been painstakingly slow.  Nevertheless, we are determined to do all in our power to accelerate the rate of progress and to pursue the political accommodation which we all know must sooner or later be achieved.</P>
    <P>Events at Drumcree have had a profound impact on the political landscape in Northern Ireland, and have raised many deep questions in the minds of the Nationalist community.  The Government's position, as stated repeatedly in the House, is that parades and those who organise them should be governed by the principle that they should not take place in an area or along a route where they are not welcome.  This principle seeks to establish respect for the rights and sensitivities of local residents without impinging on the right to celebrate identity and heritage by marching.</P>
    <P>The prospects for this year's marching season were reviewed at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held on 22 May 1996.  As the communiqué which was issued after the conference stated, both Governments &ldquo;called on all those involved in the planning of parades this year to exercise compromise and balance in the interests of the community as a whole.  To that end, agreements between all concerned should be encouraged&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> The Government continued to monitor the situation closely as it developed, particularly in regard to those parades most likely to prove contentious, for example, parades proposing to march along the Garvaghy Road in Portadown and the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast. It was hoped that agreement could be reached between the local residents and the relevant Orange Lodges.  The Government was aware of attempts to assist agreement through mediation and we supported them strongly.  Regrettably, these efforts did not bear fruit.</P>
    <P>The decision on proposed parade routes is a matter for the RUC.  Under the Public Order Order of 1987, a senior RUC officer can reroute a parade if he or she believes that the parade, and I quote from section 4 of the order &ldquo;may result in serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community&rdquo;.  The Government believes that this approach can result in a situation where the greater threat or the greater number will decide whether a parade proceeds along its proposed route or is rerouted in the face of local objections.  There is clearly an incentive in the current legislation to exaggerate the threat to public order with a consequent motivation to back this up with a show of force.  The dangers of allowing issues of public order to be decided by numbers rather than by the test of law or reason are two obvious to need elaboration.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government has repeatedly expressed its belief that the issue of parades in Northern Ireland is not simply a matter of public order.  To treat them merely as a security issue would suggest a disregard for the lessons of history revealed by the last three decades in Northern Ireland.  Parades, particularly those of the Unionist community, have traditionally been an expression of identity, heritage and allegiance.  Parades have also been vehicles for political beliefs and responses to prevailing political issues, a function more often associated with the Nationalist community.  In either case, the parades and the routes they take, <Col N="1139" /> are highly sensitive, not to say emotive issues.  They should be handled with due regard for all their political implications, which, as we have seen, are sometimes very profound.</P>
    <P>The Government has in the past conveyed its belief in the flaws in the approach to parades set out in the Public Order Order to the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. In this context, the Government welcomes the remit of the review of parades and marches in Northern Ireland announced yesterday by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew MP, in the House of Commons which includes in its terms of reference the following: &ldquo;the adequacy of the current legal provisions, and in particular the adequacy of the statutory criteria used in making decisions on public procession and open air public meetings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many in the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland have expressed doubts about the adequacy of the proposed review to fully deal with the implications of the situation created by the events surrounding Drumcree.  There is a need to fundamentally review the parades issue.  The composition of the review body will be critically important in encouraging confidence that the process will be comprehensive in its research, impartial in its assessment, and sensitive and imaginative in its recommendations in all the areas which fall within its remit.</P>
    <P>However, the impact of the events at Drumcree and the Ormeau Road and their aftermath went far beyond the question of parades.  They precipitated a collapse in Nationalist confidence in the rule of law, the willingness of central authority to enforce it, and in the RUC itself.</P>
    <P>That there was a challenge to the rule of law at Drumcree is without question. Based on the powers conferred on him by the Public Order Order, the Chief Constable directed that the return leg of the Orange Lodge's church march <Col N="1140" /> should not go down the Garvaghy Road.  In the expectation of such a direction, there was an apparently coordinated effort to challenge that direction through widespread disruption across the entire area of Northern Ireland.  That disruption involved blocking roads and access to ports and airports and illegal marches with intimidation, arson attacks and hooliganism following in their wake.  It was accompanied by a well organised assembly of ever increasing numbers at Drumcree which at times erupted into riotous behaviour.</P>
    <P>To many in the National community there appeared to be reluctance in the face of this disruption to enforce the rule of law.  Yet there was also hope that the RUC would stand firm at Drumcree, that central authority would not buckle under the threat of numbers. The physical blocking of the road and the announcement that extra troops were being flown in added to the certainty that the authorities would call on whatever resources were needed.</P>
    <P>It was the sudden shattering of this expectation and the harsh manner in which the Garvaghy Road was cleared of peaceful protestors by the RUC which combined to produce such shock within the Nationalist community.  Its sense of dismay was shared by many here in the South and, indeed, by many people abroad.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 July, the images of street violence, the rioting and the response of the security forces recalled images of the past which we had begun to hope had been left behind for ever.  It appeared as if the stark forces of mutual suspicion and enmity had been unleashed. In the words of Cardinal Daly, who had done so much with the other church leaders to defuse the situation through mediation, it was a black day in the history of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The strain of events was felt at all levels, emotional and political.  It was felt on the streets, among political and community leaders and between the two Governments.  As the Government statement issued on 11 July said, the <Col N="1141" /> reversal of the decision on the parade route along the Garvaghy Road &ldquo;runs entirely counter to the previously agreed approaches by both Governments to accord parity of esteem to both nationalist and unionist communities&rdquo;. It went on &ldquo;the Government are fully conscious of the anger which today's decision has caused to the nationalist community in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Political leaders in the Nationalist community tried to give voice to the outrage felt in their community while not encouraging further disorder.  Valiant efforts were made to maintain or restore calm.  These efforts were not helped by the perception that disturbances in Nationalist areas were being made with assertive, and sometimes aggressive, RUC behaviour which was absent earlier in the week.</P>
    <P>Reports began to circulate in the media of enormous numbers of plastic baton rounds being fired on Nationalist protesters.  These reports were borne out in the final tally; a total of approximately 6,002 were fired, of which 662 were fired up to 11 July and the remaining 5,340 thereafter.  A number of serious incidents involving the RUC were reported in the media and by local representatives.  These, I should add, have been taken up with the British Government through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>On the question of the use of plastic baton rounds and the general approach of the RUC, an approach which has resulted in death and serious injuries, the Government welcomes as a first step the announcement yesterday by the British authorities that the Inspector of Constabulary &ldquo;will conduct a review of the RUC's procedure and training for handling public order situations including those relating to the use of plastic bullet rounds&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts of Nationalist political leaders and their appeals for calm, damage was heaped on damage.  In towns, villages and streets across Northern Ireland, divisions were deepened, <Col N="1142" /> mistrust fermented and community relations soured.</P>
    <P>There have been sectarian attacks on people and property.  There are reports that businesses are being boycotted based on the religion of the owners. Nothing can condone this kind of bigotry, which should have no place in modern day Ireland or anywhere.  The Government condemns all such actions, whoever commits them and against whomever they are directed.  They contribute nothing to the resolution of our problems and only serve to make them worse.</P>
    <P>We are not yet out of the marching season and there are obvious flashpoints where the emotions aroused at Drumcree, if they are allowed to prevail over calmer and wiser instincts, could escalate community confrontation still further.  I appeal for restraint and, above all, for dialogue at local and wider level, to resolve differences on parade routes. Given how much is at stake, the suggestion that marchers should engage in dialogue with residents is surely the least that can be called for.</P>
    <P>Even if, as I hope, upcoming flashpoints can be managed, it will take time, commitment and courage to restore the damage done.  Both Governments began that process with the special Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference convened at the request of the Government on 18 July and which reviewed the serious deterioration in the situation in the aftermath of the decisions taken on parade routes.  A range of matters was discussed, including the failure of the British authorities to fully utilise the structures and procedures of the intergovernmental conference, in particualre, the failure to provide advance notice of the changed decision relating to the Garvaghy Road.  Serious concerns regarding the behaviour of the security forces were also raised by the Tánaiste and the Government will continue to pursue these within the framework of the conference.</P>
    <P>The work to repair the damage done to community relations will be difficult but essential to the foundations on <Col N="1143" /> which lasting peace and stability must be built.  The work of reconciliation will continue through the efforts of countless individuals and groups, both lay and religious, too numerous to mention.  For their unstinting work, we all owe them an enormous debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>The real work of rebuilding confidence, however lies with the political leadership of both communities and the two Governments.  As both Governments agreed at the intergovernmental conference, &ldquo;they recognised the urgent need to rebuild confidence in the wake of these developments and reaffirmed the primacy of the political process as the means of achieving this&rdquo;.  Both Governments are absolutely determined to achieve progress through the current political talks.  There is no alternative to political dialogue.</P>
    <P>It is only by bringing about a lasting, just and comprehensive political settlement that the issues which afflict Northern Ireland can be finally resolved, including the issue of policing and the handling of parades.  The Government is doing all it can to ensure that significant progress will be made in the coming days and that the talks process will engage the substantive matters on an agreed agenda.  I am confident together with the participants, that we are now making progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>The events surrounding Drumcree during the week of the Twelfth were a deeply disturbing reminder of the potential for conflict and confrontaton between the two communities within Northern Ireland.  It has done enormous damage, political and economic, but I firmly believe that that damage can be rectified, the lessons can be learned and that the failures that those events represented can be avoided in the future.  It was a sad and unnecessary detour from the road to lasting peace and stablity. The surest way to avoid future detours lies in the pursuit of political agreement in the current talks, with courage, determination and an unyielding commitment to peace and reconciliation.  I wish <Col N="1144" /> to assure the House, that the Government will do all in its power to bring about the lasting political agreement which is the shared objective of all the people of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making this set of late night statements on the North in the Dáil at yet another bleak juncture in the North's affairs.  These formal, usually prepared, set pieces do not constitute a debate.  They are intended by the Government as little more than a gesture and an opportunity to provide the press with a few select quotations from those who get their advance scripts out in time.</P>
      <P>It seems to the Progressive Democrats that because the present position is so bleak there is a particular need to show novelty in approaching the position. The bleakness is exemplified by the fact that more than six weeks have elapsed in procedural wrangles in the talks at Stormont.  These have prevented any substantive talking and at the same time we are labouring under the shadow of Drumcree and its aftermath.  The legacy of Drumcree does not appear to have added any greater urgency to the efforts of those who are talking.  It has not brought their willingness to compromise any closer to the surface because some of them see it as a form of victory and that is profoundly depressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not find the fact that we are told that there is to be a vote next Monday on adopting new procedural rules put forward by the former Senator Mitchell and that it will be probably carried very encouraging or exciting.  Several of the parties appear to have serious reservations and will presumably want to leave avenues open to themselves to continue to argue on procedural points and to procrastinate further.  Irrespective of what happens on Monday, presumably these talks will be adjourned at the end of next week for the month of August and will not resume until September. It would be an extraordinary optimist who could foresee those talks being successful on the basis of their track record to date in 1996 and on the <Col N="1145" /> basis of the record of their predecessor talks in 1992.  The present difficulty has been compounded by the holding of an election in the North recently, which was unnecessary, foolish and which, as I and others forecast, has served simply to polarise the positions on each side and to weaken the centre.</P>
    <P>Because the realistic position, as opposed to the propaganda one, we heard from the Government side tonight, is so weak and uncertain, serious consideration will have to be given to a different approach that will not depend primarily on the parties within the North for progress.  I do not say that lightly.  I fully realise the ideal in any normal society is that the elected representatives of the local population should compromise and agreed about the future Government of the area inhabited by that population.</P>
    <P>As we all know Northern Ireland is not a normal society and the normal rules of democracy and politics do not appear to succeed nor are they likely to prevail now.  If we come at the problem in a somewhat different way, it is no more than a recognition of the unique and peculiar nature of the Northern Ireland situation.  Increasingly there appears to be less and less alternative to the clear need for the two Governments to draft and prepare a form of settlement document, offer it for debate and suggested possible amendments to the parties and then put it directly in its final form to the people of Northern Ireland for acceptance in a referendum. The basic conditions of any settlement document will have to include a power-sharing administration within Northern Ireland, acceptance of the principle that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom, except by the consent of a majority of its people, and the establishment of North-South institution links to guarantee the missing parity of esteem and the rights of Nationalists.</P>
    <P>If a package like this is seen as the price of the union, there is every possibility that the moderate sober majority of Unionists will accept it.  If such a <Col N="1146" /> package is a genuine and permanent guarantee of the rights of Nationalists, and includes the means to vindicate those rights, then surely there is every possibility that a majority of Nationalists will also accept it.</P>
    <P>Those on each side who genuinely hate war and violence will see it as the only reasonable alternative to chaos, in truth the only way forward.  Thereby can the moderate centre ground be allowed and encouraged to assert itself at last. The agenda need not be written by extremists.</P>
    <P>Intransigence and loyalty to so-called basic principles and demands is the approach which has tended to win electoral success in Northern Ireland.  The two Governments will have to change the ground rules to remove the reward from intransigence on both sides.  I make this suggestion as others have, including in particular my colleague Deputy McDowell, against the background of the failure of the all-party talks initiative.  This was the basic demand of Sinn Féin-IRA for many years but when it was agreed and implemented it chose to stay outside the all-party talks by its resumption of terrorism and rejection of the very process it alleged it wanted.  Its intent is not just clear from the overt and completed acts of violence in recent months such as Canary Wharf, Manchester, Osnabruck and Adare, but also from the evidence of the equal atrocities that were averted by good luck in the case of Hammersmith Bridge and by the good work of the British and Irish police in the arrests in south London and in the discovery of an active operational bomb factory in Clonaslee, County Laois. These activities make it clear that Sinn Féin has no intention of accepting the rules for its own inclusion in all-party talks.</P>
    <P>The question then arises, could such talks be fruitfully held without them? The talks certainly can be held without them but the evidence of the undemocratic attitude of Mr. Trimble at Drumcree and the lack of progress of the last six weeks at Stormont does not <Col N="1147" /> suggest any great likelihood of success for those talks, irrespective of who is or is not there.</P>
    <P>Relying on such talks in the future to produce a viable and acceptable settlement is just not realistic.  If the present round of talks end in failure or even if they just drag on interminably, a political vacuum will again be formed and deepened which, as we know from experience, will only be filled in one way.  All out violence from extremists on both sides in the North is too terrible to contemplate.  What is now simmering just below the surface is a potentially bad as anything we have seen in the past 28 years.  Post Drumcree anger is intense.  The intimidation of people out of their homes is intolerable.  So-called punishment beatings continue apace and become more vicious and depraved by the day.</P>
    <P>The Governments, I strongly believe, have no alternative but to act together on the lines that I advocate here.  I urge them to do so without delay before both countries become locked in the sort of political paralysis that innevitably precedes a general election.  The Progressive Democrats pledge full support to the Government in any action it reasonably takes on the lines I advocate.  From my recent discussions I believe that the Opposition in Westminster would be equally anxious to afford support to the Government there if new initiatives were undertaken jointly with the Irish Government.  No reasonable effort by either Government, or both, will be sought to be capitalised on in the forthcoming general elections, even if those efforts were ultimately to fail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a contrary view to what has been suggested by Deputy O'Malley when he implicitly states that the talks in Northern Ireland have failed.  Both yesterday and today some progress has been made.  It is slow progress but nevertheless it is being made and I warmly welcome it.  It is a good sign that common sense is beginning to <Col N="1148" /> prevail.  It will be good news to all those who seek a negotiated settlement of the Northern conflict and who believe that there is no acceptable alternative to the talks.  It is my view and that of the Government that it is not possible for the two Governments to impose a solution in Northern Ireland.  It is simply impossible and would be a recipe for disaster to attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>The violence that returned to Northern Ireland a fortnight ago is totally unacceptable.  It represented a failure of political leadership and a victory of mob rule over the rule of law.  It also reflected the depth of intercommunal divisions and marked a return to the destructive politics of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;. The ugly and depressing scenes witnessed at Drumcree, Garvaghy Road and the Lower Ormeau Road and in towns and villages across Northern Ireland a fortnight ago are brutal evidence of an intransigent commitment to the politics of communal siege and defence, without regard to the risks posed to the possibility of an agreement which would respect the interests and identities of the people, Nationalist, Unionist and others, who live in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the intransigence and triumphalism displayed by Orangemen at Drumcree and elsewhere, it does not serve us well in the Republic to indulge in our own form of self-righteousness.  Parity of self-righteousness will not get us very far. That there were loutish, bigoted and even fascist elements associated with the Orange march is very clear.  That, however, should not blind us to the fact that many on the Orange side were, and are, genuinely worried that their own culture and political identity is under threat, not only from the IRA, but from constitutional Nationalists, North and South.  We in this Government believe this fear, in so far as it refers to the political aspirations of the vast majority of a Nationalist identity on the island, is a totally groundless one.  However, we must realise it as a real one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does nothing but harm to any hope of political accommodation on this <Col N="1149" /> island to talk, as did columnist in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week, of bigotry being the essence of Unionist politics and of &ldquo;Unionist fascism&rdquo;.  This is a profound insult to the tens of thousands of Unionists who fought, together with Nationalists from North and South, against fascism in the Second World War.  It is a despicable slight on the decency of the vast majority of Northern Protestants who would have nothing but contempt for the fascist thugs who murdered Michael McGoldrick in Lurgan.</P>
    <P>It is one of the deeply worrying aspects of the sharpened communal polarisation that has taken place in the past fortnight that sectarian murder and intimidation have reappeared.  This cannot all be ascribed to &ldquo;them&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;us&rdquo;.  Do not let us forget, when condemning Orange fascists, about the Green ones who intimidate Protestants out of their homes, burn Protestant-owned businesses and, in one case, write letters to a newspaper advocating a boycott of Protestant businesses.</P>
    <P>Much media comment and what passed for reportage in the Republic was not only hysterical but inflammatory. There were those who invoked the &ldquo;spirit of 1969&rdquo; who found justification for the Provisional IRA as a &ldquo;defender&rdquo; of Nationalist areas.  This would be like saying to the Italian people: your choice is between fascism and the Mafia.  But quivering media indignation is a poor substitute for hard facts.  And it is a fact that republican paramilitaries have killed no fewer than 500 Catholics in the course of the so-called armed struggle. As for 1969, the events that flowed from the confrontations of that year led to the sinister alliance of interests that resulted in the formation of the Provisional IRA, which in turn caused a serious threat to the security of this State and initiated a quarter century of violence that claimed more than 3,000 lives.</P>
    <P>I was taken to task on Saturday last by the television critic of <i>The Irish Times</i> for stating on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that <Col N="1150" /> there are bigots on both sides.  Coincidentaly, a report in the same issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> referred to incidents in Newtownbutler on 12 July when: &ldquo;a 150-strong Nationalist crowd burned a car, intimidated a Protestant family from their home and attacked businesses and homes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was by no means an isolated incident as Archbishop Robin Eames has drawn attention to this week.  And we know also that elsewhere in Northern Ireland Catholic families were intimidated and homes and property attacked. Sinn Féin can, apparently, only see the violence of one side.  But, I repeat, there are bigots on both sides.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the image of the bowler-hatted bigot, the stereotypical Northern Protestant.  However, we should realise that most Protestants in Northern Ireland are not members of the Orange Order.  They have a legitimate Unionist political identity &mdash; just as Nationalists have theirs &mdash; and many would have been concerned at the damage that Drumcree did to the Unionist cause.  By the same token, it is necessary for the leaders of the Unionist political parties to recognise the deep anger caused in the Nationalist community by the Drumcree and Ormeau Road confrontations.</P>
    <P>I do believe that the Unionist leaders failed their electorate at Drumcree and the related Orange activities elsewhere. But what should we do?  We can hardly wash our hands of a whole community because, in a specific crisis, their elected leaders show neither courage nor generosity. Drumcree should not in any event blind us to the flexibility and courage shown by some Unionists on various issues in recent times, most recently on the issue of Senator Mitchell's role in the all-party negotiations.  We should not underestimate his acceptance by all of the parties to the talks.  We should recognise the many pressures Unionist leaders come under from within their own community and the added burden represented by the IRA's return to violence. But the true test of political leadership is to take the long view as to <Col N="1151" /> what will best defend the real interests of the community at large, not just one's own tribe and not be knocked off course by the demands and pressures of the moment.</P>
    <P>An article in last week's <i>New States-man</i> by Arthur Aughey went some way to explain one of the enduring conundrums of Northern politics whereby flexibility and inflexibility seemingly go hand in hand from which I quote:</P>
    <P>How is it that commentators have spoken of an overwhelming desire for peace and yet it proves impossible to sustain that peace?  The answer goes to the heart of the problem.  People in Northern Ireland may express <i>liberal sympathies</i> about the need for equality, fairness and compromise. They generally have <i>illiberal instincts</i> when it comes to matters concerning identity and belonging.  In particular, there is a powerful instinct which tells people that communal solidarity is ultimately essential.  It is an instinct that local politicians can rarely ignore.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest it is an instinct that politicians of all persuasions will have to overcome if a settlement is to be agreed.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the long-term interests of Unionists are in an active engagement with the substantive issues set out by the two Governments in the joint framework document.  This is not a blueprint for joint authority or a slippery slope to a united Ireland.  Rather, it sets out the elements of an historic compromise between Nationalism and Unionism on this island.  It provides for the governance of Northern Ireland on the basis of shared power and responsibility between the people of Northern Ireland and for a North-South dimension that, for the first time, would give effective and democratically accountable expression to the identity of Unionists within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The framework document is not something that this Government wishes to impose on the parties and people of <Col N="1152" /> Northern Ireland.  It is there as an indication of the kind of settlement both Governments favour.  But, at the end of the day, the outcome of the negotiations must be agreed by the negotiators and will have to be put to the people of Northern Ireland for their endorsement or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I recognise the problems that the Unionist parties have with our approach, but I would emphasise that, following Drumcree, we are confronted with the possibility of a spiralling descent into communal hatred.  Such sectarian polarisation, with its attendant self-righteousness and demonisation of the other side as the source of all evil, will reinforce the hardliners in the republican and loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>Likewise, to engage in, or to orchestrate, confrontational street politics in a deeply divided society like Northern Ireland is to play a very reckless game. It is no exaggeration to say it is literally playing with people's lives.  To insist on the unrestricted right to march and to protest in circumstances that bring us close to civil war is not to assert democratic rights, but to undermine them.</P>
    <P>It is beyond comprehension to me that some people of a Nationalist persuasion, who would bitterly and justifiably condemn Orange intransigence on the Garvaghy Road, would insist on their right to march through the Waterside in Derry where the Unionist community is a local minority.  Parity of provocation seems to be on offer here.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I would like to commend the statement this week by the Presbyterian Church and Government Committee calling for local compromises on marches.  This statement is a model of fairness and should be closely studied by those for or against this or that particular march.  It expresses the hope that politicians will be facilitators and encouragers of necessary compromise, and urges all church leadership to encourage movement.  It notes the perception by &ldquo;our Roman Catholic neighbours&rdquo; of a lack of even-handedness in policing while recognising &ldquo;the impossible task which the police faced and the <Col N="1153" /> difficult decisions which the Chief Constable had to make&rdquo;.  The statement also makes the point that &ldquo;those who initiate actions in volatile situations cannot evade total responsibility for the consequences of what they begin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Extremism thrives in a political vacuum and the present perceived vacuum increases the possibility of further violence. It is essential, therefore, that both the primacy and efficacy of politics are quickly restored.  This means that political leaders must give leadership and dispense with protest and posturing. Threats of violence have no place in political discourse.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge people not to allow themselves to be driven into the conflict with their neighbour.  That way only leads to pogroms and sectarian murders.  This is exactly what the extremists on both sides want.  They must not be allowed to win. We have seen what happens when common sense gives way to intolerance.  Let us learn the hard lessons of recent events and not reap the bitter harvest of petrol bomb and baton round.</P>
    <P>The road of peace and accommodation was never going to be easy, but it is the road we must travel if we are to have a peaceful future together on this island.  The only way forward is through honest dialogue and the desire for peace, not through bluster and aggression.  The rights of all the people of Northern Ireland must be respected. The most important of these is the right to live an ordinary life in peace and without fear.  The people of this island must resist the call that no one has any wish to revisit.  If we really want peace, we must not allow the initiative to pass to the bigots, the thugs, and the wreckers.</P>
    <P>Communal conflict will kill the hopes and the future of the people of Northern Ireland.  Confrontation, intimidation, burnings and killings bring nothing but grief, while sectarianism fuels the politics of hatred and revenge.</P>
    <P>The events of a fortnight ago remind us just how fragile is peace.  We have once again witnessed the tragic loss of <Col N="1154" /> life, we have seen democratic politics undermined and the peace process gravely damaged.  But the peace process is not dead.  Democratic politicians can and, indeed, have a duty to revive it and bring it forward to a successful conclusion. That requires patience and tenacity. Above all, it requires the goodwill and spirit of compromise that were missing at Drumcree.  If they can be found again in Derry the process of peace will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Let us all resolve then to give our full support to those who are working for an honourable compromise on the issue of the forthcoming Apprentice Boys' parade in Derry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this motion.  I call on the Tánaiste to clarify the Government's position concerning yesterday's report by AFrI which links Irish companies with the international arms trade and military industry. However tenuous these links are, the findings of this highly significant report expose the hypocrisy and double standards of the Government in relation to the arms industry.  The Government simply cannot have it both ways.  In the <Col N="1156" /> recently published White Paper on Foreign Policy it was stated that &ldquo;Ireland has no indigenous arms industry and thus no economic dependence on arms exports&rdquo;.  This report spells out clearly that that statement was an untruth and this House deserves an apology for such deception.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste must now ensure that the serious questions raised in this report are answered honestly and that the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade are brought into line. This Government, and indeed successive Irish Governments, have campaigned vigorously against the international arms trade and military industry and have consistently supported the protection of human rights. The Minister present has been very much to the fore in that area.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the Irish Presidency would be used to intensify our efforts and influence others in relation to these issues.  This report has, in effect, shattered our credibility in this critical area of Irish foreign policy.</P>
      <P>The Government must act immediately to ensure that if an Irish company is involved with the international arms trade, it must be instructed to break such a link and diversify its products into non-military business.  Surely it is possible for these companies to establish the &ldquo;traceability&rdquo; of their products. There can be no compromise on this matter.  We have adopted a principled foreign policy position on the arms industry and this position must be maintained with absolute consistency.  How can the Tánaiste, who has just returned from Indonesia, raise with any degree of credibility human rights in East Timor if we in Ireland are involved with the same international arms trade which has had such a devasating impact on the people of East Timor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves of what has happened and what is happeining in East Timor.  It is estimated that in 1975 60,000 people &mdash; 10 per cent of the population &mdash; were killed in East Timor after the invasion by the Indonesian <Col N="1157" /> forces.  Following that invasion more than 200,000 people perished as a result of the Indonesian conquest.  Despite the UN resolutions demanding an end to the invasion, the US and UK continued to supply the military hardware used by the dicator Suharto and his generals in the campaign of mass murder.</P>
    <P>Whereas moves are now afoot in the US Senate to ban arms exports to dictatorial and aggressive regimes, the sad reality is that Britain's arms trade with Jakarta is actually expanding.  A deal was signed earlier this year between a British company and the Indonesian Government for the sale of 50 to 90 Scorpion light tanks and armoured personnel carriers.  Similar vehicles were used by the Indonesians to repress civilian demonstrations in East Timor.  The latest batch of 24 BAE Hawks commenced delivery to Indonesia in April 1996.  While the Indonesian armed forces prevent journalists and independent observers from going there to investigate the situation on the ground, the British Government continues to prop up, militarily, the Suharto regime.</P>
    <P>Let us be absolutely clear on where we stand as a people and a country, and cherish and nurture our policy of military neutrality.  I ask the Irish Government to show consistency on this issue, to ensure that our economic and trade policies are absolutely in line with our foreign policy so that we can continue, as a small nation, to speak with a strong and principled voice in supporting human rights and opposing vigorously the sickening growth of the arms industry and its usage in propping up many corrupt and repressive regimes throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate Ireland's position as stated in the White Paper on Foreign Policy: Ireland is not a producer of armaments and will not become one.  This policy has been supported by successive Irish Governments. This Government is proud of that policy and we are confident that the people of Ireland share that pride.  We have a long <Col N="1158" /> and honourable record as a non-belligerent and peace-keeping nation.  I do not accept that we should be saddled with some sort of guilt by association which this report would appear to suggest.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for overseas development assistance, I have personally outlined on a number of occasions my strong concern about the role of arms in the developing world.  I agree with the substantive thesis of the AFrI report that the arms industry has an entirely deleterious effect on development.  My concern on the issue was expressed most recently at a conference I organised on relief rehabilitation and prevention.  I also recently introduced legislation banning the manufacture and export of landmines. As part of our EU Presidency programme I intend to further press for a total ban on landmines and generally promote the disarmament policies of the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to the specifics of this report, I want to point out that only seven of its 40 pages relate to the activities of Irish companies.  The finding presented in the report single out from the full spectrum of products of 14 named companies those which appear to be militarily relevant. The report is careful to disavow any intention &ldquo;to insinuate that these companies are proactively involved in contributing to the production of weapons systems.&rdquo;  It states that Ireland's contribution to and links with the arms trade is located in the sphere of subcontractor supplier to main contractors, that it is at the bottom of the production pyramid.  It even acknowledges that military-related industrial activity is not a major part of the Irish economy.  It is something, I suppose, that these qualifications are included.  This circumspection makes it all the more incomprehensible that the report should immediately go on to state: &ldquo;modern weapons systems rely on the input of nuts and bolts, microchips, wiring and so on.  The micro design may differ but the macro design serves the same purposes, to maim, kill and destroy&rdquo;.  The <Col N="1159" /> House will agree that the companies in question, which provide quality jobs to Irish workers, deserve better than to have their work inpugned in this baseless, naïve way.</P>
    <P>The report outlines two case histories which show the tragic effects of the arms industry.  However, nowhere does it suggest that there is any connection between Irish products and the arms used in East Timor and Nigeria.  Deputy Kitt's comments, presumably based on reading the report, bear that out because he has thoroughly condemned British armaments in the context of Indonesia.  There is nothing in the report about Irish companies in the context of East Timor.  If the companies in the report have evidence of the use of Irish products in either of these places, or indeed in any other conflict area, I would ask them to let us have the specifics of such use.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on many occasions to people involved in the production of this report in the run up to the ban on landmines. They mentioned that they had concerns of possible Irish uses.  I asked the Deputy to immediately bring to our attention any such concerns.  I am still waiting.  While the report suggests risks, it does not constitute any such evidence. It is unfair to use the tactic of guilt by association to suggest that Ireland has some responsibility for the atrocities committed in areas such as East Timor when we have an honourable record recognised by the NGOs, including this one, for promoting conflict prevention and respect for human rights in these and other areas.</P>
    <P>The Government takes very seriously its responsibility to ensure that Ireland exercises effective control over relevant exports and that Ireland is not used to circumvent the export controls of other EU member states which have had direct involvement over decades in the manufacture and export of military related goods and technology.  This whole question of export controls on strategic goods, is a complex one.  It may <Col N="1160" /> be helpful if I avail of this opportunity to set out the facts of Ireland's policy and practice in the matter.</P>
    <P>Ireland has no indigenous defence industry and was not a member of COCOM, the relevant EU committee. For reasons which reflect positively on this country, our direct experience of controlling strategic exports is less extensive and more recent than that of any EU partner.  For the past two years the Departments concerned, notably the Departments of Tourism and Trade and Foreign Affairs, are working closely together to place our system on a fully secure legal and administrative basis.  In this context, particular value is placed on the direct access that membership of the various multilateral export control regimes mentioned earlier provides for information concerning sensitive items. Developing expertise or access to the expertise necessary to evaluate export licence applications competently is a very important task.  This applies particularly to sophisticated dual use goods.</P>
    <P>The preparation of two new statutory instruments to cover dual use goods and arms respectively is at an advanced stage.  When these instruments are adopted, Ireland will have in place a fully comprehensive, updated system for controlling the export of strategic goods. Pending their adoption, the existing legislative framework enables us to exercise adequate controls.</P>
    <P>If the authors of the report have concerns relating to either a specific or a series of companies anywhere in Ireland, I appeal to them, as I did in regard to landmines, to bring such cases to our attention or to that of other Departments.  This is their responsibility as citizens.  They have not done that so far.  Although I spoke to them as recently as several months ago on this issue, nothing has been forthcoming.  It is not right to impugn honourable Irish companies by the tactic of guilt by association.  If they have evidence, they <Col N="1161" /> should bring it forward and we will deal with it as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, is replying to my question on medical cards retention. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, expressed great concern in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week that the co-ordination and proper arrangements were not in place for this Government provision in the budget.  The Minister also expressed deep concern about another issue.  It is interesting to note that one can be in Government and not know the measures that have been introduced.  However, I welcome the fact that the Minister is concerned.</P>
      <P>Major problems are emerging over the application of the new schemes to take on long-term unemployed people. This week it was disclosed that promises made in the budget on the retention of medical cards for the long-term unemployed have not been honoured.  No administration or legal basis has been given for that decision and it is well nigh six months since the announcement in the budget.</P>
      <P>It has also emerged that there is a complete lack of co-ordination between the new jobstart and the existing back to work allowance schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare and only 100 people have been recruited to the jobstart programme so far although we were told 5,000 people would be taken on under it.  Interestingly, there is not enough money in the budget for it. In a reply the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, admitted to me that the amount of money he had in the budget for this scheme was £1 million which would allow for 436 people to take up employment. This failure to progress these issues is typical of the lack of focus in relation to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate was all about focusing agencies, Departments, activities and <Col N="1162" /> determination to severely punish criminals and stop them living off the backs of vulnerable people.  There are too many Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility for different unemployment issues.  They are all doing sound work, but the only person who suffers from this overlapping is the claimant who wishes to benefit from an application to one of the myriad of schemes.  At the last count, nine different Ministers or Ministers of State had separate responsibilities for various programmes and initiatives.  As a result, responsibility for issues fall between different Ministers and there is little cooperation.</P>
    <P>Nobody is co-ordinating the action plan on unemployment.  That is also the position in regard to the medical cards. The budget trumpeted the provision letting those who came from the ranks of the long-term unemployed and got work to retain their medical cards for three years.  It claimed that people on unemployment benefit or unemployment allowance needed that carrot to encourage them to go back to work.  I do not believe that.  In my constituency work I have never come across any person who is genuinely seeking a job wishing to stay on unemployment benefit.  They come to me looking for jobs.</P>
    <P>However, this change was trumpeted in the budget and many a Minister and Government Deputy &ldquo;dined out&rdquo; on it on radio, television and newspaper interviews but it has not taken place.  I share the grave anxiety and concern of the Minister as to why there has not been a push to implement this measure. We have submitted queries to the health boards and the Minister for Health has been informed that no administrative or legal decision has been taken.  Perhaps it was taken since Tuesday and, if so, I will be glad to hear of it.  The Minister for Finance trumpeted this measure and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and other Ministers, basked in it, but nobody told the Minister for Health to implement it.  The push has not taken place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> My complaint is that nothing happened and that there is no co-ordination. As I indicated to Deputy Eric Byrne earlier today &mdash; I silenced him for once &mdash; the number of long-term unemployed has risen by 3,500 since the Government took office.  No amount of shouting or posturing will take from that sad fact.  I wish I did not have to say this on the plinth once a month.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided to allow long-term unemployed persons to retain their medical card on entering employment it considered that it had done a good day's work, but it forgot to follow through on its great idea.  I am sure that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and that he will announce that he has, at least, done something about this matter, if only to meet the considerable concern expressed by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, in the columns of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  He did not, however, ask if this had been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy and you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to reply to the debate on behalf of the Minister for Health who is, unfortunately, unable to attend.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to explain the background to the medical care system, the conditions under which medical cards are issued and, in particular, the positive and creative manner in which the Government, recognising the need to assist the long-term unemployed take up employment, is addressing disincentives which affect their return to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance announced a number of measures aimed at strengthening social solidarity, in particular, a wide range of employment measures for the long-term unemployed.  He emphasised the Government's belief that the intractable nature of long-term unemployment is unacceptable and the Government's <Col N="1164" /> determination to ensure that the long-term unemployed share in the benefits of economic growth with other sectors of society.  In particular, he stated that the Government has agreed that persons who have been unemployed for at least one year will retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment to remove the disincentive which the potential loss of the medical card could have for long-term unemployed persons entering employment.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards who have statutory responsibility in this area have previously agreed to implement the following measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment or participate in schemes and who could be considered to remain entitled to a medical card: persons who held the medical card while on the live register are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of two years after securing paid insurable employment if they qualify for family income supplement in respect of that employment; persons who held a medical card while on the live register are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of two years after securing a placement on the community employment programme; persons on the live register starting their own businesses who are paid a back-to-work allowance by the Department of Social Welfare and who are paid family income supplement in respect of that employment are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of two years; disabled persons participating in the employment support scheme who held a medical card before entering the scheme are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of two years; persons on the live register who participate in education, training or other recognised development courses are allowed to retain their medical card; weekly payments made under the community employment programme, the back-to-work allowance and family income supplement schemes are excluded income when assessing a person's eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place between <Col N="1165" /> the Department of Health and the chief executive officers regarding the implementation of the budget provision.  I am pleased to confirm that arrangements for the implementation of the provision were agreed with the chief executive officers on 19 July.  The Department of Health will place a press notice, inviting those who are likely to benefit from the new arrangement to get in touch with their local health board office, next week.</P>
    <P>The Minister regrets that it has taken some time to agree the administrative arrangements, but I assure the Deputy on his behalf that any difficulties that may arise from this will be dealt with in a most sympathetic manner by all chief executive officers.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise the matter of the provision of sports facilities which, by coincidence, happens to be in the news. Successive Governments have made positive suggestions and proposals about the provision of sports facilities but, unfortunately, these noble ideas have not come to fruition.  The tremendous success of Michelle Smith in the Olympic Games further highlights the need for such facilities.  The necessary decisions should have been taken many years ago.</P>

      <P>Regardless of the issue, he is given three replies and told to come in here, waffle for five minutes and the Adjournment debate will be out of the way.  Five or six sites were proposed and the then Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Aylward, set about endeavouring to provide a swimming facility which is so urgently needed.  Five or six interests are prepared to provide a site including <Col N="1169" /> Tallaght, south Dublin council, UCD, Dublin City University, Quarryvale at the junction of the M50.  These are all potential sites for the provision of a facility which is so badly needed.</P>
      <P>Why can the Minister, with his financial ingenuity, not commit the national lottery on a financial bond issue over two or three decades to provide funding for these facilities?  No one generation should have to bear the financial burden of a facility which will probably have a life span of 30 years, possibly 50 years with some renovations.  Surely this Government can commit the national lottery over a 20 to 30 year period to provide the finance to allow a project like this to get under way.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the British Prime Minister announced what the British Government proposed to do in the United Kingdom and the Six Counties.  A facility could be provided in Dundalk or Newry on a co-operative basis to serve the whole island.  When the Irish team returned in the aftermath of the World Cup, we were going to endeavour to provide a national soccer stadium facility.  They are still a poor relation tenant in Lansdowne Road.  The IRFU facility in Lansdowne Road no longer meets the international seating and safety requirements.</P>
      <P>With the national finances in healthy order, the Government should be in a position to make the necessary long-term commitments this type of project requires.  It should get priority and work should commence.  It behoves this House to endeavour to support projects like this, which are far above party politics, regardless of which parties are in Government or Opposition.  The discussion has gone on for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery has been a huge financial success.  For various reasons consecutive Governments had to plunge that money into day to day spending but long-term commitment could be given to finance these projects.  The success of the Olympic team, particularly in swimming where they have won three gold medals, is an indication of the talent within our sporting community.  People <Col N="1170" /> like Michelle Smith, Gary O'Toole and Eamonn Coughlan will always go abroad to where there are scholarships and international competitions. However, potential international stars at home need such a facility.  People will then go abroad to exploit fully the potential of their talents.</P>
    <P>It is time to provide such a facility. There is much talk about drugs, health and young people and this could be a commitment to do something positive and provide facilities nationally for our young people.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Remedial Teachers Posts.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Like my colleagues, I am disappointed that the Minister with responsibility for the area in which I am particularly interested, that of remedial education, is not here to answer the question.</P>
      <P>The replies given to my colleagues tonight do not augur well for the people I represent, namely, the young people in County Clare who have not had, nor does it seem likely that they will have in the coming year, an opportunity for remedial education.  I raise this matter because in 1994-95 five remedial teachers were appointed to County Clare.  In 1995-96 only one appointment was made.  Now it appears that in 1996-97 no remedial teachers will be appointed to County Clare.  Out of 123 schools in Clare, almost half have no remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important &mdash; I am sure the Minister who is present to answer this question will agree &mdash; that it is the right of every child to have remedial teaching if he or she is in need of that service whether he or she happens to live in an urban or rural area.  In putting forward proposals to deal with disadvantage, the <Col N="1175" /> Minister should, once again, look at the definition of disadvantage.  The Minister's proposal to put one co-ordinator into a cluster of schools in each county seems daft.  It could only be termed a pilot scheme.  It could be seen also as ghettoising: it does not address the real problem of disadvantage and the need for remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>What is the point in appointing a co-ordinator to a cluster of rural schools to assist those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds when these schools do not even have a remedial teacher?  The Minister for Education must reassess her priorities.  I hope she will realise, even this late in the day, that her priority must be to primary school level and, within primary school level, her priority should be the provision of remedial teaching to children in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>A number of schools in County Clare have been waiting for 30 years for a remedial service.  This year, with 300 teachers available for redeployment, the opportunity should have been taken to appoint one remedial teacher to clusters of, perhaps, three to four primary schools, rather than having the unrealistic situation we have in Clare which I am sure pertains to other areas as well of having a remedial teacher for clusters of five, six or seven schools.  That is not the way to address the serious problems of education.  When we have 300 teachers to be redeployed this year, the whole question of remedial teachers and the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister of State replies that he will not simply read yet another irrelevant reply.  I hope I will be able to bring home good news to the people of County Clare.  Not only the teachers but the parents and the people in the local area who have educational interests at heart hope that in fighting for the provision of a remedial service for the children will hear a more positive reply than we have heard in recent weeks from the Minister with regard to <Col N="1176" /> the whole question of remedial teaching. I hope that if she does decide to reassess her position the Minister will do so positively along the lines I have suggested so that all young girls and boys will have the same chance at primary level of reaching their full potential. The Minister for Education should realise that that should be one of her most important and, perhaps, primary functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy and the office of the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of replying to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education who, unfortunately, cannot be present this evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is not in a position at present to make remedial teacher posts available to the primary school sector.  As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter, in the first instance, for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching services.</P>
      <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.  Substantial additional resources have been allocated in this area in recent years.</P>
      <P>In 1995, an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or on a shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 122 ordinary national schools in County Clare, 63 of these with an enrolment of 8,941 pupils on 30 September 1995 have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or shared basis available to them.  This includes five schools allocated a remedial service with effect from the <Col N="1177" /> commencement of the 1995-96 school year as part of the distribution of the 55 posts.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of information from the schools by the Department's primary inspectorate and also having consideration for data submitted by the schools.  This means that 73 per cent of pupils attending national schools in County Clare currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has indicated to the House her intention to review the needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources. When the Minister for Education is in a position to further extend the remediation service, all national schools in County Clare which have applied for a remedial service will receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when the Minister for Education took office in 1993 when 77 oper cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together The Task Force on Funding Arrangements in the Border region received reports from all Government Departments involved in funding programmes in the Border region.  The Government considered the report of the Task Force at its meeting on 17 July 1996.</P>
      <P>The recommendations contained in the report were agreed by the Government. These recommendations will assist applicants for funds under the programmes available, ensure that people generally are aware of the funding programmes and ensure that they are aware of the projects which are being funding under the programmes. The Government also agreed that arrangements should be put in place for information sharing and to ensure complementarity across programmes. Arrangements are being made to have the report published.</P>

      <P>Six people, who are from outside the public service, are currently engaged on a contract basis to assist the Office of the Attorney General in the drafting of legislation.  They are: Edward Bacon, SC; Marcus Bourke, BL; James Dorling, BL, Solr.; Peter Graham, QC; Vincent Grogan, SC; and Peter Johnson, QC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the nature of the work and some of the subject areas contained in a number of the Bills it would be invidious to identify any draftsman with a particular Bill.  In addition, the drafting of Bills requires the expertise and the ongoing involvement of a number of different groups including legal assistants, other draftsmen and officials of Government Departments.  The following is a list of the titles of the Bill, <Col N="1186" /> including amendments, which have involved, among others, contract draftsmen and which have been put before the Houses of the Oireachtas since January 1995:</P>

    <P>Package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>Powers of Attorney Bill, 1996.</P>
    <P>Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1996.</P>
    <P>Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>Road Traffic Bill, 1995, and</P>
    <P>Transitional Information and Consultation of Employees Bill, 1996.</P>
    <P>Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>Other Bills which are currently being drafted by the draftsmen concerned include the following:</P>
    <P>Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill.</P>
    <P>Constitution Amendment (Cabinet Confidentiality) Bill.</P>
    <P>Constitution Amendment (Votes for Emigrants) Bill.</P>
    <P>Credit Union Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> Equal Status Bill.</P>

    <P>Freedom of Information Bill.</P>
    <P>Litter (Pollution) Bill.</P>
    <P>Referendum Bill.</P>
    <P>Road Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>Taxes (Consolidation) Bill.</P>
    <P>Universities Bill.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions under which the contract staff are engaged by the Office are negotiated individually.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate to disclose details on an individual basis. However, in the period January 1995, to June 1996, the sum of £316,069, excluding VAT, was spent on engaging contract draftsmen.  The average annualised earnings of the contract staff would be £57,467.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from the second report on the implementation of the report of the review group on the Office of the Attorney General which was published on 28 May 1996, that three additional senior draftsmen have been appointed to the office.  This and other initiatives within the office will mean that the demand for contract draftsmen, in the medium to long-term, should diminish.  In the meantime, the ever-increasing demand placed upon the office as evident from the above lists and the lengthy training period required to bring new staff to an effective skills level means that in the short to medium term the use of external expertise will continue.  In fact, the training and development of recently-recruited staff in the office is another area where contract draftsmen have and continue to be involved.</P>

      <P>It is estimated from the 1995 labour force survey that there were 1,115,100 persons in full-time employment, working an average of 43.8 hours per week.  There were an estimated 152,400 persons in part-time employment working on average 18.8 hours per week.  The majority of these, 126,600 or 83 per cent indicated that they were not looking for work on a more full-time basis.  The time worked by part-time workers is equivalent to that of about 65,400 full, time workers.</P>
      <P>This does not alter the estimated level of unemployment which, like the employment estimates, is based on the internationally recommended ILO definitions.  Under the ILO definitions, all persons who worked for one hour or more for payment or profit in the survey reference week are classified as in employment.  Persons who, in the week before the survey, were (1) without work, (2) currently available for work and (3) had taken specific steps to find work in the preceding four weeks, are classified unemployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I confirm that my Department closely monitored the situation in Northern Ireland in the period from 6 to 12 July and in particular the impact of the illegal traffic blockages and road blocks referred to by the Deputies.  On my instructions our concern regarding such roadblocks and the need to assert and protect the rule of law was conveyed to the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>This concern was again underlined personally by me in discussions with the Secretary of State at the special Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference which was convened at the request of the Government on 18 July 1996.  I conveyed the Government's assessment of the enormous damage done to relations between the two communities and to nationalist confidence in the RUC.  I believe that the discussions were helpful in convincing the British Government of the serious implications of recent events and of the grave concern felt throughout Ireland, and indeed elsewhere, at the security forces' handling of these events.</P>
      <P>I hope that the growing appreciation of the damage done to Northern Ireland, politically and economically, by the illegal activities in question will add to the conviction that they should never be allowed to recur.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in comments to the media after his decision to force the Orange parade down the Garvaghy Road on 11 July 1996, the RUC Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, asserted that the decisions in this matter were made solely by him on the basis of his operational assessment of the threat to public order.  He further asserted that, while he kept the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew MP, informed of relevant developments, there was no political interference with his decisions.  The Chief Constable repeated this position in the course of his detailed account of recent events at the special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 18 July 1996.  He insists that the decision to put the Orange parade down Garvaghy Road on 11 July was his and his alone.</P>
      <P>In my comments after the conference meeting I made clear that the Irish Government's main concern was with the grave consequences of this decision, irrespective of who precisely was involved in making it, and that I had made this concern very clear to the British side at the meeting.  I also emphasised the need to ensure that there should be no repetition of the situation which arose from this decision which has caused such damage to Nationalist confidence in the impartiality of the security forces.</P>

      <P>The Government was not informed in advance of the changed decision referred to by the Deputy.  It remains a matter of concern to the Government that the structures and procedures of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference were not availed of to the fullest extent possible by the British Government in relation to the recent situation at Drumcree and the Garvaghy Road.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern about the lack of consultation and the implications of the decision itself was made clear in a number of statements which are on the public record and was immediately conveyed in the strongest terms to the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I conveyed it personally in the course of my discussion with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew MP, at the special Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 18 July 1996 convened at the Government's request.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38, 44, and Nos. 56 to 59 inclusive together as they deal with similar subject matter.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House in response to questions on 6 February, 25 March, 30 May and 4 July, and in my statement on the Florence European Council and the Irish Presidency of the European Union on 26 June, three documents have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library on a regular basis:</P>
      <P>a calendar of council meetings detailing all meetings of the Council of Ministers over the course of the Irish Presidency, together with meetings of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and plenary sessions of the European Parliament.  The location of all informal meetings of the Council of Ministers &mdash; which will be in Ireland &mdash; is contained on the list.  All other meetings of the Council of Ministers will take place in Brussels, with the exception of those in the month of October which will take place in Luxembourg.  Draft agendas for council meetings during the Irish Presidency have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library;</P>
      <P>a list of Presidency related meetings to be held in Ireland, which identifies the county in which these meetings will take place and the title of the meetings; and,</P>
      <P>the schedule for Intergovernmental Conference related meetings during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>These documents are updated regularly and I will continue to lodge updates in the Oireachtas Library on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the meetings which are listed in these calendars, the Taoiseach indicated in his report to the House on <Col N="1199" /> 26 June 1996 that the Florence European Council considered that it would be desirable to hold a special meeting of the European Council during the Irish Presidency.  The Taoiseach indicated the willingness of the Irish Presidency to host and organise such a meeting.  When the details of this meeting have been finalised, the information will be included in the calendar of council meetings.  The normal European Council of our Presidency will take place in Dublin on 13-14 December.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have received copies of the document &ldquo;Priorities for the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union&rdquo;.  This document details the priorities of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union for each Council formation. Copies of this document have also been lodged in the Oireachtas library.</P>
    <P>No representations have been received in my Department from Sligo Chamber of Commerce regarding the possibility of hosting Presidency related meetings in County Sligo or in the North West Region.</P>

      <P>The Government remain deeply concerned about the continuing conflict in Liberia.  We strongly supported the European Union Declaration on Liberia of 11 April.  On that occasion, the EU expressed its firm conviction that the Abuja Accord signed in August 1995 provided the right framework for resolving the crisis.  It called on the Liberian Council of State, National Transitional Government and factions to implement the accord and put the peace process back on track in order to <Col N="1200" /> avoid further deterioration in the situation and the violation of human rights. It also condemned the loss of human life and the harassment of civilians and humanitarian aid workers.  The EU also make it clear that the Union will base its attitude towards Liberia on the concrete steps taken by all parties concerned to implement the Abuja Accord and to bring the conflict to an end.</P>
      <P>The EU and other members of the international community have together identified three issues critical to securing peace in Liberia, namely, the need for all parties to return to the Abuja peace process, restoration of peace in the capital, Monrovia and the reinforcement of the West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG).</P>
      <P>The main focus of international efforts to achieve these and other objectives and to identify how the international community can positively influence the Liberian peace process, is the International Contact Group in Liberia. Established at the suggestion of the US, the Group was convened in Geneva on 26 April and consists of senior representatives of the United Nations whose UNOMIL observer mission continues to monitor the situation in Liberia the European Union, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, the Organisation of African Unity, the US and Canada.  At its May meeting the group welcomed the <i>Mechanism for Returning Liberia to the Abuja Agreement</i> which was formulated by ECOWAS Committee of Nine in Accra on 8 May.  It is reported that ECOWAS will examine the commitment and resolve shown by faction leaders to the Abuja process when it meets for its regular summit in Abjua this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its efforts towards restoring the Abuja Accord process, the International Contact Group is endeavouring to strengthen the capacity of ECOMOG as a neutral and effective peacekeeping force.  It has also called on all States, including those in West Africa, to take the necessary measures to comply with the 1992 UN Arms Embargo on Liberia and to bring violations to the attention <Col N="1201" /> of the relevant sanctions committee. The humanitarian problems of refugees (which were the subject of a separate EU Declaration on 13 May) displaced persons and human rights abuses which have arisen from the conflict are also being addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government support the ongoing concerted efforts of the international community to restore the Abuja Accord process and thereby bring about an early and lasting resolution of the conflict in Liberia.  To that end, both bilaterally and with our partners in the EU, we will continue to exert pressure on all parties to the conflict to engage in the peace process.</P>

      <P>Angola is one of 70 countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which are party to the Fourth ACP-EU (Lomé) Convention. As such it enjoys very beneficial trade terms with the European Union: under the Convention 97 per cent of exports from these countries enter the EU without duty or tariff restrictions.</P>
      <P>An agreement amending the Fourth Lomé convention was signed in Mauritius on 4 November 1995.  This made some amendments to the trade provisions of the convention.  These include the expansion of the list of products which receive preferential access, and the relaxation of the rules of origin which relate to the use of non-ACP produced raw materials in the manufacture of goods in ACP countries which can then be exported to the EU under the preferential terms.  The amended convention also pays greater attention to trade development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland played a full and active part <Col N="1202" /> in the negotiation of the revised convention, and fully supports the amendments made.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Lomé Convention will expire early in the year 2000.  Ireland will play an active and constructive part in the discussions on a successor arrangement, in recognition of the importance attached by the Government to the ACP-EU partnership and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the full range of the Community's development co-operation instruments, including co-operation on trade matters.</P>

      <P>At its meeting 25 March, the council approved negotiating directives for an agreement for trade and co-operation with South Africa.  On 29 March the Union formally presented the EU negotiating mandate to the South African authorities.</P>
      <P>The first meeting between South Africa and the Commission was held on 21 and 22 June and progress was made on the non-trade aspects of an agreement. These include economic and industrial co-operation, the information society, education, research and technology. The South African delegation was not in a position to discuss the trade aspects of the proposed agreement, as consultations on these matters were continuing within South Africa and with its partners in the South African Customs Union.  The next round of negotiations is planned for September.</P>

      <P>It is the practice that members of the Government do <Col N="1205" /> not give an assessment of the performance of office holders in international organisations such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  I do not intend to depart from this practice.</P>
      <P>I would draw attention, however, to the fact that under the UN Charter the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security is conferred upon the Security Council of the UN.  It is the function of the Secretary-General to ensure that decisions of the Security Council in this regard are implemented in accordance with the mandate given by the Security Council. For this, the Secretary-General requires resources adequate to the task as well as the full support of both the Security Council and the wider membership of the UN.</P>
      <P>It is also worth nothing that the current Secretary-General, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, came to office in 1991 at a time when the UN system was undergoing a process of major reassessment of its role in facing new challenges to international peace and security in the post-Cold War era and in particular the significant rise of intra-state conflicts. The UN system continues to seek to redefine an effective strategy of response to such challenges and we will lend our support to this endeavour.</P>
      <P>As regards the forthcoming election later this year to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ireland will determine its position following the outcome of the process of recommendation of candidate by the Security Council to the General Assembly.</P>

      <P>Since we were informed in October that he was missing, my Department and the Embassy in New Delhi have done everything in their power to trace him.  A visa for Pakistan was issued to him on 28 June.  We therefore asked the Indian and Pakistani authorities to establish whether and when he might have left India and entered, and perhaps left, Pakistan.  The authorities in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir were put on alert and asked to check records such as trekking permits and those at police check-posts.  Notices and posters with the missing person's photograph and description were distributed to police, tourist offices and Irish religious orders in the area of the planned trek and other Irish people travelling there were asked to be on the alert.  Regrettably, these inquiries have so far produced no information as to whether the person may be still alive or what may have happened to him.  The Department and the Embassy will continue to pursue these inquiries.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I have received a very large number of representations from concerned people, North and South, following the events surrounding the <Col N="1209" /> recent forced parades on the Garvaghy Road and Lower Ormeau Road.  It was clear from these representations that the contrast between the methods employed by the RUC in nationalist areas in the aftermath of those parades and their approach during the standoff with Orangemen at Drumcree in preceding days has caused widespread and understandable concern.  There are also serious questions arising from the very widespread use of plastic bullets in nationalist areas, frequently in apparent contravention of the regulations governing their use.</P>
      <P>I raised this concern about the recent behaviour of the RUC, and its profound impact on nationalist opinion, at the special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 18 July 1996.  I made clear that the confidence of the entire nationalist community in the RUC had suffered a most serious reverse.</P>
      <P>In the Joint Statement issued after the conference meeting, both Governments recognised the urgent need to rebuild confidence in the wake of these developments and reaffirmed the primacy of the political process as the means of achieving this.  It remains the position of the Government that the issue of policing should be addressed as an essential part of all-party political negotiations.</P>

This commitment is reflected in the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to keep the public and the Oireachtas informed of progress at the Intergovernmental Conference and we will continue to do all that is necessary to stimulate public interest and debate.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency has drawn up an ambitious work programme for the Intergovernmental Conference with a view to fulfiling the mandate given by the Florence European Council namely to present to the Dublin European Council in December a general outline for a draft revision of the treaties.  The Irish Presidency is seeking to move the Conference from its exploratory phase to the negotiation phase by focusing wherever possible on concrete draft texts for treaty changes.</P>
      <P>The first papers submitted to the Conference by the Irish Presidency containing such draft texts dealt with the areas of Employment and Justice and Home Affairs and were considered at a meeting of Intergovernmental Conference Representatives, that is the Personal Representatives of Foreign Ministers on 16 and 17 July.  Further papers concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy, External Economic Relations and Transparency were submitted with a view to discussion at a meeting of Intergovernmental Conference Representatives on 22 and 23 July.</P>

      <P>The issue of greater access to RTE services in Northern Ireland is one on which the Government places particular importance.  I have no doubt greater availability of RTE television throughout Northern Ireland would be instrumental not only in creating better understanding between North and South but also in promoting greater understanding between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland.  Our objective of greater access to RTE television in Northern Ireland is shared by the British Government.</P>
      <P>This issue was first considered by the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in July 1993 and has been a regular item on the conference agenda since then, most recently on 22 May this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> A bilateral broadcasting group comprising officials and technical experts was set up by the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in January 1994, to examine the issue of RTE reception in Northern Ireland.  That group identified that the most significant improvement in the short-term could be achieved by increasing the power northwards from the RTE transmitter at Clermont Carn in County Louth.  The British side were concerned that the increase in power could have an adverse effect on the reception of its local services in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the two relevant regulatory agencies, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in Dublin and the Radio Communication Agency in London, have had a series of meetings to discuss ways of overcoming any problems of interference which could arise from an increased power output from Clermont Carn.  I understand that a joint technical report on how to meet these concerns has been agreed at official level and that political agreement to a phased implementation of the proposed changes to the transmitter at Clermont Carn is now awaited.</P>
    <P>At its most recent meeting on 22 May 1996, the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference noted the significant progress which has been made in the work it commissioned on ways of improving RTE reception in Northern Ireland and looked forward to a full discussion of this subject at a further date.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of RTE being carried on cable services in Northern Ireland, I am aware of the company to which the Deputy refers.  From the details supplied by the Deputy, the company appears to be in the process of negotiations with the rights holders concerned. While I welcome the company's proposals to include RTE television and radio services on its Northern network, the negotiations are, of course, a matter between the company and the rights holders.</P>

      <P>Ireland supported the adoption of the Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (referred to as the Standard Rules), when adopted on 20 December 1993 by the General Assembly of the United Nations as an annex to Resolution 48/96.  The purpose of the Standard Rules is to ensure that all persons with disabilities may exercise the same rights and obligations as others.  The rules are not a formal legal instrument and there is no formal structure within the UN system which enforces their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three United Nations fora which can oversee the implementation <Col N="1214" /> of the Standard Rules.  These are the General Assembly, the Commission for Social Development, and the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally supported the resolution on Disability tabled by the Phillippines each year at the General Assembly in New York and which was adopted last year by consensus.</P>
    <P>At the 52nd session of the Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva in March/April, 1996 Ireland tabled a resolution entitled &ldquo;Human Rights of Persons with Disabilities&rdquo; which was also adopted by consensus. Operative paragraph 5 of this resolution urged all Governments &ldquo;to implement, with the assistance of organisations, the Standard Rules for the Equalization of Opportunities for people with disabilities;&rdquo; Operative paragraph 6 invited Governments and the private sector &ldquo;to contribute to the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Disability, with a view to providing additional support for the implementation of the Standard Rules, within the context of the World Programme of Action concerning disabled persons;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Operative paragraph 13 requested the Secretary General &ldquo;to make available to the Commission at its 53rd session, the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on Disability of the Commission for Social Development on his monitoring of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunity for Persons with Disabilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not currently a member of the Commission for Social Development and has never served on the Commission. Therefore Ireland has not been in a position to take any initiatives on disability in that forum although we are fully supportive of its work.  Ireland contributes to the UN Voluntary Fund on Disability.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Standard Rules in Ireland is a matter for other Government Departments with responsibilities in this area.</P>

      <P>As an open, export-oriented economy, Ireland is committed to a secure, open and rulebound global trading system.  As a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, we believe that the best forum for the resolution of trade disputes is a multilateral one.</P>
      <P>With our partners in the European Union, Ireland has been deeply concerned at sections of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Liberdad) Act.  Provisions of this Act have an extra-territorial effect on non-US companies and individuals.  They are inconsistent with basic principles of international law and they restrict legitimate commercial activities.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, the European Union voiced its concerns about this Act while it was being debated in Congress, and has continued to take every opportunity to make these concerns known to the US, including at last month's EU-US Summit meeting and in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Florence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> On 16 July, the General Affairs Council adopted conclusions which reaffirmed the Union's deep concern over the extra-territorial effects of the Helms-Burton Act.  The Council, while reaffirming its concern to promote democratic reform in Cuba, recalled the deep concern expressed by the European Council over the extra-territorial effects of the &ldquo;Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Liberdad)&rdquo; Act adopted by the United States and similar pending legislation regarding Iran and Libya.  It noted the widespread international objections to this legislation. It called upon President Clinton to waive the provisions of Title III and expressed serious concern at the measures already taken to implement Title IV of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Council identified a range of measures which could be deployed by the EU in response to the damage to the interests of EU companies resulting from implementation of the Act. Among these are the following: a move to a WTO dispute panel; changes in procedure governing entry by representatives of US companies to EU member states; the use-introduction of legislation within the EU to neutralise the extra-territorial effects of the US legislation; the establishment of a watch list of US companies filing actions under Title III action.</P>
    <P>Title III of the Act provides that companies deemed to be &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo; or engaging in commercial activity in expropriated property from Cuba are subject to suits in US courts by US nationals who hold claims to such property.</P>
    <P>The Council instructed that the necessary preparations be made for urgent Community and co-ordinated national action in response to the US legislation.</P>
    <P>On 16 July, President Clinton announced his decision to suspend for six months the right to bring action under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act.  This decision by President Clinton is a positive step.  Nevertheless, the extra-territorial aspects of the legislation still remains in place, as does Title <Col N="1217" /> IV of the Helms-Burton Act, which allows restrictions on access to the US to be applied to European businessmen. Work is continuing on the range of measures identified by the Council on 10 July in response to the US legislation.</P>
    <P>The European Union and the United States share a common desire to promote democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba.  We should work together to achieve these common aims. It is to be hoped that the US will reflect further on the implications of its legislation and that it will work with its partners to protect and promote an open international trading system from which all can benefit.</P>

      <P>At the special Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting held at the request of the Irish Government on 18 July 1996, I made clear to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew MP, that it was vital that forthcoming parades be handled in such a way as to avoid a repetition of the confrontation at Drumcree and the serious adverse effect that events there had on relations <Col N="1218" /> between the two communities and confidence in the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the best resolution of any disputed parade is an agreement at local level which respects both the right to march and the rights and sensitivities of local residents.  To reach such agreement, it is essential that all the parties involved discuss the matter directly with a view to a peaceful and agreed resolution. I understand that efforts are currently underway to resolve the difference between local residents in the Bogside and the Apprentice Boys.  I welcome the recent meeting between the leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, and representatives of the Apprentice Boys.  I hope that the continuing efforts at dialogue will be broadened to include direct contacts between the Apprentice Boys and representatives of the residents.  The issues at stake are far too serious to omit such a vital and sensible move.</P>
      <P>I would reiterate the call made by both Governments after the Intergovernmental Conference on 22 May 1996, which reviewed the prospects for this year's marching season, on all those involved in the planning of parades to exercise compromise and balance in the interests of the community as a whole.  I cannot overstate the importance of genuine dialogue in Derry and in other areas where contentious parades are planned.</P>

At least 20 per cent of this funding (approximately £48 million) is committed to the six Border counties.  At least 15 per cent of the overall amount will be devoted to activities carried out in a cross-Border context.</P>
    <P>Under the Peace Programme the total amount of funding allocated for 1996 to the border areas is 38.456 million ECU. This comprises to 26.871 million ECU EU funding, 8.963 million ECU national co-financing and a private sector element of 2.622 million ECU.  Reports from the various implementing agencies indicate that substantial progress is being achieved.  It is expected, therefore, that the bulk of the funding provided for this year will be committed by year's end.  Any funding not expended in 1996 will, of course, be carried forward to the following year.</P>
    <P>The joint administrations are in the process of tendering for consultants for the mid-term review of the programme and the appointment of the evaluator should be made by September 1996. The mid-term review is expected to be completed by June 1997.</P>
    <P>Sup-programme 3, Measure 3 of the Peace Programme makes available a total of 22.5 million ECU from the EU Structural Funds between 1995 and 1997 to assist co-ordinated approaches by public bodies to common problems in the eligible areas.  Departments in Northern Ireland and Ireland have been meeting to establish a mechanism for the distribution of these funds and to consider the applications received to date.  It is expected that a first tranche of approvals will be announced shortly, with a further tranche anticipated for the autumn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The VAT treatment of the sale and rental of videos is governed by European VAT law with which Irish law <Col N="1223" /> must comply.  The EU Sixth VAT directive precludes the application of a reduced rate for videos, because they are not included in the list of goods and services in respect of which member states have the option of applying such a rate.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I must point out to the Deputy, that all videos sold or rented in the State by registered traders, whether they are produced in the State or elsewhere, are subject to VAT at 21 per cent.</P>

      <P>The ESRI, in providing consultancy services, has to compete in the open market.</P>
      <P>The Institute is in receipt of an Exchequer grant for part of its funding, which is to cover the cost of research of public interests, and has the status of a non-profit-making exempt body for VAT purposes.  The Revenue Commissioners are, however, empowered to charge VAT on any of its activities which they deem to be significiantly outside that status.  In tendering for consultancy contracts the institute takes the same commercial approach to costing its tenders as would other economic and social consultancies, such as the universities and private firms.  Consequently the Institiute does not enjoy an unfair advantage, and must seek to succeed in its tenders on the same basis of quality and price as other competitors.</P>

The latest year for which information on the income of farmers is available is the income tax year 1992-93, the taxable income of identified fulltime farmers who were assessed to tax for 1992-93 was £347 million, including employment income liable to tax under PAYE.  The corresponding taxable income of identified trader-farmers who were assessed to tax for the same year was £138 million.

      <P>(a)  Civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly.  This restriction applies to all categories of staff.</P>
      <P>(b)  Civil servants in the industrial and in the manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections.  Civil servants in this category may, therefore, contest local elections.</P>
      <P>(c)  Members of the clerical grades in the Civil Service and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (b) but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused.</P>
      <P>(d)  All civil servants above clerical level are totally debarred from engaging in politics.  However, personal assistants and special advisers in Ministers' offices are exempt from the present arrangements covering State employees and politics.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to make any changes in this area at present.  However, the matter is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that no unnecessary restrictions apply.  These restrictions are in place in order to maintain full public confidence in the impartiality of the Civil Service. The case of teachers is not directly comparable as they have a different relationship to the Government than applies to civil servants.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissiners that the original inquiry in this case was received by the Central Repayments Office, Monaghan from a motor car dealer in Navan, County Meath.  As it was understood that the son of the person referred to in the question wished to avail of the scheme, a negative response was issued as the vehicle in question had apparently only been road taxed and insured in the son's name since 18 July 1995.  In order to quality for repayment, a vehicle must, generally, have been taxed and insured in the applicant's name for at least two years prior to scrapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> A subsequent letter sent by the Deputy to the Central Repayments Office on 10 July 1996 indicated that the father wished to avail of the scheme and that the son had insured and taxed the car in his (the son's) name for a period in 1995, May to November 1995, while the father was ill, but that the father had then resumed use of the car which had not in fact changed hands.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the Revenue Commissioners will accept an application from the father if he wishes to avail of the scheme provided the vehicle in question is taxed and insured in his name at the time of scrapping and he is registered as the owner of the new vehicle at the time when that vehicle is first registered.</P>

This information was conveyed by my Department to her former parent Department in April 1994.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the statutory provisions for the reinstatement to their former positions of women who resigned from the civil service for marriage-related reasons and who fulfilled specific criteria, have recently been repealed by the Oireachtas.  The commencement order was signed by me on 25 June 1996.</P>
      <P>In the context of this repeal, it is intended that the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions to be held by the Civil Service Commission will include special sub-panels which will be composed solely of former civil servants.  It is hoped that this initiative will go some way towards facilitating the re-entry to the civil service of women, such as the woman in question, who resigned on marriage.</P>

      <P>I am aware that transfers from one party to an engagement of his or her interest <Col N="1234" /> in what was to be the family home to the other party to the engagement are liable to stamp duty.  The Revenue Commissioners have no powers to mitigate the amount of stamp duty chargeable on any document, including a document transferring property.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has pointed out that where such a property transfer takes place between married couples who are separating no stamp duty arises.  This is because there is an exemption from stamp duty on transfers of property between spouses.  However, I consider that this spouse situation is quite different from the engaged couples situation. Consequently, I have no plans to introduce an exemption to cover transfers effected in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of recent developments in house prices.  Statistics compiled by the Department of the Environment show that the average increases in new and second-hand house prices in 1995, by comparison with 1994 were 7.3 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively, representing a quickening in the pace of house price inflation.  In the first quarter of 1996, the latest period for which the official statistics are available, new and second-hand house prices rose by 4.9 per cent and 10.2 per cent year-on-year respectively.  These same 1996 data show that the quarter-on-quarter price <Col N="1235" /> increases, first quarter of 1996 compared with last quarter of 1995 were 1.6 per cent for new houses and 1.0 per cent for second-hand houses.</P>
      <P>The relationship between house price inflation and consumer and producer price inflation is not a clear one.  House prices as such do not form part of the Consumer Price Index, although the cost of servicing residential mortgage loans is included in it.  There is no doubt, however, that an excessive increase in house prices would be a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the recent acceleration in house prices carries an immediate threat to the maintenance of low inflation in Ireland.  Over the first half of 1996 inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been lower than was generally expected, it fell to just 1.4 per cent in May, showing no apparent reaction to the significantly faster pace of increase in house prices which can be dated from about the second half of 1994.  Inflation in the industrial sector is even more subdued, with the year-on-year rate of change in the manufacturing output price index having fallen to 0.8 per cent in June 1996.  The recent rises in house prices are however such as to require close monitoring.  The Central Bank has in recent months expressed concern about house prices and credit growth and has stated that it is monitoring the situation carefully.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;low import prices for consumer goods and goods for further production&rdquo; cited in the Deputy's question, and more generally the firm exchange rate of the Irish pound, have certainly helped our recent inflation performance. They have not however been the only beneficial influences.  Domestic factors such as pay moderation under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> increased competition in retailing, and restraint on administered price increases have also made significant contributions to fostering price stability.</P>

      <Quest>the arrangements, if any, his Department has made for receiving and examining pre-budget submissions in advance of the 1997 budget; and if he will consider extending the deadline of 12 noon on Friday 2 August 1996 to facilitate various interested parties.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced in my budget speech that budget submissions should in future be made to the finance and general affairs committee. That committee have formally accepted this role and will evaluate the contents of such submissions, will meet with representative groups and will submit a report to me with their recommendations.</P>
      <P>The revised procedure will allow for much more in-depth consideration of budget proposals by interested groups. Proposals can be developed in consultations between groups and the finance and general affairs committee, the Dáil committee which specifically deals with taxation and budgetary matters.</P>
      <P>The recommendations arising from this consultation process will be given careful consideration by myself and my Department and will constitute a valuable contribution to the formulation of the budget package.  I am confident that the interests of all organisations will be well served through their contribution to this process.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has set a deadline of 12 noon on Friday 2 August 1996 for receipt of pre-budget submissions from interested parties. The question of extending that deadline is a matter for the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and I am not in a position to comment on the matter.</P>

      <Col N="1240" /> The total debt of commercial semi-State companies, which is not included in either of the above measures, stood at £5,801 million at 31 December 1995.  It should be noted that there is some overlap between the debt of the general Government sector and the debt of commercial semi-State bodies.  For example, borrowings of the Housing Finance Agency, which are counted as part of the commercial semi-State debt, become part of the general government debt when drawn by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the matter has been reexamined and that the vehicles in question will attract vehicle registration tax at the rate of £40 when used occasionally on the public roads in the course of being moved from one area of off-road use to another.</P>
      <P>All terrain vehicles (ATVs) are mechanically propelled vehicles of an intermediate type which cannot readily be classified within the existing categories of vehicle set out in the current legislation. As an interim measure, pending a full review of the situation, the Commissioners had decided to treat: ATVs of a type designed and constructed for off-road use (other than scrambling vehicles or other sporting vehicles), and so used, as outside the scope of the vehicle registration requirements and not, therefore, liable to vehicle registration tax; such ATVs as effectively a type of light agricultural vehicle, akin to an agricultural tractor, when used occasionally on the public roads in the course of being moved from one area of off-road use to another, and, as such, liable to vehicle registration tax at the rate of £40.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to identify the five cases referred to <Col N="1280" /> in the question in the absence of more detailed information.  However, the Commissioners point out that the amounts identified owing to Revenue in a liquidation are often based on estimates where returns were not made and include full interest on the amounts due, estimated or agreed.</P>
      <P>In the period January 1995 to date there were 860 liquidations on record of which 101 can be generally described as pertaining to the construction industry. Liquidations and receiverships are by their nature long drawn out affairs and of the 101 cases only three are finalised. No liability was due to Revenue in any of the three cases.</P>
      <P>The information requested on amounts currently owed to Revenue by all businesses in the construction industry from January 1995 to the latest accounting period is not available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.  However, in the period June 1995 to date there are 80 construction industry cases in liqidation-receivership with an estimated £1.93 million due to Revenue.  It cannot be stated at this stage how much of this sum will be recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not in the business of extending credit to companies, whether in the construction industry or any other sector.  They pursue taxes due from all companies as best they can so as to ensure that there is no competitive disadvantage to those who pay on time.  However, where companies experience temporary cash-flow difficulties and run up arrears of tax, the Commissioners will, once they are satisfied that the company is not inherently insolvent and that the company is capable of repaying the arrears as well as current taxes as they fall due, consider proposals to discharge the arrears by instalments over a reasonable period of time in the interests of allowing the company to survive.  All such instalment arrangements attract statutory interest which is charged at a rate higher than commercial banking rates.  On the other hand, if the Commissioners are satisfied <Col N="1281" /> that the arrears position is irredeemable, then they have no option but to take appropriate action to safeguard the tax yield.  I am satisfied that, in all the circumstances, the approach adopted by the Commissioners is a pragmatic one and also one which protects the interests of the Exchequer while taking account of temporary problems that may affect bona fide companies.</P>

      <P>There is no restriction on tax relief on covenants to a permanently incapacitated parent.  The person receiving the <Col N="1283" /> covenant will, of course, be chargeable to tax on his or her total income.</P>
      <P>A housekeeper allowance of up to £7,500 may be claimed as a deduction from taxable income by a taxpayer, who is permanently incapacitated or whose spouse is permanently incapacitated throughout the tax year, in respect of the cost of employing a person to care for the incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a taxpayer may obtain relief in respect of expenses incurred on behalf of a parent where the taxpayer concerned is entitled to a Dependant Relative Allowance in respect of the parent concerned i.e. where (i) the taxpayer maintains the parent and (ii) the parent's income does not exceed a specified amount i.e. £4,400 for the current tax year.</P>
      <P>This relief may include relief in cases of serious illness where a qualified nurse is engaged by a taxpayer on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care for a parent in the parent's home.  Medical certification, details of the qualification of the nurse and a breakdown of the payments made would be required where tax relief is claimed.  Further details of this relief can be obtained, if required, from the taxpayer's inspector of taxes.</P>
      <P>Relief is not available in respect of any expenditure which has been or is eligible for reimbursement, for example, by the VHI, health board or by any other body.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle income from most social welfare payments, including the deserted wife's allowance, is therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, primarily on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient has in the particular tax year.  Where the deserted wife's allowance is the only source of income the existing exemption limits and allowances will ensure that little, if any, tax liability will arise.</P>

      <P>These steps include an increasing number of prosecutions for smuggling of tobacco products and the initiation of prosecutions for selling unstamped cigarettes; ongoing large-scale seizures of tobacco products whether smuggled from outside the EU, purchased in excess of duty-free allowances within the EU, or transported irregularly outside the correct channels within the EU; increased co-operation with various trade interests concerned, other Revenue services, and with the Garda and the establishment of a co-ordinated approach within the Revenue Commissers to counteracting measures</P>

      <P>Notes on approved profit sharing schemes are currently available from the Revenue Commissioners and a copy of these notes is being sent to the Deputy.  These notes were aimed principally at companies.  New Revenue information leaflets, for taxpayers generally, covering both approved profit sharing schemes and relief for new shares, are being prepared by the Revenue Commissioners and will be available shortly. In the meantime, I hope the following information will be of assistance to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Relief for New Shares &mdash; Section 12 Finance Act 1986</i>
      </P>
      <P>Relief from income tax is available to &ldquo;eligible employees&rdquo; in respect of amounts subscribed for &ldquo;eligible shares&rdquo; in &ldquo;qualifying companies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An &ldquo;eligible employee&rdquo; must be an employee or a director of a qualifying company or, in certain cases, a company which is a 75 per cent subsidiary of a qualifying company.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;qualifying company&rdquo; must be a trading or a holding company, incorporated and resident in the State.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Eligible shares&rdquo; must:</P>
      <P>&mdash;be new ordinary shares which are fully paid up</P>
      <P>&mdash;be issued at not less than market value and not be subject to any restrictions,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;not, during a period of five years beginning with the date on which they are issued, be subject to any <Col N="1289" /> preferential treatment, in respect of dividends or in respect of the company's assets on its winding up, nor carry any present or future preferential right to be redeemed.</P>
    <P>The maximum lifetime amount on which relief is allowable is £5,000, which was increased from £3,000 by the Finance Act 1996.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Approved Profit Sharing Schemes Chapter IX of Part 1 of the Finance Act 1982 and the Third Schedule to that Act</i>
    </P>
    <P>This legislation provides a mechanism whereby a company which operates an approved profit sharing scheme may allocate shares to its employees.  The employee is, subject to certain conditions, exempt from income tax on the value of the shares.</P>
    <P>All full-time employees who are chargeable to tax under schedule E and have satisfied a service requirement period, not exceeding five years, must be eligible to participate in the scheme on similar terms.</P>
    <P>A Trust must be established by the company and approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  The trustees are provided with moneys by the company with which they purchase/subscribe for shares in the company on behalf of the participating employees.  The shares are appropriated to the qualifying employees on similar terms.  In order to avail of the maximum income tax benefit the shares must be retained by the trustees on behalf of the participating employees for a period of five years. Any dividends received by the employees are assessable to income tax in the normal way.  Capital gains tax is chargeable on any subsequent disposal of shares in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The maximum value of shares appropriated to an employee in any one year cannot exceed £10,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Share Option Schemes &mdash; Section 10 Finance Act 1986</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under section 10 Finance Act 1986, relief from income tax is provided where an option is granted to an employee under an approved share <Col N="1290" /> option scheme.  Because of, <i>inter alia</i>, abuse of the scheme, the section was repealed by section 12 Finance Act 1992 in respect of options granted on or after 29 January 1992.</P>
    <P>In relation to options granted during the period 6 April 1986 to 29 January 1992, no income tax is chargeable in respect of any increase in the value of the shares on the exercise of the option. Capital gains tax is chargeable on any subsequent disposal of the shares in the normal way.</P>

    <P>On the basis of returns by companies for the tax years up to 5 April 1994 &mdash; by which date 134 schemes had been approved &mdash; the Commissioners estimate that a total of about 68,000 <Col N="1291" /> employees have received share allocations under profit-sharing schemes, some in a number of tax years, at a total estimated cost to the Exchequer of close on £39 million.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1995, provided for an increase in the annual limit on relief for approved profit-sharing schemes from £2,000 to £10,000. Statistics are not yet available which would enable an assessment of the impact of this measure on employee participation in the scheme to be made.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be provided in respect of share purchase schemes qualifying for tax relief under the provisions of section 12 of the Finance Act, 1986.  It is tentatively estimated that over the period from 1987 to date share purchases by employees valued at about £4.1 million were accorded tax relief at an approximate cost to the Exchequer of £1.9 million. The number of applications approved was of the order of 6,300 but this number includes repeated counts of some employees who subscribed for shares in different years within their statutory lifetime limits.</P>

      <P>I am fully committed to the continuation of profit sharing schemes.  Such schemes can bring significant benefits for both employees and employers in terms of improving industrial relations and enhancing employee motivation.  The schemes develop the concept of wider share ownership, encourage the development of mutual interest <Col N="1292" /> between employers and employees and they assist in the development of successful companies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, with a view to further promoting such benefits, the Government substantially enhanced the relief available under profit sharing schemes in the 1995 Finance Act by increasing from £2,000 to £10,000 the ceiling on the value of shares qualifying for tax relief.  Furthermore, the maximum lifetime amount on which tax relief is available to an employee who purchases new ordinary shares in his or her employing company, under section 12 Finance Act 1986, was increased from £3,000 to £5,000 in this year's Finance Act.</P>

This cost was offset by appropriations in aid of £435,000, which primarily represents the income from fees for revision applications and appeals.</P>

      <P>Given the short notice of the question, it has not been possible to calculate the precise averages requested.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner is obliged to determine every revision request within six months or as soon as possible thereafter. The Valuation Office endeavours to deal with revision requests as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In practice, the time taken to process a revision request will vary depending on the nature and complexity of the request and the time of year in which it has been received in the Valuation Office.</P>
      <P>Decisions by the Valuation Office on revision requests are issued quarterly i.e. in February, May, August and November. Irrespective of which quarterly issue date any revised valuation is issued on, that revised valuation does not become effective for rates purposes until 1 January of the following year. Revision requests received before 10 June are processed by the November issue date (i.e. such revision requests are generally processed within six months). For practical and operational reasons, revision requests made later in the year may take somewhat longer than six months to process.  However, since a revised valuation would not be effective until 1 January after that same revised valuation has been issued, the ratepayer's liability would not be affected even if the processing of a revision request had taken somewhat longer than six months (i.e. the practical effect of a revised valuation issued in February after a six month wait is the same as the practical effect of a revised valuation issued in May after a nine month wait).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no time limit specified in statute within which the Commissioner must issue a decision on appeals made <Col N="1296" /> to him.  Determined appeals are normally issued four times a year. However, the result of an appeal is effective from the date the revision being appealed was issued, so that the length of time taken to process the appeal would not affect a ratepayer's ultimate liability, no matter that the ratepayer's rates liability might be increased or reduced or eliminated altogether on appeal.  If reduced or eliminated altogether, a refund of any excess of rates paid would be made by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Valuation Office is participating in the strategic management initiative process and has been reorganised on a team-based structure with each team having its own specific area of responsibility. The Valuation Office is committed to improving the quality of the service it provides to rating authorities and ratepayers and has set itself the target of processing all revision requests and appeal within six months of receipt.  I am satisfied with the progress and endeavours to date of the Valuation Office in this respect.</P>

      <P>At 31 December 1995 the ratio of Ireland's General Government Debt to gross domestic product, which is the standard measure of a country's indebtedness for EU purposes, stood at 81.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maastricht criteria require, <i>inter alia,</i> that in order to qualify for economic and monetary union, a country's general government debt must not exceed 60 per cent of GDP, of if it does, <Col N="1298" /> it must be approaching that level at a satisfactory pace.  A succession of low budget deficits since the late 1980s, together with increases in GDP, has resulted in a significant fall in Ireland's general government debt to GDP ratio from a peak of 117.6 per cent in 1986 to 81.5 per cent by 1995.  Based on the strong performance in recent years, Ireland has been adjudged to have met all the requirements set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Government policy is to maintain budgetary prudence in order to continue to meet the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  It is expected that, in the coming years, continued budgetary prudence combined with strong economic growth will yield further significant reductions in the debt ratio, enabling Ireland to continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and make further progress towards the 60 per cent debt/GDP threshold referred to in the Treaty.</P>

      <P>The tax burden of people in employment is of particular concern to the Government.  Consequently in my two budgets I have focused relief towards lowering the tax burden, particularly of those in lower paid employment.  This has been achieved through significant improvements in the income tax and PRSI areas.  Such measures included increasing exemption limits and personal allowance, widening the standard rate tax bands and introducing a new weekly PRSI-free allowance which currently stands at £80 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, however, further progress is needed in reducing the tax and PRSI <Col N="1299" /> burden thereby improving the competitiveness and employment potential of the economy.

      <P>The position is that the production for sale of films for the video market is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  There is no anomaly in the application of VAT as the standard rate applies to all sales of videos.</P>
      <P>The company in question has been in contact with both my Department and the Revenue Commissioners requesting application of a zero rate to sales of videos of a dramatic nature produced in Ireland.  However, the EU Sixth VAT directive, with which Irish law must comply, precludes the application of such a rate.  Furthermore, I must point out to the Deputy that the application of any taxation measures which favour domestic products over those of other member states would be forbidden by the treaties.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that a large part of the company's output is exported to destinations outside the EU or sold to tourists visiting the State.

      <Quest>his views on the current strength of the Irish pound against sterling; if he has estimated the impact of this on Irish companies; the measures, if any, he proposes to introduce to alleviate the situation; and the way in which he intends to assist Irish companies to offset the difficulties.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the concerns of certain sectors of Irish industry about the impact of the recent movements of sterling against the Irish pound, which are due to the weakness of sterling.  These exchange rate movements have taken place despite the different evolution of interest rates here compared with the UK over the past two years or so, such that Irish interbank rates are now about half a per cent below corresponding UK rates.</P>
      <P>In practice, however, the impact of such movements of the Irish pound against sterling is complex and not all one-sided.  While companies exporting to the United Kingdom can face a more difficult trading situation when sterling weakens against the Irish pound, companies also pay less for any inputs imported from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to assess accurately the impact of particular currency movements on Irish companies because, <i>inter alia,</i> of the different currencies in which companies make and receive payments for their mix of inputs and outputs.  My Department does of course monitor economic trends, including currency movements and trade trends, on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce measures to aid exporters to the United Kingdom. The responsibility for protecting companies against currency fluctuations lies primarily with the companies themselves. In addition, any such measures would involve a significant commitment of funds when the Government has set itself a tight ceiling for expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government does, however, <Col N="1301" /> have a key role in trying to ensure that the economic environment is as conducive as possible to economic activity. The present environment is characterised by low inflation, moderate wage developments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, interest rates close to historically low levels, sound public finances, a balance of payments surplus and high levels of investment, notable under the Community Support Framework: all of these factors are beneficial for economic activity, including exporting.</P>
    <P>In addition, in each of the last three budgets, considerable Exchequer resources were allocated to employers through reductions in their PRSI contributions. The ongoing cost of these reductions is some £124 million annually. The 1996 changes in employer PRSI reduced the costs of employment of virtually all employers.  There have also, of course been substantial tax reliefs, mainly targeted at the low-paid, and changes in the corporation tax regime designed to assist businesses not benefiting from the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme.  The tax and PRSI changes of recent years have to some extent been designed to assist the competitiveness of Irish companies exporting to the United Kingdom.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of all properties which are currently included in respect of section 19 tax relief on homes and gardens of significance; the names of the owners of such homes and gardens; the times at which each of these homes are open to the public; the criteria used to enable each home to be included in the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 93 buildings with gardens currently held determinations from both the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1302" /> Works in relation to the buildings' significance and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to public access under the provisions of section 19, Finance Act, 1982.  These determinations entitle the owner-occupiers of such buildings to relief from income tax or corporation tax and to exemptions from residential property tax.  Tax relief in respect of significant gardens existing independently of buildings is provided for under section 29, Finance Act, 1993 but no gardens currently qualify for relief under that section.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also advised me that confidentiality obligations placed on them in relation to taxpayers' affairs prevent the public disclosure by them of details regarding qualifying section 19 buildings, including the names of the owner-occupiers of such buildings.  However, the owner-occupiers are statutorily obliged, when claiming the tax relief, to give these details to Bord Fáilte on the understanding that they may be published by the board.  I intend, however, to review for next year's Finance Bill, whether the information on section 19 buildings can be more readily made available.</P>
      <P>As 93 buildings are currently entitled to claim tax relief and obtain exemption from residential property tax, it is not possible to give details of each building's individual opening hours. However, the legislation provides that qualifying section 19 buildings must be open to the public for a minimum of four hours per day for 60 days per year of which a minimum of 40 days must be in the summer months of May to September inclusive.  Also, either the whole or a substantial part of the building must be open for public viewing and the admission price, if any must be reasonable. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners enforce these rules very strictly in granting section 19 determinations and insist, in relation to access, that, in addition to notifying Bord Fáilte, claimants advertise their opening times by a visible sign outside the building and notices with local tourist bodies and in the local or national media.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 158, 213, 220, 234, 255 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities, as approved by Government, the operation of the scheme is to be reviewed in the third year of its operation, 1996, before decisions on its future can be taken.  The programme is overseen by an InterDepartmental Monitoring Committee of the Programme.  The review, which includes the Rehab Recycling Partnership, is currently being carried out by the monitoring committee and will be completed later this year.  The review will examine the achievement of targets set for projects in the existing programme and will include recommendations about a new programme.</P>
      <P>At present the monitoring committee is seeking tenders from management consultants to conduct the evaluation in time for a decision to be made by Government on the future of the programme, including the existing companies, prior to the end of 1996.  All participants with a disability on the pilot programme are entitled to retain their medical card and secondary benefits for three years or until the end of the current programme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the current disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations health boards can pay a maintenance allowance to any eligible person who is ordinarily resident in the functional area of the board.  A disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient who commences third level education will continue to receive disabled person's maintenance allowance if they are medically and financially eligible to do so.  If a specific course is recommended for an individual by the NRB and is not available in the State special payment arrangements may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is in the process of transferring to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare took over responsibility for the funding of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 1 August 1995 and responsibility for the administration of <Col N="1306" /> disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to the Department of Social Welfare on 2 October 1996.  I have no plans to change the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations pending this transfer but I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The National Ambulance Advisory Council has set down the standards for emergency medical technicians. These standards were published on 19 October 1995 and are presently being implemented.  The primary responsibility for the safe running of events such as that referred to by the Deputy rests with the promoters and venue owners.  In January this year the Department of Education published a code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts and other events.  While the code was designed for outdoor events, it states clearly that the parameters for the good organisation of an indoor event are basically similar to the arrangements required at outdoor occasions.</P>
      <P>The code of practice, issued by the Department of Education, clearly outlines the detailed requirements in relation to the provision of medical facilities, first aid and ambulances at major events and I would expect that promoters and venue owners would have regard to these guidelines.  Investigations are ongoing into a similar tragic occurrence and should these investigations show any deficiency in the present arrangements, the Government will move quickly to remedy the situation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>The success of joint replacement surgery such as hip replacement has led to an upward surge in demand for these services all over the country.  The increase in the demand for orthopaedic services has in turn led to demands for an expansion of facilities to cater for this new workload.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken to improve access to orthopaedic services for people in Limerick and the mid-west.  Phase I of the re-development of Limerick Regional Hospital, which I sanctioned, includes the provision of a dedicated orthopaedic theatre and building work on this project is ongoing. Planning of Phase II of Limerick Regional Hospital is presently in progress and will incorporate a 30 bed orthopaedic ward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 I provided £300,000 to Croom Orthopaedic Hospital, for ward refurbishment and £90,000 for the acquisition of orthopaedic medical equipment. Between the years 1993 and 1996 inclusive, a total of £2.844 million has been <Col N="1309" /> allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board under the Waiting List Initiatives. Orthopaedic surgery has been one of the specialiaties which has been specifically targeted and a total of 700 additional procedures have been funded in the Mid-Western Health Board area. There are currently 185 people on the Mid-Western Health Board's waiting list for hip replacement surgery and the average waiting time is 12-16 months.</P>
    <P>When taken together I am sure that the measures which I outlined will improve access to orthopaedic services for the people of the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): At present long-stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations.  Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment.  These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
      <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987.  These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for thirty days or for periods totalling thirty days within the previous twelve months. These charges are applicable whether or not a person has medical card eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over-riding consideration in applying long-stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of <Col N="1310" /> long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance. In deciding the amount to be conntributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 159 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, which came into operation on 31 October last, specify the conditions attached to the placement of children by health boards with relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> My Department issued guidelines to each board at that time in relation to the payment of allowances to relatives in accordance with the regulations.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that, in two of the cases mentioned by the Deputy, they are at present undertaking an assessment of the relatives involved.  Pending completion of these assessments, and in line with the guidelines issued by my Department, the health board is paying the relatives in question a reduced amount of the allowance paid under the regulations.  If these relatives are formally approved, they will be paid the full allowance and receive the difference between that rate and the amount they received in respect of the period of the placement preceeding their approval. Health boards may not pay allowances to relatives in respect of any period prior to 31 October 1995, when the regulation came into force.</P>
    <P>While it is open to any relative caring for a child to apply to a health board for financial assistance, I would like to stress that allowances paid under the Child Care (Placement Of Children with Relatives) Regulations are made in respect of children who are in the care of a health board and where the provisions of the regulations are met.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 is to provide a statutory basis for the making available without charge of certain services to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C. Eligible persons are those who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin -anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.  The services to be provided are: (a) general practitioner medical and surgical services, in realation to all medical conditions, provided by registered medical practitioners (within the meaning of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978) chosen by the persons; (b) drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances; (c) the home nursing service specified in Section 60 of the Health Act of 1970; (d) a home help service as specified in Section 61 of the Health Act of 1970; (e) dental, opthalmic and aural treatment and dental, optical and aural appliances; (f) counselling services in respect of hepatitis C; and (g) such other services as may be prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On June 26 last, the Act was signed <Col N="1313" /> into law by the President.  The administrative arrangements necessary for the delivery of the health services set out in the Act are now being put in place.  Discussions are under way between officials of my Department and the health boards which are responsible for the provision of the services and also with professional groupings whose members will be involved in the delivery of these services e.g. the Irish Medical Organisation and Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  I would hope to be in a position at an early date to sign the Commencement Order, which will bring the provisions of the Act into operation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Health Insurance Act, 1994 sets out the grounds on which insurance undertakings, whether based here or abroad, may carry out the business of health insurance in the State. The Act provides for undertakings to conduct such business, subject to compliance with provisions in the interests of the common good, which include the community rating of premia, adherence to the principles of open enrolment and lifetime cover and the provision of a specified minimum level of benefits in policies relating to in-patient, day-patient and out-patient services.  Regulations pursuant to the Act were signed by me and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 March 1996.  It is now essentially a commercial decision for duly authorised insurers to decide if and when to commence health insurance business here in accordance with the legal provisions applying.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for this allowance is deterimined primarily by reference to the degree of care and attention required by the child rather then the type of handicap involved and because of this information on the handicaps of each child in receipt of DCA is not collected by health boards.  If any albino child, in the opinion of a health board, required extra care and attention that child's parents would qualify for DCA. There were 8,125 people in reciept of DCA at 31 December, 1995.</P>

The issues raised therein concern the tracing of donations and of blood donors in the context of possible infection with hepatitis C from blood transfusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the BTSB that in response to the letter of 2 October 1995, the Chief Executive Office of the Board contacted the person in question by telephone on 18 October, 1995 and conveyed to her that the BTSB has checked the details of the donors of the two blood units referred to in the correspondence of 2 October. He informed her that while the Board maintains a very strict policy of confidentiality in relation to donor details, on checking the donor details in this case, he confirmed that the donors of the two units had not been identified during the Targeted Lookback Programme and that the BTSB had no evidence to suggest that the individuals in question were or are hepatitis C positive.  He also pointed out that the tracing of donors of blood to persons who have subsequently been found to be hepatitis C positive involves many moral social and legal <Col N="1316" /> issues and that this matter was under ongoing consideration.</P>
    <P>In its letter dated 9 July 1996 the BTSB responded to the legal representatives of the person concerned, informing them that the two blood unit numbers supplied by the person were not associated with donors whose donations are the subject of the Targeted Lookback Programme and that neither of the donors have returned to donate blood since the introduction of screening for hepatitis C in 1991.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 141, 142, 143 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1995 the Eastern Health Board requested a meeting with me to discuss the future development needs of James Connolly Memorial Hospital and on the 16 February 1995 a meeting took place between myself, the Minister of State Deputy Austin Currie, and a delegation from the Eastern Health Board. Having taken the views of the Eastern Health Board into account and the fact that no significant upgrading had taken place in 40 years I agreed that the hospital required major development. The board indicated that it was prepared to utilise funds from the sale of some surplus land in order to provide <Col N="1318" /> funding towards this development.  On this basis, I agreed in principle to participate and to match the funding being provided by the board on a £1 for £1 basis to a maximum of £8 million.  The board has identified the need for a new accident and emergency department, intensive care and coronary care units and new ward accommodation and these are being addressed in the new development.</P>
    <P>In relation to the disposal of surplus land on the James Connolly Memorial site, the Eastern Health Board has advised me that it has recently applied to Fingal County Council for a variation of the county development plan to have the land re-zoned for development purposes.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provision of paediatric services at the hospital, these services in the Dublin area are provided at three sites, at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Temple Street Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street, which will be moving to Tallaght. Hospital services for children are provided at these specialist sites so that children in need of hospital care can be assured of the best possible service. However, in the event of an emergency, children are treated in James Connolly Memorial Hospital's Accident and Emergency Department and when their condition is stabilised they are transferred to the appropriate children's hospital.</P>
    <P>This is the first major injection of funds at James Connolly Memorial since the hospital was completed in the 1950s.  There is a large amount of development required and all requirements cannot be met in this initial development.  The hospital will, however, have a programme of development to ensure that all areas of the hospital will be brought up to the highest standards of accommodation available in any of the other hospitals in the country.  A project team is now addressing the detailed planning of the new development and the measures leading to the appointment of a design team are <Col N="1319" /> now under way.  I am happy to be associated with this major development plan for the hospital which I hope can be expedited in order that patients and staff of the hospital can enjoy top class facilities and services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Dental Health Action Plan the key aims of the public dental service, as outlined in the National Health Strategy, are being implemented, on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>The action plan provides for the phased improvement of primary and secondary care orthodontic treatment through the development of consultantled orthodontic services.  A total of six consultan orthodontists with support staff have already been appointed to health boards.  In addition a consultant orthodontist has been appointed to the National Cleft Palate Unit at St. James's Hospital.</P>
      <P>In addition to his/her own direct clinical involvement, each consultant orthodontist is required to organise and co-ordinate training for health board dental surgeons in the provision of orthodontic treatment.  This will achieve a high service level at a high standard. Orthodontic treatment for some milder cases can be provided at primary care level by health board dental surgeons who are competent and who have access to consultant advice and cover.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment services in the Dublin area is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  The board has informed me that the number of children awaiting orthodontic treatment in Dublin at present is as follows: Category 1,376; Category 2, 8,352 and Category 3,4,851.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funds have been provided by my Department over the last number <Col N="1321" /> of years specifically for the development of orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board area and my Department has agreed with the board a framework for the development of its orthodontic services under the dental health action plan.</P>
    <P>The board, at present, shares the services of a consultant orthodontist with the Dublin Dental Hospital.  This consultant has a half time commitment to the Eastern Health Board.  In addition a consultant orthodontist took up duty on a full-time basis with the board on 1 July, 1996 and is based in the new orthodontic unit at St James's Hospital.  A second post for a full time consultant orthodontist with the board has been recently advertised again by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>During 1995 the board increased the number of orthodontists working at sub-consultant level from two to five whole time equivalents.  The board also plans to recruit seven additional dentists and support staff to work under the direction of the consultant orthodontist in the unit at St. James's hospital.</P>
    <P>Pending the full implementation of a consultant led orthodontic service the board has also entered into arrangements with a number of private orthodontists for the provision of services.</P>
    <P>As a result of these developments the board is hopeful that the waiting periods for orthodontic treatment will be reduced considerably.</P>

While the Order has developed residential services in recent years for male clients, the number of places available to this group is still limited.  However, respite and other support services are provided by the board to this client group.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the Order, has examined the needs of this client group as part of the overall service needs of north County Dublin and included proposals to meet these needs in their regional five-year development plans.</P>
    <P>The regional development plans will form the basis for the overall development plan which my Department is preparing and which I expect to be ready later this year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Following previous waiting list initiatives I have committed a further £7 million in 1996 to continue to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialities where waiting times are considered excessive.  The main aim of the initiative remains the elimination of in-patient waiting lists in excess of 12 months for adults and six months for children in the target specialities.  Of this <Col N="1328" /> amount the North-Western Health Board has received an additional £542,000 to allow it to carry out an additional 615 procedures in the specialities of ear, nose and throat, general surgery, urology, ophthalmology and orthopaedics.  Regarding out-patient appointments, the provision of additional treatments for people on in-patient waiting lists will allow the North-Western Health Board to continue to process further people through the out-patient waiting lists for assessment and treatment as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Out of the £7 million being made available nationally in 1996, £1 million is being allocated for a cardiac surgery waiting list initiative.  The number of patients on the cardiac surgery waiting list has been a cause of concern.  The £1 million provided will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to enable 200 patients currently on the public hospital waiting list for cardiac surgery receive their operations over the next year.  Funds are also being allocated out of the waiting list initiative to enable a further 100 cardiac patients to avail of cardiology treatment.</P>

      <P>There is also an emphasis on preventive programmes e.g. fissure sealing treatment and on dental health education. Children who may have special dental needs are identified and, where necessary, called back for more frequent assessment and provision of treatment.</P>
      <P>The targeted approach, as opposed to a demand led system, ensures the maximum use of resources and also ensures that all children in national school have equal access to the health board dental services.</P>
      <P>Under the dental health action plan additional funding of £3 million is now being provided to health boards on an annual basis for the development of the childrens dental services.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that health boards have adequate resources to provide the service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>There is no formal code of practice in relation to the right to respite care. However, the provision of respite care and home support services are an integral part of service provision to people with a mental handicap and people with physical disabilities.  Both statutory and voluntary service providers use the facilities available to them to provide access to various respite services for as many clients as possible.</P>
      <P>Respite services are provided in a variety of ways; for example, through the use of dedicated respite beds, residential places vacated by residents returning to their families at weekends and the use of other residential places as and when available.  As such it is not possible to identify separately in the annual allocations for services to persons with a mental handicap-physical disability the amounts which relate solely to respite care.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the respite care scheme was transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to my Department at the start of 1995.  Funding of £500,000 was made available in each of the years 1995 and 1996 to provide grants to agencies and organisations to provide respite care.  This scheme is administered through the health boards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of services for drug addicts in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  My Department has ongoing liaison with the board regarding the provision of its services for drug misusers.  The board's policy regarding these services has been set out in its report on the Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol and Drug Misuse, which was published in 1995.  The board is making progress on implementing the recommendations in this report, which include the expansion of its services to deal with alcohol and drug misusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the announcement of the Government decisions on measures to reduce the demand for drugs in February 1996, my Department requested the Southern Health Board to outline how it proposed to implement the decisions in so far as its services were concerned. The health board replied with a detailed response on how it intended to continue with implementation of the policy and it <Col N="1336" /> also identified the resources which would be required.</P>
    <P>My Department has now allocated additional resources to the board in order to expand its services to include the following: the appointment of a health education officer; the appointment of an assistant director and additional counsellor in Arbour House; the establishment of a telephone advice line; materials for health education-promotion; awareness campaigns for young people and parents; a contribution to costs incurred at the therapeutic treatment centre at Buree; the establishment of community drug treatment teams; training and support to voluntary and community groups; training programmes for general practitioners; and the cost of an area co-ordinator in so far as the post relates to drug misuse.</P>
    <P>The total resources allocated by my Department for the implementation of these measures will be £125,000 in 1996. I am confident that the resources provided to the Southern Health Board will allow it to develop its service further in order to effectively cope with service needs.</P>

    <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed to me by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistant service to enable people with disabilities to live independently in the community. The development of a personal assistant service was examined by the advisory group on personal assistance.  While it did not recommend the establishment of <Col N="1338" /> an independent living fund, it recommended that funding of a personal assistant service should be considered in the context of the development of support services generally for people with disabilities.  I have informed the centre that this issue is being addressed by the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities whose report is expected very shortly at which time I will make a decision about the personal assistant scheme as part of my overall decision on the appropriate development of support services for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take questions 172 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service was published in November 1993.  The group, in its report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and fire service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work, approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnal are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the fire service personnel or indeed the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993. The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a range of productive-efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision <Col N="1340" /> in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity-flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication in December 1993 of the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service which heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which had not been addressed in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from this, a set of proposals was agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995 SIPTU advised that the proposals had been rejected.  A number of meetings have been held since then to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion.  In recent weeks an intensive series of discussions has been held in which progress has been made on a number of the outstanding issues. One further meeting has been scheduled with the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that this issue can be fully resolved at a very early date.  With the monetary aspects of this deal already agreed, my Department is anxious to finalise the details of the productivity and flexibility measures as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 174, 175 and 176 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme to compensate certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of blood or blood products provides that the Minister for Health, if he considers it appropriate, may amend the scheme, but no such amendment shall operate to remove, restrict or diminish in any way rights or benefits confered on persons entitled to claim under the scheme in its unamended form.  If in the future I have evidence and I am convinced that the workings of the tribunal are not serving the very best interests of the claimants, or if in my opinion such amendment would improve the scheme.  I will use my powers under the scheme to ensure that the tribunal is at all times meeting the needs <Col N="1586" /> of persons infected with hepatitis C.  I have been informed by the tribunal that no applicant will be compelled to have his-her case heard without agreement to the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing.</P>
    <P>The compensation tribunal has received 1,620 applications.  In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must apply within six months of the date upon which they first become aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, which ever date is the later.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant who it is satisfied was under legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser of that legal disability. Six applications were received after 17 June 1996, six months from the date of the establishment of the tribunal, and none have been rejected.</P>
    <P>The numbers of applications from various countries overseas are set out beneath:</P>

    <P>At all times I have been concerned that persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of blood products and-or blood transfusions should be informed of the existence of the compensation tribunal and through the Blood Transfusion Service Board, I wrote to such persons who had been identified through the various testing <Col N="1587" /> programmes of the board with information on the tribunal and the health care arrangements which have been put in place.  The Deputy will be aware that the arrangements for health care apply within the Irish jurisdiction only.  It is open to tribunal applicants resident abroad, who cannot avail of the special health care arrangements in Ireland, to claim compensation from the tribunal for the cost of health care delivered outside of this country.</P>

It will not be necessary for an adopted person to produce his or her birth certificate in order to use the national contact register.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that it has decided to institute summer ward closures in its hospitals.  The closures will mainly effect elective procedures.</P>
      <P>Summer bed closures are designed to coincide with consultant and other staff leave and it is a common occurrence that there is a fall off in elective procedures during the holiday period.  The board is satisfied that the proposed measures can be implemented without affecting the overall acute hospital activity projected for 1996.  Emergency services will not be affected by those measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Open heart surgery <Col N="1590" /> including heart transplants are carried out at the National Cardiac Surgery in the Mater Hospital.  There is no lung or heart-lung transplantation programme in Ireland at present.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital has submitted an outline preliminary proposal for a lung and heart-lung transplantation programme. The cost of the proposal from the Mater Hospital which would include additional cardiac surgery is: capital cost, £2.6 million, and revenue cost, £2.4 million per annum.  This would involve the employment of an additional 45 staff.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a successful transplant programme for any specialty is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  The Department's recent experience with the successful liver transplant programme bears this out.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients requiring lung or heart-lung transplants and I am considering options to alleviate these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of services for drug misusers in the Kerry area is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  My Department has ongoing liaison with the board regarding the provision of its services for drug misusers.  The board's policy regarding these services has been set out in its report on the Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol and Drug Misuse, which was published in 1995.  The board is making progress on implementing the <Col N="1591" /> recommendations in this report, which include the expansion of its services to deal with alcohol and drug misusers.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of the Government decisions on measures to reduce the demand for drugs in February 1996, my Department requested the Southern Health Board to outline how it proposed to implement the decisions in so far as its services were concerned. The health board replied with a detailed response on how it intended to continue with implementation of the policy and it also identified the resources which would be required.</P>
      <P>My Department has now allocated additional resources to the board to expand its services.  The health board, in turn, has commenced a survey to determine the epidemiology of alcohol and drug misuse within the community in various age groups, locations, patterns of misuse, etc.  The focus of this survey would be to estimate the current level of undetected drug misuse.</P>
      <P>Following the completion of the above study the board will be in a position to determine the exact requirement for the establishment of treatment centres in Kerry for teenage and adolescent drug misusers.</P>

The board is satisfied that the proposed measures can be implemented without affecting the overall acute hospital activity projected in 1996. Emergency services will not be affected by those measures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illness to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by this scheme having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of <Col N="1596" /> other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  A person or family who are unable to provide for their own heating or clothing needs should contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre who will be in a position to assess the individual's needs under the various schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick-East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of medical card eligibility is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a persons's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.</P>
      <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards.  Medical cards are usually granted to persons for a limited period as a person's entitlement may change.  In some instances medical cards may be given to persons, such as pensioners, for longer periods as their circumstances are unlikely to change. Medical card holders whose circumstances change are obliged to inform their local health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers have agreed on a number of standardised procedures to ensure uniformity and consistency when medical card applications are being considered.  A review group on medical card entitlement established by the chief executive officers is at present examining the effectiveness and efficiency of the arrangements for granting and renewal of medical cards.  In particular the review group is considering the manner in which medical card eligibility is <Col N="1602" /> reviewed.  It is expected that the group will bring forward proposals shortly to streamline the arrangements for granting and reviewing medical card eligibility.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for my Department to write directly to the Deputy concerning the cost of administering the medical card scheme and the percentage of cards issued by the Eastern Health Board for different periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services in the eastern region is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £1.25 million was initially made available in 1996 to the Eastern Health Board which has enabled the board to put in place 18 new residential-respite places, 112 new day care places and to further enhance the level of home support services available in the region.  A further £0.150 million was subsequently made available to the board to provide further additional residential places.</P>
      <P>Capital funding of £2 million is being made available to the board over a two year period to provide additional residential facilities on the southside of the city.  Some £1 million has been allocated this year with a further £1 million being made available early in 1997.  Additional capital funding of £0.660 million has also been made available to the Eastern region to support the additional services which are being put in place this year. A further capital grant of £0.250 million has also been approved by my Department to enable the board to continue the ongoing maintenance and refurbishment programme in St. Joseph's service for persons with a mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the latest information available to the board indicates there are 414 persons with a mental handicap on the waiting list for residential services and 420 on the waiting list for day services. In addition to those awaiting placement in day or residential services, there are also persons with a mental handicap already in receipt of services who require a different or more intensive level of service provision than that which they are currently receiving.  I am aware of the particular difficulties, which arise mainly due to the growth in <Col N="1605" /> the population and the tradition in the past of persons with a mental handicap from other parts of the country being placed in services in the eastern region, which the Eastern Health Board faces in meeting the demands being made upon it in relation to services to persons with a mental handicap.  These factors have been taken into account by my Department in determining the level of funding which was made available to the board both this year and in previous years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the substantial level of additional funding which has been made available in recent years has made a significant impact on the numbers of those awaiting services.  The Government's commitment to the continued development of services to persons with a mental handicap is reflected in my decision, with my colleague the Minister, to prepare a five year development plan to meet the needs identified by the new national mental handicap database.  I expect the plan to be ready later this year.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the out of hours emergency social work service is to respond to the needs of young people in crisis.  While it is recognised that some adolescents may, for whatever reason, be wary of contact with the Garda, the security of health board staff and the young people in question must also be taken into account in the organisation of the service. As staff may be meeting with unknown individuals, these meetings must take place in a secure and safe environment.  Such a setting may also be of support and help to children in crisis.</P>
      <P>The provision of a comprehensive out of hours social work service to children has been identified as one of the major service targets within the child care and family support services.  In this regard, funding was made available to a number of health boards, in the 1996 child care action plan, to provide an out of hours service or expand existing services.  I intend to keep this aspect of services to children and adolescents under continuous review.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The overall objective in providing treatment services for those addicted to opiates such as heroin is to return them to a drug free lifestyle.  It is recognised that, in the short-term, this may not be an option for many drug misusers.</P>
      <P>Methadone maintenance programmes are in operation in most member states of the European Union as well as in other countries and they have been shown to be successful where they are part of an integrated response to the drug problem.  I am satisfied that they also represent a valid response in this country.</P>
      <P>International research has shown, however, that methadone maintenance programmes make a significant improvement in the health and behaviour of such person, with consequential benefits to them, their families and society in general.  There are, in addition, considerable public health benefits with a reduction in the risk of spreading HIV and hepatitis C.  The level of drug related crime also reduces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is not possible to provide information of the type requested by the Deputy.  In the case of methadone maintenance, for instance, the cost per person would depend on the manner in which the maintenance programme was being delivered, for example, through a community drug treatment centre or through a general practitioner.  The associated incidental costs as well as the dosages would vary in both of these settings and the average costs would vary accordingly.</P>
      <P>In the case of a residential therapeutic programme the difficulty would arise in determining at what stage it would be appropriate to deem the programme successful for each individual.</P>
      <P>In any event, I do not think it appropriate to compare costs of different treatment approaches in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  Methadone maintenance works for a number of drug misusers but it is not the only approach.  Equally, therapeutic communities have successful outcomes with some patients, but do not work for others.  It would be more appropriate to recognise that both approaches can, with other treatment and prevention regimes, form part of an integrated approach to reducing the demand for drugs.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 222 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rehabilitation services, including services for people with brain injuries, are provided by the National Rehabilitation <Col N="1611" /> Hospital.  My Department's 1996 allocation to the NRH is £6.202 million.</P>
    <P>In April this year I was pleased to officially open a new head injuries unit at the NRH.  The new facilities have meant that the number of beds available for people with head injuries has increased from 23 to 34.  Separate wards for adults and children have been created with specialised facilities for the more severely disabled patients.  Nineteen additional staff have been recruited in the fields of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, social work, psychology as well as nursing.  This has facilitated the development of a multi-disciplinary approach to the rehabilitation of the patient.  I was pleased that my Department was able to make £150,000 capital available towards the development of the new accommodation and £300,000 ongoing funding for the running of the facilities.</P>
    <P>I also recently approved a capital grant of £50,000 for the development of a pre-discharge unit on the grounds of the hospital.  This unit is for patients immediately prior to discharge to rehabilitate them to the outside environment. I have also recently agreed to the establishment of a hospital development project team at the NRH which will comprise representatives of the hospital and officials of my Department. This team will look at all aspects of service provision at the hospital and plan future improvements.</P>
    <P>A wide range of services is available for people with brain injuries in addition to those provided at the NRH.  In line with the Government's commitment to disability issues, additional funding has been made available for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including people with brain injuries.  As a result, improvements have taken place in a number of services, including home support services, community based therapy services, provision of aids and appliances and additional grants to voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> The review group on services for people with a physical or sensory disability is currently examining the service needs of people with disabilities, including the provision of rehabilitation services. Its report is expected to be published very shortly at which time I will make a decision about the development of rehabilitation services as part of my overall decision on the appropriate development of services generally for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The European Court of Justice ruling referred to by the Deputy relates to a case which was forwarded to the court by the UK Court of Appeal from a decision of the UK Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is a particularly complex case and the European Court of Justice ruling has yet to be implemented in the UK.  An independent expert had to be appointed to carry out a job evaluation exercise and his report will not be made available until September 1996 at the earliest, following which time the employers' defence will be considered by the UK Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the ruling has no implications for the pay claim currently being pursued by IMPACT on behalf of the profession.  A meeting was held on Wednesday, 26 June 1996, between management and union, under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.  Both sides explored whether the provisions of the joint Government-ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the impasse in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the House that both sides have agreed to re-enter direct <Col N="1614" /> negotiations with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.  As the Deputies are aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £56.58 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-96 which has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,200 day care places.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.  The Government is committed under both the health strategy document &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; and &ldquo;Government of Renewal&rdquo; to the continued development of the service as resources become available.  That commitment is reflected in my decision, with my colleague, the Minister, to prepare a five year service development plan to meet the needs identified by the national mental handicap database.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy on services for people with physical disabilities is not readily available in my Department.  I will ask the health boards to put together this information in so far as it is available to them and I will forward it to the Department in due course.  As the Deputy will be aware there is no database on physical disability.  I understand that the forthcoming report of the review group on physical and sensory disability will recommend the establishment of such a database.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group is examining all aspects of service provision for people with physical or sensory disabilities. This will include examination of the existing provision of services and identification of unmet needs across all health board areas.  It is my intention, following publication of the report, to ask health boards to prepare local plans for implementing the report based on a <Col N="1618" /> total assessment of needs across the services in their areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to services for persons with a mental handicap, this information is being compiled as part of the five-year plan for the development of services which I will be announcing later this year.  At that time I will also be launching the mental handicap database which will provide the type of information requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern of many mothers that when their newborn child is diagnosed with a particular condition which may require more specialist care that they should be transferred with their child; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this can be a particular concern of mothers of children with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Newborn babies requiring specialist referrals from maternity hospitals are, in the main, referred to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  The hospital authorities are not aware of any specific concerns of mothers, as a group, in relation to their transferring with their newborn babies to the hospital.</P>
      <P>Demand for parents' accommodation in the hospital is considerable and currently there are 55 parents' beds provided in a unit on the third floor of the hospital.  Pressure on specialist beds has prevented the development of parent-child accommodation on wards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): At present a wide range of statutory and voluntary bodies provide information to people with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities.  These include the health boards, National Rehabilitation Board, National Social Services Board and Disability Federation of Ireland.  An information booklet &ldquo;Information Guide to our Health Services,&rdquo; which contains a section on services for people with disabilities, is widely available from my Department, health board offices, relevant organisations, libraries and the Internet.  Separate information leaflets are also available on domiciliary care allowance and disabled persons maintenance allowance.  In addition the Eastern Health Board has in place an information unit which operates as a one-stop shop for information on the full range of health services.  This unit is open to a personal callers and can be contacted by a freephone number.</P>
      <P>The review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, due to report shortly, deals with all aspects of service provision for people with physical and sensory disabilities. The group's report will address the issue of information needs and will make recommendations so as to ensure that a coherent and comprehensive information service is available to everyone.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): There is no gap in the <Col N="1620" /> qualification ages for a domiciliary care allowance and a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  DCA is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 who are so severely physically or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  Disabled person's maintenance allowance is the primary income support scheme operated by health boards for people between the ages of 16 and 66 who, because of their disability, are unable to work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Public health nurses perform a dual role in the care of people with disabilities living in the community. They provide direct nursing care and advice on maintaining good health. They also supervise and co-ordinate the provision of support services.  This role of the public health nurse has recently been reviewed as part of a broader review of the public health nurse service. A report is due shortly which, I understand, will confirm the important role of the public health nurse in supporting people with disabilities in the community.  The report of the review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities will also identify the important role public health nurses currently play in the early identification of disability.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): A planned twilight nursing service which is run by the majority of health boards operates from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.  This service is provided as part of the services for the care of the elderly. In specific circumstances where nursing care is required outside of this age group, arrangements are made to cover such cases.  The activities carried out by this service are a mix of technical nursing and procedures aimed at maintaining the activities of daily living.  This service is operated by registered general nurses.  In areas where there is not a planned twilight service arrangements are in place for public health nurses to provide nursing services, if required, during the hours from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have examined the recent report of the inquest into the death of a woman referred to by the Deputy.  The inquest was unable to establish conclusively the cause of death in this case.  In addition to herbal remedies, the woman had also been taking a conventional medicine, naproxen, prescribed for her by her GP.  Whilst the post mortem and the coroner's report suggest that the death was probably drug related, neither were able to indicate whether it was as a result of a rare reaction to the conventional medicines or a reaction to the herbal remedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that I take this opportunity to stress the dangers in seeking to <Col N="1628" /> treat ailments by combinations of various medicines without seeking proper medical advice on the matter, because of the possibility of interactions between different medicines.</P>
    <P>The controls governing the licensing and sale of all medical preparations are set out in the Medical Preparations (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1996. Herbal preparations may, in certain circumstances, be classified as medical preparations within the terms of the regulations.  Products containing herbal ingredients are considered to be medical preparations when the labelling or accompanying or associated literature makes any preventative, curative or remedial claim, or any of the herbal ingredients presented is recognised as having medicinal properties.  Where such a product is deemed to be a medical preparation it would be required to be the subject of a product authorisation as required by the regulations.  All applications for product authorisations are assessed by the Irish Medicines Board to establish the safety, efficacy and quality of the product.</P>

    <P>The criteria under which these allocations were made to the various agencies as follows: record of achievement of the individual agency in reducing waiting times under previous waiting list initiatives; investment already made in designated specialities since waiting list initiative commenced; waiting times for patients who need procedures; price per procedure; size of fund available; and ease of access for treatment.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993 when the Government provided £20 million to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialties where waiting times are considered excessive.  The sum of £10 million was provided in 1994 and a further £8 million was provided in 1995.  Since the first initiative commenced the total in-patient waiting list has been reduced from 40,130 in June 1993 to 27,752 in December 1995 which represents an overall reduction of 12,378 or 31 per cent over a period of 30 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The two clean air theatres in Merlin Park Regional Hospital opened in 1993.  In order to facilitate this expansion in orthopaedic services, my Department provided the Western Health Board with additional moneys of £400,000 in 1994, and £70,000 in 1995.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that the total number of staff &mdash; medical, nursing, clerical and paramedical support &mdash; is 16, at an approximate annual cost of £300,000.  Annual non-pay costs are in the region of £300,000 also.  A total of 1,100 operations were carried out in the hospital in 1995.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that both clean air theatres are used for elective orthopaedic surgery, Monday to Friday, 9.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Trauma procedures account for 70 per cent of the hospital's current orthopaedic workload and the trauma theatres are in use 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The board informs me that consultant anaesthetist cover is provided seven days a week for trauma work and this arrangement has affected the availability of anaesthetists for elective work.  I understand that the board will be employing a locum anaesthetist to help alleviate this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I remind the Deputy <Col N="1638" /> that the planning and provision of elective orthopaedic procedures at Merlin Park Regional Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board to address from within the resources available to it. My Department has recognised the need for the expansion of orthopaedic services at the hospital and this is reflected in the additional moneys made available to the board as outlined above.  I am confident that the Western Health Board will identify ways of overcoming the present difficulties so that the facilities at the hospital can be fully utilised for the maximum benefit of orthopaedic patients.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The proposed utilisation of the in-patient unit at Galway Hospice has been the subject of detailed discussions between representatives of the Western Health Board and representatives of the Galway Hospice Foundation.  These discussions have now reached an advanced stage and I am confident that agreement will shortly be reached on the provision of funding by the health board to enable the hospice to open the in-patient unit on a mutually acceptable basis.</P>

Diploma is not acceptable for working as a social worker within the health services under his Department; if there is no explanation for the non-acceptance of this particular diploma, if his Department will review its policy in this regard and clarify that the diploma is acceptable on the same basis that the higher diploma in social studies is acceptable for social worker employment in our hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In July 1991, the then Minister for Health established a committee whose remit included reviewing the qualifications necessary for employment as a social worker in a health board.</P>
      <P>The committee reported in March 1994 and recommended that those recruited to entry grade positions in social work under health boards should have a minimum entry qualification of four to five years combined academic and practice training and education, that is, an academic and a professional qualification. This recommendation was accepted.  There is currently a limited number of degree and post-graduate courses available, in TCD, UCD and UCC which meet this professional standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the B. Tech Diploma was not one of the qualifications <Col N="1647" /> examined by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee. However, it is highly unlikely that the qualification would have fulfilled the academic and professional practice place requirements of a professional social work qualification.  In the health boards and the voluntary hospitals which I tend to adopt qualification standards accepted by health boards, the recognised qualification for both recruitment and promotion over the past 16 years has been the professional qualification now known as the National Qualification in Social Work.</P>
    <P>The committee, in its recommendations, also advised on the setting up of a permanent successor to itself, an advisory body in the form of a National Validation Body to oversee standards in social work training and education.  This body, established in May 1995, is charged with assessing the equivalence of both national and non-national qualifications to the NQSW.  I understand that if the holder of a B. Tech Diploma were to submit their qualification for assessment, the precise shortfall in course content and level of qualification would be detailed by the National Validation Body.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is essential that all those involved in the delivery and supervision of social work be appropriately qualified and experienced.</P>

      <P>The MRBI undertook three surveys on behalf of my Department in the period since January 1995 at a total cost of £41,745.  The surveys were conducted in March, October and November 1995 for the purpose and ascertaining public attitudes to divorce.</P>
      <P>As is normal MRBI practice, each survey contained classification questions to enable the divorce data to be more effectively cross-analysed.  The data was cross-analysed by responses to questions in each of the surveys on demographic factors, party support and referendum voting intentions.  The cost each of the surveys undertaken its as follows: Market Research Opinion Survey, March 1995, £18,150; Divorce Campaign Research Monitor, October 1995, £11,797.50; Divorce Campaign Research Monitor, November 1995, £11,797.50.</P>

      <P>There is no working party on day-care for children operating under the aegis of my Department. In 1994, however, I initiated a pilot childcare initiative which continues to operate.  I introduced this initiative for the purpose of providing support for, and to facilitate, a limited number of innovative projects for the setting up, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures utilising the skills of suitably trained local people so as to enable local residents to avail of education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they might otherwise be unable to undertake in the absence of a childcare facility.  The initiative is targeted at designated disadvantaged areas and is to assist with start-up capital costs only.</P>
      <P>The initiative is administered, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management Ltd., which is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in cooperation with relevant Area Partnership companies established by the Government in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The name and location of all the projects which are being funded under the initiative are set out in tabular statement which I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal conservation requirements of huntable species, including the red grouse, are met through the provision of a limited hunting season under section 24 of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Currently, the hunting season for red grouse is limited to the month of September and this restricts the hunting of the species by all hunters, both native and out-of-State.  In addition, there are a number of additional controls imposed upon out-of-State hunters who form the principal market for commercial shooting-hunting operations in this country.  The conservation controls imposed on such operations provide that shoot operators must submit details of their shooting rights to the National Parks and Wildlife <Col N="1657" /> Service of my Department for assessment of their shooting capacity.  This ensures that lands are not overshot and hunting licences under the 1976 Act are issued by reference to this assessment. Shoot operators must also submit game bag returns at the end of each season and, in addition, National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers spot check shooting parties and inspect game bags. Hunters must hold a valid firearm certificate and hunting licence, and have the landowner's permission to hunt over the lands.  Notices are also issued to all out-of-State hunters advising them of the general Irish hunting situation and rules.</P>
      <P>The above controls apply to all commercial shoot operators and I am satisfied that through these controls no undue threat to the conservation of red grouse species will arise through hunting in the Knockmealdown Mountains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of capital moneys expended directly by my Department in each county during 1994, 1995 and for the half year to 30 June 1996 are set out in Table 1 attached.  The figures include expenditure by the National Heritage Council for the period to 9 July 1995, as, prior to the establishment of the heritage council as a statutory independent body on 10 July 1995, such payments came directly from my Department's Vote.  Also included is expenditure in 1996 by former divisions of the Office of Public Works &mdash; the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service &mdash; which have now transferred to my Department.  I have also included the comparative expenditure for 1994 and 1995, which, while paid out of the Office of Public Works Vote, was in respect of the operations of those heritage divisions which have now transferred.</P>
      <P>Details of capital moneys expended by the Waterways Service are listed separately in Table 2 as much of the work carried out by this division overlaps county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the figures contained in Tables 1 and 2 do not refer to capital expenditure by bodies under the aegis of my Department where such expenditure is not included in my <Col N="1659" /> Department's Vote &mdash; for arts purposes, for example, through the Arts Council or broadcasting purposes through RTE.</P>
    <P>In order to give greater clarity to the overall picture, however, I should also point out that I am responsible for expenditure not only through the Vote of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; including spending on heritage which prior to this year was channelled through the Office of Public Works Vote &mdash; but also for expenditure from EU Structural and INTERREG Funds.</P>
    <P>Among significant cultural projects for which substantial funding has been provided or approved by me during the period in question are: Crawford Gallery, Cork, £1.8 million; Galway Theatre Project, £2.3 million; Hawkswell Theatre, Sligo, £0.344 million; Hunt Museum, Limerick, £0.9 million; Longford Theatre, £0.67 million.</P>
    <P>Among major projects approved, commenced or completed in the heritage area were: Curvilinear Range Restoration, Botanic Gardens, Dublin, £4.7 <Col N="1660" /> million; Boyne Valley Visitor Centre, County Meath, £7.9 million; Kilmainham Gaol Visitor Centre, Dublin, £2.15 million; Purchase of Emo Court, County Laois, £1.5 million; Restoration of the Great Telescope, Birr, County Offaly, £1 million.</P>
    <P>EU Structural Funding has also been approved by me for a number of major cultural capital projects in the national cultural institutions, which are not paid for through my Department's Vote, including: Collins Barracks, Dublin (Phase 1), £12 million; and Chester Beatty Library, Dublin, £5.4 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, I recently approved funding in principle in excess of £13.3 million in respect of 24 projects under the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme, which is also underpinned by Structural Funding and will be a major source of support particularly aimed at developing arts infrastructure throughout the regions.  The projects are located in Counties Donegal, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, Tipperary, Clare, Kerry, Wexford, Mayo, Dublin, Roscommon, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  280, Uimh.  281, Uimh.  297 agus Uimh.  298 le chéile.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 42 and 49 of 12 June 1996 and Question No. 128 of 2 July 1996.  As I stated in those replies, I expect to be in a position to place a Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, before the House in the autumn. The Bill will, <i>inter alia</i>, set out the requirements for natural heritage areas and the question of compensation, if any, will have to be viewed in the light of those requirements. The Bill will also establish a formal system for hearing objections to NHA designations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed NHAs are areas which contain the best remaining examples of our native wildlife species and habitats. It is EU policy that any developments in receipt of grant aid should have no adverse impact on the environment. Developments in areas under consideration for NHA status that comply with planning law and meet any necessary grant regulations are not affected by the proposed NHAs.  However, where it is considered that development proposals <Col N="1665" /> will damage the environment, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department will object to those proposals.</P>
    <P>With regard to the identification of NHAs, a survey has been undertaken by the NPWS of former areas of scientific interest to determine whether or not they should be proposed for NHA designation. The criteria used by NPWS in selecting sites which are proposed for designation are set out in Appendix I. These criteria are applied in the light of best current scientific knowledge.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX I</P>
    <P>Criteria for selection of NHAs:</P>
    <P>(a)  Protection of site will make a substantial contribution to the conservation of one or more species* which are considered vulnerable, rare or endangered in the site's locality, region, Ireland or Europe, and whose survival in the area depends on the protection of the area and the habitats contained in it.</P>
    <P>(b)  The site contains habitats which are judged to be rare or endangered in the site's locality or region, or in Ireland or Europe, or which, where they do occur, are normally to a much greater degree of damage or disturbance.</P>
    <P>(c)  It contains habitats which, if they were to be destroyed, could never be re-created or which could not be recreated within a reasonable time scale or at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>(d)  It warrants conservation on the grounds of its diversity of species, plant or animal communities, habitats or structural features &mdash; such diversity being judged by reference to other sites of a similar or related type.</P>
    <P>(e)  It contains geological or geomorphological features or land forms which are rare in its locality, region, Ireland or Europe, or which, where they do occur, are normally subject to a much greater degree of damage or disturbance.**</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> (f)  it contains habitats, geological or geomorphological features, land forms or other natural features considered as good representative examples of their type with reference to the range of natural variation in such features.**</P>
    <P>(g)  It is one of a number of sites whose conservation is essential in order to conserve the full range of natural variation in a given species,* habitat type, geological or geomorphological feature or landform or other natural feature in Ireland.**</P>
    <P>(g)  Conservation of the entire area is essential on the grounds that it comprises a landscape unit which contains a number of natural features, the combined conservation value of which is greater by virtue of their occurence in one area.**</P>
    <P>(i)  It has the potential, if managed appropriately, to qualify under one or more of the criteria listed above, in a reasonable time scale and at reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>(j)  It is judged to warrant selection as an SPA or SAC under EU Directives.</P>
    <P>* &ldquo;species&rdquo; is used as defined in the Wildlife Act, 1976 and includes sub-species and hybrids.</P>
    <P>**Sites will be proposed for NHA designation on geological or geomorphological grounds on the advice of the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that an application was submitted to my Department for funding for this project under the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme which I am administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism.  I should explain that some 170 applications were received by me for assistance under the first call for the CDIS, representing total funding demands of some £87 million.  Since the total funds available to me under this first call was £14.7 million, the scheme was well over subscribed.</P>
      <P>Based on the recommendations of the advisory committee which I appointed to assist in the evaluation process, I have recently made decisions on the selection of projects to be assisted from the applications received to date under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that some very difficult decisions had to be made and that it simply was not possible for me to assist some worthwhile projects given the limited funding at my disposal. I regret that I was not able to include the Scartaglin project among the 24 projects to which assistance in principle has been offered under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, that it is intended to advertise this autumn for the submission of applications for the final stage of the CDIS, for which I expect to be able to allocate grant assistance of the order of £5 million towards successful projects.  It will be open to project promoters to submit a new or revised application based upon the most up-to-date position pertaining in response to that advertisement.</P>

      <P>A draft scheme of the Bill for the establishment of an inland waterways navigation authority has approved by Government and will shortly be referred to the parliamentary draftman for the preparation of the draft Bill.  Under this draft, there is a provision that the Minister can designate additional areas of land or water for the purposes of the Act.  This will provide for the designation by the responsible Minister of additional waterways, which could include the Boyne navigation, for restoration and development.  I am not at present in a position to say when this Bill will be for publication.</P>

The total amount available to me under the scheme during the five year period 1994-99 is £19.7 million, which, together with the matching funds that have to be provided by successful applicants, will enable a total capital infrastructure of at least £26 million to be put in place in the period up to 1999. A total of £14.7 million has been designated for allocation to successful applicants from the 170 applications received.  The remaining £5 million available under the scheme will be allocated following a second and final call for applications.  This call will be made in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The export of protected wild birds and protected wild animals is controlled under the Wildlife Act, 1976 (Control of Export of Fauna) Regulations, 1979, (S.I. No. 235 of 1979).  This prohibits the export of certain wild species &mdash; live or dead &mdash; except under licence.  These regulations do not apply to the export of specimens <Col N="1678" /> of legally shot game.  There is no statutory requirement to ascertain the number of game species being exported from the country.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department monitors wild birds and assesses tourist shooting through the assessment of lands to determine the shooting capacity, the allocation of gundays and bag checks, etc.  There is no evidence that hunting, including current levels of commercial shooting, pose a threat to migratory species.  From an analysis of bag returns and bag checks carried out by NPWS staff, it has been found that the level of such shooting is not a threat to the conservation status of migratory species.</P>

      <P>Under section 29 (2) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, out-of-State hunters must obtain a licence to hunt game.

Guidelines for residential caravan parks for traveller families, issued by my Department to local authorities in 1985, recommend full consultation with the travellers who are to use the sites selected or their representatives and, where possible, with local community groups or their public representatives prior to site acquisition.  The need for the fullest possible consultation process has been restated repeatedly since then, and is referred to in the policy document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead.</i></P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the precautionary measures, if any, being taken following the discovery of algae toxin in Lough Derg; the other lakes or locations known to contain this toxin; if any system or programme exists for the regular testing on waters for such poisonous occurrences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department issued general advice to local authorities in 1992 and 1993 in relation to algal blooms and the protection of drinking water sources. Matters addressed included risk assessment, sampling procedures, public information on human health and animal protection aspects where the presence of toxins is detected, and arrangements, treatment methods, etc., to safeguard drinking water supplies.</P>
      <P>As regards the present situation in Lough Derg, I understand that Tipperary North Riding County Council has appropriate monitoring and risk assessment arrangements in place and is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency and Cork Regional Technical College in responding to the algal bloom and its associated toxin problem.  The council has advised the public to refrain from paddling and swimming in areas of the lake affected by heavy concentrations of algae and has indicated that individuals and animals should avoid contact with shoreline deposits.  The council has also instructed that animals should not be allowed gain access to the lake shoreline. The need for these precautions will be kept under review by the council in the light of the results of its on-going water sampling programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tipperary North Riding County Council and other local authorities adjoining Lough Derg and the River Shannon have programmes in hand to upgrade sewage treatment facilities. These include the provision of secondary treatment and-or phosphorus <Col N="1690" /> reduction facilities at Ballinasloe, Birr, Nenagh, Roscrea and Tullamore at an estimated cost of £6.5 million.  Planning and construction of sewerage schemes at Athlone and Monksland, County Roscommon, is proceeding and will involve estimated expenditure of £2.85 million.  The expenditure will be met from grants provided by the Department with EU assistance.</P>
    <P>Extensive powers are available to local authorities to deal with agricultural sources of pollution.  These have been complemented by a recent amendment of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, allowing local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans, where warranted, in the interests of restoring or protecting water quality and by the application of the integrated pollution control licensing provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to new intensive pig and poultry rearing activities with effect from 3 September 1996.</P>
    <P>I will shortly launch, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, a code of good agricultural practice aimed at protecting waters from pollution.  The code has the support of farmer representative associations and will be promoted as the means to achieve sustainable agriculture taking account of environmental protection requirements.</P>
    <P>The position in Ireland regarding the occurrence of toxin producing forms of algae is the subject of an investigation commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Environmental Monitoring, Research and Development Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-1999.  The investigation will also address the environmental conditions which promote and sustain the development of toxin emitting algae of the cyanobacteria strain, test methods to establish the presence of toxins, the standards for safe levels of toxins in waters used for the abstraction of drinking water supplies and for water contact activities, the toxin levels which <Col N="1691" /> may entail animal deaths or human health illness if affected waters are ingested, the evaluation of existing techniques for removing toxins in water treatment plants, and proposals to upgrade these techniques where, and if, necessary.</P>
    <P>I understand that Lough Derg will be examined at three locations as part of this investigation and that samples of algae will be collected from more than 40 lakes throughout the country.  The lakes concerned are representative of waterbodies in each trophic category with existing or potential uses such as water abstraction, water contact sports, angling and shoreline facilities.  The project is expected to take two years to complete.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for national policy in relation to the development of mobile phone networks lies with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Any health issues arising from the development of such networks are matters for the Ministers for Health and Transport, Energy and Communications. As Minister for the Environment, my functions arise from the fact that communications masts require planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated previously in the House. I issued draft consultation guidelines on the planning issues arising in connection with communications masts for the guidance of planning authorities, operators, and the general public.  The draft guidelines advise that operators be required to furnish evidence that their installations comply with the International Radiological Protection Association guidelines or other relevant international standards.  This is to ensure that best international practice is followed.  The guidelines also advise planning authorities to assess the visual <Col N="1694" /> impact of communication mast proposals and the scope for sharing of existing facilities as a means of diminishing the impact on the landscape.  Consideration of the large number of comments received in response to the circulation of the draft guidelines has now reached an advanced stage.  The guidelines in final form will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>I have no function in relation to individual planning permission applications. However, it is open to any person to make an objection to the planning authority where an application is made in relation to any particular communications mast and, if dissatisfied with the decision of the authority to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348, 349 and 350 together.</P>
      <P>The National Strategy for Traveller Accommodation, which I announced in the Dáil on 27 March 1996, includes a proposal to give wider legislative powers to local authorities to deal with unauthorised parking by travellers in circumstances where local authorities have provided sufficient accommodation for travellers in their areas.  Preparation of the necessary legislation is currently under way.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for residential caravan parks issued by my Department to local authorities in 1985 are currently being reviewed and I intend that revised guidelines will be issued shortly.  The existing guidelines recommend that local authorities consult with the travellers who are to use the sites selected, or their representatives, and, where possible, with local community groups or their public representatives, prior to site acquisition.  The need for the fullest possible consultation process was stressed more recently in the policy document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead</i> and this will be restated in the revised guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Strategy provides that <Col N="1712" /> management and maintenance of residential caravan parks, currently the responsibility of the housing authorities, is to be improved with a view to securing higher standards of upkeep.  The question of providing assistance to local authorities in respect of the costs involved, as recommended in the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, is currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>Proposals to apply on-the-spot fines to speeding offences, by regulations under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are currently being developed by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Garda.  It is my intention that the regulations will be made by the end of October.</P>
      <P>The Garda will continue to be empowered to initiate court proceedings in relation to any case where an on-the-spot fine is not paid or where it is considered that such an approach is warranted in the light of the alleged offence.</P>

      <P>There is no record of the receipt of an application for a grant under the 1985 house improvement grant scheme in this case.  There is, however, a record of an application received in 1979 under a previous scheme.  In that case, the applicant's wife asked the Department's inspector to forego his inspection on the <Col N="1714" /> day he called because of her husband's ill-health.  She intimidated that she would make contact later with the Department, but there is no record of any subsequent contact.  Payment of a grant cannot be considered at this stage as a claim for payment of the grant was not received by 30 June 1981, the final date for receipt of such claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368, 369 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>Increasing vehicle numbers, with significant reductions in air pollution from stationary sources, make road traffic a relatively greater contributor to air pollution in Ireland than in the past.  A range of statutory measures are in place to control air pollutant emissions from vehicles.  In the case of all new vehicles, the relevant EU emission standards are implemented by the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Emission Control) Regulations, 1993 to 1995.  More stringent standards for light commercial vehicles, required by Directive 96/1/EC will come into force from 1 October 1996 under regulations being drafted at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, prohibit a person using a vehicle in such a manner as to emit fumes which could be prevented by the exercise of reasonable care and prohibit use in a public place of a vehicle which <Col N="1720" /> causes excessive noise through a defect (including a defect in design or construction), lack of repair or faulty adjustment.  The regulations also provide that a person must not drive a vehicle in such a manner as to cause excessive noise which could be avoided by the exercise of reasonable care. Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Under the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations, 1991, light goods vehicles over four years old must be tested for roadworthiness every two years and heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances over a year old must be tested annually.  The roadworthiness test includes emissions and noise tests on exhaust systems.</P>
    <P>Regarding traffic noise, while there is no immediate intention of making regulations under the Roads Act, 1993, this matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming national sustainable development strategy will address sustainable transport in the context of providing a framework of objectives and policies for achieving sustainability in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Support for recycling in Ireland is being intensified, in line with the policies and targets established in the Government's national recycling strategy.  An increased financial provision, supported by EU co-financing, is now available to promote recycling infrastructure; applications under this new grant scheme are being assessed by my Department and a first block of grants will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>The industry led REPAK initiative is being mobilised and I am at present considering, in consultation with REPAK, the establishment of appropriate regulatory support for the initiative within the range of powers available under the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency National Waste Database Report 1995, which has been published today, shows that recycling in Ireland is increasing rapidly.  The percentage of household waste recycled rose from 1.4 per cent in 1993 to 4.3 per cent in 1995. The percentage of overall packaging waste recycled from the municipal waste stream has risen from a reported 10.3 per cent in 1994 to 15.6 per cent in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consulted other EU member states and the European Commission regarding possible international action to improve the situation at the informal meeting of EU Environment Ministers and Commissioner Bjerragaard held in Dublin last weekend.  There was agreement as to the need for urgent consideration to be given to measures at national and-or Community level which will encourage more stable and adequate markets for recyclables.  These could include public procurement based initiatives and incentives for sourcing a <Col N="1722" /> minimum quota of raw materials from recyclables.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 390 together.</P>
      <P>Value for money (VFM) reports on selected local authority operations, carried out by the VFM unit of my Department, are issued, as they are completed, to all local authorities.  The local government auditors, in the course of their annual audits of local authority accounts, assess the extent to which the reports' recommendations are implemented by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The VFM publication which I recently issued aggregated ten separate reports in one comprehensive volume. This was the first time that such reports were made available to the general public. Since publication, a report on local authority stores has been completed and has been issued to all local authorities. Work is currently under way on studies in relation to water production, housing maintenance and debt collection.  A study on refuse collection is also planned.  I propose to publish these, and all future VFM reports, at regular intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Value for money auditing is still a relatively new and developing initiative, introduced within the local government audit service only these years ago.  It is <Col N="1730" /> an evolving process which may require adjustment or &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; as it develops.  The purpose of the VFM reports is to assist local authorities generally in achieving efficiency, effectiveness and economy in the provision of services, rather than to identify defects or inadequacies in the case of individual authorities; this latter is more approporiate to the normal audit report.  I have no proposals, therefore, to specifically identify those local authorities who contributed to particular studies based, on returns from a sample of authorities, but the issue will be kept under review in the light of developments.</P>

      <P>The legislative measures proposed to deal with the problem of drugs and anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates are designed to cater for the particular circumstances of those estates which are managed under the Housing Acts.  The question of anti-social behaviour in dwellings generally, or in dwellings to which the Landlord and Tenant Acts apply, are not matters in which I have any functional responsibility.  I might add, however, that the legislative measures already announced include a proposal to allow health boards to refuse or withdraw SWA housing assistance on grounds of anti-social behaviour.</P>

    <P>All schools already designated as disadvantaged, regardless of size, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway were invited to apply for inclusion in Breaking the Cycle.  In addition, all schools from all parts of the country <Col N="1739" /> with fewer than five teachers were eligible to apply for inclusion under the initiative.  The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the target schools and has invited applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.</P>
    <P>The centre is currently prioritising all applications in terms of level of needs as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 415, 438 and 477 together. Schools are being selected for support under Breaking the Cycle Initiative by reference to new selection criteria, developed by the Education Research Centre, and taking on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency.  The criteria were outlined in the Department's leaflet, Breaking the Cycle.</P>
      <P>The following criteria are common to the identification of both urban and rural schools which serve children from disadvantaged backgrounds: long-term unemployment (one year or more) of the main breadwinner; the family having a medical card; living in a lone-parent household and the educational level attained by the mother and by the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of urban schools, there is an additional criterion relating to the numbers of children who live in rented local authority accommodation and in the case of small rural schools, there is an additional criterion relating to the numbers of children from families in receipt of assistance because of limited incomes from farming.  The advantages which will accrue to all schools included in Breaking the Cycle are: an additional £30 capitation grant; grant for the purchase of teaching and learning materials <Col N="1741" /> and special in-career development for school staff.  In addition, there will be a maximum of 15 children in junior classes &mdash; that is junior infants to second classes &mdash; in urban schools.  Co-ordinators will be appointed to promote the new initiative.</P>
    <P>The application forms which were issued were very detailed and information was requested in regard to the school, enrolments, staffing, additional support schemes benefiting the school, details of the children in reception class, and commitment to in-career development, planning and the implementation of testing procedures for children with reading and numeracy difficulties.</P>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five year development plans identifying current difficulties and putting forward specific proposals and targets to address the problem of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre is currently prioritising all applications in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.</P>

      <P>Bill O'Herlihy Communications Group was recently contracted to provide a public relations advisory service to my Department.  The contract was awarded following an approach to five public relations firms inviting them to submit tenders.  Requests for tender documentation were sent to the companies concerned on 14 June 1996, asking that the tenders be returned to the Department not later than 5 p.m. on 17 June 1996.  Four of the five firms responded.  Following consideration of the tenders, the contract was awarded. The procedures for the engagement of consultants were followed at all times in respect of the award of the contract.  For commercial reasons, and in the interests of competitive tendering by Government Departments, I am not in a position to disclose details of the cost of the contract.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the contract was awarded on the basis of the lowest most suitable tender and that the tender was very competitively priced.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the details of this contract and payments made to the firm will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The consultants are required to provide a public relations advice service to my Department on: the implementation of the White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;; the ongoing Civil Service-wide Strategic Management Initiative; the preparation and promotion of legislation to give effect to the decisions conveyed in the White Paper on future educational policy and the continuation of the process of building enduring capabilities and competencies through in-career development programmes for staff in the education area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the important new initiative, &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;, which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas, which I recently launched in response to reports <Col N="1749" /> that I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  As part of this initiative, a pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 is being made available to the junior classes of 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway areas. A substantial programme of other supports is also available to selected urban and rural schools under the initiative.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, including schools in the Dublin 15 area that are already in the disadvantaged areas scheme, inviting their applications, The centre is currently prioritising all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

    <P>The enrolment of St. Patrick's national school, Corduff, on 30 September 1995 was 326 pupils.

      <P>A wide range of supports is currently available for primary schools designated as disadvantaged.  A supplementary capitation grant of £25 per pupil is paid in respect of these schools.  This rate is being increased to £30 per pupil from September 1996, which will bring the total capitation funding for these schools to £75 per pupil.  Until 1994, each school awarded disadvantaged status was also allocated an ex-quota concessionary teaching post.  However, from 1994 onwards, when the disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded, schools were allocated capitation grants only.  In addition, the staffing allocation made to each disadvantaged primary school is set at a level which enables the school authorities to ensure that no class will have more than 29 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme also receive the following supports: refund of television licence fee; 95 per cent building grant for building projects; schools with an enrolment of 200 or more may also receive a grant of £15 per pupil in respect of clerical-caretaking services, subject to a maximum of 500 pupils; under the scheme of grants to provide aid for school books for needy pupils, funding is provided specifically to aid in the establishment of loan-rental schemes for schools designated as disadvantaged and in 1993, a special initiative was introduced to <Col N="1751" /> alleviate the difficulties of certain schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme which were encountering serious current financial difficulties. One hundred and eighty-one primary schools which have been granted disadvantaged area status also avail of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, 40 disadvantaged schools have been allocated Early Start Pre-School classes and 31 disadvantaged schools have access to teacher counsellors.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a major new initiative, Breaking the Cycle, targeted specifically on tackling disadvantage. The benefits which will be available to primary schools which will be granted disadvantaged status under the new initiative are as follows: an additional £30 capitation grant which issues to all designated schools; grants for the purchase of teaching and learning materials and in-career development for school staff.  In addition, there will be a maximum of 15 children in junior classes, that is, junior infants to second class, in urban schools.  Co-ordinators will be appointed to promote the development of the initiative and there will be additional funding for strategies which the schools will identify in their plans to address the needs of the children.</P>
    <P>With regard to post-primary schools, the additional £30 capitation grant, in addition to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant, was introduced in 1994 for schools which were designated as disadvantaged. This brings the total capitation funding for post-primary schools designated as disadvantaged to £207 per pupil in 1996.  These schools are also allocated an additional ex-quota teaching post.  Eighty-seven post-primary schools designated as disadvantaged also avail of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme in 1994.  Schools were selected for inclusion in the scheme at that time on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators. Account was also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing teacher ratios.  The case put forward by the school in question was considered at that time.  Unfortunately, when taking these factors into account, the needs of the school were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant their inclusion on that occasion.  I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to this school.  I am aware that the adjacent boys school already has disadvantaged status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the report from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  In line with the recommendations of the report, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers <Col N="1753" /> are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.  The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the target schools and invited applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  The centre is currently prioritising all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the school and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five year development plans. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.  Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

An action plan has been drawn up with the aim of giving effect to the review committee's recommendations over a target period, having regard to likely resource availability and the need to prioritise responses.

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 440, 443, 444 and 445 together. The information regarding the primary schools in Counties Leitrim and Sligo which have a remedial teacher, or who are sharing a remedial teacher, is <Col N="1757" /> detailed on the attached list.  The information regarding the primary schools in both counties which have applied for a remedial teacher, either on a full time or on a shared basis, is not readily available within my Department.  If the Deputy would like to make an inquiry regarding an application from a particular school, my Department would require details of the school concerned.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to the schools referred to by the Deputy or to any primary schools. Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question. However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>During the period 1994-1995, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases. In the current school year.  I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  Of the 43 national schools in County Leitrim, 25 have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full time or a shared basis. They are as follows:</P>

      <P>The Price Waterhouse <Col N="1760" /> report, which the Deputy will have received, gives a full explanation of the methodology used to conduct the investigation. Price Waterhouse have not named those people whom they interviewed in the course of their inquiries. The material was properly despatched from the Ursuline College.  An Post have stated that a package bearing the same reference number as the package of craftwork from the Ursuline College was signed for as having been received by an employee of a Sligo-based company. However, the package itself has never been traced and Price Waterhouse state that it is therefore not possible to say with any certainty what was the ultimate fate of this package.  Price Waterhouse concluded following a lengthy and very thorough investigation and a report which details the facts as ascertained by them, that there is no single cause for the errors and failures that occurred.  They state that the reasons for their occurrence are, in most cases, complex and multifaceted.</P>

      <P>Safety is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department.  All aspects of safety, including carrying capacity, are monitored on an ongoing basis.  Approximately 165,000 children are transported to school each day in safety.  Bus Éireann's record of safety since the inception of the scheme in 1967, speaks for itself.  Bus Éireann ensures that the loadings do not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the different bus types in use.  The maximum loading on school buses is calculated on the basis of three school children to every two adult seats, in accordance with legislation laid down by the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the correspondence in question, which concerns the provision of escorts on the school transport system.  In 1995, I allocated a sum of £150,000 for a pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of <Col N="1768" /> escorts on certain school transport services. All applications for support under this scheme, including the application from the school in the area referred to by the Deputy, were carefully considered by my Department.  Funding under the pilot scheme was allocated as follows: to special schools for physically handicapped children in respect of their transport routes; and to provide assistance towards the costs of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for the hearing-impaired and visually-impaired who travel long distances by bus and train at the weekends.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to fully evaluate the operation of the pilot phase before considering any modifications or expansion of the scheme.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the children in the area in question will be given every consideration in the event of any further expansion of the scheme being undertaken. I regret that I am unable to arrange a meeting as requested by the Deputy as my diary is fully booked for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The School Transport Review Committee, established earlier this year, has been asked to review the arrangements for pupils in special schools.  The provision of escort services and journey times will form part of this review.</P>

I would remind the Deputy that since taking office I have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio from 25.2:1 to 22.9:1; and this will be further reduced in the 1996-97 school year.  The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of Bishop Galvin national school on 30 September, 1995 <Col N="1770" /> was 475 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and fifteen assistant teachers for the 1996-97 school year.  In addition, the school also has the services of a remedial teacher.  Accordingly, the sixteenth and seventeenth assistants' post at the school have been suppressed.</P>

      <P>The number of people, generally, with access to Department of Education conferences and events during the Irish Presidency, will be contingent on factors such as the capacity of venues, cost, and degree of interest. <Col N="1771" /> While, Presidency conferences and events are, in the first instance, aimed at those with a direct interest in the theme of the conference or event, nonetheless the Department wishes to accommodate members of the general public who wish to attend.  The number of people from the general public who will have access will be determined in due course, having regard to the factors outlined.  The phrase &ldquo;access on a limited first-come first-served basis&rdquo;, means that in relation to conference places for the general public, the primary consideration governing their allocation will be in the order in which members of the public apply to the Department for entry to specific events.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers <Col N="1773" /> are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.  The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, inviting their application.  The Education Research Centre is currently prioritising all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage.  Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>The student support schemes apply only to approved full-time courses in recognised institutions. The free fees initiative applies to approved full-time undergraduate courses in institutions which are recognised for the purposes of student support and are part of the CAO entry system. Open University courses do not meet these requirements and students pursuing the courses are therefore not eligible for grant assistance.  It is estimated that the annual fee costs of Irish students pursuing Open University courses is over £1 million.  It has been necessary to adopt this approach to the student support arrangements because of overall resource constraints.  I would hope that as resources become available it will be possible to provide greater Exchequer support for part-time undergraduate students.  The tax relief provisions for certain part-time courses in <Col N="1774" /> the Finance Act, 1996 are a welcome step forward in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472, 473, 474 and 475 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy regarding the breakdown in numbers and locations of the schools which have a remedial service and the schools in County Donegal which do not have a remedial service, is not available yet.  However, this information is currently being compiled within my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available. I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question. However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases. In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area <Col N="1776" /> in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the boys' school referred to by the Deputy has disadvantaged status since 1993.  An application for disadvantaged status from the adjacent girls' school was considered in my Department in 1994 in the context of an expansion of the disadvantage areas scheme being undertaken at that time.  Schools were selected for inclusion in the scheme at that time on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators. Account was also taken of the views of my Department's Inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios. The case put forward by the school in question was considered at that time. Unfortunately, when taking these factors into account, the needs of the school was not considered to be of such priority as to warrant its inclusion on that occasion.  I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged areas status to this school.</P>

      <P>I remain committed to the provision of additional assistance to <Col N="1782" /> schools for caretaking and clerical services. Since 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to primary schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress-Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> undertakings. The scheme has been extended to more schools by a reduction of the qualifying enrolment towards the target of schools with 100 pupils or more. However, present indications are that, in light of current resource constraints, it will not be possible to meet this target by September 1996.</P>

      <P>I recently decided to grant provisional recognition to Gaelscoil Cnoc Liamhna, Knocklyon, Dublin 16.  In accordance with established practice, the provision of accommodation for the gaelscoil during the period of provisional recognition is a matter for the promoters and I understand that, in this case, they intend to locate the school initially in the Scouts' Hall in Knocklyon.  In the circumstances, there is no immediate requirement for a permanent site for the school.  Normally, a gaelscoil would get provisional recognition in the first instance and would be in operation for a few years before its viability can be confirmed and permanent recognition granted.  It is only at this stage that the school could apply for capital grant-aid towards the purchase of a site and the provision of a school building.  A general guideline for primary school sites gives a requirement of around 2.5 acres for an 8-room school and three acres for a 16-room school.  I intend to monitor the progress of the new gaelscoil closely and will consider what action is appropriate in relation to the site on Scholarstown Road in that context.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to the schools referred to by the Deputies or to any primary schools. The total number of ordinary national schools in County Clare is 122, 63 of these schools, with an enrolment of 8,941 pupils on 30 September 1995, have the services of a remedial teacher available to them.  The number of ordinary national schools in County Clare which do not have the services of a remedial teacher is 62.  The combined enrolment of the 62 schools on 30 September 1995 was 3,294.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  The substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.  However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>During the period 1994-1995, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases. In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>The programme has been expanded in the current school year by the inclusion of a further 25 pre-school projects. This brings the total number of projects now in place to 32.</P>
      <P>I have also established an expert monitoring committee to advise me on the operation and future development of the Early Start Pre-school Programme. This committee is representative of a wide range of interests involved in the provision of pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The needs of this newly amalgamated school will be considered in the context of any future development of the Early Start Programme.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of St. Fiechen's national school on 30 September 1995 was 56 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and one assist and teacher for the 1996-97 school year</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 504, 508, 509, 517 and 518 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to make additional resource teacher posts available to the schools referred to by the Deputies or to any primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers and 29 resource teachers to the primary sector. A total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 36 resource teachers are now in place.</P>
      <P>I consider that substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>During the period 1995-1996, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers and 23 resource teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the <Col N="1794" /> entire spectrum of specials needs, including the resource teaching area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to twenty-five selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, inviting their application. The centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five year development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on <Col N="1795" /> the submission of suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information currently available to my Department, the school in question would be eligible for consideration for support under the scheme and will have recently been invited by the Education Research Centre to submit an application for inclusion in the scheme.</P>

A total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 36 resource teachers are now in place. These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following recommendations from the Department's Primary Inspectorate and having regard to the data supplied by the schools.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers and 23 resource techers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, states that a number of ordinary primary schools will be designated by education boards as centres where students with particular disabilities may be educated.  The concept of the designated school envisaged is part of a proposed continuum of provision aimed at ensuring that children with special needs will have access to a variety of placement options capable of meeting their evolving needs in their own areas. <Col N="1805" /> This provision will extend from placements in ordinary primary schools, with special back-up support if necessary, through placement in a designated school, to placement in a special facility dedicated to particular groups.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the designated schools will be selected on the basis of their capacity to make a positive contribution to meeting the special needs of children with disabilities in their areas and having regard to suitability of locations.  In addition to offering specialised support for children with disabilities, the designated schools will provide out-reach support services to special needs children attending ordinary schools in their areas.  Special additional resources will be made available to enable designated schools to undertake these functions.</P>
    <P>The Special Education Review Committee has made detailed recommendations on meeting the needs of pupils in each category of disability.  A special task force has been established within my Department to implement the committee's findings, as resources permit.  I am confident that the measures implemented will help to ensure that only in exceptional circumstances will children with special needs be required to live away from home to avail of an appropriate education.</P>

The degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children concerned.</P>
      <P>The rights of consultation for parents of children with special needs will continue to be an integral part of this process.

    <P>A range of measures have already been implemented and others are being implemented as resources permit.

      <P>As I outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question 117 of 15 February 1996, proposals for the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool are under consideration in my Department.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched an important new initiative, Breaking the Cycle, which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, inviting their applications. The centre is currently prioritising all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome shortly.</P>
      <P>The criteria being used to prioritise schools are as follows: long-term unemployment (one year or more) of the main breadwinner in the family; the family having a medical card; living in a lone-parent household; the educational level attained by the mother; the educational level attained by the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of urban schools, there is an additional criterion relating to numbers of children who live in rented local authority accommodation.  In the case of small rural schools, there is also an additional criterion with regard to numbers of children from a family in receipt <Col N="1818" /> of assistance because of limited means from farm incomes.</P>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five year development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information currently available to my Department, the school in question would be eligible for consideration for support under the scheme and will have recently been invited by the Education Research Centre to submit an application for inclusion in the scheme.</P>

However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is currently of its own initiative reviewing all aspects of the licensing laws.  I understand that the committee is at present accepting submissions from interested parties.  It would therefore not be appropriate for me to anticipate this report by commenting on individual suggestions at this stage.  When the committee has published its report, I intend to examine it in detail and to give consideration to its recommendations.  Any proposals, legislative or otherwise, which I might then have arising from this study, will be prepared and announced in the usual way following consultations with interested groups.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 560, 566, 685 and 687 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Burton, dealt comprehensively with the Government's proposals in relation to lotteries and fundraising generally in the course of her contribution &mdash; to which I would refer Deputies &mdash; to the debate in this House on the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill on 18 June.</P>
      <P>In particular, she indicated, against a background of concerns which had been expressed about the position of charitable lotteries, that the Government accepted that changes need to be made in relation to the cap on prizes which exists at present and proposed to make such changes in the context of a comprehensive reform of the legislative framework within which fundraising organisations operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a commitment in the Government Policy Agreement to reform the law relating to administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the Report of the Committee on Fundraising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes. Work on the preparation of this legislation is proceeding and it is hoped to introduce the legislation towards the end of this year or early next year.  To assist this process, the Minister of State established an advisory group on charities comprising representatives of a number of organisations working in this area.  It is expected that the group's report will be available early in September and at that stage it is proposed <Col N="1826" /> to refer the report to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security for their consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make any changes in the regulations governing lotteries in advance of the completion of the process of legislative reform which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that horse drawn carriages used in the Dublin area are licensed by the Garda Commissioner.  The law is contained in the Dublin Carriage Bye-laws, 1946 which are made under the Dublin Carriage Act 1853.  Each licensed vehicle must have a plate affixed to it bearing the number of the licence issued by the Carriage Office.  Inspections by personnel at the Carriage Department have disclosed no breaches of the Regulations.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has no responsibility for the licensing of horse drawn carriages outside the DMA.</P>
      <P>Under the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1851 it is an offence if the owner of a cart or carriage fails to have his name and address painted upon some conspicuous part of the right offside of the vehicle.  Statistics of the number of prosecutions taken under this Act are contained in the Garda Síochána Annual Report on Crime, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  It is not possible, however, to say how many of these prosecutions were in respect of the above mentioned offence.</P>

      <P>I am in absolute agreement that the transmission of pornographic material through the Internet is something that should be stopped, if at all possible.  It is a particularly worrying form of evil activity because it facilitates the distribution of pornographic material in a totally indiscriminate manner &mdash; including its distribution to children.</P>
      <P>The problem, however, is how to tackle it.  The depressing reality, unfortunately, is that no solution has been found in other countries which are equally concerned about the problem.</P>
      <P>The legislation for which my Department has responsibility dealing with the sale and distribution of pornographic material is principally the following: the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967 (as amended); the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1992; and the Video Recordings Acts, 1989 to 1992.</P>
      <P>These Acts provide for censorship of books/magazines, films and video recordings, respectively.  The task of censorship is carried out by the Censorship of Publications Board in relation to books and magazines and by the film censor in relation to films and video recordings.  There are also appeal boards to decide on any appeal against the decisions of the Censorship of Publications Board and the film censor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of censorship to the Internet &mdash; which can be described as a method where data on computers <Col N="1831" /> located throughout the world is accessible over a public phone line by a computer situated, for example, in an individual's home &mdash; would require the application of a radically different startegy to the type of censorship set out in the legislation I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are of course certain existing provisions which Deputies may wish to cite.  For example, section 96 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 provides that Telecom Éireann may &ldquo;prohibit transmission of objectionable messages&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications do not see provisions of this kind as providing an immediate solution.  They make the point that while the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has responsibility for the formulation of national policy connected with telecommunications matters, that policy does not extend to forming moral judgments about what constitutes obscene or otherwise unacceptable material.</P>
    <P>They point out that the obligation to make judgments on such matters traditionally rests with bodies established by the Minister for Justice and that responsibility for investigation of criminal offences rests with the Garda.</P>
    <P>Finding solutions to this problem is, therefore, a complex matter.  I am not aware of any immediate solutions but I will continue to search for one in consultation with any appropriate ministerial colleagues.</P>

      <P>The health care unit at Mountjoy prison is the location for a new treatment facility for drug addicted prisoners.  The treatment options available at the unit include: humane detoxification, tailored to meet individual needs and a structured programme of therapy aimed at enabling addicts to avoid becoming reinvolved with drugs and drug abuse.  In addition, subject to criteria such as sentence length, methadone maintenance which is widely employed as a stabilisation/harm reduction strategy, will be made available in suitable cases to individual prisoners.  All prisoners undergoing treatment in the unit will be monitored by daily drug urinalysis in order to ensure compliance with their treatment regimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is accommodation for up to 50 prisoners in the health care unit.  The treatment facility, which is the first of its kind in a custodial setting in this State, is based on one of the unit's three floors and will initially cater for a group of six prisoners.  The numbers being treated will be increased on a phased basis over the coming months subject to satisfactory progress with the first group.  I am advised that this gradual approach is the most prudent for medical and operational reasons.  This may mean that a few cells may have to be left vacant for these reasons and to allow for expansion <Col N="1833" /> of the programme.  I am satisfied that this is fully justified in the interests of ensuring the longer-term success and integrity of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for the committal of inmates to Mountjoy Prison provide, in each case, for the completion of a detailed questionnaire at the time of committal.  This questionnaire includes a section relating to the individual's drug history.  In addition, all committals are medically assessed by one of the prison medical officers, usually within 24 hours of committal.</P>
      <P>Most committals suffering from drug addiction readily volunteer this information when requested.  Those who decline to discuss their drug status, may if they so wish, discuss the matter with the medical officer.  It should be noted however that discussions between the medical officers and prisoners are confidential in the context of the doctor-patient relationship and that information gleaned from this source is not available to the prison authorities.</P>
      <P>In many cases prisoners co-operate on a voluntary basis with drug urinalysis testing.  Such testing issued sometimes in order to confirm a prisoners drug-addicted status prior to the commencement of a detoxification programme or conversely in order to ensure that a prisoner is drug-free prior to a transfer to another institution, such as the drug free training unit or to one of the two open prisons for male adults, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  Refusal to co-operate in a urine test would tend to suggest that the prisoner has, or has recently had, illicit drugs in his system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no measures currently in place either in the statutory provisions <Col N="1834" /> governing the administration of the prisons and places of detention or legislation generally, which would enable the prison authorities to demand bodily samples from prisoners on a compulsory basis.  I am not planning to introduce measures of this kind at this time.  I am satisfied that the voluntary testing system currently in place is satisfactory and appropriate.  It provides an effective means of both quantifying the extent of the drug problem among prisoners and, in so far as is necessary for operational reasons, the identities of those individuals concerned.</P>

It was not possible to place them in the detention room which is used for the detention of persons of their age as it was being painted at the time.  Nor was it practical, because of their behaviour, to keep them in the public office.  The children were placed in a cell under the supervision of a female garda, and the door of the cell was kept open at all times.  After 45 minutes, one of the children was released into the custody of her mother. The other two children, having spent 65 minutes in the unlocked cell, were taken to the public office to await the arrival of their mother who arrived three hours and forty minutes later.

      <P>Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, which governs co-operation in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, already provides that member states will, <i>inter alia,</i> regard police co-operation for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other forms of international crime, as matters of common interest. Structures already exist within title VI directed to improving co-operation on these matters on an ongoing basis. Ireland will take forward this work during the term of the Presidency in accordance with the priorities identified by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers for the period 1996-98.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency will endeavour to build on the work already under way from previous Presidencies to enhance co-operation between member states in combating terrorism.  Specifically the Irish Presidency will (i) prepare an updated evaluation of the internal and external terrorist threat to the Union (which is manifested in attacks such as those referred to in the Question); (ii) seek to further enhance co-operation at operational police level between member states to counter that threat and (iii) endeavour to secure the adoption of new legal measures to ensure that persons suspected of involvement in terrorist offences are brought to justice.</P>
      <P>The Florence European Council stressed the vital importance of reinforced co-operation between member states to fight against drugs and organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the key Union-wide actions which the Irish Presidency will pursue in order to improve co-operation in the <Col N="1839" /> compating of drugs and organised crime will be:</P>
    <P>&mdash; A review by member states of the adequacy of co-operation in protecting the external borders (s) of the EU &mdash; with particular reference to combating the problem of the importation of drugs by land, sea or air</P>
    <P>&mdash;  That arrangements be made to introduce co-operation between national forensic laboratories as an aid to law enforcement in consultation with the EDU (Europol).</P>
    <P>&mdash;  A declaration aimed at the introduction of sentences for serious drug trafficking offences, in the national laws of each member state, which come within the range of the severest penalties imposed in that member state.</P>
    <P>&mdash;  To actively pursue the ongoing study on the effect that the possible harmonisation of member states' laws would have on reducing consumption and illicit trafficking of drugs with a view to its completion by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>&mdash;  A Community-wide initiative be launched to encourage member states' customs administrations to enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with relevant trade bodies and companies in the private sector, with a view to enlisting their help in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>&mdash;  To promote enhanced co-operation between police and customs services and greater co-operation between member states in respect of exchange and training of law enforcement officers involved in anti-trafficking activities.  In this regard a policy/customs co-operation seminar took place on the 3 and 4 July 1996 which considered practical measures of furthering this co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> On the international front, the Presidency will strive for close co-operation between all regions affected by the problem of drug trafficking and organised crime.  Full and effective use will be made of all available mechanisms, including opportunities offered by the process of structured dialogue between the Council of Ministers of the European Union and that of non-EU states such as the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, the Transatlantic Action Plan, the framework of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.  The establishment of a co-operation mechanism between the European Union and Latin America including the Caribbean is also a priority and where appropriate with the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>In the policing and customs area, in addition to the major objective of tackling drug-related criminal problems, the Irish Presidency will be concentrating on developing and intensifying the effective exchange of information and practical co-operation between the competent services of the member states.  It will focus, in particular, on the training of personnel, crime prevention measures, measures to tackle organised crime, stolen vehicles and illegal trafficking of all kinds.</P>
    <P>Under the Intergovernmental Conference it is envisaged that changes to the Treaty of the European Union will be proposed prioritising action to combat drugs and focusing on the importance of protecting the external borders of the Union in the fight against drugs and organised crime.</P>
    <P>The Protocol to the Europol Convention was signed in Brussels on 24 July 1996.  This will enable ratification of that Convention which will be an important instrument in the fight against organised crime.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas, that prior to September 1994, there were two uniform inspectors in both Dundalk and Drogheda Garda stations.  When an inspector in Drogheda retired in September 1994, his replacement was allocated to Dundalk.  In February this year this new inspector transferred to Drogheda to assist in the preparatory arrangements for the transfer of the divisional headquarters, thus restoring the status quo in relation to uniform inspectors in both stations.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the position of collator will be filled at Drogheda station.  However, should the current collator not transfer to Drogheda it is envisaged that he will be absorbed into the uniform operational strength at Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is planned to transfer the following personnel from Dundalk station to Drogheda station <Col N="1844" /> when the proposed transfer of divisional headquarters is effected: one chief superintendent; one superintendent; two sergeants; seven gardaí; one clerical assistant (typist).</P>
    <P>As outlined in my previous reply to Deputy Ahern, all of the above staff are associated with the functions of the divisional headquarters.</P>

    <P>The decreased in strength is attributable to the fact that Fermoy, which was part of the Cork City Division, is now a divisional headquarters in its own right.

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  I understand from them that the current strength of Bunclody Garda station is four gardaí.  The station is supervised by a sergeant from Courtown station.  One of the gardaí from Bunclody station is temporarily assigned to Courtown for the July-August holiday period.</P>
      <P>The station at Bunclody is open daily between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and when unmanned a direct communications link placing members of the public in contact with the Garda at Gorey is in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there is a patrol car attached to the station and on certain days during the Irish open golf championship at Druid's Glen it was necessary to divert the car to other duties. However, during these periods I understand that patrols were carried out by the traffic corps, thereby maintaining continuity of Garda service to the Bunclody area.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have stated that to date in 1996 there have been no robberies recorded in the area.  In fact, crime statistics for Bunclody for the past three years indicate a downward trend.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied with the current level of policing in Bunclody and that they do not intend increasing these levels at present.  However, they will continue to keep the matter under review.</P>

      <Quest>if she has considered amending the law regarding the identification of alleged criminals by members of the public who currently must physically place their hands on the person identified in a formal identification parade; if she has given consideration to the use of one way glass partitions for such identification parades; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the guidelines governing the holding of identification parades there is <Col N="1855" /> no requirement for a witness to place his or her hand on a suspect and that it is sufficient for the witness to clearly point out the person being identified.</P>
      <P>It is also the case that the Supreme Court has stated that there is no rule of law or practice that requires visual identification in all cases to be by means of an identification parade: each case must be considered on its facts.</P>
      <P>The overriding consideration in any identification procedure is to exclude any suspicion of unfairness or the risk of erroneous identification and to make sure the ability of the witness to recognise the suspect has been fairly and adequately tested.  The inherent fairness or otherwise of the procedure followed at the identification parade is among the matters which can be questioned by the defence in the course of any subsequent trial.</P>
      <P>Clearly complex issues arise and any changes in existing procedures could only take place after very detailed consideration. While I understand that the Garda authorities envisage difficulties arising in relation to the proposal in the Deputy's question, I shall keep the question of changes in this area generally under review.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the increase in the use of syringes as a weapon in the commission of an offence.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific offence of using a syringe as a weapon, the criminal law already includes penalties up to life imprisonment for offences involving the use of a syringe in the course of committing a robbery or other offence. The possession of a syringe in a public place is also prohibited under the Firearms and Offences Weapons Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Legislation to reform the law relating to non-fatal offences against the person is at present being drafted and if I believe that some further strengthening of the law in this area is required or would produce some actual benefit I will consider it in that context.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that, on 1 June 1996, there were approximately 12,900 applications for copy folios and file plans on hands in the Land Registry.  This figure must be viewed against the Land Registry's output for this category of business which, in the five month period 1 January to 31 May 1996, was 53,241 applications for copy folio maps and file plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ten week period of industrial action by members of the CPSU affected the operations of the Land Registry in common with other Government Departments.  During this period, the efforts of the Land Registry to reduce the arrears were hampered since priority was given to servicing personal <Col N="1857" /> callers in the various public offices of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  In consequence, applications lodged by post in the registries were affected for the duration of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Despite these difficulties, however, the current position is that the period for issue of the majority of applications for copy folios and file plans ranges from one day to 14 days, depending on the region of the Land Registry involved.  However, in case where queries arise in relation to the application, completion can be delayed.</P>

    <P>The Garda Commissioner, following a review in June 1994, submitted a report to my Department outling proposals for a further extension of the scheme.  These proposals are still the subject of discussions between my <Col N="1859" /> Department and the Garda authorities. While I expect these discussions to be concluded in the near future, it is, of course, vital that all aspects of such proposals be carefully examined and reviewed in the context of current demands being placed on the Garda Síochána.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultation with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.</P>
    <P>No ministerial reports on the scheme of rural community policing have been produced.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to say how many speeding offences will be dealt with by way of issuing fine-on-the-spot notices when the regulations are made.  Neither is it possible to say how many of such fines would be paid before the need to proceed by summons arose.</P>

      <P>The current strength, all ranks, at Ballymun station is 50 members.  The number serving when the station was built was around 45.  However, the increased level of activity at the station and the need for additional facilities has rendered the existing building inadequate.</P>

In the case of the three dealings, which were lodged in the Land Registry on dates in 1990 and 1992, it appears that the applicant has been unable to satisfy the Land Registry of entitlement to absolute title to the land in question.  The applicant's solicitors have been advised of this and of the possibility of registering possessory title only.  There has been no reply to this suggestion from the applicant's solicitors.</P>
      <P>Queries regarding the associated dealing were issued to the lodging solicitors on 12 August 1994 to which it appears no replies have been received.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 635 and 636 together.</P>
      <P>I have previously indicated my dissatisfaction with the systems in place within the criminal justice system for compiling statistics in such a way that everybody using the statistics is clear as to the precise meaning.  For example, I have found that in the past court statistics were maintained primarily for the purpose of measuring activity levels and thereby measuring resource requirements for the courts.</P>
      <P>Taking the case of statistics relating to applications for judicial separation as an example, previous Ministers for Justice and myself have given figures in respect of the number of applications for judicial separation to the Circuit Court since the enactment of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, to 31 July 1995, which, if totalled would come to over 11,000.  Such statistics, which have been given many times, were a measure of the actual volume of business which was before the courts over the years, but in some cases involved an element of double counting, if a case went from one term to another.</P>
      <P>When I became aware of the lack of clarity and difficulties of interpretation which existed in the past in relation to judicial separation statistics, I instituted a complete review of such statistics to ensure that everyone who had occasion to use the statistics would know exactly what was represented by the figures produced to avoid any double counting.</P>
      <P>The actual number of individual applications for judicial separation which were made to the Circuit Court frem the commencement of the 1989 Act of 31 July 1995 was 6,712.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A breakdown of the number of applications made and decrees of judicial separation granted under the 1989 Act by each Circuit Court area is as follows. The review of judicial separation statistics did not focus on recording the <Col N="1873" /> grounds under which decrees of judicial separation were granted.  Such information is not readily available and could only be compiled by the allocation of very scarce resources from other more important tasks.</P>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of applications for judicial separation and the number of decrees granted for the 1995-96 year will be compiled after the completion of the current legal year which ends on 31 July next and I will arrange for it to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

Information on the grounds upon which the decrees were granted is not readily available and could only be compiled by the allocation of very scarce resources from other more important tasks which in my view could not be justified.</P>

      <P>The Bridge Project is an intensive probation supervision initiative established by my Department's probation and welfare service in 1991.  The project is run as an alternative to custody and referrals are made up from the following groups:</P>
      <P>&mdash;offenders who have committed serious crimes and, at the court stage, are placed on the programme as an alternative to custody;</P>
      <P>&mdash;prisoners, who are serving sentences for serious crimes, and who are given temporary release on the condition that they attend the programme.</P>
      <P>The participants are placed on a demanding community based programme while under the strict supervision of the probation and welfare service. The project provides a programme which addresses the lifestyles of offenders, aimed at diverting them from crime and finding them employment or other meaningful occupations.  Recently, I was pleased to launch, on behalf of the project, a major new initiative to explain to employers the reasons why exoffenders should be considered for jobs, and the benefits that can be derived by employing them.  The programme also facilitates the development of constructive personal and social skills aimed at reducing recidivism.</P>
      <P>The bridge project has a management committee comprised of representatives of criminal justice agencies, business people, the Irish Youth Federation, City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. FÁS, ICTU, and research interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provided grants amounting to £110,000 to the project for <Col N="1881" /> running costs in 1995, in addition to over £4,000 for capital equipment.  My Department is also in the process of having new premises in Parnell Street, Dublin, renovated for use by the project.</P>

Two more intakes of 163 trainees are scheduled each for next week and October 1996. The number scheduled to be admitted for training in 1997 is 600.  There are 144 candidates from the current competition remaining to be medically examined. These medical examinations are currently in progress and it is not possible at this point to state how many will be declared medically fit for entry into the college.  There are 176 trainees in Phase I and Phase III training at the Garda College, with a further 179 on Phase II at selected Garda stations, giving a total of 355 in training.</P>

      <P>I expect to submit my proposals for Garda recruitment for the three to four years period commencing 1998 to Government later this year.  The current recruitment competition, which covers the period 1995 to 1997 inclusive, provided for the recruitment of 1,050 new gardaí.  This figure is being augmented by a further 400 following the recently announced crime package.  The recruitment of 200 civilians under that package will also be a significant boost to the operational strength of the force through the release to operational duties of a comparable number of gardaí.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 662 and 663 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there is, or was, a problem of &ldquo;unattended and unassessed psychotically ill prisoners in Mountjoy Prison&rdquo; in 1993 or 1994 or the period since then.  There is, I freely acknowledge, a long-standing problem in relation to a waiting list for admission to the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) for prisoners who are mentally disordered and are deemed, on medical examination, to require in-patient treatment in that setting.  The waiting list in question fluctuates considerably in size from time to time.  The Central Mental Hospital operates under the aegis of the Department of Health and the Eastern Health Board.  Responsibility for its <Col N="1892" /> staffing and admissions policy ultimately rests with those bodies.  At the request of my Department, a working group was established by my colleague, the then Minister for Health in 1994 to examine, <i>inter alia,</i> the accommodation provision in the Central Mental Hospital in respect of mentally disordered prisoners.  This group included senior officials from my Department, including the Director of Prison Medical Services.  The group reported to the Minister for Health in mid-1995 and its recommendations, which included steps to increase the number of beds available for prisoners, were accepted by the Minister for Health.  The main step to increase bed availability was the transfer to local psychiatric hospitals of older patients at the hospital who were deemed to no longer require treatment in conditions of high security.  Implementation of this policy recommendation is ongoing and I understand that several patients have in fact been transferred under this policy to local psychiatric hospitals in their home areas.</P>
    <P>Recent court decisions have led to an increase of inward referrals to the Central Mental Hospital from the health boards and this has, to an extent, offset the potential gains from the outward placement of older Central Mental Hospital patients to which I have already referred.</P>

      <P>The ethical accountability of all doctors registered in the State is to the Medical <Col N="1893" /> Council, which is essentially constituted to function as a watchdog of medical standards on behalf of the public.  No doctor is ethically accountable to another doctor.</P>
      <P>In relation to medical management accountability, the appointment of a director of prison medical services in 1990, which was a newly created position at that time, did not focus on clearly defining the accountability of existing prison doctors to this new medical manager. While this omission is understandable, given the difficulties that occurred in recruiting a suitably qualified doctor to the position, it is clearly time to revisit the relationship between the medical director and the medical practitioners in the prisons.</P>
      <P>As a first step, I have asked the director of prison medical services to review his role and make a submission to me on the matter.  Among the aims of the proposed common contract for prison doctors, which has been under negotiation with the IMO for some time, is to more clearly define the line management responsibilities of prison doctors to both prison governors and to the director of prison medical services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overtime allocation for the prison service has been constantly exceeded over the years.  The factors involved are complex. Prisons by their nature are labour intensive and agreed staffing levels must be maintained in the interest of the good order of the institutions, irrespective of demands arising outside the prisons for escorts to courts, hospitals and other prisons.  These demands, which <Col N="1894" /> must be met, account for more than one quarter of overtime expenditure.</P>
      <P>The level of overtime also reflects the increasing pressure on the prison system which has had to cope with a 50 per cent increase in the number of committals since 1991.  A further factor which links into overtime is sick leave as staff who do not attend for duty, by and large, must be replaced on overtime in order to maintain required staffing levels.</P>
      <P>Whatever the justifiable reasons for overtime, high levels of overtime are not in the long-term interests of either prison staff and their families or of the prison service.  With a view to addressing this and other matters which affect prison costs, a review of the operating costs of the prison service is being carried out.  This review group includes representatives of prison governors, prison staff, my Department, as well as people from the public and private sectors and the Department of Finance.  I hope to receive its report within a matter of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 671 and 679 together.</P>
      <P>A drug-free area with accommodation for up to 90 prisoners has been operating successfully at the training Unit, Glengarriff Parade, Dublin 7 since March 1996.  Regarding the possible expansion and improvement of drug-free accommodation for prisoners, I am currently examining several options in respect of other institutions.  I hope to be in a position to announce significant developments in this regard in the autumn. The treatment facility for drug addicted prisoners, which includes a detoxification facility, is now in operation at Mountjoy Prison's health care unit.  While the staffing arrangements for the unit have been the subject of some discussions with staff representatives, this matter has now been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
      <P>Methadone maintenance is one of the treatment options which will be available in the treatment unit.  Committals who had been complying with a recognised course of maintenance immediately prior to imprisonment will, subject to certain criteria, be facilitated with a continuation of their course.</P>
      <P>These developments at present cater for male prisoners only.  Having regard in particular to the self-contained nature of the health care unit, I am not totally excluding the possibility of providing treatment for female prisoners at this location.  This will, however, depend on the development of the services there and other operational factors.  The plans for the new female prison reflect fully the medical needs of inmates including provision for the treatment of drug addicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I readily acknowledge that close co-operation between Eastern Health Board drug treatment agencies and the prison authorities will be essential to the successful delivery of treatment measures for addicts, both in the prisons and in the community.  Regarding the practical arrangements, the staffing of the unit includes medical and psychiatric personnel who are already active <Col N="1899" /> in this field with the Eastern Health Board.  I am satisfied, therefore, that co-operation will be more than adequate.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>her Department's response to the recommendations of the 1995 Visiting Committee for full implementation of the guidelines on padded cells in the Five Year Management of Offender's Report; if she will respond to the committee's expressed concern at the ambivalence in relation to the conditions for restraint in padded cells; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Governor of Mountjoy prison has already pointed out publicly the urgent practical necessity of putting prisoners in a place of safety where they are not a danger to themselves or others when they start being difficult in prison.  I do not accept there is any ambivalence in this matter.  The guidelines in place for the use of padded cells require all such placements to be reported to the Department of Justice.  They also require the early involvement of a prison doctor where a stay in a padded cell goes on any longer than overnight.  It is simply not practical to call out the doctor every single time the padded cell has to be used, day or night.  On many occasions it has to be used at the prisoner's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The references to the use of padded cells in the Department's Five Year Plan for the Management of Offenders, June 1994, arises in the context of discussion of new prison rules.  On page 119 of the plan document it is indicated that padded or strip cells shall not be used for the confinement of prisoners except where necessary to prevent them injuring themselves or others.  The text goes on to require that the reasons for use of the padded cell shall, in each instance, be recorded and conveyed to <Col N="1900" /> the Department.  This reflects currently observed policy in the prisons.</P>

The compilation of the statistics in respect of 1994 and 1995 is in progress.  However, as I already indicated to the House, I recently decided that the written elements of the reports for those years, which include the main developments in the prisons service, the reports of the Visiting Committees and the various prison services, will be published separately. I plan to have these interim reports ready for publication later this year.  The statistical tables would then be published as soon as possible afterwards.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  They informed me that the area referred to by the Deputy forms part of the community policing initiative in operation in the district, and as part of this there is one garda allocated to the station in question.  The whole area is also covered by mobile patrols.  It is understood that this garda will soon be transferred to another location and the consequential vacancy will be advertised, complete with official accommodation, in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the strength of this station in 1962 was one sergeant and two gardaí and has never exceeded this level.  At present, in addition to the garda serving at the station, one of the three sergeants based at the administrative headquarters has responsibility for policing in the area.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that these policing arrangements are satisfactory but they will keep them under constant review.</P>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the scheme is to provide income support for less well off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and are unable to obtain summer work.  Priority, therefore, is being given to enable the maximum number of eligible low income students to participate within the overall financial allocation of £10.2 million for the 1996 scheme.</P>
      <P>The persons concerned are not affected by the 1993 disqualification of students claiming unemployment assistance and consequently are not eligible for participation in the student summer jobs scheme.  If they are unable to find alternative work they may, subject to a means test, qualify for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 699 and 700 together.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children, including twins, up to 16 years of age and up to 19 years in respect of children who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in the 1996 budget for increasing the grant in respect of the birth of twins to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12.  These new grants are intended to assist with the particular financial pressures arising at birth and as the twins enter primary and secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements in relation to twins were brought into effect from 1 January 1996, and are in addition to the increases being provided in the monthly rates of child benefit.  From September next, the monthly payment will be £29 <Col N="1913" /> in respect of each of the first two children and £34 for the third and subsequent children.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 budget, these rates represent an increase over the last two years of 45 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 36 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of other children.  Further improvements in child benefit will be considered in the light of available resources and within a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Birth grants were made in respect of a total of 609 sets of twins in 1995.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 701, 703, 704, 705, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 725, 729, 735, 736, 737, 742, 743, 744, 745, 748 and 758 together.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the student summer jobs scheme is to provide income support for less well off third level students who are excluded from receiving unemployment assistance under the change in social welfare law in 1993 and are unable to find summer work.  Students who are not disqualified from unemployment assistance by this 1993 exclusion are not eligible for the student summer jobs scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the improvements which I introduced to the scheme in 1995 there was a large growth in the number of students seeking to participate.  While £6 million was allocated in the 1995 budget, the expenditure on the scheme rose to £10 million and the numbers participating rose from 9,000 to almost 16,000.  I received Government sanction to again spend £10 million on this scheme in 1996 and I am satisfied that approximately the same number will participate this year.  In order to ensure the students for whom it is intended actually benefit from this sizeable expenditure, that is, low income third level students who have been denied <Col N="1918" /> unemployment assistance since 1993, it was necessary to strictly adhere to the conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is too early yet to provide reliable statistics on the specific take up of either sponsors or students in this year's scheme.  This information will not be available until later in the year when the vast majority of sponsors will have submitted claims for recoupment of payments made to students.</P>
    <P>The following table is a summary of the number of sponsors in each county who failed to get students for the years 1994 and 1995:</P>

    <P>To qualify for the scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to that which is applied for entitlement to unemployment assistance. The means assessment does not make any allowance for voluntary contributions made to pension schemes.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier and in previous parliamentary questions, the scheme was never intended for students who are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if they cannot find work.  Students in regional technical colleges who have completed a course of study although they may intend to do further courses are not barred from claiming unemployment assistance if they cannot find work and are, therefore, ineligible for the scheme.  Every ineligible student included would squeeze out an eligible needy student with no alternative source of income. Students were excluded in previous years on grounds of ineligibility; this is shown in the table.</P>
    <P>The number of sponsors offering jobs has increased significantly this year so that the individual sponsors such as the sponsor concerned in Dublin 16 may be experiencing greater difficulty in attracting approved students to their projects than they did in 1995.  Each approved student is given a booklet containing a list of all the sponsors.  It is a matter for the students concerned to choose the sponsor, and for the sponsor to accept the student.</P>
    <P>Where we become aware that an approved student has failed on their own initiative to secure a job under the scheme, my Department makes every effort to assist that student in the search for a suitable sponsor.</P>

      <P>The back-to-work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as an integral part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.  This scheme has proved to be a significant success with close to 13,000 persons currently in receipt of the allowance.  An independent evaluation of the scheme has just been completed and the final report shows that it is proving to be a success in encouraging the long-term unemployed to leave the live register and return to work.  A total of 3,767 persons have been approved so far this year for the scheme.</P>
      <P>The jobstart initiative which is aimed at employers was launched by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment at the end of last May.  It is too early to provide statistics on the specific take-up rate of this programme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not affected by the 1993 disqualification on students claiming unemployment assistance and consequently is not eligible for participation in the student summer jobs scheme.

      <P>In the period since January 1995 the MRBI was selected, following a competitive tendering process, to undertake one independent, quantitative research survey for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The main fieldwork was conducted in the period February 1996 to June 1996. The cost of conducting this research by the MRBI amounted to £39,675.  The VAT charge of 21 per cent increased the total payment to £48,006.75</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the research was, through a sample of 1,000 recipients, to obtain an objective assessment of the <Col N="1923" /> nature and levels of service provided to social welfare recipients generally; to highlight areas of service where improvements are required, and, through a sample of 1,000 members of the public, to measure the level of knowledge of and attitudes towards the Department of Social Welfare and its services.</P>
    <P>No surveys undertaken by the Department have included questions in relation to support for political parties.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Act, 1990, provides for compulsory preservation of occupational pensions in respect of post-1991 service.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report referred to the fact that, although many schemes provide for preservation voluntarily in respect of pre-1991 service, many others do not. The recommendation made in the NPB's first report was that the preservation requirement should not be extended to the period before the introduction of the Pensions Act because of the potential cost implications of sudden new requirements on schemes for which advance financial provision would not have been made.  It also indicated that the preservation requirements should be extended to pre-1991 service within a period of ten years of the Pensions Act coming into force.  The NPB also recommended that the statutory Pensions Board should continue to keep this issue under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently wrote to the Pensions Board requesting that a number of issues, including this one, be put on the board's policy agenda and that the <Col N="1924" /> board prepare a report for me on the issue.</P>

      <P>The method of nominating people to the Pensions Board is set down in the Pensions Act, 1990.  I consider the board to be representative of all pension interests, including all members of schemes both active and deferred.</P>
      <P>Under the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1996, which was recently enacted, I provided for an additional two members on the board, both of whom must be trustees of pension schemes, one nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and one nominated by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC.  These representatives jointed the board on 5 July 1996.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board represents a balance of interests between the pension scheme members, employers, trustees and the industry generally.  It provides an excellent forum for the strategic development of pensions policy over its term of office.</P>

      <P>A private occupational pension scheme is an arrangement organised by an employer to provide pensions and/or other benefits to one or more employees on retirement or to surviving dependants on death.  A scheme may be <Col N="1925" /> on a defined benefit or a defined contribution basis.  There is no legal requirement on employers to provide pension benefits or offer a choice of pension benefits to employees under an occupational pension scheme.  It is an entirely voluntary arrangement and, while I agree with the desirability of making schemes as flexible as possible, I have no plans, at present, to change the voluntary aspect of this arrangement.</P>
      <P>I understand employers establishing pension schemes have a wide variety of choice in the types of scheme they may establish and in the pension products on offer.</P>

      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by health boards, is designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. People on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplements may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a means test.  The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of survivors, widows and widowers, contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.  Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1926" /> The person concerned has a total weekly income of £179.10 which is made up of £119.10 deserted wife's benefit, plus £60 maintenance payment which, under the terms of a maintenance order of 3 May 1996, is paid directly to Dublin Corporation in discharge of mortgage payments, including arrears.  The income limit for this scheme for a lone parent family and three children is £124.10 but, as the person has a total income of £179.10, she does not satisfy the means test for receipt of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>

      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by health boards, is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a means test.  The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of survivor's, widow's and widower's, contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.  Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orphan's pension is not considered to be a qualifying payment under the terms <Col N="1927" /> of the back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme.  The orphan's pension, which is a basic social welfare payment, is payable to the guardian and is intended to cover the child's cost of living, including food and clothing.  Eligible applicants will receive either a contributory or non-contributory orphan's pension of up to £42.60 per week.  In comparison, the allowance paid in respect of dependent children with other social welfare or health board payments is either £13.20 or £15.20 per week.  The higher rate of orphan's pension compared to the child dependant allowance rate means that the guardian receives an additional income of up to £1,400 per annum in respect of the orphaned child.</P>

Projects should involve the participants in the running of, and where possible, the design of the project itself.  Priority is given to projects aimed at developing the skill and expertise of individuals in setting up and running projects in their communities; groups in disadvantaged <Col N="1932" /> areas; projects aimed at specially disadvantaged groups, and new projects establishing themselves in their communities.</P>

      <Quest>whether the figure of £5.7 million contained in his reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 23 and 48 on Thursday, 20 June 1996 represents an estimate by his Department of potential claims for arrears from recipients of retirement pensions, old age contributory pensions and widows/widowers contributory pensions who applied late for their pension to which they were entitled by virtue of contributions paid but did not receive payment due to provisions currently in operation governing the payment of arrears of social welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 205 (2) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, provides for regulatory powers to disqualify a person from payment of arrears if they do not claim within the prescribed time.  These powers are provided for in Articles 102, 104 and 105 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Payments Provisions) Regulations, 1994, as laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in December 1994.  I am satisfied these regulations are being interpreted correctly.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, is designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. People on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplements may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a means test.  The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of survivor's &mdash; widow's and widower's &mdash; contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.  Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> The person in question qualified for the allowance in 1995 as the income criteria for the scheme was satisfied at that time.  The person now has a total weekly income of £171 &mdash; £119 from earnings plus £52 family income supplement.  The income limit for this scheme for 1996 for a woman with two children is £107.10.

      <P>As I indicated in my replies to Question No. 123 on 6 June 1996, Question No. 268 on 18 June 1996 and Questions Nos. 21 and 37 on 20 June 1996 one of the special recommendations of the special task force on security for the elderly was that my Department introduce a £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary groups in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.  Subsequently I established an advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the St. Vincent de Paul, the Irish Association for Victim Support, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána are represented, to devise a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted at the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.</P>
      <P>The scheme, entitled a scheme of community support for older people was advertised on 29 May 1996 in the national newspapers.  The scheme is open to any voluntary or community based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people.  The scheme is being administered in each of my Department's regions with the aid of a regional advisory committee which mirrors the composition of the national advisory committee referred to above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deadline for receipt of applications was 28 June 1996.  This was to allow time for my Department to assess all applications and to ensure that those most at risk benefit from the available <Col N="1939" /> funds before the onset of winter.  On the advice of the advisory committee which I established, I have decided that all applications on hand should be processed with a view to making grants as soon as possible to eligible groups.  To date a total number of 303 applications have been received nation-wide on behalf of a total of 4,597 individuals and 17 applications have been approved for grant-aid, benefiting 429 individuals.  My Department will take a flexible attitude to late applications, is continuing to accept applications, subject to availability of funds.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  Under present arrangements, only one allowance is payable per carer.  The carer's allowance has been improved and expanded progressively since it was first introduced in 1990.  In 1995, for example, the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further improved with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipients of occupational pensions.  Last month, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 to £67.50 which represents an 8 per cent increase on last year's rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also announced last month the introduction of new regulations which change the basis of assessment of means of carers for the purpose of determining <Col N="1940" /> entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance.  As a result of these changes, carers who are receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements from the health boards stand to benefit by as much as £29 per week. The new regulations also mean that some applicants who previously failed to qualify on the basis of their means will now be in a position to qualify for the allowance.  The question of introducing further improvements such as in respect of carers who are looking after two or more persons is one of a number of issues which will be considered in the context of a review of the carer's allowance which is currently under way.</P>

      <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant has an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA.  This legislation provides for the payment, subject to certain conditions, of a weekly or monthly supplement, including rent and mortgage interest supplements.  Executive functions in relation to the administration of the SWA scheme lie with the chief executive officers of the eight regional health boards.  The question of entitlement to any of the allowances or supplements in individual cases is determined by the health board in accordance with the legislation and taking account of the circumstances of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> Were the health boards to introduce a system of controls and quotas as suggested by the Deputy, this would remove the freedom of choice as to where people reside and may have consitutional implications.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might wish to note that a housing review group was set up in September 1994 under the aegis of my Department to examine rent and mortgage interest supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This group recommended in its report, which was presented to me in December 1995, that &ldquo;an integrated approach to the assessment of housing need and the allocation of housing resources should be adopted within a single legislative framework&rdquo;.  Following the publication of this housing review group report, an inter-departmental committee under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, and with representatives from the Departments of Health, Social Welfare, and Finance, was established.  The purpose of this committee is to make recommendations to Government as to how the proposal in the Programme For Government, A Government of Renewal, which contains a commitment that &ldquo;all forms of social housing assistance will be administered by the local authority&rdquo;, can be carried out.  The work of the committee is to examine the main issues arising from the proposed transfer of the administration of rent and mortgage supplementation to the local authorities.  This committee will report to the Government in due course.</P>

      <Quest>whether, in view of the considerable increase by Dublin Corporation of hot water/heating charges to tenants from October 1996, tenants in flat blocks who previously did not qualify for a fuel allowance from his Department will qualify in future provided they meet normal criteria and pay over £8 per week for heating charges.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist qualified householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week &mdash; £8 in smokeless zones &mdash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.  Not all recipients of social welfare payments are entitled to a fuel allowance.  Since 1987, fuel allowance has not been paid to tenants of communally heated dwellings such as Ballymun Flats and St. Michael's estate because subsidised heating was provided by Dublin Corporation. As the local authority tenant was considered to be in a more favourable position than a person providing their own heating needs with the assistance of a free fuel allowance, the local authority tenant did not qualify for the allowance.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated 20 May 1996, Dublin Corporation informed my Department that as and from 1 July 1996 the corporation would no longer be subsidising tenants' heating costs.  In a letter of reply dated 22 May 1996, my Department sought information from Dublin Corporation.  No reply was received to the letter from my Department.  In a telephone conversation with Dublin Corporation, initiated by my Department arising from the Deputy's question, my Department was informed that the subsidy would be removed as from 14 October 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Deputy raising this issue as the decision was taken by Dublin Corporation without consultation with my Department.  I am totally opposed to the proposal.  The proposal is based on the assumption that every tenant on social welfare or health board payments would qualify for the fuel allowance and this assumption is not correct as entitlement is based on a means test.  The removal of the subsidy will have financial implications for all families on social welfare and low pay including those who would qualify for the fuel allowance as it is unlikely that <Col N="1943" /> the fuel allowance would fully compensate for the increased heating charges. The fuel allowance is not of course payable to persons in work and on low pay.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is currently available to employees on low earnings with children.  The person referred to by the Deputy was in receipt of FIS while her spouse was claiming her as an adult dependant on his unemployment assistance payment.  Social welfare legislation precludes this situation and the FIS claimant was notified as soon as the full details of the case became known.  If the family income supplement payable to her was less than the adult dependant allowance it would not be of benefit to her to forego the adult dependant allowance.  FIS is designed to encourage unemployed people with families to take up work as opposed to claiming unemployment payments.  The concurrent payment of unemployment assistance and FIS would, therefore, be inconsistent with the purpose of FIS.  Since taking office, I have consistently improved the provisions governing FIS.  The 1996 budget increased the family income limits by <Col N="1945" /> £10 thereby ensuring that most recipients will receive an increase of £6 per week.  Other improvements in FIS announced in this year's budget includes a reduction, from six to three months, in the minimum period which the employment is expected to last; a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify for FIS, from 20 hours per week to thirty eight hours per fortnight; the extension of FIS to jobsharers and increasing the rate of FIS payable on the birth of a child, rather than awaiting the annual review of the entitlement.  In addition, this year's Social Welfare Act provides for a further improvement which allows people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more to retain entitlement to increases for children payable at the full rate, for a period of up to 13 weeks on taking up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks. This improvement will alleviate the difficulties encountered by some families during the period between the termination of their unemployment payment and the award of FIS.  This initiative is designed to complement the support provided by FIS for low paid workers. FIS is kept under constant review by my Department with a view to introducing further changes designed to assist families with children in low paid employment. Further improvements must, however, be made in the light of available resources and in a budgetary context.</P>

This gap in his insurance is the reason his yearly average contribution level was insufficient to qualify him for a contributory old age pension.  His insurance contributions between 1946 and 1953 cannot be used in determining his entitlement to pension.  As the person concerned has indicated that he was employed in his family business between 1953 and 1986 his entitlement to a contributory old age pension is being reviewed.  A local officer will call to him shortly to determine his employment status for this period, to inspect insurance records of the family business and to determine the insurability of his employment in the family firm.  When this examination is completed, his eligibility to pension will be reviewed and he will be notified of the results as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course covered for widow's, widower's and ophan's pensions.</P>
      <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension. Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, <Col N="1949" /> costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period. Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding year's contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on any basis including a lump sum payment would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> puts forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.  However, they also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 &mdash; three years &mdash; to 520 &mdash; ten years &mdash; contributions.  The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present.  While I, in principle, favour a <i>pro rata</i> pension approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

These arrangements were introduced when social insurance pension coverage was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and were in line with recommendations made at that time by the National Pensions Board.</P>
      <P>Contributions payable by self-employed people also include cover for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions, entitlement to which does not require entry to insurance prior to age 56.  The question of refunding that element of the contribution does not therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>In September 1995 a World Trade Organisation dispute settlement panel was established to examine claims by the European Community, Canada and US that the Japanese liquor tax system discriminated against imported spirits and liqueurs by applying lower tax rates to domestically produced &ldquo;Shochu&rdquo;.  The European Community argued that the Japanese system contravened Article III.2 of the GATT 1994 by applying higher internal tax rates to imports of &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;directly competitive or substitutable products&rdquo;, thus discriminating in favour of, and affording protection to, domestic products.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions, the provision of tourist accommodation is a matter for the tourism industry and depends primarily on individual operators commercial judgment as to the manner in which to respond to levels of demand.  The industry has responded well to market forces and <Col N="1953" /> there has been a steady expansion in tourism accommodation, especially in recent years.  All registered and approved tourism accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. A sum of £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country, virtually all of which is now committed to projects.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, was recently introduced under the &ldquo;Peace and Reconciliation Fund&rdquo;.  Investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in the 15 resort areas, including Bundoran, County Donegal, designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism provides assistance for accommodation in very specific circumstances &mdash; for specialist accommodation at recognised outdoor pursuit centres, branded walking routes and at approved residential equestrian centres.  I understand that the agriculture rural development and forestry operational programme and the Leader programme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and the local urban and rural development operational programme under which, <i>inter alia</i>, the Department of Enterprise and Employment's county enterprise partnership boards operate, also offer limited assistance for accommodation.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 773, 781 and 794 together.  It is difficult to assess precisely the overall impact of the recent disturbances in Northern Ireland on tourism performance this year and potentially for 1997 but Bord Fáilte's ongoing monitoring shows that, in those markets where inquiry levels dropped in the immediate aftermath of the incidents, they recovered quickly following successful advertising campaigns.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is continuing to closely monitor the situation in association with key carriers, tour operators and product suppliers.  Appropriate strategies to deal with situations such as this have already been considered by Bord Fáilte and the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative who, notwithstanding the latest disturbances, will continue to promote and sell Ireland as vigorously as possible in overseas markets, having regard to available funds.  Bord Fáilte still anticipates growth from all of the principal overseas markets in 1996 and the target set for overall growth in visitor numbers is 10 per cent.  Bord Fáilte considers that this target is achievable and this is borne out by the most recently available statistics from the Central Statistics Office for the period January to March 1996 which were up 11 per cent over the same period in 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 774 and 792 together.  The evidence available indicates that Irish exporters generally are maintaining UK market share, and are now more effectively utilising currency hedging mechanisms in administering their UK transactions. For example, An Bord Tráchtála's most recent quarterly estimate of indigenous exports to the UK market is 10 per cent increase over the corresponding first quarter of 1995, and this at a time when the UK economy generally was growing very slowly.  An Bord Tráchtála has established a sterling market task force which has already contacted almost 250 indigenous companies with high dependence on the UK.  The task force is now concentrating its main efforts on a small group of 21 companies experiencing difficulties in that market and assisting them in seeking new business opportunities or new customers in new market segments.</P>

      <P>I believe that the best approach is to ensure that membership of the approved sector continues to offer distinct advantages to operators over the unapproved.  At present only approved operators have access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the tourist information offices, to tax breaks and to other subsidised finance schemes.  The pilot tax relief scheme for the tourist resort area and <Col N="1957" /> the subsidised tourism loan schemes were also carefully designed so that only approved operators would be eligible. Unapproved operators are already obliged to comply in the same way as the approved sector with requirements, for example in the areas of taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene.  I am hopeful that, backed by this approach, the associations which have been recognised, following the restructuring of Bord Fáilte, for the purpose of approving the B and B sector will be successful in their drives to increase their membership.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 777, 778 and 779 together. Bord Fáilte, which is overseeing the creation of a new tourism brand for Ireland has reported that considerable progress is being made on the project. A partnership forum was organised by Bord Fáilte on the 24 October 1995 to give leading figures in the tourism industry an opportunity to hear the results of research carried out in the interim on international consumer perspectives of Ireland and to debate further steps in the development of the brand image.  It was agreed that Bord Fáilte would continue, under the aegis <Col N="1958" /> of an advisory group led by Bord Fáilte's International Marketing Director, to develop brand positioning proposals and communications strategy.</P>
      <P>Peter Owens-DDB Needham, an Irish company affiliated to International Advertising Consultants, has now been selected to undertake the development of the advertising creative for the Ireland brand.  Design Works, an Irish company, has been chosen to develop the visual identity/logo.  Bord Fáilte envisages that the new creative and design work will be completed during the autumn and that the brand will be ready for launching in our international markets at the end of this year.  The recent disturbances in Northern Ireland have not impacted on the development of the brand image.  Approximately £250,000 has been expanded to date on the new tourism brand but Bord Fáile is projecting total expenditure of the order £3 million to £5 million on brand development including marketing research, design and image costs etc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 782 and 788 together.  I confirm that following the failure of the open competition to produce a satisfactory proposal, the named organisation has written on a number of occasions since January seeking to be included in an alternative strategy, to secure a conference centre for Dublin under the present tourism operational programme. This strategy involves the possibility of a higher European Regional Development Fund rate which may apply to capital developments by public or similar bodies.</P>
      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy's specific reference is to a letter written by the organisation in May 1996 indicating that it was proposing to develop a centre on a joint-venture basis with a named voluntary organisation and local authority. I decided to ask Bord Fáilte to assess the possible suitability of this proposal for inclusion in the alternative strategy. I understand that in the event Bord Fáilte received no details of the proposal within the given deadline, subsequently twice extended, and so were not in a position to carry out an assessment as requested.  Consequently, there was no basis on which the organisation's proposal could be deemed eligible for inclusion in the alternative strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 783 and 796 together.  The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission in July 1994, proposed that with the support of the European Regional Development Fund, a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates be built in Dublin.  Under the open tendering competition, which terminated last January, proposals were invited in relation to sites within ten kilometres distance from the city centre. The first EU Operational Programme for Tourism (1989-93) had designated Dublin as the most suitable location for a national conference centre.  This view was endorsed in an independent study in 1991 on the feasibility of such a centre on the basis that Dublin, as the capital city, has entry points from most major markets by sea or air; a significantly greater concentration and range of suitable accommodation than other areas, and all the necessary support services for a major international conference centre.</P>

      <P>There have been suggestions along lines referred to by the Deputy, including one made in writing to me <Col N="1961" /> from the organisation named by the Deputy.  However, the objective is to provide in Dublin an international conference centre capable of enabling Ireland to increase its share of the lucrative, but very competitive, international market for conference business. Accordingly, the Government is seeking a developer who will take responsibility not only for construction but also for operational viability for any proposed national conference centre, a criterion reflected both in the terms of reference for the defunct open tendering competition, and subsequently in criteria being applied by Bord Fáilte in assessment for the purpose of identifying a possible alternative strategy to secure the project under the current operational programme.</P>

      <P>The organisation named by the Deputy was party to one of 13 applications considered under the open tendering competition for the development of a national conference centre which terminated last January because no applicant, including the organisation in question, was within the parameters set out in the project invitation document. The organisation in question subsequently came forward with a new proposal based on a joint venture with a named voluntary organisation and local authority.  Bord Fáilte was asked to contact the organisation with a view to assessing suitability of this new proposal for inclusion in a possible alternative strategy, to secure a conference centre for Dublin under the present tourism operational programme.  This strategy involves the possibility of the higher <Col N="1962" /> European Regional Development Fund rate which may apply to capital developments by public or similar bodies.  It is understood that because the organisation was unable to confirm, in broad terms, outline details of the proposed joint venture, within a twice extended deadline set by Bord Fáilte, which is responsible for the assessment of individual proposals, the board was not in a position to proceed with the assessment process as requested.  Advance planning permission is not a prerequisite for applying for grant assistance under any measure in the tourism operational programme. However, grant approvals in relation to all capital developments under the operational programme, including the conference centre project, are explicitly made subject, <i>inter alia</i>, to any necessary statutory planning permissions from the local authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 786, 789, 790 and 795 together.  The Deputy will recall my informing the House last January of the conclusion of the independent product management board that none of the applicants from stage 1 of the open tendering competition, including the organisation named by the Deputy, were prepared to participate in the development and operation of a national conference centre within the parameters set out in the project invitation document.  This effectively terminated the competition.</P>
      <P>The product management board recommended that the strategy be reconsidered with a view to developing an alternative, including the possibility of a public sector option.  I accordingly decided, with Government approval, to ask Bord Fáilte to pursue further an earlier outline proposal from the RDS which as a voluntary society could possibly qualify for the higher aid rate available for public or similar bodies, but on the basis that their proposal would operate without annual subsidy from the Exchequer or any other external source such as licensed casino activity.  Assessment of this proposal by Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the product management board, is now, I understand, practically complete.  Once confirmation of their conclusions is available I will consider them with a view to referral to Government for decision before formal submission, if appropriate, to the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission must give final approval before any offer of grant aid for the purpose of developing the national conference centre can be made. Accordingly, the Commission is being kept briefed on the process including being made aware of a proposal from <Col N="1964" /> the organisation named by the Deputy for a joint venture with a named voluntary organisation and local authority, the subject of another reply today to the Deputy.  No submission seeking approval for any specific proposal, inclusive of the related issue of aid rates, has yet been made to the Commission. I am not aware of any EU plans for studies in respect of the issue other than their requirement that any request for approval must be accompanied by an independent cost benefit analysis of the project.  A timeframe for completion of the national conference centre project cannot be finalised until the approval process, inclusive of negotiations with the EU, are complete.</P>

      <P>The promoters of the <i>Tour de France</i> are seeking funding amounting to £2 million from the Exchequer to allow them to start the 1998 tour in Ireland.  While supportive in principle of the proposal, the scale of financial assistance required is unfortunately beyond the resources of my Department's Vote.  Accordingly I am in contact with other Government Ministers whose areas of responsibility stand to gain from the promotional opportunities offered by the proposal.  I am awaiting their views as to how the necessary funds might be secured before proceeding with further consideration of the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 800, 816 and 820 together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill refers, in her questions, to redundancy payments due to former Irish Steel employees.  There are no outstanding redundancy payments due to former employees of Irish Steel Ltd.  All employees made redundant by Irish Steel Ltd. received their redundancy payments in full on leaving the company. The Deputy may have in mind the question of readaptation aid from the EU, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty.  As the Deputies are aware, my Department received a communication from the EU Commission confirming that the Commission has approved grant aid, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, amounting to ECU 376,806 for 194 workers made redundant in 1994-5.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has been advised that their pre-conditions for the release of the readaptation aid have been met, now that the State aid, which was approved by the EU, has been paid to the company on completion of the sale on 30 May 1996.  My Department is seeking an early decision by the Commission, therefore, to release the readptation aid.  My Department has also asked that this readaptation aid be paid to the eligible former employees in a lump sum.  We await clarification from the Commission on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe refers to 200 workers in his question.  As I have indicated previously, my Department initially applied for readaptation aid in respect of 205 workers in Irish Steel Ltd. as a result of the 1994 rationalisation plan.  This figure was ultimately revised to 194 to take account of workers who did not actually receive redundancy payments such as apprentices, workers who terminated their employment but were not made redundant, workers scheduled for redundancy but subsequently retained and a small number <Col N="1969" /> of additional redundancies.  I am aware of the concern of the former workers regarding this matter and officials from my Department met with representatives of the former workers in June to outline the current situation.  It was brought to the attention of my Department, only last month, that the list of eligible workers as supplied by Irish Steel Ltd. and subsequently forwarded by my Department to the Commission was incomplete.  Following correspondence with Irish Ispat Ltd. &mdash; formerly Irish Steel Ltd. &mdash; an additional list of employees made redundant during the period was forwarded to my Department. The eligibility of these additional workers will, however be an additional matter for decision by the Commission.</P>

      <P>Trading at the side of the road is regulated by the Casual Trading Act, 1995, which came into force on 1 May last.  The primary purpose of this Act is to achieve greater decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation of casual trading by local authorities than was possible under the less flexible regime provided by the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  The principal reforms contained in the 1995 Act are to devolve the licensing function from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the local authorities and to provide for social welfare requirements with respect to the issue of casual trading licences; to provide for the use of by-laws by the local authorities as the method of regulating and controlling casual trading, thus facilitating greater flexibility and efficiency in regulating casual trading; to limit the list of casual trading activities excluded from the scope of regulation under the 1980 Act to (i) selling by a licensed auctioneer; (ii) door-to-door selling and (iii) charity sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 2 (4) of the Act local authorities are empowered to exempt categories of trading previously exempted under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, or to exempt any new categories of trading they may decide are appropriate for their own areas.  I understand that some local authorities are at present drafting by-laws while others have advertised their proposed by-laws and sought submissions on same as required by section 6 of the Act, before adoption.  The question of such trading causing a traffic hazard is a matter <Col N="1972" /> for the Garda to deal with, in consultation with the local authorities if necessary.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 132 on 14 December 1995 (Official Report, Vol. 459, columns 1889 to 1891).  Reference to the case is also made in the Companies Report for the year ended 31 December 1995 (Pn 2808) which was published earlier this month.  A full review of all aspects of this matter took place under my direction early in 1995. Following the completion of this review and the taking of legal advice, I determined that no useful purpose would be served by my pursuing the matter further under the company law code. My decision at that time was made with considerable reluctance having regard to the unfortunate circumstances of the case.  There have been no developments in the interim which would justify a review of my earlier decision.</P>

      <P>Ireland was a competitor for the LG Group investment at the outset and IDA Ireland hosted visits and had detailed negotiations with several top level delegations from the company and its advisors.  In April 1996, I with the Chief Executive of IDA Ireland and the Irish Ambassador to Korea visited LG Group in Seoul and had discussions with senior officials at the company in relation to the project.  At that time I took the opportunity to support IDA's efforts to promote Ireland as a location for the company's overseas investments and also to endorse the benefits of the Government's ongoing pro-business policies.</P>
      <P>As I have pointed out in the past a variety of factors come into play in the decisions of foreign companies as to where to locate particular projects. Incentive packages and access to markets are some of the many factors which influence this choice.  I understand, too, that proximity to a local market could have been a factor of some significance for certain high volume-low value products within the overall package.  In the final analysis, of course, decisions as to where to locate overseas manufacturing operations rest with the owners of companies themselves and are beyond the control of IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case it must also be borne in mind that LG Group already has large scale manufacturing facilities <Col N="1974" /> in the UK, successfully producing a range of consumer goods.  Hence the company had a high level of comfort with a UK location.  The attraction of inward investment is a very competitive business and Ireland has had an extremely successful track record in attracting new projects.  In 1995, a total of 22 electronic and software projects, with an employment potential of almost 7,000 jobs, were approved by IDA Ireland.  To date in 1996, a total of 18 electronic and software projects, with an employment potential of more than 3,800 jobs, have been approved.  I am confident that Ireland remains competitive and will continue to win high tech projects against very strong competition from many sources.</P>

      <P>Expansion of production capacity over a number of years has brought about overcapacity in the sawmilling industry putting pressure on limited supplies of logs and forcing log prices up.  In addition, the sector is currently experiencing problems due to very competitive timber pricing on the Irish market, a sluggish UK market with increased imports from Eastern Europe and a fall-off in demand for and prices of sawmill residues.  My Department is in ongoing consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in relation to issues of concern to the forestry and downstream processing sectors.  The issue of log supply and pricing has been the subject of discussions between all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>A framework for a new timber sales regime has been drawn up to address this issue.  This framework was agreed between Coillte and the Irish Timber Council in March 1996.  Since then various meetings have taken place to have the new system agreed by the end of 1996.  I understand that satisfactory progress is being made in this regard.  The problems outlined above have contributed to the recent redundancies in the sector.  I am advised, however, that no significant investment has taken place in the mills in question over the past ten years and that even in the event of lower log prices and an improvement in market conditions it is unlikely that these mills could survive in the long term without significant investment. The Deputy may be assured that I and my Department will continue to monitor developments in the sector in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry where appropriate.  Forbairt will continue to provide assistance to sawmills for research and the development of new products and added value activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 810, 811, 812 and 813 together.  On 16 July 1996, I made an order entitled Proposed Merger or Take-over Prohibition (Amendment) Order, 1996 (S.I. No. 214 of 1996) which I laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The effect of that order is to prohibit the proposed merger on take-over involving Statoil Ireland Limited and Conoco Ireland Limited except on certain conditions stipulated in the instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the retail motor fuel market that will take shape as a result of my Order will give rise to healthy competition based on price.  Under the original proposal, I have well founded concerns that the market would become <Col N="1978" /> overly concentrated in the hands of big multinationals and that the consumer would lose out.  I am satisfied that the revised proposal significantly reduces market concentration and that we will see ongoing price competition to the motorists benefit.  The revised proposal will see the new Statoil market share reduced to just below 20 per cent, compared with over 25 per cent in the original proposal, and Maxol's market share increase to some 15 per cent.  As a result of my decision in this matter, there will now be five major players in the motor fuels market in the State &mdash; Esso, Statoil, Shell, Texaco and Maxol &mdash; compared with three previously.</P>
    <P>I asked the Competition Authority for their advice on receipt of the revised proposal.  The Authority did not assess it in detail as they regarded the procedure of amending my February order as a matter for me as Minister.  They did, however, point to their unease as expressed in their report on the original proposal.  As I set out in my order of 16 July 1996, I consider that the exigencies of the common good do not warrant the continued absolute prohibition of the take-over and that it would be unlikely to operate against the common good if effected on the conditions stipulated. Statoil will be obliged to provide me with satisfactory evidence of its having complied with those conditions.  In so far as weakness in the law are concerned, it would, generally, be inappropriate for me to comment or draw conclusions on foot of one individual case. I will, however, make my views on the general need for changes in merger legislation known to the competition and mergers review group that I will establish shortly.  Their report will form a basis for examining changes in competition and merger law.</P>

IDA Ireland is also co-operating with the West Tipperary Enterprise Group in the production of a suitable promotional brochure and is hopeful that, with the present level of interest in the facility, and the assistance of the West Tipperary Enterprise Group and local authorities, a replacement industry for Tipperary town will be found.

      <P>The throughput of cattle at Irish slaughtering facilities for the period 1 January to 29 June 1996 was 1.8 per cent less than that of last year.  While throughput at the height of the BSE crisis was down 60 per cent on the corresponding period last year, in recent weeks it has stabilised with throughput for the four weeks in June this year up by 12 per cent on last year. A proportion of those employed in the beef processing and by-products sectors were laid off at the beginning of this crisis.  However, the levels of permanent full-time and part-time directly-employed staff are, for the most part, back to normal with a maximum variance of 5 per cent on comparable figures for last year.  The further processing sector has also substantially recovered the direct employment lost due to the BSE crisis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 825, 898 and 899 together.  Since 20 March, I have visited Russia and Libya.  A successful promotional visit to Russia took place from 28 to 29 May 1996.  I was accompanied on the visit by officials of my Department, an assistant secretary and my private secretary.  I was also accompanied on the visit by the Director of International Markets from An Bord Bia.  I travelled to Libya on 16 July for discussions with the Libyan authorities on the re-opening of the live cattle and beef trade between Ireland and Libya.  The Libyan authorities undertook to send a technical delegation to Ireland in advance of placing the autumn tender for the supply of live cattle and beef to Libya.  It was also agreed that following the lifting of the ban priority would be given to Irish supplies. It is anticipated that the delegation will come to Ireland in the August-September period.  I was accompanied on the visit by an assistant secretary, a deputy chief veterinary officer, my private secretary, the agricultural attaché at the Rome Embassy which is accredited to Libya and an officer from An Bord Bia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promotional visits to non-EU countries on Irish beef have not been undertaken by the Taoiseach since 20 March 1996.  However, political interventions have been made by the Taoiseach with the political leaders in a number of third countries.  Many of the issues and concerns raised by importing countries in regard to the recent BSE crisis are technical. The full resources of my Department, the Diplomatic Service and An Bord Bia are continuing to address these concerns and providing the necessary reassurances to all importing countries on the safety of Irish cattle and beef.  The question of promotional visits to third country markets is kept under <Col N="1985" /> constant review and I am prepared to make further visits should this prove necessary.</P>

      <P>The direct costs to the Exchequer to date as a result of the BSE crisis, have been related to Border controls and to the provision of financial assistance to the rendering industry. Given the initial effects of the crisis on the rendering industry, temporary financial assistance of £2.5 million was provided to subsidise storage costs for meat and bonemeal up to 21 May to provide time to finalise the commercial arrangements for the collection, treatment and disposal of offal.  The cost of the Border controls mounted to ensure that the export prohibition of 27 March banning all UK beef exports is effective is about £350,000 per week and to date amounts to about £6 million.  This operation is implemented primarily by the Garda, backed up by the Customs Service and my Department.  As the Deputy is aware the EU is providing £70 million to compensate beef producers for losses due to the crisis.  Payments of this aid will commence in September.</P>

      <P>No such regulations exist.  The Protection of Animals Act, 1911, which is enforced by the Garda Síochána, prescribes that persons shall be guilty of an offence of cruelty if they over-ride, over-drive over-load any animal, including a horse.  As indicated in the House on 29 May, provision has been made in the Control of Horses Bill, 1996, for a major recasting of section 1 (1) of the Act to include conviction on indictment in the case of offences of cruelty.  The Bill provides for maximum penalties for cruelty to animals as follows: on summary conviction, a fine of £1,500 or six months imprisonment or both; on conviction on indictment, a fine of £10,000 or two years imprisonment or both.</P>

      <P>The current round of Structural Funds under the Community Support Framework for Ireland will operate until the end of 1999.  While the Government is monitoring all aspects relating to Ireland's position as a beneficiary of Structural Funds after 1999, it would not be appropriate to <Col N="1997" /> speculate at this stage on what the likely outcome of the negotiations for the post-1999 period will be.  Nonetheless, it can be taken that Ireland will continue to benefit from Structural Funds after 1999.  The Government's strategy in the negotiations will be to secure the best deal for Ireland so as to enable us to maintain and build on our achievements to date.  As in this Round, the aim, in relation to agriculture, will be to target the measures at the farmers most in need e.g. higher rates of grant for smaller farmers for capital investment. Following an independent evaluation, I am also examining the Compensatory Headage Payments Scheme to see how it can be better targeted at the smaller farmer.</P>
      <P>I would also underline that since the 1992 CAP reform, the emphasis has moved from market support to direct payments to producers and these payments, which are additional to Structural Funds, are biased in favour of the small and medium sized farmer.  For example, on cattle and sheep farms under 10 hectares, direct income support, including compensatory allowances under the Structural Funds, accounted for 58 per cent and 87 per cent, respectively, of family farm income in 1994.  In addition to direct income support there is also a series of measures in place to tackle the underlying structural weaknesses that give rise to persistent low farm incomes in certain sectors of the agricultural economy. The range of measures include incentives to encourage land transfer under the Farm Retirement Scheme, one of the CAP Reform Accompanying Measures.  The release of land to a younger generation of farmers is intended to increase farm size and in turn improve the efficiency and economic viability of existing smaller holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of part time farming is particularly evident among small scale farmers which indicates that these farmers are augmenting on-farm incomes with off-farm jobs.  This trend is likely to continue and it is in this context that I <Col N="1998" /> see rural development initiatives like LEADER as being increasingly important in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 852 and 853 together. The areas of the country which will be proposed for reclassification as extremely severely handicapped are being selected at present.  The criteria being used include the presence of a high proportion of extremely poor land which could be described as rough grazing land, and also the presence of excessive climatic conditions such as higher levels of rainfall and windspeed than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The selection of the specific areas is being facilitated by the use of satellite imagery, which helps to clearly define the boundaries of rough grazing land. This exercise is almost completed and a proposal will be forwarded to the EU Commission in the very near future. The Commission will need time to examine the proposal before commencing the approval procedures, but I would expect that the areas will be announced in time for the 1997 headage schemes.  I cannot comment on specific areas which may or may not be in the proposal in advance of approval by the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced arrangements for the payment of the BSE compensation package which was agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers at the end of last month.  The package which is worth a total of some £70 million to Irish producers involves a top-up of £22.40 in the 1995 suckler cow premium and £19.08 in the 1995 special beef premium.  These payments will be subsequently adjusted upwards or downwards to take account of actual numbers qualifying under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, the package includes a special allocation of £13.3 million to compensate those producers who have suffered most severely because of the BSE crisis.  Following an analysis of losses incurred in the various sectors and having given careful consideration to the views and recommendations of the farming organisations, I have now decided on the following approach for the payment of this allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A flat rate payment of £50 per head <Col N="2000" /> will be paid on steers and young bulls slaughtered in licensed export premises and steers exported to non-EU countries between 25 March and 9 June, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme.  In the case of live exports the compensation will be limited to 90 steers per applicant in order to target those who have suffered losses and minimise the possibility of paying compensation to dealers.</P>
    <P>A flat rate payment of £50 will also be paid on heifers slaughtered in licensed export premises and local abattoirs during the period 25 March &mdash; 29 June.  The slaughter period has been extended by three weeks for this category due to a backlog of heifers overhanging the market in June.  Herdowners who submit applications for compensation for more than 40 heifers slaughtered in domestic abattoirs must provide evidence of ownership before 25 March.  As in the case of live exports the purpose of this condition is to avoid dealers getting windfall gains from the compensation package.</P>
    <P>I believe that the approach being adopted in the payment of the compensation package is balanced and is designed to assist those most affected by the crisis.  Payment of this package will commence in September and must be completed by 15 October, the end of the current EU financial year.  The EU Commission have indicated that the compensation package has been designed to cover losses for this year and accordingly, there is no provision for additional payments later this year. However I have secured the continuation of the deseasonalisation premium for 1977.  This premium will be payable on steers slaughtered at export plants in the first half of 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 855, 856 and 857 together.  Under revised monitoring and control procedures implemented by my Department recently, compliance checks are required to ensure that farmers have completed the specific works outlined during the first year of the plan before second year payments can be made.  Some delays have occurred in processing second year payments mainly due to industrial action in the Department's local offices.  The dispute has now been resolved and measures are being taken to clear any backlog that has occurred.  This resulted in a four month processing delay in County Clare.</P>
      <P>In County Clare 317 participants are awaiting their first instalment under the REP scheme and 50 participants are awaiting a second instalment under the scheme.  To date one compliance check has been carried out on second year applicants in the county.  The number of organic farmers who have been approved for second year payment is ten.</P>

      <P>While I do not have statutory responsibility for the sawmilling sector, I maintain regular contact with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, in relation to issues arising in the sector.  In so far as the sale and supply of timber from Coillte Teoranta is concerned, the position is that these are matters for Coillte Teoranta to pursue in the context of its commercial mandate, as contained in the 1988 Forestry Act.</P>
      <P>I indicated to this House on 25 June, 1996, in response to Parliamentary Question No. 296, that a new timber sales regime is now being negotiated by Coillte Teoranta and the Irish Timber Council, the representative body of Irish sawmillers.  I remain convinced that the implementation of the proposed new sales regime will enable the Irish sawmilling sector to move forward and gain new markets at home and abroad.</P>

    <P>A parcel of some 4.997 hectares of the land disposed of on 1 May 1996 was originally approved in 1989 for allotment to an adjoining landowner but was refused by him.  A subsequent legal dispute over possession precluded the letting of the land and the Land Commission received no income from the land while this dispute was in progress. The parcel was offered for sale by tender in January 1994 in an effort to establish the level and extent of interest in it. Under the conditions of the invitation to tender the Land Commission was not bound to accept the highest or any tender. In the event none of the tenders was successful and the land was subsequently allotted to a full-time, qualified farmer from an adjoining farm who was regarded as the most suitable applicant from the point of view of age, agricultural qualifications and the proximity of his parent holding.  The decision on allotment was made by the Land Commissioners. Every effort will be made to expedite disposal of the 0.306 hectares remaining on this estate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 867, 868, 869 and 879 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 174 of 13 June 1995, area aid under the EU arable support system is confined, in the case of peas, to those peas which are harvested in a dry state.  Vining peas, which are harvested at a green stage, and which are subjected to mechanical dehydration are not eligible for area aid.</P>
      <P>Following representations by the company concerned, I raised the matter with Commissioner Fischler, seeking inclusion of vining peas in the aid system. The Commissioner explained, in a detailed written response, the reasons why vining peas were excluded from the area aid system.  These were that: as vining peas had never been covered by a previous support regime, payment of compensatory aid under CAP reform was not justified as was the case with cereals and other eligible arable crops for which previous price supports were either reduced or abolished; the inclusion of vining peas in the arable support system would create distortions in the market and had been opposed by producers in the major production regions of the EU; and the introduction of an end use obligation such as dehydration would jeopardise the protected status of arable area payments under the GATT Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have not received a specific request to meet the Managing Director of the company in question, he did meet with senior officials of my Department, following which I raised the matter with <Col N="2010" /> Commissioner Fischler.  While the nature of the response from the Commissioner does not indicate any real prospects of having EU policy in this regard changed, I would be happy to see further discussions take place with the Managing Director to see whether a basis exists for a further approach to the Commission.</P>

    <P>Of the total amount of £5,394,342, £3,076,847 relates to the provision of <Col N="2011" /> grading and storage facilities and £2,317,495 to processing facilities.  In addition to the above a number of projects were approved for FEOGA grant-aid amounting to £3,760,101 for which payment claims have yet to be received.</P>
    <P>Great strides have been made over the last number of years in improving the quality of marketed Irish potatoes and in providing value added processing facilities.  The considerable investment that has taken place in refrigerated capacity, and the provision of modern handling facilities have been instrumental in bringing great improvement and efficiency to the potato industry.  The growth in the last few years of the washed potato trade and the high quality of Irish potatoes coming from the new refrigerated stores in spring and early summer are a testament to the investment that has occurred.  Much of this investment undoubtedly would not have taken place in the absence of the FEOGA scheme and its related Exchequer investment.</P>

      <P>The lands in folio 29835 County Mayo were the subject of a commonage division scheme prepared by the Land Commission.  The Vesting Order relating to the commonage was completed on 22 August 1995. However, due to an objection raised by one of the shareholders concerning a right of way, the Land Commission has not been in a position to lodge the Vesting Order in the Land Registry.  Consequently, none of the shareholders can be registered as owners of their defined plots for the present.  The Land Commission cannot consent to the proposed transfer until such time as the objection has been resolved.</P>
      <P>The objection will be referred to the Court of the Irish Land Commission for hearing at the earliest opportunity. Details are being sought on the current usage of the right of way from the other commonage owners and from the occupiers of the relevant adjacent folios.  The case will be expedited as much as possible.</P>

      <P>In October 1995, I announced that the EU Commission had approved the reclassification of almost one million acres of land to more severely handicapped status.  The south Kilkenny area formed what is known as a non-contiguous area, in that it does not join the existing more severely handicapped boundary.  In order to qualify for reclassification, an area of at least 15,000 hectares would have to satisfy the criteria of land quality and income, and would have to form a homogeneous and logical block of land. At the time of the original proposal, the appeals panel did not feel that the area appealed could be justified to the Commission and it was excluded from their recommendations.</P>
      <P>Following representations from the south Kilkenny area, I agreed to have the status of the area re-examined.  On completion of this examination, a proposal was sent to the EU Commission in respect of certain townlands in the area.  I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that, at a meeting of the Agriculture Structures and Rural Development (STAR) Committee in Brussels yesterday (25 July), this proposal was accepted.  The areas which are now reclassified as more severely handicapped include Brandonhill which is in two District Electoral Divisions, Coolhill and Freaghanna.  There are no townlands called Tory Hill or Chapel Hill in this area so I cannot say if these areas are included.</P>

      <P>The level of headage payment which is made in respect of ewes in the disadvantaged <Col N="2016" /> areas is currently £10 per eligible ewe. This assistance is co-funded by the EU Structural Funds (65 per cent) and the National Exchequer (35 per cent).  An increase, such as the Deputy has suggested, would not be possible within the EU Rules for headage payments and in any event such a change in rates would involve prohibitive cost.  The total Structural Funding which will be made available up to 1999 has been agreed so that any increase in funding for one scheme can only take place at the expense of some other scheme within the envelope of funds.</P>

      <P>The scheme under which butter vouchers are made available to certain categories of social welfare recipients is wholly funded by the European Union as part of the EU butter market support system.  Given that the primary purpose of the measure is to help support EU butter sales, the scheme does not cover other products which, in fact, compete with butter. Within general guidelines set by the EU, the precise determination of welfare recipient categories eligible under the scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the hardship being caused to small milk producers due to the alterations made to the temporary milk quota leasing scheme; and if he will give an estimate of the amount of milk that remains to be distributed under this scheme.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 883, 884 and 885 together.</P>
      <P>The milk quota system as implemented in Ireland is heavily biased in favour of small scale milk producers. Priority is given to such producers in the end of year reallocation of unused quota, in quota restructuring and temporary leasing schemes.  Furthermore, a subsidy of between £0.40-£0.50 per gallon will shortly be available to a certain category of small scale producers towards the purchase of milk quota under this year's restructuring scheme. This follows the operation of a similar scheme in each of the past two years.</P>
      <P>The estimated quantity of quota allocated under all stages of the 1995-96 temporary leasing scheme was 68.4 million gallons.  The quantity allocated under the first stage of the 1996-97 scheme was 41.6 million gallons.  There are two further stages to be operated in this year's temporary leasing scheme and it is not possible at this stage to estimate the quantity that will become available for allocation during these stages of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to operation of this year's scheme I have already announced that under the second stage of the scheme total priority will be given to smaller scale producers who have depended on temporary leasing in previous years.  I have also arranged that the outcome of the second stage will be reviewed <Col N="2018" /> immediately after its completion in order to assess the impact of its operation and to make any adjustments which may be appropriate.</P>

Approximately 25 per cent of participants who have been approved for second year payments have had penalties imposed.  However, this figure is based on a small sample of payments already made due to the industrial dispute in the Department's local offices.</P>

      <P>The number of farmers who had completed their first <Col N="2022" /> year in REPS on 30 June 1996 and are due second payments is 4,131.  The number of farmers approved for second year payments is 215.  A breakdown by county of payments made is set out in the following table.  Following the implementation of more stringent control measures and the revision to the REPS specifications, arrangements have been put in train to deal with the backlog as follows.</P>
      <P>Lists of those participants who joined the scheme in 1994 were issued to the Department's local offices on 14 May 1996 to facilitate farmer compliance checks.  A total of 309 participants were involved of which up to now 250 have had compliance checks completed. Industrial action in the Department's local offices contributed to the delays in carrying out compliance checks.  The dispute has now been resolved allowing compliance checks to be carried out for the 1,512 participants who were due second year payments up to 31 March 1996.  It is intended to commence checks on other participants who are now due second year payments by the end of the month.</P>

A breakdown, by county, of these payments is set out in reply to Question No 895.  A breakdown by county of compliance checks is not available.  The number of inspectors available to carry out compliance checks is 179.  A breakdown of these is set out in the following table. These inspectors also carry out inspections on other schemes administered by my Department including the farm improvement programme and the control of farm pollution scheme.  Due to the diverse nature of the inspection work and in the absence of an automated payment system it is not possible to give details of the number of inspections carried out by the inspectorate. The introduction of an automated payment system later this year will enable such information to be provided.</P>

      <P>The number of farmers, by county, approved under the REP scheme for first and second year payments is set out in the following tables.  The information requested in relation to sub programmes of the REP scheme is not available at present.  The total amount paid to date under the REP scheme is as follows: 1994, £1.3 million; 1995, £29.5 million; 1996 (to date), £24.75 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seventy-five per cent of all expenditure on REPS is recouped from the EU FEOGA Guarantee Fund with the <Col N="2025" /> remaining 25 per cent funded from the National Exchequer.  The current allocation for the REP scheme for 1996 is £57.56 million.  It is expected that additional funding in the region of £7 million will become available from changes within ERAD.  I am keeping the funding of REPS under close review <Col N="2026" /> with a view to ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet the expected demand.  The number of new entrants this year is 7,290.  The current projected expenditure under the scheme to end 1997 is £200 million.  Funding for subsequent years will be due for negotiation next year.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give in tabular form and by county, the number of applicants, the number of successful applicants, the number of people paid, the amount of money paid out and the number awaiting payment in relation to the control of farmyard pollution scheme; the total money committed for all expenditure in respect of all existing applicants; the amount of that money liable for payment in 1996; the number of applicants this amount represents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The information sought as regards the number of applications, the number of applications processed to approval to commence work, the number and the amount paid to date is set out in the following table.  In addition some 216 who were approved on the basis of payment in 1997 have completed work.  This represents a grant commitment of £1.568 million and payment will issue in early 1997.</P>
      <P>As regards the number awaiting payment the position is that payment issues only on completion of works to the Department's specification and issues within the time limits set in the Charter of Farmers' Rights.  Approvals to date, which should all be completed, represent a grant commitment of £99 million on a gross investment of £177.7 million. The level of payment in 1996 will depend on the level of eligible approvals completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 908, 909, 915, 921, 925 and 928 together.</P>
      <P>The matters arising from the questions have been addressed already in the Adjournment on 20 June 1996, the reply to a series of previous Dáil Questions on 2 July 1996 and in the statements at the session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on 18 July 1996.  However, it may be helpful to the Deputies who put down these questions if I reiterate the responses already made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of bringing this affair to a resolution was unavoidably protracted. Public comment or moves by me or the Government to bring an earlier resolution of the affair would have led to accusations of political interference and <Col N="2038" /> frustrating the normal exercise of due process.  I, and the Government, were obliged in the circumstances to observe a discreet silence to allow the Bord na Móna inquiry to take its natural course in order to enable the board to assemble all of the relevant facts and at the same time to provide every opportunity to the former Managing Director to respond to the issues raised in relation to his remuneration package.</P>
    <P>As soon as its inquiries had been completed, the board &mdash; with the exception of the former managing director &mdash; concluded that there had been a breach of the Government pay guidelines.  This conclusion was conveyed formally to me and, at this stage, I and the Government acted decisively to bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>On 9 July 1996 Dr. O'Connor was suspended by the Government, on full pay and benefits, pending a full review and early report by a third party of the corporate governance issues arising from the managing director's remuneration package.</P>
    <P>However, the need for this review &mdash; by Mr. Frank Clarke, SC, &mdash; was removed by the resolution of the matter by mutual agreement between the parties on 12 July 1996 and the resignation of the former managing director.  During the course of the negotiations leading to the resolution of this matter, the chairman of Bord na Móna was obviously kept informed of developments as a matter of necessity and professional courtesy.  The Price Waterhouse Report was commissioned by Bord na Móna. The cost is a matter for the board and will not be a charge on the taxpayer. Recent correspondence between my Department and the former managing director of Bord na Móna touched on his suspension and related matters and it would not be appropriate to make that correspondence public.</P>
    <P>The mandate given to Mr. Pat Dineen on his appointment as chairman on 13 September 1995, was clearly outlined by me to the Oireachtas Committee and is now a matter of public record.  The mandate given to the chairman was a clear <Col N="2039" /> extension of the mandate already given to the previous chairman and was highly supportive of the company.  The principal elements of the mandate were the need for concentration by the board on its core activities; the need for reductions in the group HQ overhead costs; concern at the board's involvement in wind energy research, and a reiteration of the Government's support for the company as demonstrated by the decision to inject £120 million of equity into the company and by the Government's full support for the construction of a new 120MW peat station.</P>
    <P>The only other correspondence with the chairman &mdash; other than the incoming chairman's formal letter of appointment and the policy guidance outlined above &mdash; was a request from the secretary of my Department for a complete understanding of the managing director's remuneration package following the submission to him of the interim report on this matter which had been commissioned by the board and a letter from me to the chairman seeking a response to 13 questions about various aspects of the former managing director's remuneration package.  A general request to all chairpersons about Government pay guidelines had been issued separately by me to all the State Companies for which I am responsible. This was not, of course, directed specifically at Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Naturally there are day-to-day operational contacts between the Department and Bord na Móna.  As all this correspondence and related contacts, in aggregate, would touch on matters which are, or could be, commercially sensitive.  I do not propose publishing this correspondence.</P>
    <P>I was not involved, nor did I involve the Government, in the matter of the managing director's remuneration package until the board of Bord na Móna came to a determination of the matter in recent weeks.  I then took immediate action to ensure the matter was resolved, fairly and speedily, so as to <Col N="2040" /> allow the company to focus on its business problems.</P>
    <P>Details of the settlement with the former managing director were provided to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on 18 July 1996.  Dr. O'Connor was already entitled to preserved pension benefits and lump sum from his previous service with ESB and Bord na Móna to a value of £290,000.  This figure should, logically, be deducted from the gross pension calculation to arrive at the additional cost involved.  When this is done, the extra element of Dr. O'Connor's pension settlement is worth £424,000.  This pension is based on his ESB and Bord na Móna pension schemes with ten added years.  Such an arrangement is in line with public sector norms and has precedents going back for some time.  Exit packages offered to and accepted by senior public servants under previous Administrations have included ten extra years of notional service for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition, Dr. O'Connor will receive a severance payment, a bonus due in respect of last year, his already agreed VHI payment and a contribution towards his legal costs.  In aggregate, these come to £148,000 giving the total estimated additional cost of the package of £570,000.  This is the agreed money element of the package.</P>
    <P>The settlement also takes account of contested claims made by both the board and Dr. O'Connor.  The board contends that amounts were owing to it by Dr. O'Connor in respect of cash advances, unvouched expenditure and personal expenses together with claims for reimbursement by Dr. O'Connor of a tax settlement already made by the company in respect of Dr. O'Connor's package and possible future liabilities which might arise with Revenue.  Dr. O'Connor, in turn also claimed and contended that the proceeds of a bond amounting to £90,000 is owing to him. In full and final settlement, the parties have agreed that these amounts will be offset against one another without either side admitting liability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> The settlement between Dr. O'Connor and Bord na Móna received the formal approval of the Government on 17 July 1996.  The resolution of this matter now allows the board, management and workforce in Bord na Móna to focus their attention once again on normal business and to concentrate all their energies on the many challenges facing the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated final cost of the consultancy for the strategic alliance is £2.95 million plus VAT and expenses of up to £50,000 per month for the duration of the project. The consortium of consultants is led by investment bankers Morgan Stanley.  It also includes legal advisers Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom and telecommunications strategic advisers Arthur D. Little.</P>
      <P>The role of the consultants is to assist the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Department of Finance in the negotiation and conclusion of the alliance, including the finalisation of transaction documents. The consultants advise on all aspects of the alliance process including financial,-legal, regulatory and strategic considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultancy fee is likely to represent less than 1 per cent of the proceeds likely to ultimately arise from the transaction.  This is significantly less than the charge likely to arise from a <Col N="2043" /> more straightforward flotation or placement. The consultants are also assisting the company thereby avoiding very significant expenses involved in the retention of separate advisers.</P>

      <P>On 26 June last the Government chose a consortium of KPN and Telia as the strategic partner for Telecom Éireann and entered into exclusive negotiations with them.  These discussions are virtually completed and it is envisaged that the transaction documents will be signed within the time limit agreed.</P>
      <P>Following signature, a number of conditions must be satisfied before the deal can be closed.  One of the closing conditions is the enactment of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will include provisions permitting the sale of shares in Telecom as envisaged in the transaction documents and will include appropriate provisions for worker directors.</P>
      <P>This legislation will be introduced in the Oireachtas in the early autumn.  A second Bill to provide for a general reform of telecommunications legislation for a liberalised market is envisaged for later in 1997.  It is expected that this Bill will also include provisions arising out of and impacting on the strategic alliance.</P>

      <P>The 1994-95 alternative energy requirement scheme or AER 1, was administered on my Department's behalf by the ESB's power procurement office.  All applications and submissions in respect of that scheme were submitted directly to that office.

      <P>The accelerating development of communications technologies and in particular the increasing convergence between telecommunications and broadcasting services is rapidly redefining the potential of cable television network operators to expand into new product areas. It is widely accepted that the upgrading and development of cable networks to enable the delivery of advanced multimedia information services to the mass market will be a key factor in promoting the development of the information society which in turn is regarded as an important influence on future economic growth and development.  This is fully recognised in the Forfás report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, I am anxious that the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors develop rapidly towards the widespread provision of advanced information services.  In this context, I sought and received from the Government approval for inclusion in the mandate for the negotiation of the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance, a requirement that Cablelink would be developed as a platform for the provision of advanced services.  The draft transaction terms to be signed with KPN/Telia include specific initiatives in <Col N="2048" /> relation to the development of Cablelink in order to diversify its product portfolio and, using the expertise of KNP/Telia in cable and multimedia applications, it should be possible to achieve the advanced communications services environment envisaged by Forfás without a change in ownership of Cablelink.</P>

      <P>The Government earlier this year approved electricity price increases for the next three years.  These increases are necessary to enable the ESB to undertake substantial investment, of the order of £1.5 billion over the next five years, in the electricity infrastructure, particularly in up-grading the rural network.</P>
      <P>While the overall average price increase will be 2 per cent in 1996, 1.5 per cent in 1997 and 3 per cent in 1998, domestic bills will increase by 2.8 per cent in 1996, and 2 per cent in 1997.  The 1996 increase, now being implemented, will add 17 per cent per week to the average domestic electricity bill.  The allocation of the increase in 1998 among the various categories, including domestic customers, will be determined in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there has been no <Col N="2052" /> increase in electricity prices for over ten years has also left domestic prices among the lowest in Europe.  Moreover, the implementation of the approved increases for 1997 and 1998 is contingent on satisfactory implementation of the CCR.  As the projected savings from the CCR come through, they will help to contain electricity prices against inflationary tendencies.  The implementation of the CCR is being monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department and ESB's external auditors have also been requested to sign off on the savings.</P>
    <P>The interest of European consumers is one of the major factors underlying the EU sponsored proposals for the liberalisation of the electricity market in Europe.  It is too early to predict the extent of the benefits the new electricity Directive is expected to bring to consumers.</P>

      <P>Due to reasons of commercial confidentiality it will not be possible to undertake full disclosure of the transaction documents.  It is intended however, following discussion and agreement with the partners, to make public certain of the more significant provisions of the transaction at the time of a formal cermony launching the strategic alliance in September.</P>

      <Quest>the rights held by KPN/Telia in relation to the final pricing of the stake in Telecom Éireann; his views on the inbuilt incentive in the deal for KPN/Telia to restrict the development of Telecom Éireann for a number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>KPN/Telia will acquire an initial 20 per cent of the total outstanding shares of Telecom Éireann for £182.86 million together with an option to acquire a further 15 per cent of the shares, three years after closing of the deal, for £200 million.  There will also be a sharing with the State three years from closing of the <Col N="2055" /> increase in value above a certain threshold rate on the strategic partners initial 20 per cent investment and on the cost of the option shares if the option is exercised.</P>
      <P>The value of the strategic partners investment at that time will be determined either by way of public offering of some or all of the shares which are subject to the option or by way of an independent valuation.  KPN/Telia are not obliged to exercise their option but it will be in their interest to do so if the valuation of the company shares in three years time exceeds the option price.</P>
      <P>This deal is structured so as to provide an incentive for all parties to accelerate the development of Telecom Éireann and there is no question of KPN/Telia having any incentive or motivation to restrict the development of the company.  On the contrary KPN/Telia, through their extensive financial investment and an agreement to provide strategic support contributions, are committed to assisting in this transformation process which will ultimately enhance the value of their initial stake and consequently provide them with an opportunity to realise further enhanced value through the exercise of their option shares.</P>

      <P>At the general level, the obligation to comply with best international practice in relation to emissions of electro magnetic radiation from communications masts is included in licences issued by me to the operators.  This best practice is laid down by the International Radiation Protection Association, IRPA, in their 1988 guidelines.  These guidelines were recently endorsed in a review of all relevant research on the subject by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, an international and well respected group of experts in the area of non-ionising radiation.  The review states <Col N="2057" /> that there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur in people exposed to levels of non-ionising radiation at or below those energy levels considered to be safely tolerated 24 hours a day.  Compliance with these guidelines ensures that no member of the public is exposed to unacceptable levels of emissions and independent tests carried out at a number of locations show that the levels in this country are well within the guidelines.</P>
      <P>I have, however, no function in relation to particular masts, including the one mentioned by the Deputy.  This is a matter for decision by the local planning authority and, on appeal, An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts a former member of the Permanent Defence force may apply for compensation in respect of a wound or an injury, including damage to hearing, received on duty or otherwise attributable to service either at home or abroad.  Formal application must be made within one year after the date of discharge or retirement.</P>
      <P>The minimum degree of disablement required to qualify for a pension is 20 per cent.  A disablement gratuity may be granted where the degree of disablement is less than 20 per cent.  Applications are asessed by the Army Pensions Board which is the statutory body established pursuant to section 5 of the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  It consists of a chairman and two ordinary members. It assesses the degree of disablement and determines whether the disablement is attributable to military service.</P>
      <P>Under the common law it is open to any member or ex-member of the Defence Forces to take a civil action for damages for any personal injury sustained as a result of the alleged negligence or breach of duty of the Minister, his servants or agents.</P>

      <P>As I outlined previously to the House the EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In submitting proposals for 1996 Ireland put the emphasis on securing support for the requirements to implement the new entry and exit arrangements which came into operation on 1 January 1996 and which are an essential element of the new control measures for the Irish box.  In addition to these items funding was also sought for a range of control measures to be operated by both the Department of <Col N="2068" /> Defence and the Department of the Marine.  The total amount of expenditure under the programme for both Departments for 1996 is £5.8 million, of which £4.3 million will be met by the EU.  In agreeing to the 1996 programme the EU Commission recognised the unique position of Ireland by agreeing to a higher rate of intervention to many elements of our package and by contributing to Ireland's operational costs.</P>
    <P>I have now asked that an examination be carried out to establish the resources required by the Naval Service to ensure effective enforcement of the various regulations taking account of the control measures agreed in December 1995. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Ireland will derive the maximum benefit from the available EU support including support for the purchase of additional patrol vessels.</P>
    <P>The Commission will consider Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and will decide before the end of the year on the level of funding to be made available in 1997.  Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to provide a fishery protection service using the existing seven patrol vessels, a number of which, it is expected, will be refurbished under the five year programme.</P>

      <P>Prosecutions in relation to pollution occurrences are initiated by the individual regional fisheries boards in whose region the incident occurs and all issues in relation to these prosecutions are a matter for the boards concerned.  The seven regional fisheries boards advise that they collectively initiated a total of <Col N="2072" /> 71 prosecutions in relation to water pollution incidences, including fish kill occurrences, during 1995.  Forty four of the fish kills reported in 1995 were not attributable to any single, precise source and consequently the boards could not under current legislation initiate legal proceedings in respect of these.  Of the remaining cases, the precise source of pollution was identified and sufficient evidence obtained in 19 cases to sustain legal action.</P>
      <P>The balance of prosecutions taken by the regional boards related to water pollution incidents which merited a prosecution although no fish mortalities had resulted.  The boards obtained successful outcomes in 58 of the cases initiated, the remaining 13 cases have yet to be heard or are adjourned pending the result of appeals to the Supreme Court.  In all cases where a prosecution was obtained the defendants were convicted and fined and the boards were awarded costs and expenses.  Details of the number of prosecutions initiated by each board in 1995, the categorisation of the cases by region and the current position in the cases are set out in the following tabulations:</P>

      <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers was initiated following consultations with the EU Commission in order to regularise the position of vessels which had formed part of the Irish fleet but which for various reasons were not placed on the register of sea fishing boards created under the terms of the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 344 of 1989).</P>
      <P>The details of the scheme and its implementation are still the subject of discussion with the Commission.  It is envisaged, however, that agreement on outstanding matters in this regard will be reached in the context of negotiations on the next multi-annual guidance programme on EU fleet capacity. On the basis of current progress, it is envisaged that the applications received under the scheme will be processed by the Department later this year.</P>

      <P>The tourism angling measure of the operational programme for tourism provides for total investment of almost £19 million in the development of the tourism angling product over five years.  I have already announced some 54 projects, involving total expenditure of almost £7.7 million, under this measure. No projects have been approved to date in County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indicative investment of almost £4 million in the Border region, including the Monaghan area, has been provided for under the tourism angling measure. The extent to which this indicative investment is realised will depend on the number, eligibility and quality of projects submitted.  I understand at least three projects in the Monaghan area are <Col N="2077" /> undergoing preliminary evaluation and assessment at present.</P>
    <P>Following previous inquiries by the Deputy I asked the Central Fisheries Board, which is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the tourism angling measure, to advise the Deputy directly about application on hand in relation to projects in the Cavan/ Monaghan area.  I have now asked the board to contact the Deputy in relation to current applications in the Monaghan area.</P>
    <P>Scope for significant investment in the Monaghan area, and in the Border region generally, also exists under the fisheries measures of the INTERREG programme 1994 to 1999, under which £2.5 million has been made available, and under the special support programme for peace and reconciliation under which almost £1.3 million has been provided in respect of co-operative actions in fishing and aquaculture.</P>
    <P>I understand that the agriculture, fisheries and forestry working group of the INTERREG II programme has decided to support a major inland fisheries project in the Cavan/Leitrim area and that a formal announcement in this regard can be made as soon as certain financial arrangements associated with the programme have been finalised.  I also understand that a number of other applications submitted for funding under the fisheries measures of that programme are undergoing evaluation at present.</P>
    <P>The first tranche of applications under the fisheries measure of the special support programme for peace and reconciliation will be assessed and decided upon late this year.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 965, 966, 967, 968, 969 and 971 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware from the submissions received from Wexford County Council of the erosion problems at the various locations identified by the Deputy. <Col N="2080" /> Indeed, I visited a number of them earlier this year to see the situation for myself.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the funding available for coastal protection works is limited to approximately £1 million per annum.  Realistically this only allows a limited number of small schemes to be completed in any one year.  The funding available in 1996 has been allocated to a variety of schemes with a wide geographic spread.  Included in the 1996 programme is provision for the undertaking of a £100,000 protection scheme at Courtown.  I am aware that the consultancy study of the erosion problem at Courtown, which was aided by my Department, has indicated that the long-term solution to the problem would require an investment level of some £2 million on offshore breakwaters. Funding for such a large-scale project is not currently available nor is it likely in the immediate future given present funding allocations.  However, given the level of damage inflicted to the dunes at Courtown during last winter's storms it is considered essential that emergency remedial works be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council is of the opinion that Courtown, despite the problems at other locations in the county, should be addressed as a priority.  These protection works will help stabilise the situation at Courtown pending the securing of funds for undertaking a longer term solution.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am aware of the problems being encountered at other locations in County Wexford and the council's priority proposals for protection works at these locations will be considered on an annual basis, having regard to the funding available, over the remaining years of the environmental services operational programme.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 36, regarding Structural Fund support for a tugboat for the Shannon estuary, answered on 29 May 1996 in which I stated that EU policy on aid to shipbuilding is currently set out in Council Directive 90/684/EEC of 21 December 1990 as last amended by Directive 94/73/EC of 19 December 1994.  Tugs of 365 Kilowatts or above fall within the scope of the Directive.  Aid is allowed, to the yard or to the shipowner, up to 9 per cent of a contract value, if this is equal to or <Col N="2082" /> higher than 10 million ECU.  For contracts of a lower value, the aid limit is set at 4.5 per cent of the contract price.</P>
      <P>However, in December 1994 an international agreement was signed within the OECD under which all direct or indirect aid to shipbuilding is to be considered unlawful.  This agreement, to which the EU is a party together with the USA, Japan, Korea and Norway, has not yet entered into force &mdash; this should have happened on 1 January 1996 &mdash; but is expected to do so in the near future.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission, however, has already signalled it will no longer approve grant aid for tug projects as it would be against the spirit of Community policy to seek such support given the pending imposition of a blanket ban on aid to shipbuilders and shipowners. As stated in my reply of 29 May 1996 I asked officials of my Department to discuss this matter further with the Commission.  Such discussions have taken place and the Commission's position remains unchanged.</P>

    <P>That being said, limited funding of approximately £1 million per annum is available under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994 to 1999 to assist local authorities to undertake priority protection works.

      <P>Under the Harbours Act, 1946 the Minister for the Marine may approve harbour rates for harbours scheduled under the said Act.  Rates approved usually cover tonnage and traffic charges.  Sligo, Galway and the ports at Killybegs, Buncrana and Ballyshannon in County Donegal are scheduled harbours.  I am arranging for copies of the harbour rates orders in operation at present for harbours in the counties listed above &mdash;<Col N="2084" /> there are none for Ballyshannon &mdash; to be sent to the Deputy.  There is virtually no commercial traffic handled at present by the ports of Buncrana and Ballyshannon, while Killybegs is primarily a fishing port.</P>
      <P>In addition to these charges there are the stevedoring or cargo handling charges associated with the loading/unloading of cargo.  These are negotiated locally between shippers/ users and the stevedoring company.  The stevedores at the above ports are private companies and I have no details of these charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986 and 987 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 25 October last to a series of questions raised by him, a large number of specific safety recommendations arose from the review of the circumstances of the tragic canoeing accident at Dunmore East in which two lives were lost.</P>
      <P>I also explained on that occasion the steps which were being taken to implement those recommendations.  I noted, however, that implementation would be on a voluntary basis in close co-operation with all concerned.  This was and remains in keeping with current policy, which considers that the most effective approach to water leisure activity to be through self-regulation by the various governing bodies.</P>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to advise the Deputy of a number of initiatives that have been taken in relation to safety in the marine leisure industry.  I have taken up with my colleague in the Department of Education, which is responsible for sport in general, the question of the regulation of all adventure sports with particular reference to the monitoring and control of adventure centres which provide facilities for young people.  Canoeing is only one of a wide spectrum of activity sports which encompasses such diverse activities as horse-riding, archery, rock-climbing and scuba-diving and I am sure the Deputy will agree that there needs to be a co-ordinated approach towards ensuring greater safety in all these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the Marine Emergency Service of my Department has been engaged in an extensive programme of information meetings with the various groups sponsoring marine adventure sports, including canoeing-kayaking and in the dissemination of safety messages to as wide a circulation as possible, in particular through schools in coastal areas.  It has also been arranged that the cliff and coast rescue service units based at 50 locations <Col N="2091" /> around the coast should become more active in the creation of greater safety awareness at local level through greater imvolvement at community level in their areas.  Furthermore the search and rescue and safety awareness demonstrations mounted at a number of locations by IMES each year have been expanded to cover canoeing.  In addition, a range of advisory literature on the dangers of marine activity has been circulated by my Department for a number of years past, a video on the use of life-jackets has been produced and circulated and a marine emergency phone-in service has been established in the Department.</P>
    <P>My Department has also recently launched a marine safety initiative involving the RNLI, the Irish Sailing Association, the relevant Government Departments, the National Safety Council and the various regulatory bodies under the aegis of the Association for Adventure Sports.  The aim of this working group is to use its collective expertise and experience to create and communicate marine safety information and messages to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the group are: to establish strong working relationships with other national and local organisations to create and promote accident prevention programmes; to establish cause and trends in accidents at sea; to develop accident prevention programmes; to measure effectiveness of prevention programmes; and to provide a co-ordinated approach to the dissemination of safety information in response to individual inquiries.</P>

      <Quest>if he will allow an extension of the salmon fishing season by an extra two weeks beyond the closing date of 31 July 1996 in the Waterford estuary in view of the difficulties caused in 1996 due to a plague of jellyfish which has totally ruined the season; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It has not been the practice in recent years, nor would it be in accord with established policy objectives, to extend drift netting seasons.  As regards the particular area mentioned by the Deputy, I would point out that the salmon drift net fishermen along the south coast already have the benefit of a lengthy season which has been in place since 1980 and extends from 15 March until 31 July each year.  While I sympathise with any difficulties arising, no change in the season is proposed.</P>

      <P>EU Cohesion Fund aid of 75 per cent of project cost has been approved towards the acquisition by Cork Harbour Commissioners of a new tractor tug.  The balance of the cost is being met by Cork Harbour Commissioners and no Exchequer funding has been made available to the Commissioners in respect of this project.  The new tug, <i>Gerry O'Sullivan</i>, at a cost of IR£3.6 million is now operational and to date Cohesion Fund aid of just over IR£2 million has been paid to Cork Harbour Commissioners.  The <i>Gerry O'Sullivan</i> is a replacement tug for the <i>Shandon</i> which is now being offered for sale and the former crew of the <i>Shandon</i> will operate the <i>Gerry O'Sullivan.</i></P>
      <P>The <i>Gerry O' Sullivan</i> is equipped with the most up-to-date firefighting equipment and is the most modern and up-to-date tug in any port in the Republic.  The <i>Shandon</i> did not operate on a 24 hour, 365 day system but did operate as required over the 365 days. The <i>Gerry O'Sulivan</i> will operate in the same way.</P>

      <P>Ireland is committed to the provision of the Loran C station, by way of signed international agreement approved by the then Government in 1992 and subsequently by Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992. At any time, in order to provide maximum system coverage, it was necessary that the station be located in the south west.  The site near Loop Head was selected as most suitable by reference to a comprehensive range of criteria following extensive site investigations in counties Kerry and Clare.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently evaluating the practical and legal implications of last week's Supreme Court judgment in relation to the statutory powers of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to construct the Locan C mast. I would also remind the Deputy that a further High Court decision is pending in relation to decision taken by An Bord Pleanála regarding planning permission for the Loran C mast.</P>
