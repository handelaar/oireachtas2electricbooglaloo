    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one organisation specifically established to deal with cross-Border projects. The International Fund for Ireland was established in 1986 by the Irish and British Governments with the aim of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between all communities throughout Ireland.  The fund is financed by international contributions and it is administered by an independent board.  It administers ten main programmes: disadvantaged areas, investment companies, flagship projects, community initiatives, business enterprise, tourism, urban development, <Col N="1498" /> rural development, science and technology and wider horizons.</P>
      <P>The joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme for 1994-99 is a multi-sectoral one with the two major objectives of creating and developing networks for cross-Border co-operation and the economic regeneration of the Border region.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Marine, Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, Tourism and Trade, Enterprise and Employment, Education and Finance in conjunction with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, implement measures under the programme and the Department of Finance oversees the whole programme.</P>
      <P>Under the programme the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has recently approved a total of 24 projects for support of £2.20 million with a similar level of ESF funding being provided through the Northern authorities for projects in the North.  The projects were selected from more than 100 projects submitted to the Department of Enterprise and Employment and to the Training and Employment Authority in Northern Ireland.  A joint North-South working group assessed the projects and attempted to ascertain those projects that most clearly fulfilled the criteria relating to impact on Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment will call for further projects for the 1997-99 phase of the initiative early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme is to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation. Funding is targeted mainly at those who have been most affected by the conflict. The programme contains a number of measures intended to contribute directly to economic development.  Particular emphasis has been given to measures which promote social inclusion.  This theme extends across all the measures under the programme and there is also a specific social inclusion sub-programme which accounts for 30 <Col N="1499" /> per cent of total funds available under the programme.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management and the Combat Poverty Agency jointly administer 11 measures under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Co-operation North, a registered charity, was established in 1979 to act as a vehicle to research and develop methods of increasing communication and co-operation between people in the North and the South.  In association with IBEC/CBI(NI), Co-operation North acts as an intermediary body for Measure 3.1 -Cross-Border Business and Cultural Linkages.  County council led task forces have been established in each county to boost the regeneration of Border areas affected by the conflict and will receive allocations from the Department for the Environment shortly.</P>
    <P>Apart from these programmes which are specific to the Border counties, funding is also available under the full range of Exchequer-funded programmes that address the needs of disadvantaged areas, such as the Department of Social Welfare's Community Development Programme.  I am circulating in the Official Report a list of EU-funded operational programmes and Community initiatives which are national programmes under which funding is also available to the Border region, in addition to a list of the Leader groups, county enterprise boards and area partnership companies which are in place in the Border region.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has acknowledged that the numerous sources of funding can be confusing and feels there is a need for co-ordination to ensure that the maximum effectiveness of the funding is achieved.  That is why on 7 February this year I was asked to chair a task force to examine funding arrangements in the Border counties, and I expect the task force to report its recommendations to the Government this month.</P>
    <P>1.  The following operational programmes, which are nationwide programmes, provide funding to the Border <Col N="1500" /> region: Industry; Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry; Fisheries; Tourism; Local Urban and Rural Development; Community Development Programme; Human Resources; Transport; Economic Infrastructure and Environmental Services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply but I would like to tease it out with him.  While the £2.2 million allocated to the 24 INTERREG projects is welcome none has gone to County Donegal on this occasion.  The southern Border counties have borne the brunt of economic depression resulting from the troubles and it has not always been easy to defend our position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>We must proceed by way of questions at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the southern Border counties have suffered greatly in the past 25 years?  Is the Minister aware that 16 only of 421 American companies in the country are in the Border counties?  Is the Minister aware that on Thursday last a Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives asking the President to enter into a trade agreement with Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties to establish a free trade zone between Northern Ireland and the Border counties? Will the Government support this measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is news to me.  I am glad Deputy McDaid has extensive resources in the United States.  At Question Time last week he informed me that another Bill restricting investment was introduced in the House of Representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that this Bill has been put to the House of Representatives but on this occasion as on <Col N="1503" /> the previous occasion I will ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to inquire into what legislation is proposed and when I have the details I will reply to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As a recently appointed Minister with responsibility for the Border counties I am sure the Minister of State will want to keep himself informed.  Is the Minister of State aware that the political parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government are aware of this measure because it was raised by John Hume on the floor of the House of Commons and as far back as 3 January 1996 in an article in The University of Ulster publication.  It is estimated that a free trade zone along the Border would generate an additional $750 million for the economy which would be additional revenue for the UK and the Republic.  Will the Minister look at this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to dissuade the Deputy from making a speech or letting us have information rather than seeking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State needs to be informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the people who have suffered in the Border counties.  Studies have been conducted and recommendations made and I am responsible for ensuring that the operational programmes listed in the reply are co-ordinated properly and the money is spent in time so that we will be able to report considerable progress at the mid-term review.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I am interested in any reasonable proposal on Border areas from Deputy McDaid and I share his anxieties.  Should he make another viable proposal, I will be glad to have it investigated and ask the responsible Minister for an official reply on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that people in the Border areas are somewhat mesmerised by the number of organisations and bodies dispensing funds?  We have the Delors package, Area Development Management and the Combat Poverty Agency administering funds.  Does he accept it would be preferable to have the tried and trusted vehicle for development, the local authorities who have been bypassed by successive Governments, administer these funds in the Border areas?</P>
      <P>Does he accept there is a need for proper industrial infrastructure in the six southern Border counties, particularly those in the middle?  Does he agree much of the money available under the Delors package could be channelled into industrial infrastructure to create much needed jobs in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on other occasions initiatives taken by the county council have been dealt with by this programme which we inherited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The proliferation of dispensing bodies was agreed with the European Union.  The Government is examining the role of local authorities and when the report on local authorities is available I am sure the Deputy will find it very interesting.  Local authorities will have the power to take more initiatives when this report is finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about industrial infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Border Regional Authority I would point out that a seminar will take place in Donegal on Friday and Saturday of this week to report to all concerned in the Border areas on the spending of the £48 million available to the Border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the problems have been caused by the <Col N="1505" /> violence of the past 25 years and that we should collectively suggest to the IRA that it call another ceasefire to encourage potential industrialists to set up in the region?  Will he further agree that the £10 million allocated for the Border areas has been administered collectively by the local authorities and other interested bodies in the region?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the distribution of funding, the percentage share of the Border counties is 14.74 per cent or £3,846 per person as compared with a national average of £3,338.  There is, therefore, a bias in favour of the Border areas in the distribution of funds.  As I was at pains to point out to Deputy Ahern, both today and on numerous other occasions, we have inherited most of the programme which was negotiated principally by his colleagues as part of the Delors package.  I am glad the support programme is getting under way and the Department of Enterprise and Employment was in a position to announce the projects in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the east Border region committee, comprising representatives of four councils, two on each side of the Border, has been working for 25 years on a shoestring budget, although it has received some funding in recent times? It would be an ideal vehicle to co-ordinate the disbursement of funds in Border areas.  Will the Minister of State seriously consider assisting this committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government receives the report of the task force and gives its opinion I will pursue the Deputy's view that there are other more efficient vehicles available for the distribution of funds.  This would fall to be considered as part of the mid-term review due to commence at the beginning of July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council in its report, New Approaches to Rural Development, identified the importance of developing towns as growth centres and acknowledged their role in sustaining rural population.  This is the case for all rural areas, including Border areas.</P>
      <P>A range of public policies influence the location of population in rural areas, villages, towns and cities.  The council was of the opinion that further research on Ireland's settlement patterns and urban system was necessary in order to explore the interdependence of urban and rural areas.  There is a need for an understanding of rural growth and decline.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed that the research recommended by the National Economic and Social Council will make a valuable contribution to our understanding of the issues of both rural and urban development.  Accordingly, in response to the action plan recently launched by the Western Development Partnership Board, the Government agreed to the undertaking by the NESC of a detailed analysis of overall settlement patterns, including the hierarchy of village, town and city settlement and clarification of policy goals concerning settlement.  It is expected that the NESC study will inform future policies to be pursued to overcome problems of population imbalance in various areas throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While these studies are being conducted the situation in rural Ireland is getting worse.  Is the Minister of State aware of the concerns of people in rural areas that, while at national level there is a policy of decentralisation, at county level there is a positive policy of centralisation to services in the county town?  As a result of the policies being pursued by the Government and agencies under the remit of various Departments, many <Col N="1507" /> towns in the Border areas in particular are suffering.  I refer specifically to the decisions to relocate the ESB office from the Army barracks, Cootehill to Cavan.  Is the Minister of State aware that the ESB negotiated with a certain bank rather than with An Post to collect moneys, with the result that people are now concerned that post offices are under threat?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State further aware of the concerns of people in small towns about the effect of designation of specific areas in the county town?  Those who refurbish their premises in smaller towns pay increased rates whereas those in designated areas in the county town get tax relief.  Leaving aside the research being conducted for the different agencies, will the Minister of State do something to resolve these serious problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the Deputy's views about the weak infrastructure in rural towns and the continuous drag towards the centre.  This pattern has emerged over many years.  This is the first Government to make any effort to address the problem.  As the Deputy rightly said, studies are being conducted of the various ways by which the decline in population can be arrested.  Work is in train on four or five pilot projects in western locations which will be announced in coming weeks with a view to the integration of public services in rural areas.  The initiative began in the west when a small group of farmers got together with the bishops and said they would take no more.</P>
      <P>The Government of which the Deputy was a member asked the NESC to study the issue of rural development.  I quoted from its report, compiled by Professor Cummins and others, in my initial reply.  It is as a consequence of this report that the examination of settlement patterns will be undertaken without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that a rural development policy will be devised and a framework established before the next general election.  I am satisfied from the <Col N="1508" /> response I have received to date from rural communities that they are happy with the progress I am making.  I regret to say that I have not received any requests from the Deputy's constituency, either Cavan or Monaghan, to conduct pilot studies, but I am satisfied that, when the results of the initial projects are published, the people of those areas will be anxious to have similar studies carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the rationalisation of the ESB is concerned, an agreement was made between the trade unions and ESB management when the company engaged in a reassessment of its position <i>vis-à-vis</i> preparing for competition. Part of this agreement was that the private sector would take up the sale of electrical goods in certain areas.  It was also agreed that the ESB would make reasonable efforts to provide a full service, whether through post offices or banks, to the public in towns which were losing shops.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Hanlon wishes to inform me of a town where a post office is being overlooked and people are being encouraged take their business to the banks, I will make representations on his behalf to the chairman of An Post, who I am sure will listen to my pleas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not receive a reply to Question No. 1 in relation to infrastructure for industrial development on the Border.  The Minister of State is aware that all parties have called for the spending of EU funds in this regard but there are apparently no plans to do so.  A company has earmarked and put aside land near Ardee, County Louth, which is awaiting purchase by the State agencies.  Unfortunately there is no money in IDA coffers to purchase that land.  Funds from the Delors package could be made available to purchase the land and build advance factories in Ardee, where there is a high rate of unemployment.  A similar situation obtains in Drogheda where there is no land available for the IDA to initiate industrial growth.  This problem is duplicated, and is probably worse, in other Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask that the Minister of State and the Government use their good offices to ensure that funds from the Delors <Col N="1510" /> package are not consumed by other schemes, and that cognisance is taken of representations by Members of the Oireachtas who live in Border counties.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce amending legislation to remove the doubt concerning the validity in law of marriages celebrated in the months of August, September and October 1996.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the permission of the House to <Col N="1512" /> answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who is in Belfast on business.</P>
      <P>He has no proposals to amend the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995 relating to notice of marriage.  The effect of section 32 of that Act is that, unless special exemption has been obtained in accordance with the Act, a marriage shall not be valid unless the parties give three months notice of their intention to marry.  The section comes into operation on 1 August, 1996 and, so far as marriages to be celebrated in the months of August, September and October, 1996 are concerned, it means that notice must have been given in the corresponding months of May, June or July, 1996 as the case may be, that is to say in a period before the date that has been specified for operation of the section.  It was obviously not the intention of section 32 of the 1995 Act that no marriages can take place in August, September and October 1996 and if it had been intended that persons could not marry in those months the legislation would have specifically provided for that.  The presumption under rules of statutory interpretation is that the Oireachtas intended that couples be entitled to notify the registrar of their intention to marry and that the registrar should have power to receive such notices prior to commencement of section 32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice from the Attorney General is that the provisions of section 10(1)(b) of the Interpretation Act, 1937 cover exactly the situation that arises in relation to those notices of marriage given prior to 1 August 1996.  The 1937 Act provision deals with the situation where an Act of the Oireachtas is expressed to come into operation on a day subsequent to the date of passing of such Act.  It makes clear that if an Act confers a power, the exercise of which is necessary or expedient to enable the Act to have full force and effect immediately upon its coming into operation, such power may be exercised at any time after the passing of such Act. <Col N="1513" /> By virtue of that provision and on the basis of ordinary rules of statutory interpretation, the Attorney's view is that, prior to 1 August, couples are indeed authorised to notify registrars of marriages of their intention to marry and registrars have power to receive the notices so given.</P>
    <P>The view of the Attorney General, with which I agree, is that there is no necessity for amending legislation in relation to section 32 of the 1995 Act. Couples who have notified or will notify registrars of their intention to marry, as required by the 1995 Act, can be assured that there are no legal difficulties with the operation of this provision of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance who is standing in for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform. Had I known he would be replying for the Minister today, I would have tabled some special questions to him.  Is the Minister aware that doubts have been expressed, not just by me and a number of lawyers but also by a Government backbencher, Deputy Shatter, about the retrospective effect of the legislation on cases which are not clearly specified? The Minister has said that the Attorney General is relying on the Interpretation of Statutes Act, 1937 and on the presumptions normally taken in those circumstances but there should not be any doubt about this area.  Approximately 12,000 people will be involved in marriages in the period in question.  In exempting people from the notice in that period up to 1 August, there would be no question of somebody challenging the presumptions made at a later stage. This area should be put beyond any doubt, even beyond any reasonable doubt.  I understand the Attorney General is suggesting that, on the Interpretation of Statutes Act, it might be beyond reasonable doubt but there should not be any doubt about this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Woods's concerns and the concerns of engaged couples intending marriage.  I assure the <Col N="1514" /> Deputy and all the people who may have been in contact with him that the best legal advice we have from the Attorney General is that there is nothing in section 33 of the Family Law Act, 1995 which could prevent a couple from serving the formal application to the court seeking exemptions from provisions of section 32(1)(a) prior to 1 August if they felt that was necessary. We have examined in some detail the legal provisions surrounding the operation of the 1995 Act and the 1937 Interpretation of Statutes Act and, taken together, there is not any reason a registrar cannot accept a notification by somebody intending to marry after 1 August provided it is filed in due time and in the normal way.  There is not any reason an application by a person, served prior to the commencement of the 1995 Act which comes in on 1 August, cannot be properly registered by the registrar.  Consequently, when that marriage takes place, there will be no legal doubt as to its validity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the registrar found it necessary to consult the Attorney General to confirm he was entitled to register these cases in the circumstances and that he was assured by the Attorney General that it was appropriate for him to proceed? There is a danger, however, of a legal challenge at any time in the future.  That problem can be resolved by a simple amendment.  I ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the case and not just the arguments made by the lawyers about the presumption that will be taken.  I thank the Minister for the reference to section 10(1)(b) of the 1937 Act but there is contention in regard to its validity.  In exempting people in the period up to 1 August, all doubt in this area would be eliminated.  We would co-operate with the Minister in doing that so that there would not be any possibility of problems arising in the future.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to implement the EU Directive on parental leave for mothers and fathers; the length of leave that will be provided; when the Directive will come into operation; and if he will make a statement on this important EU development.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11923/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Directive on the Framework Agreement on Parental Leave was formally adopted at the Social Affairs Council which I the Minister for Equality and Law Reform attended in Luxembourg on 3 June.</P>
      <P>He has followed the progress of this dossier closely since becoming Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  As far back as 1993 he supported this proposal at the Social Affairs Council but the necessary unanimity required for its adoption was not achieved.  He is very pleased, therefore, to welcome adoption of this directive now notwithstanding the fact that it will not apply in the United Kingdom in view of the UK opt-out of the Social Agreement of the Maastricht Treaty which provides the legal base for this measure.</P>
      <P>Implementation of a provision for parental leave for mothers and fathers is a logical development for the Department at this stage representing as it does the next in a series of family and parental statutory measures aimed at supporting the reconciliation of family life and work commitments.  The Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, which he introduced, were important steps in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant aspect of this directive is <Col N="1516" /> that its provision for parental leave has been devised and agreed by employer and worker interests at EU level.  He is aware that both IBEC and ICTU, representing Irish employers and workers, participated constructively in the European social partner agreement.  He is sure that such involvement will greatly enhance the preparation and progress of Irish legislation to give effect to this directive.</P>
    <P>Although the EU timetable for implementation of the directive only commenced on 3 June last, the Department has already had preliminary consultations with IBEC and contacts with ICTU are also under way.  Although further consultations are envisaged I expect that the legislation to be brought forward to implement this directive will seek to provide for parental leave from work of three months duration for each parent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome the formal adoption of the measure on 3 June.  I am certain many people in Britain will be disappointed that this measure will not apply in their circumstances.  When does the Minister expect the measure to come into operation?  Will it be introduced at the earliest possible date?  The Minister said that consultations have already begun with IBEC and ICTU. This is one of the important measures which will help to create a family-friendly workplace and I know the Minister is keen to see it adopted.  Will he tell the House when it is expected the measure will come into operation and will it apply to part-time workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is possibly aware, the directive provides for a two-year timeframe within which member states could introduce the necessary domestic legislation to give effect to the directive.  There is also an additional third year attached to that timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is anxious to proceed as quickly <Col N="1517" /> as possible but the speed will be determined by the way in which the consultations between the social partners at national level proceed and how quickly they can reach agreement on its implementation. I am not sure what the attitude is in regard to part-time workers but I presume, in so far as they are entitled to other social statutory protection measures, it is the intention that such part-time workers, who already enjoy such social protection in the work place, will be able to avail of this protection measure also.  However, I do not have the exact information to that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the start-up time, is it reasonable to suggest it might be included in the budget of next year, for instance, from the beginning of April or the beginning of June?  Will the Minister agree it applies to a minimum of three months' parental leave and not, as stated somewhere, up to three months?  I worry when I hear the Minister refer to a two years' time limit with a possible third year for exceptional circumstances. I wish to impress on the Minister the importance of this to families. Given the increased numbers of two parents working outside the home, there is a need for this leave, not only for children but also for parents and other special circumstances, to which we will come later.  In respect of children this is an important measure.  I congratulate the Minister on its adoption on 3 June and ask that there be no further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, is positively committed to the earliest possible implementation of this legislation on our Statute Book. In the first instance, it is a matter for positive and constructive negotiations and consultations with the social partners. Among other things the framework agreement provides for an entitlement for each individual parent to a minimum of three months.  Parental leave will be granted on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child, in the <Col N="1518" /> case of adoption to be taken before the child reaches a given age of up to eight years.  The right to parental leave would be non-transferrable between parents. All matters relating to social security should be matters for the member states to determine.  An employee would be entitled to return to employment after parental leave and would be protected from dismissal on the grounds of application for, or the taking of, such leave. The agreement also provides for an entitlement to time off work on the grounds of <i>force majeure</i> for urgent family reasons.  Such leave may be limited to a certain amount of time per year and/or is the case.  The Deputy will agree that the breadth and extent of that directive, when it becomes domestic law, will considerably move forward our statute law here in regard to reconciling the obligations and responsibilities of family life with those of the workplace.</P>

      <P>The Equal Status Bill is currently being drafted and is expected to be published during the latter half of this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has received a copy of the circular prepared by the Vintners' Federation of Ireland concerning the proposed equal status legislation.  He intends to reply to the federation shortly giving his views and to send copies of the reply to all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He met separately representatives of the federation, the Licensed Vintners' Association and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland earlier this year.  At the meetings, he made it clear that there could be no blanket exemption from the provisions of the Equal Status Bill for the licensed trade or for retailers generally and it was agreed that these bodies would let him have their proposals as to how their concerns could be met in the legislation.  Since then, he has received <Col N="1520" /> proposals from the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  Officials of his Department have met a representative of the Licensed Vintners' Association and further contact is anticipated.</P>
    <P>After meeting with them, he wrote to the federation asking that they make specific suggestions prior to publication of the Bill and saying that he would like to meet federation representatives again to discuss these suggestions.  The Chief Executive of the federation replied to him by letter dated 12 April in which he confirmed he would seek legal advice on drawing up suggestions for safeguards and would be in touch with him again.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, representations from the Vintners' Federation and the other bodies referred to in the question will receive full consideration from him in the preparation of the Bill and during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is his intention that the provisions in the Bill will meet the relevant requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister for Equality and Law Reform reconcile the concerns of the vintners' association and the other retailers with those of the other groups involved in the equality campaign?  Everybody agrees that the vintners have valid concerns.  Will the Minister accept there will be a difficulty in ratifying the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination if the request, which we now know has come from the vintners, is acceded to?</P>

      <P>When will the legislation be introduced?  This has been going on for almost four years.  Will the Minister agree there has been an inordinate delay in this process.  Surely it should be possible to deal with this legislation in a more speedy manner.  It was remarkable that the Minister said the Minister for Equality and Law Reform only met the various groups who were concerned about this legislation earlier this year to seek their recommendations.  Will he agree it is up to the Minister to provide the legislative framework rather than look for lobby groups to provide satisfactory wording?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern but this area is immensely complex. There is not much precedent in Irish legislation regarding its enactment here and much time and care is required to balance a variety of different rights under the Constitution.  As far back as 25 January 1996 the Minister met various groups.  I am satisfied from the information I have to hand that work is proceeding satisfactorily.  It is the intention to have the Bill published in the second half of this year.  Given the information I have to hand and from what I have heard from the Minister in the past there is no reason to believe we will not be in a position to meet that timetable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty the vintners expressed relates to the indication that the Bill will not oblige a publican to give a reason for refusal of service to a customer at the time.  They contend the proposed law will be unworkable and will cause more problems than it will solve.  Is it intended to drop that provision?</P>

      <P>Following the Minister's meeting with the federation he invited it to submit in writing its concerns and suggestions as to how they might be overcome.  The chief executive of the federation replied to that request in <Col N="1522" /> April when he indicated he would seek legal advice.  To my knowledge, that information has not been submitted to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  When he receives the information and the accompanying legal advice it will be examined in the context of ensuring the vintners' concerns can be addressed while ensuring that the legislation enables compliance with the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has received a copy of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights entitled Women In Management in Local Administration which shows that local authority management remains almost exclusively male-dominated; his views on the recommendations of the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has received a copy of the report entitled <i>Women in Management in Local Administration,</i> which he considers a useful addition to the information available on the gender composition of local authorities.  The report generally reflects the findings of a survey published by his Department in 1993 in relation to the position in local authorities in 1990.  At that time he indicated he considered it to be totally unacceptable that women were virtually absent from senior management in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights suggests a slight increase in the number of <Col N="1526" /> women in some management posts but the improvement is far from satisfactory and he hopes the joint committee's recommendations directed at the recruitment procedures and the internal promotion processes of local authorities will be given serious consideration.  It was clear from the 1993 report that few public bodies had specific equality objectives and his Department has asked that all public sector bodies should introduce equal opportunities policies.  The recommendations of the joint committee should serve to reinforce the need for proactive equal opportunities policies in local authorities and throughout the public service generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the report.  It is incredible that there are no women city or county managers or assistant city or county managers.  The representation of women in the higher echelons of senior management is disgraceful and while I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement in this regard, I would have preferred a more positive response about what can be done to address the problem.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights intends to circulate this report to various administrations, but reports are generally filed away and ignored.  What more positive steps will the Minister for Equality and Law Reform take to ensure the report's recommendations are acted on by the various administrations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform has written to all public sector bodies requesting them to introduce equal opportunities policies.  Members whose parties are represented on local authorities can highlight the matter at county council, health board or vocational education committee level.  The initiative rests with individual members of those councils or the parties represented on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A change in attitude is necessary in the various organisations, but this should not happen solely from a top <Col N="1527" /> down perspective.  People at all levels in county councils, health boards and so on should highlight the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that an important element of local and central administration is the interview system?  I know the Minister is not satisfied that only approximately 23 per cent of assistant principal posts and 12.1 per cent of principal posts are held by women.  How can we break through the system?  The Minister is correct in saying there is an attitude problem.  The main difficulty arises at assistant principal and principal levels in the Civil Service. While there is outside involvement in the interview system for assistant secretary and secretary posts, that is not the case for the posts of assistant principal and principal.  The same applies to equivalent posts in local administrations. The system should be much less introspective and less affected by internal attitudes.  Women from various businesses, with a keen eye for selecting the most suitable candidates, should be represented on interview boards.  The Minister should wear both hats to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>In referring to the Minister's other hat, I am sure the Deputy is referring to his statutory role in regard to the Civil Service appointments commission. He will convey his comments to the commissioners.  Because of their perception of their family responsibilities, when starting a family many young women may not put themselves forward with the same vigour as their male colleagues for such posts.  This should also be taken into account but he will consider the Deputy's suggestion constructively.</P>

      <P>As the Minister indicated to Deputy Keogh on 2 May last, initial contacts have been made with major Departments on a follow up survey to his Department's 1993 report on equal opportunities in the public sector.</P>
      <P>The high response to the survey reported in 1993 followed from careful preparation and close liaison with the main parent Departments involved.  In preparing for this survey, he has asked that every effort be made to have included the equal opportunities position in other public sector employments not previously surveyed.  This will involve preliminary preparation of appropriate data banks in such sectors. In addition, he has asked for information on the responses to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> request for the introduction of equal opportunities policies and programmes in all public sector employments.</P>
      <P>He welcomes the recent report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights entitled, <i>Women in Management in Local Administration.</i> His officials are examining this work in the context of reviewing the survey needs for the follow-up to the 1993 report.</P>
      <P>When consultations with the various Departments have been progressed more fully, he expects to be in a position to indicate more clearly the likely timescale for the carrying out of the survey.</P>

      <P>The Minister could have admitted to part of the difficulty in appointing women to senior positions.  I tabled that question last March but there has not been much further progress in preparing an update of the 1993 report.  If up-to-date information is not available it will be difficult for people to make a proper case for the appointment of women to senior positions.  I am disappointed the Minister's Department <Col N="1529" /> has not made any progress on the survey of equal opportunities in the public sector.  It is crucial that such information is readily available.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform should have that type of data available on a consistent basis.

The targets are far from achieved in the area of local administration and there is much to be done in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maintenance Act, 1994, came into operation on 25 November 1995.  On that date the UN Convention on the recovery abroad of maintenance entered into force as regards Ireland.  The EC Convention on the Simplification of Procedures for the Recovery of Maintenance has been ratified but it will not enter into force until it has been ratified by all the member states.  The 1994 Act enabled the State to ratify both conventions.</P>
      <P>Reciprocal arrangements under Part III of the 1994 Act for the recovery of maintenance between Ireland and each constituent state of the United States of America were brought into operation on 1 May 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am discharging the functions of the Central Authority provided under the Act to assist in the recovery of maintenance. The Authority liaises with authorities in other states for that purpose. To date, six applications under the Act for the recovery of maintenance from persons living abroad were received by my Department.  Five of them have been forwarded within the last seven weeks to the appropriate agencies in the <Col N="1531" /> states concerned and are being processed here.

All states of the United States of America are included. The cases to which I referred cover the following states: France, Alabama, Florida and the United Kingdom.  In regard to advertising, I am not sure what precise public information has been made available.  This legislation has been in operation since 1 May and I am sure all social welfare offices, relevant social support offices and the National Social Service Board has the relevant information. I will make inquiries on behalf of the Deputy and request the Department to write to him on that matter.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of the convention the Central Authority has been established under the aegis of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  It is particularly important to get the message across.  The Minister mentioned the Department of Social Welfare and other bodies.  Obviously, they have many outlets and contacts, which are very important, but they might not take the initiative; that must be taken by the Department.  That should be made very clear.  Since 1 May six applications have been made.  There were relations between the UK and other European countries before that date.  Has the Minister information on <Col N="1532" /> the number of cases that have arisen as a result of the previous position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to public information offices, the Department of Social Welfare, of which the Deputy has intimate knowledge, has a very extensive network of offices, as has the National Social Service Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, and that is the ideal instrument for the promotion of this information. Libraries and local authorities could also be used but probably not to the same positive effect.  The arrangements with the United Kingdom, which go back as far as 1974, are in no way altered by this legislation.  It has been decided by the Department of Equality and Law Reform that, for the time being, the function of the Central Authority will be vested in that Department until it sees what the volume of business is and whether it would be appropriate to transfer that function to another designated body.  The information available to me is that it is too early yet to form a view in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficulties encountered by women in having maintenance orders enforced? The onus is on the recipient of the order to pursue the matter through the courts and that causes great difficulty, upset and psychological damage to many women.  Will the Minister consider taking steps to alleviate that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the difficulties involved.  A case was brought to his attention recently of a woman living in his constituency who had previously been married to an employee of the New York Police Department.  A legal separation was agreed and the woman, who now lives in Ireland, received maintenance payments for a couple of months but payment then stopped.  The difficulty with information and enforcement was made very clear to him in that when he asked the woman for information &mdash; he presumed that attachment orders would be <Col N="1533" /> available in a public service office such as the New York Police Department &mdash; equivalent to the RSI number of the person in question and perhaps his serial number and rank within the police force, she had difficulty getting the information because it was not attached to the documentation relating to the court case.  After getting the information, which took some time, the case was processed through the good offices of the consul in New York and through his political contacts in New York city. He accepts that not every person will be in that position, but no individual citizen should have to go through that process. The assistance given by State agencies through the Central Authority is designed specifically to obviate the need for that kind of intercession.</P>

      <P>I am not sure the information the Deputy cited is accurate, nor am I sure that I gave it, as it does not appear to be in the documentation I have with me.

      <P>As to the appropriate Department to deal with the issue, it is reasonable, as the Minister suggested, that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should get the package together and the scheme up and running. However, the Department of Social Welfare is involved in bilateral <Col N="1534" /> agreements all over the world on social security matters and has a unit to deal with pension rights, invalidity, etc.  It also has a small unit for the collection of these moneys abroad, which was set up a few years ago and is making reasonable progress.  As it is that Department which makes the payments it uses this function a great deal, so it seems a suitable place from which to do this work also.  It has a mechanism in place and therefore appears to be the appropriate Department.  Perhaps it could be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would come to the same conclusion, although I am not necessarily well informed as to the precise detail.  Where an existing system is in operation with a body of experience from our many by bilateral agreements with other countries on social welfare and trans-frontier payments, that existing administration and body of expertise should be utilised.  Perhaps that could be done on an agency basis for the central authority which has the responsibility to implement this legislation.</P>

    <P>The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by Area Development Management or ADM Limited. This is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies established by the Government in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of the pilot child care scheme to determine its effectiveness in achieving its objectives is under way and the Minister is awaiting a report in the matter, which will be available later this year.  Discussions between officials of the Department and members of the staff of ADM are ongoing with regard to the 1996 allocation of grants under this schemes.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of any links which have been developed between the Department of Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, all of which have responsibility for child care? Is this pilot scheme being evaluated in conjunction with schemes from other Departments?</P>

      <P>The scheme applies to designated partnership areas of disadvantage and there is close co-operation between the various Government Departments and statutory agencies such as health boards and FÁS in respect of the integration and co-ordination of their work in those areas.  I therefore presume there is close co-operation and there certainly should be. That was the intention behind the establishment of the partnership areas, the broad representative nature of the boards, and the co-operation required for the operation of the companies under the various statutory agencies. Looking at the list of bodies and groups which have received money from this <Col N="1536" /> initiative, it is clear that others &mdash; such as Cherish, which is well connected with the Department of Health &mdash; would be aware of those needs and would have ongoing communication with them.</P>

      <P>The figure for this year is £800,000 and the total financial allocation to ADM amounts to £1.25 million towards the cost of grants for approved projects.  That is substantial funding from a standing start and we must now examine how effective it is.  It had a clear purpose and intention, which was to enable parents to re-enter the workforce, either directly or indirectly through the training route, by allowing them to devote their time and energy to it while having their child care requirements facilitated at local level, in many cases by locally trained neighbours. The scheme is now running long enough for the evaluation study to determine whether it is achieving the objectives for which it was established.</P>

      <P>The scheme is well directed in that it covers the areas of greatest disadvantage in the first instance.  Does the Minister agree that it is still, relatively speaking, a small amount of money for the whole country, as this is a major factor preventing women getting a share in the workplace, either full-time or even part-time?  In the evaluation, it would be important to look at the impact not only on disadvantaged areas but also on women throughout the country.  Many women are trying to get back into the workforce and while they are not from disadvantaged areas they are disadvantaged as individuals in their circumstances.  I ask the Minister to look at that aspect of the matter as this is in practice a widespread area of discrimination against women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money may appear relatively small and the range of grants is quite extraordinary &mdash; it runs from £350 to £88,000.  In some cases the money complements other public sector grants or public moneys made available to local communities. For example, in the Ringsend Community Centre a community child care playgroup has been established within an existing community building that is already in receipt of public sector funds and therefore the amount of money the playgroup receives is relatively small. The total effect of public support for many of these playgroups is therefore much larger than the figure of £800,000 might suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 58, 59, 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Parental Equality has, as one of its objectives, promotion of the concept of shared parenting of children in cases where parents separate.  He welcomes the work it is doing in this area.  However, there is no provision in his Department's Estimates for the funding of organisations such as Parental Equality.  The organisation has made representations to him on the subject of shared parenting and he has discussed its concerns with it. The matter is not without some difficulty and it would be misleading to suggest that there are easy solutions by way of any changes in the statutory provisions which apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> In the course of his reply to Question No. 41 on 26 March 1996, the Minister set out the context in which the present law operates and how the best arrangements for children can be aimed at by parents following the breakdown of their marriage.  In deciding issues concerning the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child the court must, under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. That important criterion, which is common to many other jurisdictions, is a matter which falls to be dealt with by the court in the context of all the circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>In the absence of agreement between the parents, the court will inevitably have to make hard and difficult decisions and almost always it will include the granting of custody to one parent and access to the other parent. That is the arrangement which seems to work well in most situations where each of the parents co-operates fully with the terms of the court order.  The court may grant joint custody of the child to the parents and his understanding is that it has done so in some cases.  Moreover, orders made by the court regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to a child are not final and may, upon application by either parent, be varied by the court if it is in the best interests of a child that a variation order be made.</P>
    <P>Of course, the best arrangement for all concerned is normally the one agreed by both parents without the need for court intervention.  The law is fully supportive of those arrangements.  Where judicial separation proceedings are in question, there is an obligation on solicitors to advise their clients of the possibility of entering into an agreement on the terms of their separation, including what should happen to the children.  The courts may adjourn separation or custody proceedings to allow parties to work out agreements in relation to their children.  The Family Mediation Service may be of assistance and is being <Col N="1540" /> developed to extend its services nationwide. Where the parties are entitled to legal aid the Legal Aid Board will, through its law centres, be in a position to assist parties in the drawing up of agreements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is bringing forward proposals to Government to update aspects of the law in relation to children, including guardianship.  The details of those changes, including any changes in relation to the subject matter of these questions, will be announced in the normal way in due course.  He will be glad to take into account any further representations which he may receive on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the position in the workplace has changed in recent years in that the number of women participating in it has risen dramatically to approximately 35 per cent and is continuing to rise?  This will lead to a new situation where the position of both parents will have to be considered.  The Minister said that the welfare of the child is of paramount importance, and we all agree with him. However, many men feel aggrieved and believe that the system operates against them.  I accept that in the majority of cases it is the man who is at fault, but the men who visit our clinics believe they do not get an equal share even though they do everything correctly.  I believe this is the point about which Parental Equality is concerned.  Will the Minister ensure that the issue of parental equality is given consideration in the preparation of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very supportive of this point and some time ago he met similar groups who expressed the concerns outlined by Deputy Woods.  In reply to an earlier question we referred to the need to change attitudes in terms of equal opportunities for women in the workplace.  There is an increasing need to change attitudes with regard to the positive parenting role men can play as fathers.  There is a traditional presumption that the mother is <Col N="1541" /> the better or more responsible parent in all cases.  Clearly this is not the case, and in some instances great harm and hardship has been caused to very responsible fathers who were deemed by the courts not to be responsible on the basis of the presumption that the mother was more responsible.  This is part of the thrust of the case being made by this organisation and others.  This matter will be taken fully on board in the reform of the Guardianship of Infants Act.  This is fully in line with the commitment to equality enunciated by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on numerous occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that the role of fathers as parents is acknowledged. We all know fathers who have virtually been excluded from the rearing of their children.  The mores within society which expect women to have the only parenting role mitigate against men who are exceptionally good fathers.  I was very glad to hear the Minister say that this matter would be addressed in the reform of the Guardianship of Infants Act.</P>

As the Minister indicated in response to parliamentary questions from Deputies Woods, Keogh, O'Malley, Kenneally and Sargent on 26 March last and, more recently, from Deputy Wallace on 5 <Col N="1542" /> June, this legislation has proven extremely complex and difficult.  Nevertheless, he can assure the Deputy that his Department and the advisory and legal drafting services of the Attorney General's office has been giving the Bill priority attention in recent months with a view to meeting the Government's legislation programme commitment for its publication during the current Dáil session.

      <P>As we all know, a tragic event occurred since we last assembled in this House.  I know I speak for all Members in condemning and deploring the murder of Detective Garda Gerry McCabe and the wounding of his colleague, Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan as absolutely reprehensible.</P>
      <P>We extend our sincere sympathy to their families, friends and members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> I am sure everything is being done by the Government, the Department of Justice and the Garda to bring those who perpetrated this horrendous act to justice but, despite denials, there appears to be a strong <i>prima facie</i> case that this action is linked with para-militaries. Those arguments being advanced about its sanctioning or otherwise are totally irrelevant as far as my party is concerned.  Whatever precise words may be used to condemn murder, all Members readily concede that their attitude to such an appalling act must be clear and unambiguous.  Indeed all Members have unequivocally condemned that act in intervening days.</P>
    <P>This awful tragedy yet again highlights that it is not credible to claim to be totally committed to the peaceful, democratic process on the one hand while, on the other, members of an associated armed organisation reserve the right to engage in violence whenever it suits them.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party I want to place on record &mdash; as I and a number of my colleagues have done publicly &mdash; and join other parties in extending our sympathies to the families concerned, the very least we can do.  Those who perpetrated this act, those who represent them and know them owe something more than the sympathy I can express within a few moments here.  It is our fervent hope that we shall not have to wait much longer to ascertain the attitude of those who can do something about eliminating a recurrence of the awful tragedy of last Friday morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the leaders of the various parties should make statements on this matter today. If ever there was a time for flexible, meaningful rules, it is on an occasion like this.  I am delighted we are being afforded that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extend on my own behalf and that of my party our sympathy to Detective Garda McCabe's widow, her family and <Col N="1644" /> friends.  I also want to convey my sympathy and best wishes to Detective Garda O'Sullivan and his family.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bertie Ahern said, there is no room for ambivalence in relation to such issues.  Anyone who falls short of condemning what happened on Friday last, the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána and the serious injury of another, cannot call themselves democrats.  One is either for or against violence; there is no grey area in between.</P>
    <P>Last weekend the Leader of Sinn Féin told us he felt cheated but the people who can rightly feel cheated are Ann McCabe, her family and the late Garda McCabe's relatives, friends and colleagues. The constitutional politicians here, in Britain, in the United States and elsewhere who have gone out of their way to bring Sinn Féin into the democratic peaceful process can also rightly feel cheated.  It is time the leadership of Sinn Féin made up its mind as people are fed up with its ambivalence.  It has an opportunity to ensure the restoration of the IRA ceasefire, to come into the democratic political process, to stop play acting and engaging in the political stunts we saw yesterday or be banished for all time to the political wilderness.  That is Sinn Féin's choice.  It is time it stopped condemning everyone else, the real condemnation we want from Sinn Féin is its condemnation of what happened last Friday.  We can draw clear conclusions if it fails to do that.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the Taoiseach's strong words today.  He is right.  Every decent-minded person, not only in this House but in the country, will fully agree with him.  Our heartfelt sympathy must be extended to the relatives and friends of a member of the Garda Síochána who &mdash; the first time in a decade &mdash; was murdered in the course of duty. That must make it clear to all of us that democratic politics is the way forward, that we do not want any play acting outside or inside the talks process, but <Col N="1645" /> compromise, reconciliation and adherence to democratic principles as the way forward.</P>

      <P>In compliance with the orders of the House I wish to express my appreciation for the support the Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Ahern, and the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, have put on the record.  As the House will be aware, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and President attended the funeral of the murdered garda in Limerick yesterday.  Their presence there reinforced their physical solidarity with the mourners of that city and the family and demonstrated the nation's total repugnance of the use of violence to advance any political ideal or aim, no matter how sincerely held or pungently argued.  There is only one road to the future for all peoples on this island, the road of peace which is wide enough to accommodate all political stands from every political tradition on this island as we travel together.  We will make no progress if the back-up of an armed paramilitary force is lurking in the shadows in the event that the process of democratic argument does not succeed in convincing one's opponents as to how best to share this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two garda were engaged in normal duty which we take for granted. They were protecting taxpayers' money which was being transported through Limerick to be distributed as social welfare payments to thousands of people in that part of the country.  They were shot in the course of duty, a duty that gardaí undertake daily.  We have taken their duty for granted in the past and this brutal murder should bring home to us how perilous their jobs will remain as long as the ambivalence about violence prevails <Col N="1646" /> on this island.  There can be no soft hiding place or cosy corner for the ambivalence which encouraged this type of activity.  Its ultimate conclusion is the murder of servants of this State who have served us very well.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a separate and unrelated matter.  Based on what the Minister for Finance said on today's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme about the Gaming and Lotteries Act, will he clarify whether a legislative change or another interpretation of the existing legislation is required in this area?  Those who have heard some of today's radio programmes will be aware that many trades have built up in this area.  Some shops which sell Irish lottery tickets are also selling UK lottery tickets, shops which do not have a licence to sell Irish lottery tickets are selling UK lottery tickets, others are selling them through an agent for a fee and it is difficult to establish what that fee represents. I am concerned that under our legislation a large trade in the sale of such tickets will develop.  If the Minister considers such retailers are operating outside the law, he should outline how it is proposed such illegal trade may be stopped.  I was the first Deputy to raise this matter in the House several weeks ago because of the large trade in the sale of UK lottery tickets in Dublin city and I have been informed that this trade has increased around the country.  How does the Minister intend to deal with this matter?</P>

      <P>There was a presumption that new or amending legislation might be required, but on detailed examination that is not the case.  Retailers selling lottery tickets for lotteries not authorised in this State, which includes the UK lottery, are in breach of the law. The Department of Justice has instructed the Garda to take whatever action is necessary to ensure compliance with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> The UK lottery took action against German lotteries which attempted to sell German lottery tickets in the UK jurisdiction.  European free trade internal market provisions do not extend to national lotteries.  It is a misconception to believe that because UK lottery is a European Union lottery it is subject to regulations governing the internal market and, consequently free trade.  That is not the case.  The almost 1,500 retailers who are selling UK lottery tickets are in breach of the law at a revenue cost to lottery proceeds of approximately £20 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned on the last occasion, I spoke about the disappointment of people of the north side of Dublin that the north side had not been included in Phase I.  I expressed the hope that the publication of the consultant's report mentioned in the media will result in a change and that the north side line will be reinstated in Phase I.</P>
      <P>Even if that does not happen, it is important that Phase I should at least take in Parnell Square.  There needs to be some order and sense in the implementation of this scheme.  At present one Minister, Deputy Enda Kenny, is planning a national convention centre at the top of O'Connell Street on the site of the old Carlton cinema, and another Minister, Deputy Lowry, is planning a light rail system which is to stop at the other end of the same street.  That is ludicrous.  I hope the north side line will be included in Phase I, but if planning and organisation mean anything, Phase I should go up O'Connell Street and around Parnell Square.  There are many tourist attractions on Parnell Square &mdash; the Municipal Art Gallery, the Writers' Museum, the Garda of Remembrance. That part of town has lost its tourist office.  It is important, therefore, that it is not cut off.  In the context of the location of the proposed convention centre, it would be sensible and logical that Parnell Square should be included in Phase I.  I would like to think, too, that the line would take in Bus Áras and Connolly Station, the main interchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about consultation, about which there is much concern. Some people will not be happy no matter what one does for them, but the Minister is relying very much on the <Col N="1651" /> Railway Works Order.  This may have worked well in the 18th century when railways were being laid across country, but I wonder if it will work as well in the context of an inner city operation in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>I worked in CIE and I do not intend to slag any of my ex-colleagues there. The engineers are fine dedicated people who do a wonderful job.  If one wants a railway line laid, they are the people to do it.  However, I am concerned that, as of now, we do not know which section of CIE is to operate it.  Will it be Iarnród Éireann or Dublin Bus?  The operator ought to have a major say in how the railway line is laid.  They might be arms of the same company, but the railway operator has different criteria to those of the bus operator.  A decision on that should be made and made quickly.  It is vital that the division who will operate the system should be involved in the consultations from an early date.  It is crazy to introduce something and we do not know whether a bus or a train driver will drive it.  I can assure the House that there will be arguments down the line with trade unions, etc.  We may as well have those soon rather than waiting until the system has been built in five years time when we will have to face industrial problems about who will drive the trains.  My concern relates not just to the drivers but to management and standards that professional operators will require.  I hope there will be an early decision on who will run the system.</P>
    <P>In the context of planning permission, I can see why the Minister does not want procedures duplicated.  However, if the necessity for planning permission is pushed aside, we see the sort of thing that happened in his Department when Telecom Éireann began putting up Eircell masts.  Sadly, organisations are inclined to lose common sense if given unlimited authority.  Telecom Éireann lost perspective when it got permission under a special directive two years ago to put up masts, and erected masts in places where they should not have been <Col N="1652" /> erected.  I am concerned about such authority being given to anybody.  I accept that we will have the EIS and a public inquiry.  However, as happened in relation to the Dublin Port tunnel, residents groups see the mechanics of this system as very formal &mdash; they feel they cannot have a meaningful input into it. They see the EIS as the establishment telling them how to proceed.  The Minister might feel everything is being done in an orderly manner, but that is not their perception.  Not alone must things be done fairly, they must be seen to be done fairly.  There is great concern about that, and residents' associations do not feel they are getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>I am concerned too about the expectations being raised.  We are talking about two or three lines.  Some people may expect too much from it.  Even when we get three lines it will not change the world.  I looked at an Irish Rail calendar some months ago which depicted Blackrock in the year 1902 and Terenure Cross in 1904 &mdash; there seemed to be tram lines all over the place.  Now, in 1996 we are talking about putting down three lines and we think that will solve all our problems.  I welcome it and hope it happens.  It will be of some benefit. However, I want to calm people's wildest hopes that if we spend £200 million our traffic problems will be laid to rest.  LRT will be but a fraction of the tram lines we had in the city at the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a change in the implementation of Phase I.  Even if there is not, and we get the north-side line in Phase II or Phase Ia.  I hope there will be serious consideration given to bringing it at least up to and around Parnell Square.  I would ask also that the Minister pay attention to consultation because, at the end of the day, it will prove worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  That a considerable portion of the proposed line from Tallaght to O'Connell Street will come through a densely populated <Col N="1653" /> area in terms of business makes it a matter of considerable interest and concern to me.  I hope there will be maximum consultation and minimum disturbance and inconvenience to the business community and to those living in the inner city during the development.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications may authorise by order the construction, operation and maintenance by CIE of the light railway system serving the greater Dublin area.  Effectively the Minister is taking on to himself powers that in normal circumstances would be under the jurisdiction of the local authorities. I would appreciate an explanation as to why this is necessary.  Dublin Corporation will face difficulties as a result of this proposal.</P>
      <P>Effectively, minimum interference will be caused by the proposed line in Dublin South County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, so planning will not be a major problem in those areas. If the line is to proceed on the northside beyond Ballymun, part of Fingal County Council will be affected.  As only one county council area will be affected in Phase I, it should be possible to allow normal planning procedures to run their course.  That could be done with the package of proposals for each of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that those who represent the wards through which the lines will run should have the opportunity of analysing and teasing out the case and having local communities present their case at local authority level.  The procedure adopted by the Minister will not allow that even though the order will require an environmental impact study to be presented and a public inquiry to take place, to which the public can make submissions.  In essence that is different from the local authority having the authority to process the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is traffic chaos in Dublin.  The city is booming and there has been an enormous increase in traffic to the port since its industrial relations were streamlined.  The growth in traffic to the port increases daily, badly affecting the <Col N="1654" /> quays, and commuter traffic and heavy goods vehicles are gridlocked.  We have to deal with the problem.  We have been slow in European terms in providing suitable urban infrastructure to move traffic from our narrow streets.  It would be ideal to pedestrianise the core of the city which would make it much more attractive to dwell in.  The previous policy of development in greenfield areas has been changed and considerable urban residential redevelopment is taking place.  The inner city will be an attractive environment with the pedestrianisation of the area between the canals.  The ring road will be critical to enable traffic to skirt the city.</P>
    <P>The DART is the only efficient mode of public transport that makes it more attractive for people to use this service than to bring their cars into the heart of the city.  Major congestion has been eliminated on the coastline route it serves, but the service has not been extended throughout the city, which is a pity because it is a comfortable, efficient and effective service.</P>
    <P>Another approach to traffic management is the proposed tunnel system, which initially appeared ideal because it does not interfere with over ground systems but the Austrian method of drilling is not the most successful method to have been developed in the past decade. There is a question mark as to its desirability in areas where it has been used and an outcry from residents in those areas.  It would be a very serious setback to eliminating congestion in the city if the central artery of the plan did not proceed.</P>
    <P>The quality bus corridor is being developed but that gives rise to accessibility problems in areas with narrow streets.  People who live in these areas are very unhappy that freeways have to be provided constantly.  None of the proposals to date have been successful in clearing the city of traffic.  The light rail is the latest proposal and I support it.  It will benefit us by bringing a large volume of commuter traffic into the heart of the city but it has a considerable number of drawbacks because it <Col N="1655" /> was approached in isolation without a definite attempt to integrate it into the existing public transport network.  It was developed in a lopsided fashion without any consideration for Phase I taking in the northside of the city which would be desirable in the first place.</P>
    <P>A number of decisions have been made purely on financial grounds.  Even at this late stage the Government should consider making a number of relatively minor changes which would be of enormous benefit.  As Deputy Ahern said, the IRT should not stop in O'Connell Street in the heart of the city but continue around Parnell Square. Unlike other areas where opposition has been encountered, this would be in keeping with the great desire of the business community in the area.  I understand the only reason it will not continue around Parnell Square is lack of finance, despite the short distance involved.  It is only appropriate that it should, particularly if the Ballymun line, on which a decision has yet to be made, does not go ahead.</P>
    <P>There is a failure to link the Tallaght line, via O'Connell Street.  Abbey Street or Talbot Street, with the existing public transport terminals at Busáras in Store Street and Connolly Station from which the railway lines to Belfast.  Sligo and other parts of the country run.  Connolly is also a major station on the DART line.  The distance involved is short.  This should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The failure to use existing railway lines on the north side of the city surprises me.  Interestingly, the old Harcourt Street line and the Heuston line on the south side will be used.  None of the lines on the north side, including the Broadstone, Connolly and Drumcondra lines, is being considered.  It is as if little thought has been given to it.  This displays blinkered vision.  An underground link between Heuston and Connolly stations should have been considered.</P>
    <P>The Ballymun line has been left out of the equation.  This is a strange decision.  I am glad, however, that a <Col N="1656" /> socio-economic evaluation of the line which meets all the criteria is to be completed within 12 weeks by Goodbody economic consultants and Oscar Faber international transport consultants.  It seems the Tallaght line will remain intact.  They will assess the long-term return to the local economy, evaluate the permanent effect on local economic performance, the contribution to exploiting local development potential, the ability to reintegrate the long-term unemployed into the economic mainstream and combat social exclusion.  I will be surprised if they do not recommend the inclusion of the Ballymun line in the initial phase.</P>
    <P>In the heart of the city and densely populated areas work on the LRT will cause major disruption and inconvenience to both small and large businesses. It is important, therefore, that the best routes are chosen to cause the minimum of inconvenience and disruption. I understand work will continue on each street for at east two years.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed line from Heuston Station to O'Connell Street considerable hostility has been encountered from residents and some members of the business community in Arran Quay Terrace, Chancery Street and Mary's Abbey.  Part of the reason is that there was little or no consultation with the local community, apart from the distibution of a leaflet outlining what would happen.  It was difficult to make out the proposed route on the small map provided.  Many of the problems might have been solved if CIE had taken its responsibilities seriously and organised a series of meetings to outline the proposed route and the implications for residents, but this has not happened.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to demolish seven of the ten houses on Arran Quay Terrace. The lives of the residents of the remaining there will hardly be worth living as the line will run close to their bedroom window.  The same applies in Mary's Abbey and Chancery Street.  This is a source of considerable concern to residents.</P>
    <P>There are alternatives.  Prior to the <Col N="1657" /> implementation of a ministerial order giving effect to CIE's package of proposals there should be consultation to choose the best route, given that people's livelihoods are at stake.  The preferred route would run along North King Street where CIE acquired many properties by way of compulsory purchase order when it planned to build the inner city tangent which is not going ahead.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to demolish a number of houses in Old Kilmainham on the south side of the Liffey.  Work on the proposed route will cause disruption to an extensive core of businesses backing on to the Camac, placing up to 600 jobs at risk.  Again there is an alternative. The preferred route would run along Davitt Road by the canal.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being passed to facilitate CIE in terms of organising and processing the implementation of the light rail system.  We must ensure in advance that we obtain the preferred option of people in the affected areas. On Committee Stage we must consider the inclusion of a right of appeal and a level of compensation, both of which are available in countries where this type of light rail proposal has been implemented.</P>

      <P>I must express my concern and disapointment about the handling of statements relating to the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill.  1996. There seems to have been conflict with regard to information, research and consultation even before it entered the public domain.  I was surprised by the comments of the previous speaker, a Labour Party backbencher, who stated where the line should run through parts of his constituency.  Last week a Fine Gael backbencher, Deputy Jim Mitchell, expressed his opposition to the proposed route and gave his view as to how <Col N="1658" /> the light rail plan should be implemented.  I am surprised that there seems to be no consultation between the Government and its backbenchers.  If Members will excuse the pu, the proposed legislation seems to have been &ldquo;railroaded&rdquo; through.</P>

      <P>I am equally concerned about the consultation process with the public and those who will be affected by the proposed routes.</P>
      <P>My party's spokesman expressed his genuine concern about the measures contained in the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill, 1996.  It seems the Bill will create more problems than it will solve.  For that reason the Fianna Fáil Party regretfully cannot support the Bill as drafted but it recognises the need to improve our public service transport system, particularly in Dublin.  As a northsider I wish to ensure that the improvements carried out will be of equal benefit to commuters in the north, south and west of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications seems to be serious about his proposal to, by and large, exclude the north side of the city from the provisions of the Bill.  I am baffled by the fact that the people responsible for drafting this legislation chose to ignore completely the north side of the city and the 9 million passengers who commute from Dublin Airport on an annual basis.  That is one of the principal benchmarks which should have helped in choosing <Col N="1659" /> the direction and routing of the actual rail lines.</P>
    <P>I am also frustrated that, for some time, there has been much discussion about a proposed convention centre.  I see that the Minister of State is laughing.</P>

      <P>Under two years ago, the Minister of State and many of his current Government colleagues tabled parliamentary questions demanding that the convention centre proceed.  One of his colleagues pulled the rug in relation to the RDS&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was recently suggested that the convention centre should be situated in the area of Parnell Square, through which the proposed light rail system does not pass.  These are crucial benchmarks when considering the siting of a light rail system.  Surely proposals for developments that would attract large gatherings of people or areas where there is an identified need or requirement for public service transport should be taken into consideration in this regard.</P>
      <P>I ask that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications clarify how the proposed system will work.  All Members have been lobbied by business houses and residents in the Kilmainham area who have indicated that the system will not work.  There has been public debate on this issue in the national print media.  If the Minister is unable to respond in detail in the House, I would appreciate if he could respond in writing to my queries on all aspects of the proposed system.  If he cannot deal with certain aspects, perhaps the Minister would indicate why this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members recognise that there will be a certain amount of congestion in the city.  Questions have been posed with <Col N="1660" /> regard to how long it will take to construct the light rail system, how it will be put in place and what compensation, if any, will be offered to businesses which may be affected or forced to close or move permises.  These isues must be clarifed.  Like other Members, I received submissions from individual residents, residents associations, business houses and group business houses in the city, expressing their concern about public perceptions of the proposed light rail system.  These people are also concerned about the safety aspect of the proposed route compared to other light rail routes.</P>
    <P>The public consultation process, as distinct from the political party consultation process which seems to be nil, must meet the needs of the public and adequately assure people that there is proper consultation.  In this context, genuine concerns have been expressed that ordinary citizens cannot approach consultants who have the benefit of major support and back-up.  Regardless of the envisaged public consultation process, I ask the Government to consider how it intends to put in place a process in which people will be able to participate.</P>
    <P>There is currently a proposal to site the Dublin Port access route in my constituency and a public consultation process exists in this regard.  In the course of deliberations on the proposed tunnel, Australian consultants, PR consultants and the weight and might of Dublin Corporation, with its secretarial, professional, architectural supports, were employed.  I received telephone calls from three women living in Marino who complained of drilling outside their houses which had caused structural damage and who were advised, following an inspection, that if they wished they could consult a solicitor who would fight each case on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>I tabled motions to City Hall in relation to providing financial assistance not only to individuals but to residents' associations affected by any of these proposals but particularly by the port tunnel proposal, thereby ensuring that <Col N="1661" /> they would be in a position to fight might with might.  That would have ensured there was a level playing pitch, but unfortunately such funding is not available.  That is a problem we must seriously evaluate with a view to putting in place a system that would be recognised as part of a consultation process.</P>
    <P>If we are putting forward a proposal which has all the support services in place, it is equally important we have a process in place that recognises the concerns of the people affected and which would allow them tap into whatever professional advice was available.  We cannot expect people who may be on a limited income to come up with the funding for professional reports necessary to fight their case.</P>
    <P>When power is given to a Minister it is frustrating to see it being passed on to another body.  Killester DART station is an enormous success but problems have arisen in relation to commuters parking their cars at the station.  This problem is causing frustration among local residents. I wrote to the Minister in this regard but he replied that it was a matter for Iarnród Éireann.  Iarnród Éireann has said it does not have the necessary resources to address the problem. Following a great deal of pressure from me and others the Minister announced that he will fund the Fair-view DART station but not the parking facility.</P>
    <P>In regard to the problem of taxis, there should be co-ordination.  Incentives should be provided to taxi operators in relation to the types of car that can be used and the VRT to encourage them to use top of the range models. Some taxi owners use these models but there are no subsidies available in that regard.  We should recognise taxi owners and the excellent service they provide.  I would also like to see an extension of the Nitelink service, particularly in Dublin, as well as the cycle paths.</P>

      <P>The chaos we are experiencing in Dublin is directly related to a planning failure in the past <Col N="1662" /> to integrate proper land use with road building and public transport provision. We are now at crisis point but we are fortunate that funds have been allocated from Europe to allow us put in place measures to alleviate the chaos we are experiencing.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats has long favoured the provision of a rapid rail transit service for Dublin and we continue to do so.  It is clear to everybody that the city is choking with traffic congestion which has a damaging effect on tourism, business and the general quality of life of our citizens living in the city and suburban areas.</P>
      <P>Like other major European cities, Dublin needs a fast, efficient and reliable public transport system.  We are fortunate the EU is making funding available for a major upgrading of our public transport services in Dublin.  Such a proposal could not have been contemplated had we to fund it from our own resources.  If taxpayers were funding this project totally and if the major expenditure being proposed to be spent on it was coming from our own resources, we would have a much energetic debate in this House on the proposed project.</P>
      <P>It is vital we make the best possible use of the money available to us, otherwise we will squander a never to be repeated opportunity to solve Dublin's transportation problems.  This funding has given us the chance to construct a state of the art rail rapid transit system for Dublin.  The Progressive Democrats believe it must satisfy basic criteria if it is to be successful, the first of which is that it must serve both sides of the city. It must be fit for the purpose for which it was originally planned, namely, to provide all sides of the city with proper public transportation.  It must serve the largest possible population catchment. It must be integrated with the existing DART system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello expressed concern that there has been a blinkered debate on certain aspects of the proposals and that we were being led to believe the powers that be are not for changing on <Col N="1663" /> these important details.  That is unfortunate because once the Bill has passed through this House we will lose responsibility for the detail &mdash; the actual impact on the ground &mdash; of the proposals.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed also by people who question certain aspects of the proposals that their questions are greeted with a plea for immunity from public debate for fear of losing the funding. That is a rather immature way to respond to legitimately voiced concerns of Deputies on all sides of the House in regard to the details of the current proposals.</P>
    <P>The proposed system should offer a significant improvement in speed and reliability over bus services.  The proposal the Minister is supporting fails to satisfy any of the criteria I have mentioned.  We are in danger of being saddled with an ill-conceived system that will not be suitable for its intended purposes.  We may be about to spend several hundred million pounds on a project which will do little to improve transport services for the vast majority of Dubliners.  It is important that careful consideration is given to the issues involved before we pass the point of no return.  Many Deputies are concerned that we will lose control of the detail of the final project as it impacts on our citizens once the Bill goes through the House.</P>
    <P>A socio-economic evaluation has been promised and there may be a recommendation that the Ballymun route should proceed, but that would be a tragedy if it were to be at the expense of one of the routes on the south side. The DTI proposal &mdash; in which I had a democratic input as a member of Dublin City Council &mdash; recommended three routes, not two.  What we are getting from the Government is a selective implementation of the lengthy DTI study and of the strategy we all endorse democratically.  For that reason there is great unease that we are not getting what we signed up for in the DTI.</P>
    <P>The planned system will not serve the north side of the city.  Some 40 per cent <Col N="1664" /> of Dublin's population will be excluded entirely from its benefits.  The people of Ballymun are to be denied a rapid rail service on the ludicrous grounds that they do not have enough cars to leave at home.  The needs of the airport are also being ignored.  The planned system will not be integrated with the existing DART service.  Dublin will be one of the few cities anywhere with two different rapid rail transit systems run by two different companies with no interchange between them.</P>
    <P>The planned system will run along the street for almost half of its entire length. This means we will have the equivalent of the Dublin-Cork railway running through the streets of Dublin.  A twin track rail line will go down the middle of the Naas Road through the Mount Brown area to the city centre, along Mary Street, Henry Street, O'Connell Street, College Green, Westmoreland Street, Nassau Street, Dawson Street and St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>The road space available to cars, cyclists and delivery vehicles will be severely reduced.  At each major junction 35 tonne trains, 90 feet long, will be competing with other traffic for the right of way.  Whole streets will have to be demolished to make room for the railway lines.  Some inner city communities may be destroyed completely.  This policy of official destruction flies in the face of everything we have been trying to do and say about the need to develop Dublin as a living city.  The destruction caused during construction will be immense.  It has been said that we have to accept the pain for the long-term benefits.  Sufficient consideration is not being given to the question of damage limitation in regard to that disruption. There will be necessary disruption but the powers that be are not for turning on key aspects of it.  The consultation process is inadequate.  There is a blinkered approach which is saying, &ldquo;this is going ahead, there is nothing you can do about it, our minds are made up&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The cost will be about £3 million per mile.  The cost of relocating services has not been included in the Luas budget. <Col N="1665" /> Who will pick up the tabs for this work which could be as high as £40 million?</P>
    <P>The fact that Dundrum is to be served with a line which is to stop at Dundrum village is chaotic.  Any sensible person with an objective view of the line and its benefits would say it should be extended to Sandyford because Dundrum would be destroyed as a result of the present proposal.  It is a major disadvantage that the proposed system is not to be integrated with the DART, and there are many other disadvantages which have been outlined by my party's spokesperson.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the British newspaper, <i>The Independent,</i> outlined the fact that Sheffield, to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks as one of the examples of successful light rail, is a complete flop.  What will the Minister say now about Sheffield, which has proven to be a disaster?  There it was cheaper to take buses and the public refused to use a system which was competing with traffic?</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response.  It appears there is little room to manoeuvre in respect of the details. We will be opposing the legislation as framed.  Even if we try to amend it on Committee Stage there will be no control over the detail of the routes.</P>

      <P>I share some of the concerns expressed by the previous speaker in regard to the details but Deputy O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats is trying to have it every way.  I would like to see the Progressive Democrats design a light rail system which would serve the maximum population and yet not run into problems of disruption during construction.  The alternative to going through junctions is go around them, under them or avoid main streets.  The design of a light rail <Col N="1666" /> system is never easy and will cause disruption during construction.</P>
      <P>In my J1 visa days I recall spending a week in San Francisco which was a major disappointment, because of the disruption caused by the installation of an underground system.  It was disruptive and unattractive during construction but they are reaping the benefits since.  Every city has to accept disruption as they expand and develop their transport systems.  There is an incoherence in the approach of the Progressive Democrats.  They want a better system available to everybody all over the city but somehow with less disruption.</P>
      <P>To suggest that this House should have control of detailed design is a nonsense. Obviously that issue should be handled at a different level.  I share some of the concerns about a democratic deficit in the context of the procedure being used here which is similar to a motorway system for implementing these schemes.  When engineers or designers are fixed on a design, regardless of the level of opposition, it is extremely difficult to have changes made.  We are fighting battles on the north side in respect of the design and the route of the tunnel.  We are aware we can delay it but we do not want to do that.  We want a design that is agreed by the communities.  Most of the cards are stacked on the side of those who are proposing and building the structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I broadly welcome the Bill which provides for light rail.  Some additional form of public transport, an extension of the DART, is essential for the city which is growing and developing and shows no sign of stopping.  There is enormous further potential for growth. In a newspaper article in the past week Dublin was referred to as a doughnut city with only 30 per cent occupancy in the inner city area.  Anybody who has been watching developments in the inner city knows there has been a dramatic change with enormous potential for a further increase in population. There has been a serious lack of provision on many fronts for that population expansion.  The development of a <Col N="1667" /> light rail system is desirable if the city is to be alive and have a heart.  If it is to be sustained there is no way in which the city can provide, on the road, for the increased number of cars as the main mode of transport for citizens in and around the city.  No other capital city in Europe has been able to do so.  Clearly, therefore, there must be substantial development in public transport.  I welcome the Minister's sense of urgency in respect of this Bill but while it is urgent we should not rush it.</P>
    <P>We on the northside are interested, excited and pleased by the unexpected intervention of the EU Commission in the person of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in regard to the analysis of the priority to be given to the different lines.  What is proposed is a three-link system, which includes Ballymun, and that has always been the case, but it was a question of phasing.  The Progressive Democrats are not correct in suggesting there is no commitment to the northside. Given EU intervention I am confident that there is increased planning and preparation for the northside link and I welcome that wholeheartedly.  It was more than we had expected because we had campaigned in the context of the Structural Funds particularly for the port access tunnel.  A large number of residents' associations had come together from a widespread area over the northside of the city seeking that investment because it was considered that the Drumcondra-Swords Road route was incapable of sustaining its present traffic levels and certainly could not support increased public transport without being relieved of some of the heavy port traffic by way of the tunnel. Having received a financial commitment of more than £100 million towards the tunnel, it was more than we could have dreamed of to have been included in the priority area for the light rail system. In that context, there was a certain political acceptance of the phasing announced by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Kenny's constituency borders mine and we have a mutual <Col N="1668" /> interest in the local partnerships in our areas.  They have identified a great need for substantial investment in public transport.  We welcome and support the reassessment under way at present.</P>
    <P>I take no pleasure in setting our route against those to Tallaght or along the old Harcourt Street line.  The Tallaght line would qualify under all the social criteria and the Harcourt Street line qualifies under other criteria.  It is an historic route for which many Dubliners have much affection.  I support the reanalysis of the Ballymun line and I hope it will lead, to all the routes proceeding at a faster pace.</P>
    <P>The Ballymun case is significant.  We have not had the same detailed analysis of potential routes as the other areas. However, there is a clear need for such a service.  The EU Commission is putting emphasis on long-term unemployment as a key criterion and under that there is no doubt that our area qualifies. This line would serve a deprived area between Ballymun, Coolock and Darndale which has a population of 106,000 &mdash; larger than Galway and Waterford cities combined.  One in three people is unemployed, a rate which is double the national average, and two-thirds left education before the leaving certificate.  Gamma consultants devised a deprivation index of one to ten and the areas concerned scored eight, nine or ten.</P>
    <P>Local partnerships in the area have identified a major desirable project for industrial development near the airport and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment made an announcement this week in this regard.  The link to Ballymun and the airport via the light rail are important elements in the future development of these areas of great need on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>The people of the area rely heavily on public transport, a fact which, depending on one's analysis, may be positive or negative from their perspective. If the objective is seen as taking traffic off the road it may work against <Col N="1669" /> them; if the objective is social development and employment creation this is positive for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review, although it may cause some headaches for the Government if it comes out in favour of the Ballymun link.  I hope the Government will have the headaches and on the north side of Dublin will benefit doubly from the investment in roads and public transport.</P>
    <P>We have been lobbied strongly by those who believe we should have an underground system.  My experience of the port access tunnel plan leads me to dispute any claim that a tunnelling system would be less controversial than a ground level system.  Difficulties have been experienced in the areas in which the port access tunnel is to be built with regard to access, pollution, ventilation and tunnelling methods.  An underground system would not be easier to achieve; it would be as disruptive as an overground system.  It is misleading to present it as an easy option.  The present proposal fails to integrate the new system with existing public transport in the city, particularly the DART.  We will have the benefit of examining schemes in other cities and experience indicates that there must be integration with other major public transport systems. Design details are being considered at present.  Those in Iarnród Éireann involved in supervising the design and managing the public consultation process must take these elements into consideration.</P>
    <P>Disruption is unavoidable, although every effort will be made to minimise it. The work will begin in the suburban areas and will continue into the central areas which will cause more difficulty.  It has been suggested that one cannot have the light rail trams and cars running on the streets.  The Amsterdam tram system runs along the major streets and most cities have a major part of their light rail overground.</P>
    <P>There may be simpler routes for the lines.  There is a simple line through the north side of the city but it would be distant from centres of population.  It is <Col N="1670" /> difficult to find routes that will achieve the two objectives of minimum disruption and maximum service.  Every effort should be made to meet local needs, as has been the case with road and motorway schemes in the past.  It is essential that the new light rail system is integrated with the other public transport systems.  These changes and a positive result from the review of the Ballymun link will provide a satisfactory system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill implements the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  The Dublin Transportation Office's report to the Minister for the Environment last month sets out the means of achieving the vision for Dublin as defined in the DTI's final report.  It states:</P>
      <P>... to reinforce Dublin's status as a leading European city by ensuring improved access for all against a pro public transport background.  The city must remain the heart of the region and must not be allowed to stagnate as access becomes more difficult as a consequence of land use policy in neighbouring counties.  Growth in employment in activities in the centre city must be maintained without generating an increase in car trips.</P>
      <P>The key question is the type of transport infrastructure needed to help realise this vision.  An investment of £200 million is being provided under the 1994-99 transport operational programme for the LRT network.  The Dublin Transport Office is satisfied in the context of this programme that the LRT lines approved in principle by the Government are more readily implementable in the time scale of the programme and represent a greater potential for a shift from private cars to public transport.  It is equally satisfied that an on-street light rail option better meets the DTI's vision for Dublin than an underground system.  It notes the development of many on-street light rail systems throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTI strategy also recommended an extension and upgrading of the <Col N="1671" /> DART and suburban rail services.  I welcome the proposed refurbishment of Kilbarrack DART station and the contribution this work will make to enhancing the environment of the surrounding area.  I support the case for the extension of the DART to Malahide and I call for the provision of a new DART station at Baldoyle Bridge to relieve traffic congestion in the Baldoyle-Donaghmeade area.  This railway bridge was part of the original Baldoyle station and it is being reconstructed with EU funding as part of the Grange road improvement scheme to improve access from the northern cross route to Baldoyle industrial estate.  Due to the growth of new housing estates in the area, access to the DART is vital to ease traffic on the existing road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The DTI is currently evaluating the provision of a conventional rail link between Dublin Airport and the Dublin-Belfast rail line, which I strongly support.  Dublin is the only European capital city without a rail link to its airport and with the number of passengers using the airport set to reach almost nine million this year, the provision of a rail link to the rail network would enable travellers to continue their onward journeys by rail.  The extension of the LRT to Ballymun and Dublin Airport should be a priority to achieve a north-south balance in the network.</P>
    <P>The DTI report sets out the need for public transport interchange facilities in the city centre.  These are necessary between the LRT network and mainline rail and provincial bus services to reduce delays for commuters and tourists. To facilitate a higher level of passenger interchange and an integrated fare structure and ticketing system an investment of £4 million has been recommended by the DTI.  A traffic management plan in the vicinity of Busáras and the Custom House dock site is crucial to facilitate better movement of buses leaving the city centre.</P>
    <P>The DTI strategy recognises the role of feeder buses in linking people with <Col N="1672" /> the LRT network and rail routes.  The current system of feeder buses serving DART stations has been successful in switching commuters from cars to public transport.  There are two DART stations in Dublin north-east which operate successful feeder bus services. At Harmonstown station a feeder bus enables commuters from Airfield. Darndale and Priorswood to gain access to DART services and at Sutton station a feeder bus service connects Baldoyle, Portmarnock and Malahide.</P>
    <P>For a light rail network to be successful it must be part of an integrated and co-ordinated strategy dealing with traffic management, car parking and quality bus corridors.  Effective compliance with and enforcement of traffic parking laws is essential to the successful implementation of the DTI strategy. The most acute traffic congestion is currently caused by commuters travelling to an from the inner city cordon between the canals at morning and evening peak times.  The city is effectively gridlocked during traffic peak hours and failure to address these issues would undermine the DTI strategy.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Chamber of Commerce, which is part of the roads lobby, has adopted a negative attitude to the light rail proposals and is exaggerating any temporary disruption which may be caused by the construction of the light rail system.  To gain a balanced approach, it should examine the success of light rail systems in Manchester, Grenoble and other European cities. Critics of light rail refer to the experience in Sheffield where there was not an integrated approach to traffic management or public transport.  Bus services in Sheffield were deregulated before the construction of light rail and when this happened passengers switched to private cars which put pressure on the road space required to develop the light rail system.  Lessons have been learned from the mistakes in Sheffield.  It is also worth noting that the Dublin City Centre Business Association has warmly welcomed the light rail proposals.  The Government has decided <Col N="1673" /> there should be a director of traffic for the corporation area to take over responsibility from the gardaí and traffic wardens for on-the-spot fines and towaway services in the capital.</P>
    <P>The DTI set itself performance targets of a peak hour target of 50 per cent and an off-peak target of 35 per cent of all trips to the city centre by public transport by the year 2001.  It also predicts that accidents will have reduced to 90 per cent of the current level by then and there will be real reduction in pollution levels generated by all forms of transportation over the next 20 years.  It is vital that any strategy is open to new ideas and approaches and is to the forefront in assessing new technologies and initiatives that may affect transport in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The Luas proposal, involving a core light rail network made up of lines to Tallaght and Cabinteely via the Harcourt line and to Ballymun and Finglas via the Broadstone railway line and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords, has been recommended by the DTI.  This represents a major infrastructural development for the city and will involve a massive investment of some £200 million in transport with much of the funding coming from European Union sources under the operational programme on transport.  The project will have a major impact on the citizens of Dublin and must be welcomed in principle.  As the proposal is now before us it would be almost impossible to reject it out of hand.  Nevertheless, I am not sure alternative routes were given due consideration or that the finer details of the project were fully examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of public consultation has been hopelessly inadequate to date.  The project will involve major disturbance and disruption to residents and businesses and will cause major traffic disruption, particularly during the construction stage.  The Bill gives sweeping powers to CIE in this regard.  The provisions on consultation and community <Col N="1674" /> involvement are not satisfactory.  The contents of the Bill are needlessly legalistic and bureaucratic.  The project will succeed only if there is adequate negotiation with a real attempt to achieve consensus on the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied the LRT system will be fully integrated into the overall public transport system of the city.  That matter should have been examined more carefully.  It will not integrate with the DART system.  It could be argued that it is being imposed on the city without any consideration of the overall transport requirements.  However, the light rail network will be environmentally friendly.  It will not cause pollution and will help promote the concept of a living inner city.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies from the northside, I deeply regret the original decision to defer construction of the Ballymun line.  Everyone on the northside breathed a sigh of relief when the Minister finally admitted that in November 1995 the EU Commission ordered a socio-economic study, involving independent and in-depth analysis on the prioritisation of the three lines. We were told the Ballymun link was originaly deferred due to the low car ownership statistics for the area and the disruption and congestion which would occur in the Drumcondra area, in particular, with two major projects under way, the Dublin Port tunnel and the Ballymun light rail link.</P>
    <P>The so-called north Dublin black are involves the largest cluster of deprivation in the State.  According to the president of Dublin City University this belt of deprivation has a population of 106,000 people, more than Galway and Waterford cities combined.  There is a serious long-term unemployment problem in the locality.  Of course, it makes sense to examine the social dimensions of any infrastructural development.  Several studies concluded that the Ballymun link would greatly enhance efforts to develop the area economically.  The task force set up by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to examine job opportunities in and around Dublin <Col N="1675" /> Airport strongly recommends the provision of the Ballymun line.  It is also supported by Dublin City University, the Ballymun Partnership, the Finglas-Cabra Partnership, the Nortside Partnership and more recently by a combination of residents' associations in the locality known as the North Dublin Transport Alliance.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable there is no rail link to Dublin Airport, a major international airport which grew by more than one-third in the past two years and had eight million passengers in 1995.  Dublin Airport may be the only airport in Europe without such a link &mdash; other Deputies referred to that matter.  It is vital that detailed planning and necessary preparation and design work for the Ballymun line is commenced so that it has a realistic chance of inclusion in the final package to be put to the European Commission.  There may be no funding available from the EU after the year 2000 and if the Ballymun line is not included in the first phase the general fear is that it may not see the light of day if is has to be funded solely from domestic sources.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that two major projects, the Dublin Port tunnel and the Ballymun line, would lead to massive disruption in that locality. Potential disruption could be minimised by adequate phasing and co-ordination between the two projects.  The people on the north side of Dublin want fair play in the prioritisation of the three light rail lines.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a proposal put forward by a group known as the Transport Users' Support Group, an alternative to the Luas proposal or an option which could be taken in association with that proposal.  The plans involve a circular rail line from Malahide to Booters-town DART station, linking Malahide, Swords, the airport, Ballymun, Finglas, Blanchardstown, Coolmine, Lucan, Clondalkin, Baldonnel, Saggart, Tallaght, Sandyford, UCD and Booters-town. There is merit in such a proposal. <Col N="1676" /> Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether that project and the Luas line are mutually exclusive.  Has he received a submission in that regard and, if so, what is its status?</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Initiative was a very important and worthwhile endeavour. For the first time all aspects of transport in the greater Dublin area were examined in a comprehensive way. Most importantly, for the first time, there was public involvement and consultation regarding the deliberations.  I recall attending a number of public sessions organised by the Dublin Transport Initiative in local areas, which were very well attended, and the standard of debate was first class.  The initiative is a very important milestone in the development of transport policy in the city.  My only regret is that it did not study adequately all proposals for a port access route.  In particular it did not analyse and evaluate in a satisfactory way proposals from National Toll Roads plc for an east-west Liffey tunnel.  Perhaps that battle is lost, or perhaps the project will be resurrected in the future.</P>
    <P>Information submitted to public representatives at the time was that the proposed Liffey tunnel would create 600 jobs over the five years' construction period; directly create 35 full-time jobs; involve no cost to Government &mdash; funding would include 70 per cent Structural Funds, £70 million, and 30 per cent private funding, £30 million; generate £25 million in tax revenues on capital cost from VAT, PAYE and PRSI; generate significant company tax, PAYE, PRSI and VAT payments for the 30 years' duration of the toll scheme; reduce traffic congestion on the quays and facilitate public transport, particularly on the quays; the toll franchise would return to Government ownership after 30 years; it would increase the competitive advantage of Irish exporters through Dublin port; stimulate development and economic growth in the city, particularly the port area; require no Government subvention of <Col N="1677" /> operating or maintenance costs, estimated at £1 million annually, and provide a much needed port access route. The Dublin Transportation Initiative did not evaluate that project as well as it should have and perhaps it will be resurrected at some stage.</P>
    <P>A port access route is vital for the survival of manufacturing in the City of Dublin.  Dublin port is being strangled because of traffic congestion generally. Nevertheless, I have much difficulty with the proposed A6 Dublin port tunnel route from Whitehall to East Wall. As an isolated proposal it makes no sense and would simply result in thousands of cars using the East Wall road area &mdash; it is estimated that it would double traffic in that area.  Perhaps the Minister for the Environment will say whether the southern leg of the eastern by-pass is back on the agenda.  To propose in isolation a port access route to East Wall would cause many difficulties, a matter of which we should be very conscious.</P>
    <P>There has been very little consultation with local residents about the Dublin port tunnel.  Many residents have legitimate concerns and cannot get satisfactory answers from the technical people involved &mdash; for example, people have fears about their homes.  There are many rumours in the locality about the effects of this tunnel.  I am unable to allay the concerns because I do not have the technical qualifications to deal with the queries raised.  It is disgraceful that people cannot get satisfactory answers to their legitimate queries.</P>
    <P>Many concerns have been raised locally about the Dublin port tunnel. The location of the tunnel portal in the Whitehall area on the Swords Road has been questioned.  Concerns about emissions and noise in the Whitehall area have led to requests to move the tunnel portal northwards, and I support that view.  There is concern about construction disturbance; construction vibration from the tunnel, particularly in the Marino area; possible damage to houses in Marino; compensation arrangements, should that arise; noise and vibration <Col N="1678" /> from the tunnel after construction; amenities and facilities in Fairview Park; air quality in the East Wall Road area and at the northern portal; and recreational amenities involving water sports in the Tolka River.  These are genuine concerns but to date they have not been adequately dealt with by the consultants.  An environmental impact statement was promised in March &mdash; it is now June.  Dublin County Council is not able to facilitate the project until these questions are answered satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The engineers involved say the A6 route must be taken and the routes A1 to A5 cannot proceed &mdash; it must be the A6 route or nothing &mdash; but I do not believe what engineers say.  In his contribution our leader, Deputy Ahern, said that he has observed engineers for years and while they always say they cannot do a task, after adequate consultation they come up with satisfactory solutions as to how it could be done.  An acceptable alternative to the A6 route must be brought forward, following real and meaningful consultation with all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Austrian tunnelling method, known as NATM, is being used to construct the tunnel but the reports we receive about this method lead to worries. There was a damning review of the use of this method by the British Health and Safety Executive, which dealt at length with the possibility of tunnel collapse. It is estimated that new safety measures will have to be introduced, which will increase the existing £130 million cost.</P>
    <P>Members of the public must raise funds to make submissions on issues like Luas and the Dublin port tunnel but they have no satisfactory way to hire experts to make proposals which differ from those put forward by the local authority or CIE.  Now that we are trying to encourage community activity and participation, a system of funding should be put in place for voluntary groups who confront proposals such as this on infrastructure, etc.  The EU will <Col N="1679" /> probably implement it for us in due course but it is an issue for the future.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked who was looking after transport in Dublin.  Three Government Departments, four local authorities, a host of transport providers, the Garda, the National Roads Authority and, most recently, the Dublin Transportation Office are all concerned with one problem.  That is unsatisfactory. Dublin Bus Nitelink service should be extended because it is inadequate at present.  Given the current number of taxis in the city, the overall picture should be examined and Dublin Bus should play a greater role. Cycleways are another development for the future and local authorities should be seen to do more in that regard.  I welcome the provision of new DART stations in Clontarf and Drumcondra which will improve public transport in the city.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;road rage&rdquo; phenomenon has been observed in the US and the UK and Dublin's transport problems are becoming so chronic that we will witness this phenomenon here also.  We must tackle our problems now.  We have the opportunity and the funding to do it. We must get our priorities right and get these major developments under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased this Bill is before the House and that we are finally making progress in this area.  I congratulate the Minister because, as a Deputy representing Dublin South since 1981, I recall various candidates at election time promising people in my constituency that, if they were elected to Dáil Éireann, the Harcourt Street line would be re-opened.  This has been promised so many times it is remarkable that there are not ghost trains travelling the line on a nightly basis carrying people into the city centre.  I never made promises about this issue, but as a Member of this House and of the local authority I have long complained about transport problems experienced by my constituents and the abysmal service offered to the people of Dublin.  This proposal <Col N="1680" /> deserves the whole-hearted support of all sides of the House but, as I understand it, Fianna Fáil will oppose the Bill this evening.  I find this quite extraordinary and am not sure what political point it thinks it is making by doing so.</P>
      <P>The hard-pressed citizens of Dublin want a speedy, efficient and environmentally friendly transport system. They want a system they can rely on and which is superior to the service currently provided.  They want the State to enter the 21st century without being dependent on a public transport service which had its foundations in a different era. New buzzwords are always interesting to hear and we have heard much about &ldquo;integrated transport systems&rdquo;.  If I may view this project from the parochial perspective of a backbench Deputy concerned for his constituents, if we are to have the proposed line from Dundrum to the city centre it is essential that the words mentioned mean exactly what they say in practice.</P>
      <P>I repeat in this House what I have said previously to the Minister &mdash; the overwhelming majority of my constituents welcome this initiative, want the light rail transit system put in place as rapidly as possible and would like to see the Government comply with the timescale prescribed.  However, there is also an anxiety to ensure that, if the system is put in place as currently envisaged, it does not solve some problems while creating others along the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter of particular concern is the impact of the proposed system on the village of Dundrum and the surrounding areas of Sandyford and Ballinteer.  The plans publicised by CIE and the Minister propose that the light rail transit system terminus in my constituency will be opposite the Crazy Prices supermarket in Balally, but there is not one person who believes this is a sane choice.  I fully understand and accept that there are financial constraints, but it is important to ensure that, in seeking to resolve a transport problem, we do not create gridlock and bedlam in the places where people will use the system.  From my personal knowledge of this area and <Col N="1681" /> the roads in it &mdash; this goes back to the time I was in short trousers &mdash; there is absolutely no possibility of Dundrum village and the road leading out of it to the proposed terminus point being able to cope with the traffic input which would result.  The intention is to provide a park-and-ride system and to make it attractive for people from the surrounding areas of Sandyford, Rathfarnham, Glencullen, Balally and Mount Merrion to use the light rail transit system terminus in Dundrum.  This is being done for two reasons: first, to take cars off the road and, second, to provide a speedy and, one would hope, profitable public transport service.  The only logical place for the line to end is the Sandyford industrial estate which has more than 6,000 employees and a large landbank where the parking facility could be constructed. This facility cannot be constructed in Balally where the proposed maximum number of car parking spaces will be grossly inadequate to meet the needs.</P>
    <P>It will cost an extra £15 million to extend the line from Balally to the Sandyford industrial estate.  It will be a false economy not to provide this funding. If the proposed system is put in place the resulting traffic chaos and on-street parking on main roads and in residential suburban estates will inevitably lead to the extension of the line in a very short time, by which stage the current estimate of £15 million will be substantially greater.  These issues will be teased out in the ongoing public inquiry and debate but they should be considered seriously and urgently.  I say this as someone who fully supports the project. I am relaying to the House the strong message given to me by my constituents, particularly those who live in Dundrum and Sandyford.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the timescale for the project.  When I entered public life in 1979 I was told that the southern cross route, which is part of the Dublin ring road, would be open to traffic by 1983. This is 1996, yet not one sod has been turned on the southern cross route.  The procedures necessary to get the project <Col N="1682" /> to the stage where it would go to tender have been completed but it is snarled up in court proceedings and we will be lucky if the route is open by the year 2002.  We have an extraordinary ability to produce worthy plans in the transport area which Government genuinely committed to them finds it impossible to implement because people take it, the local authority or a State body to court which, due to the nature of the system we operate, takes years to reach a decision.</P>
    <P>The timescale for the building of the light rail system is vital, not only because of the European funding issue. It is popular to say that if we do not build the system by a particular date the European Commission may deprive us of the funding.  That may be the case but it has been my experience in the context of past projects to which the European Commission committed itself that funding is not usually withdrawn where delays occur.  This project must be proceeded with urgently to alleviate the traffic gridlock which afflicts not only my constituency but Dublin city and county and to provide a modern and adequate public transport system.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the Bill between now and Committee Stage. Bearing in mind the history of other schemes, it is inevitable &mdash; no matter how much I may wish to discourage it my voice will not have any great impact on this &mdash; that someone will launch a court challenge to this project at some stage, whether it is before or after a public inquiry or after the making of ministerial orders.  The Bill seeks to delimit the extent to which court applications can be made.  The Minister should consider the inclusion in the Bill of provisions which would require courts to determine challenges within a specified period or which would give such proceedings a form of priority within the court system.  This would give ensure that challenges of any description which would hold up the project would be dealt with and resolved within a few months rather than years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the opposition <Col N="1683" /> voiced by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to the light rail transit system. Any business group in the city centre which seeks to oppose this project has dinosaur vision.  The city centre is dying and business is being transferred to suburban shipping centres because of a lack of transport access to the city and inadequate parking facilities.  In suburban shipping centres people can shop in a more attractive and traffic free environment. Traders in the city centre should be crying out for the rapid implementation of this project.</P>
    <P>In the context of integrating the scheme, we must ensure that the various public utilities, including Dublin Corporation, use the opportunity to complete any outstanding works which need to be carried out.  We have an extraordinary inability to co-ordinate these works.  In the city new roads are dug up within weeks by Telecom Éireann, Bord Gais or the corporation.  In many cases one section of the corporation does not check with another section what work it proposes to carry out and one suddenly discovers that there is a need to lay new sewers or piping.  We have seen the frenetic activity on roadsides and the landscape pockmarked by repair works.  It frequently looks like a lunar landscape which has suffered a meteorite holocaust.</P>
    <P>Advanced planning in this area should take place now.  It should be made clear to all utility providers who feel the need to dig up our streets regularly, that the last opportunity to modernise existing structures or to provide additional ones, will arise at the time of the construction of the light rail transit system.  Otherwise, I can guarantee that within four or five weeks of its construction a utility company will sabotage its work in some part of the city by digging up a portion of the road to undertake work that could have been done months earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my thanks for the constructive way in <Col N="1684" /> which comments were put forward in this debate and the general support expressed for this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil decision to oppose this Bill is impossible to understand and runs counter to the content of and sentiment expressed in many of its party members' contributions in this debate. Fianna Fáil, in particular Deputy Séamus Breannan, seems to be intent on obstructing progress on this vital transport initiative, having consistently and deliberately attempted to sabotage the light rail project for short-term political expediency.  I ask Deputy Brennan and his party colleagues to reconsider their attitude and recognise that this affords a golden opportunity to address in a meaningful way the chaotic traffic congestion in our capital city.  Indeed the Fianna Fáil position is totally out of line with everyone else.  Community groups have supported it, as has the DTI as an integral part of its proposals.  City traders are in favour of it, in the past week I had a meeting with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and expect a positive response to our discussions and exchange of views.</P>
      <P>Issues in relation to transport and indeed in relation to Dublin's particular traffic difficulties have been debated many times in this House.  The proposal to remedy these difficulties in part through the provision of a light rail system has been a key element of these debates.  It is a proposal which commands broad support in this House, as evidenced in this debate, and among the public at large.  The majority of people recognise that something must be done to tackle traffic difficulties in Dublin and that light rail represents the best option available in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill represents a vital stage in the process in that it will provide the statutory framework for the development of the light railway for Dublin.  It provides that CIE will develop the system and this is reasonable given its pivotal role in providing public transport services in Dublin.  CIE will be the formal implementing agency for the construction of the light rail network.  However, <Col N="1685" /> it is envisaged that the role of the private sector in the detailed design and construction of the light rail project will be maximised.  An international consultancy team with extensive experience of implementation of light rail projects abroad is working on the detailed planning with the CIE project team.  The actual construction of the light rail links will be carried out by private sector firms on the basis of specific contracts awarded after Irish public sector and EU competitive-tendering requirements have been observed.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not seek to dictate the detail of how light rail will be implemented.  That will be decided only after detailed public consultation and a public inquiry at which all interested parties can have their say.  This part of the process, which is essential to the success of the project, has given rise to a considerable number of questions during this debate.  Therefore I want to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>This project is being developed on the basis of a policy of openness and public consultation which is very much in keeping with principles enshrined in the DTI.  The clear message from the DTI experience is that successful implementation of strategy depends on ongoing local consultation and effective two-way communication on issues of importance to those concerned.</P>
    <P>No less attention is being paid to the public consultation aspects of the light rail project.  In launching the light rail public consultation programme last December, I invited the people of Dublin to become involved in a process designed to explain what light rail was about and the benefits it could bring with it.  I strongly emphasised at that time my determination that the consultation programme would not be a one-way process.  I, therefore, reject the suggestions made during this debate that the consultation stage would not amount to genuine consultation.  I have insisted that the CIE project team listens carefully to concerns and opinions from all interested parties in relation to <Col N="1686" /> the light rail proposals, and to respond to those concerns wherever possible.</P>
    <P>These concerns do not undermine the prospect of improving the traffic situation in Dublin but reflect the very real and genuine difficulties which individuals and businesses perceive at local level.</P>
    <P>This Bill follows through on my commitment to full and open public involvement at all stages in the light rail project. Deputy Brennan expressed his fear that the inquiry will be extremely bureaucratic, legalistic and bewildering to local communities.  I do not believe this will be the case.  More to the point, this confuses two aspects of the process: it fails to distinguish between the consultative process, now under way, and the formal public inquiry stage which will be undertaken later.</P>
    <P>The detailed consultation at local level must take place now and done in a variety of ways.  Since the public consultation process was launched, the LRT project team has been engaged in a constant series of meetings with residents' associations, individuals, businesses, public representatives and others to ensure that all interested parties are kept fully informed on the project. The meetings have taken place both at the initiative of the LRT project team and at the request of local communities and public representatives. There have been large gatherings with hundreds present; there have been small groups; there have been meetings with residents and there have been meetings with business interests.  There have also been newsletters, special phone lines, exhibitions and videos.</P>
    <P>The very type of interest group representation to which Deputy Séamus Brennan and Deputy Bertie Ahern referred in the context of other developments has in fact already been formed in relation to light rail project.  The business and environment consultative group brings together business, tourist and environmental interests.  I expect more such groups will form at a local level.  Indeed I believe they will last <Col N="1687" /> beyond the approval stages and continue to liaise with the LRT team as construction takes place in their areas. This type of association must be allowed develop in response to needs; it cannot be legislated for.  That would give rise to the very bureaucracy and legalistic difficulties that Deputies seek to avoid.  The legislation must concentrate on the formal procedures which are required to evaluate the proposals which emerge from the consultative process.</P>
    <P>Of its very nature the consultative process is bound to bring out issues of difference and highlight areas of contention. Contrary to what may have been implied by some contributions to this debate, issues of contention and difference raised at local meetings are not being ignored by the project team. Options and alternatives to solve difficulties which have been put to the project team by local representatives and others are being considered by project design and engineering experts as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the consultation process is used to the maximum extent possible to resolve issues of concern to local interests.  Where possible solutions that can be found within the obvious constraints of budget, timeframe and operational requirements for the project must be accommodated.  Where a positive response is not possible, it is equally important that people are given a full and honest explanation.  There is no attempt &mdash; as was suggested &mdash; to ride roughshod over people's rights.</P>
    <P>The formal procedures for which this legislation provides serve to strengthen the informal consultative process by providing an opportunity to comment on the details of the light rail order itself.  It requires the Minister to consider all the submissions before he makes a decision to grant a light railway order.  The legal process allows any person affected by the project or interested in any way in the project to be kept informed and updated to the fullest possible extent at this important stage in the development of the project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> Deputies have queried the extent of some of the general powers provided in the Bill.  I assure them that such powers are similar to those provided for in existing legislation; they are already used by other public companies and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy, while supportive of Luas, raised the question of the suitability of on-street light rail in the context of our streets becoming a battle ground for trams, buses, trucks and cars. As part of an integrated transport policy, and given proper traffic management priority, light rail can provide a high level of public transport service in segregated running and on-street as appropriate, without the battle ground scenario presented by Deputy Molloy and without substantial disadvantages to other road users.  It must be remembered that this issue was considered by the DTI in the preparation of a long-term integrated transportation strategy for the period up to the year 2011.  The DTI recommended an on-street light rail system as a key element of its public transport strategy.  It recommended against an underground system on economic, financial and accessibility grounds.  It also concluded that a wholly bus-based solution would not be as effective as an integrated public transport strategy based on DART, suburban rail, quality bus corridors and light rail.</P>
    <P>The on-street light rail system is the option favoured by the DTI.  Certainly it is a lower cost solution compared to the underground option and will provide a better economic return.  That is not to say it is a second rate solution.  In fact light rail will be more accessible on-street than underground.  More stops will be possible on-street.  Apart from being very expensive, underground stations are less accessible to mobility impaired people.  I am advised that on the basis of a very preliminary estimate CIÉ calculates the additional cost associated with constructing a two kilometre underground section of light rail in the city centre would be in the region of £65 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of a wider strategy proposed by the DTI and supported by Government.  This strategy is now being implemented in a spirit of co-operation between the various agencies involved.</P>
      <P>As part of this overall DTI strategy it is recognised that light rail represents a sound investment bringing together the reliability, speed and comfort of the traditional railway with the flexibility of the bus.  We can all appreciate that, given traffic levels today, street space is at a premium and it makes sense to employ those forms of transport that make best use of it.  Light rail is just such a form of transport, being most cost effective when traffic levels are broadly in the intermediate capacity range between the upper limits of high density bus services and the lower limits of heavy commuter rail systems such as DART.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to concerns of Deputies that the north side of the city is being <Col N="1690" /> ignored, nothing could be further from the truth.  The Ballymun line remains part of the core light rail network recommended by the DTI.  The Government remains committed to the construction of the full core light rail network &mdash; that is the three lines to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght.  In this regard I have recently appointed Oscar Faber, international transportation planning consultants, to carry out the comparative socio-economic evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum light rail lines.  The consultants have commenced their work and are expected to complete their assignment within a 12 week period.</P>
    <P>The issue of integration of light rail with other services has been raised on a number of occasions during the debate. While cost is an issue it is not simply a question of funding.  Direct links with DART, Connolly Station and Busáras raise significant technical issues.  The issues involved and the potential tradeoffs between alternative options on integration are quite complex.  The current proposals provide a direct light rail link to the Arrow and mainline rail routes at Heuston Station.</P>

      <P>It is an historic evening in which the Opposition has won a major vote in the Dáil and the Government has been defeated. Perhaps the Minister for Health. Deputy Noonan, might be generous in case another defeat may be in the offing tomorrow night.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to extend the deadline of 17 June 1996, for victims' compensation claims to the <i>ad hoc</i> hepatitis C tribunal until three months after the final court judgment is delivered in the first hepatitis C compensation case.</P>
      <P>This is the twelfth time in the past five months that the hepatitis C controversy has been raised in this House by the Opposition.  It has been raised through every device available, by way of motion, priority questions, Private Members' Business and on the Adjournment.  No other health issue has occupied more Dáil time in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason hepatitis C has been raised in this House so frequently is because of the dissatisfaction with the Minister's handling of the issue.  The Minister has taken a minimalist approach and has seldom shown any flexibility or goodwill in the hepatitis C affair.  Progress has only been achieved after struggles and has never been <Col N="1695" /> granted voluntarily.  The victims have felt on many occasions they have been double crossed by the Minister.  He promised them justice and fairness but instead they met opposition and inflexibility. They have been made to feel they are responsible somehow for contracting the virus rather than being victims of a State agency.</P>
    <P>The victims certainly believe the Minister for Health has not listened to them at key times because, irrespective of their concerns, he went ahead and unilaterally implemented change.  The result has been that the issue has had to be raised many times here and at the end of each debate and Question Time one hoped there would not be a need for a next time.  One hoped on these occasions that finally the Minister would acknowledge the wrong that was done to these victims and would give them a full explanation as to how this affair occurred.  That has not happened and at every turn the innocent victims have been short-changed and forced to beg for concessions and explanations.  The Government's measures have been presented as benevolence rather than the victims' right, given the State's responsibility in poisoning their lives.</P>
    <P>Every change in the proposals for the compensation tribunal and every alteration to the plans for health care have been wrenched only after months of lobbying by the groups representing victims and by debates and questions in this House.  That is not how it should be, given the damning evidence of the State's culpability in this affair.  This evening we find ourselves in a scenario where the Minister is steadfastly refusing to budge on an issue of major importance to the victims, despite the clear wish of the majority of the victims for an extension of the deadline for applications to the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for extending the deadline, not least is the fact that only one third, or just over 600 victims have applied to the tribunal even though the deadline is next Monday. <Col N="1696" /> While I imagine some of those who have not applied to date are awaiting the outcome of this debate to see if Government Deputies will honour the private commitments given to victims about supporting the extension of the deadline, many applications will remain outstanding after the 17 June deadline has passed.  That will be a serious indictment of the Government's plans for compensating the victims and will have to be regarded as signalling the failure of those proposals.  It will signal also that victims lack confidence in the compensation tribunal and in the deadline applied.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that the Minister tonight will try to disguise this failure. He has already been building up to it. Last week we were told in the House &mdash; when the Minister was particularly sensitive on this issue at Question Time &mdash; that the number of hepatitis C victims who might be eligible for compensation was in the region of 1,400.  However, three weeks previously when the Minister addressed the Select Committee on Social Affairs he said there were 1,600 victims.  There appears to be a clear case of disappearing numbers, depending on the day and the time.  Is the Department telling some solicitors or victims who telephone it that based on the details supplied the victim would not have a case?  Does the Minister want the total to be as low as possible so that the number of applicants on 17 June looks even slightly respectable?</P>
    <P>There is a compelling case to extend the deadline from 17 June until after the final court judgment is given in the case before the High Court.  That case is being taken by a mother of ten in her late forties who is seriously ill with hepatitis C.  Her case which will begin in October is expected to throw light on some of the many outstanding issues in this affair and is likely to determine an issue that has a key bearing to other victims, whether the Blood Transfusion Service Board was negligent in the hepatitis C affair and if so, if the woman is entitled to damages for that negligence. Under the tribunal, victims are <Col N="1697" /> not entitled to such damages and liability is not admitted by the State in this affair.  Therefore, the victims going before the tribunal do not know whether they are taking a major gamble by going that route and whether they will have any resourse if the High Court finds the Blood Transfusion Service Board negligent.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears determined, no matter what, to get the hepatitis C victims before the tribunal.  There is much evidence to back up this statement.  He has written to all hepatitis C victims endorsing the tribunal.  He did this at the time application forms were issued. This endorsement of the tribunal route was an abuse of office.  Rather than representing the public interest and maintaining balance in this affair, he immediately put one option above the other.  It could be called subtle psychology. Officialdom was signalling that this was the route it wanted people to go.</P>
    <P>This was the start of the brow beating of victims which has continued with incessant advertising in the newspapers. Although the Minister told us last week that both he and the Department know all the victims from the national blood screening programming, the targeted look back programme and the optional testing programme, he still has blanket advertising of the tribunal in the media. This advertising is well on the way to costing £1 million, the bulk of which has been spent in less than four months on advertising aimed at people who already have received the application form through the post and all sorts of reminders since.  One can only conclude that the purpose of the heavy spend is to soften people into acceptance, constantly remind them of the tribunal and woo them through advertising.</P>
    <P>One of the nastier ways an attempt has been made to brow beat victims is through the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Any victim who has entered a High Court case against the Blood Transfusion Service Board has received a letter from the Chief State Solicitor which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> In the light of the numerous benefits and advantages of the scheme of compensation, as opposed to court proceedings, it is difficult to understand how your client could choose to ignore the scheme in favour of the uncertainties, delays, stresses, confrontation and costs involved in the High Court litigation ... If, despite the scheme of compensation, your client is advised to ignore the tribunal and to pursue litigation and your client chooses to accept such advice, the resulting litigation will be fully defended by the State, if necessary to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>This letter amounts to intimidation.  It is scandalous that the State should act in such a heavy handed fashion.  It forces one to ask why it is so desperate to ensure victims go to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument has been that the only reason he is urging the tribunal route rather than the courts is to save money on lawyers.  Would he be happy to make a major decision without getting legal advice or trying the court option also?  He was not slow to retain an expensive lawyer to represent him at the beef tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister developed a problem since with lawyers?  He has made many disparaging remarks in the House about the legal profession in connection with this affair.  For example, at Question Time last week he suggested that a deadline was needed as otherwise solicitors would never complete the paperwork or get applications in on time.</P>
      <P>There is an example that I wish to cite of the misinformation fed to victims in a bid to get as many as possible to apply to the tribunal.  In recent weeks the Minister has tried to argue that, even if people send in their applications to the tribunal now, it could possibly be a year before they come up and that by then the test case in the High Court will have ended.  He has also urged people to send in applications without supporting documentation.</P>
      <P>Both claims are not founded on fact. There is a great danger, if people make applications without supporting documentation, that this will create a major disadvantage for them down the line and could come against them in the future.  Many victims are having difficulty in getting their medical records from the Blood Transfusion Service Board and hospitals.  This is particularly the case, as the Minister acknowledged, for those infected with hepatitis C through a blood transfusion.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons there should be an extension of the deadline is to give these people time to get their records together.  Many of these people's records have been destroyed or lost during the past 25 years, in some cases because of hospital amalagamations. Some records have just disappeared while others appear to be findable only if a court order is obtained, as has been the case with the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Department of Health.  Some victims fear that their documents have been destroyed deliberately &mdash; I have no evidence of this &mdash; to protect certain parties from legal action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person makes an application without supporting medical documents now <Col N="1700" /> and is not successful later in finding those documents, what will happen to their application?  The Minister said that they will have to supply the documentation six weeks before the case is to be heard.  What if, six weeks before the case is to be heard, the documentation cannot be found?  Will the case be heard on this basis and could an award be made on an unsupported application?  Could the application be rejected on this basis and would the applicant be able to turn anywhere else at that stage?  Will their documents be more findable in this way or would they stand a better chance of getting all their records if they got a court order?  To date, getting a court order would appear to be the more effective route.</P>
    <P>I also have to question the manner in which applications are being taken in the tribunal.  We have all read media reports that applications could be made by phone, that slips of paper and even names on a list would be acceptable. That seems to be a remarkably lax approach to a most serious matter.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to deny these reports.  That would be a dangerous scenario and something that should not be encouraged or acceptable in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The other claims made by the Minister that I wish to challenge relate to the time within which actions will be heard. In the Chief State Solicitor's letter to victims it is made abundantly clear that hepatitis C actions in the courts will be taken all the way.  The Minister confirmed that at Question Time.  Therefore, the State, if it loses in the High Court, is bound to appeal the current case to the Supreme Court.  How long will that take?  Will the case be fast-tracked? Could it be several years before the matter is finally legally resolved?</P>
    <P>There is every reason to believe that there will be little co-operation from the State in the matter.  It has obstructed the case every step of the way.  For example, the woman's desire to use an alias <Col N="1701" /> rather than her real name was challenged. That was a despicable act forcing her hand.  It also seems to be intent on contesting admission of liability in her case, even though there is a damning report of inquiry by the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  It has dragged its heels in entering a defence of the action delaying the case for several months.</P>
    <P>All these facts indicate that there will not be a speedy end to the Bridget Roe case, as it is known.  It also makes a mockery of the claim that victims will be treated equally and fairly, whether they go to the tribunal or the courts. There is every reason to believe that applications made now could come up before the case is resolved.  There is also reason to believe that all applications could be heard sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>At Question Time last week the Minister appeared to be signalling that, because the tribunal is so slow, he might consider appointing more personnel to the body or a parallel tribunal to speed up the hearing of applications.  If he were to do this, does it not mean that cases would be heard much faster and that applications could come up in October or November rather than next year?  If a case currently scheduled has to be postponed, will one of the current applications not be slotted into its place?</P>
    <P>It is most unsatisfactory for the Minister to make claims about the hearing of applications that cannot be adhered to. It smacks of the onging campaign which has taken many forms to corral, intimidate and pressurise victims to go to the tribunal.  However, the worst tactics employed have to be the ones employed in the Bridget Roe case.  If these road blocks are being constructed to defend the State, the State is not acting in the best interest of its citizens.  I do not agree with the tactics being used to minimise the State's liabilities, and I object to the offices of the State being used in such a mean-minded, oppressive fashion.  The inevitable conclusion is that, because the Minister and the Government are defendants in this <Col N="1702" /> action, the public interest is no longer being represented.  All parties &mdash; the Minister, the Department of Health, the Cabinet and the Blood Transfusion Service Board &mdash; appear to have been sucked into a cover-up.  Nobody can break the silence or object to the tactics being used.  Questionable procedures also apply to the tribunal.  There is &ldquo;cherrypicking&rdquo; of cases to appear before the tribunal.  Some of the most important cases are being heard first. This creates an impression that big money is on offer on the assumption that victims will go before the tribunal if they hear they can obtain large settlements there.  Some of the awards made in cases heard to date will not reflect future awards.  Why are they being hyped up?  At an early stage in this saga, before the Compensation Tribunal was established, the Minister for Health informed the Dáil that once the tribunal began making large awards, the cases would roll in.  Certainly, the awards being made by the tribunal are being trumpeted from the rooftops.</P>
    <P>There is an amazing coincidence in this public relations work on the tribunal awards.  The firm of solicitors that has taken many of the cases to the tribunal has hired a firm of public relations consultants strongly associated with the Minister's party.  Those consultants, as is their right, circulated information to the media on behalf of the solicitors.  I asked the Minister about this matter on a previous occasion and still believe part of the information circulated to the media could only have come from his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that the tribunal sits infrequently.  It is deliberate Government policy that the tribunal sits infrequently and has such a limited membership.  In this way, it can only hear 12 cases a week and, therefore, the £60 million granted by the Minister for 1996 will last much longer. The Minister has not given a valid reason the deadline should continue to apply.  Last week in the Dáil he suggested there are benefits for the administration, establishment and financing of <Col N="1703" /> the tribunal in adhering to the date. What about the victims?  Do they not matter?  Is this just an administrative exercise for the Department of Health?</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Minister for Health agreeing to establish an inquiry into the continuing revelations in this hepatitis C controversy, the importance of the Bridget Roe case is immense.  It is important for several reasons, but I am dismayed that this woman's personal case has become the official inquiry. That is unfair to Bridget Roe and represents an abdication of responsibility by the State.  One of the very significiant reasons for extending the deadline until there is an outcome to the Bridget Roe case relates to the determination of negligence that will be made.  That will have a very significant bearing for victims.</P>
    <P>An award for negligence or aggravated damages is not provided for under the tribunal.  Many victims are, therefore, keenly awaiting the outcome of the case.  However, they face a dilemma. Under the rules of the tribunal, once an award is decided an applicant has four weeks to decide on acceptance.  When the award is accepted, the applicant must drop all other claims against the State and other rights to action.  A claimant is expected to gamble on which is the better course without having full knowledge of the consequences.  It is uncaring of the State to put its citizens in such a dilemma.</P>
    <P>The other significance of the Bridget Roe case relates to the disclosures that will be made at the trial on how the hepatitis C scandal occured.  As many people are aware, it began for most of those infected, with anti-D immunoglobulin, a blood product that is routinely administered and given without consent to rhesus negative blood group mothers. Others were infected through blood transfusions during organ transplants, operations, etc.</P>
    <P>Anti-D has been administered in Irish maternity hospitals since the early 1970s to prevent rhesus incompatibility in new-born infants.  It is an extremely important product which has prevented <Col N="1704" /> death and serious illness for thousands of infants since its introduction in 1970. It is ironic that a product which was designed to save life is the one that has led to so many lives being currently under threat.  Anti-D was manufactured from 1970 to 1994 in Ireland by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Women receiving plasma exchange treatment during pregnancy were a particular rich source of antibody for the production of anti-D.</P>
    <P>Plasma from one such women was used to produce anti-D between September and November 1976.  The woman became jaundiced and the Blood Transfusion Service Board ceased using her plasma.  She tested negative for hepatitis B and appeared to make a full recovery after a few weeks. The Blood Transfusion Service Board then decided to recommence use of her plasma in the anti-D programme.</P>
    <P>Until work began on the Bridget Roe case, and based on the report of the expert group that investigated the scandal, I, and others, believe the Blood Bank had not been aware of the problems with anti-D until it received notification from Middlesex Hospital in December 1991.  I was happy to believe what had happened was an awful mistake. However, I no longer believe that. There was a deliberate and calculated cover-up which should be investigated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have requested such an investigation on a number of occasions in this House to no avail.</P>
    <P>When I believed this matter was just a mistake, I was shocked and appalled that the Blood Bank did nothing about the letter from Middlesex for more than two years and that many more people were infected as a consequence. However, now it has emerged, in this court case, that the Blood Bank knew in 1976 that the donor who was the source of the infection had been clinically diagnosed as suffering from infective hepatitis but failed to act, and appears to have perpetrated a cover-up.</P>
    <P>I would like Government Deputies to bear in mind during this debate the <Col N="1705" /> serious nature of hepatitis C infection.  It is not a simple infection.  It is a vicious, uncertain disease, with one in five victims developing cirrhosis of the liver.  It also causes many other diseases unrelated to the liver such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Hepatitis C almost universally recurs in a newly transplanted liver. Hepatitis C infection changes lives irreversibly and people meet problems with, simple, every day issues such as mortgage protection and life insurance, with, for example, mortgage insurance loading being doubled due to hepatitis C infection.</P>
    <P>Had full information become available in 1994 about the extent of the cover-up and the disease, court terms should have been offered at the Blood Transfusion Service Board rather than golden handshakes.  The Bridget Roe case has also thrown light on how the original donor was infected.  I am sure many people have thought about the original donor who, I understand, is still alive.  I have often thought she must feel guilty, as she and everyone else were led to believe she was the source of the infection.  The expert group that investigated the scandal was led to believe and concluded that the donor had a history of jaundice.  However, the information that has come to light during this court case points to the fact that it is most likely that Donor X was in fact infected by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The case also raises many questions about why the Blood Transfusion Service Board made anti-D from blood plasma from a patient they knew to have infective hepatitis.  Why did the Blood Transfusion Service Board not do other tests after their diagnosis?  Why did it cover up the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis?  Why were the files disclosing this information only discovered following the issuing of a court order?  Why did the board break its own rules for donor standards?  If the expert group had this information, would its report have been different?</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Select Committee on Social Affairs which wrote to Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien in relation <Col N="1706" /> to the report of the expert group.  In response she replied:</P>
    <P>The question in your letter &ldquo;Did the expert group ask for all relevant documents?&rdquo; we found somewhat surprising.  To have failed to do so would have been negligent on our part.  I can state that we not only made such a request to the Blood Transfusion Service Board but also to the other parties involved.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, nor did I have at any time, that the expert group asked for all relevant documentation.  One must surely ask now whether the particular documentation which came to light as a result of the court order was ever made available or shown to the expert group.</P>
    <P>I know the members of the expert group do not want to enter the controversy because a court case is pending but it is clear that even though they asked for all relevant files &mdash; as confirmed by their chairperson &mdash; the crucial file involved was not shown to them. It is clear, therefore, that the assumptions it made about the actions of the Blood Transfusion Service Board were not made in possession of the full facts.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were genuinely interested in being fair to the hepatitis C victims, and he has said consistently in this House that he is, he should reconvene the expert group and present all new information that has come to light.  He would also act on the point the group raised in its letter to the Select Committee on Social Affairs about documents being withheld.  The full truth of this affair is not known and, until it is, justice will not be done.</P>
    <P>I detect from the Government side of the House a keenness on the part of many Government Deputies to have this debate over as soon as possible so that they can go back to victims and say the Dáil has decided the matter.  For many of those Deputies, 17 June cannot come fast enough so that the hurdle is passed and the pressure is off.  I believe there is a Government agenda to shut the door on this problem and hope that it goes away but in the programme for <Col N="1707" /> Government there is a promise to pay fair compensation to those infected with hepatitis C.  On the basis of that commitment, is it fair to rush victims into decisions on which route they take for compensation?  Why has the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; been forgotten?</P>
    <P>Many Deputies on the Government side of the House have, privately and publicly, expressed support for the extension of the deadline.  I must single out <i>The Examiner</i> for praise as being virtually the only national newspaper that has consistently followed this controversy, thanks to the efforts of its political correspondent.  The newspaper recently quoted a number of Deputies &mdash; and I am delighted to see Deputy Ahearn in the House &mdash; who want the Minister to accede to the request for the extension.  It is crucial that he does so in the light of so much uncertainty.  At the Select Committee on Social Affairs there was unanimous agreement among all parties for the extension of the deadline and a letter to that effect was sent to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I read in today's newspapers that some Government Deputies were hoping that a last minute deal might be worked out between the Minister and the groups representing victims, but I do not think the Minister will meet them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, one of the representative groups was told that the Minister has a very busy schedule &mdash; I have no doubt it is &mdash; but that he would try to meet its members at the end of June, early July or whenever his schedule allowed which would certainly be well after the 17 June deadline has passed.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>At the outset I had serious reservations about the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  One of my greatest concerns was that it would be silently wound up somewhere down the line.  The Minister told me this could never happen but it happened with the <i>ad hoc</i> Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, set up in 1974 in the wake of the terrorist bombings, which was quietly wound up.  It would have been much better to have a statutory tribunal, especially given the difficulties <Col N="1708" /> many victims will have in proving on the balance of probabilities that their infection was caused by a blood transfusion or a blood product.</P>
    <P>Because of the way the terms of the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal have been set, there is a great danger that bona fide and deserving claimants may not be able to prove their case because of an obligation to establish that blood was contaminated in certain circumstances that cannot be proved because records are incomplete, missing or simply do not exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an allegation here last week that people inside and outside this House were encouraging victims not to go the tribunal route and giving them advice.  I am not one of those people but I have consistently said I have difficulties with the tribunal.  The people who have been giving the advice are members of the legal profession and they would be far closer to the Minister's side of the House than to this side.</P>
    <P>What happens if the Bridget Roe case is lost?  Will the victims be left without a penny because the deadline for the tribunal has passed?  If the Bridget Roe case is won, will people feel in years to come that they have been grossly under-compensated? Both these possibilities point to the necessity for the Minister to show flexibility and to extend the deadline.</P>
    <P>The truth must come out in this affair and that will take further time.  Unless the deadline is extended and victims are treated sensitively, they will remain dissatisfied with the State.  To continue to refuse to extend the deadline would be unjust and unfair.  I ask Deputies on the other side of the House to use their considerable influence with the Minister to extend the deadline.  That is what the victims want and that is what they should be granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing her time with me.  I understand the rulings of this House, which have been created over many years of experience, but I also understand the response that has just been given by the people in the Public Gallery.</P>
      <P>I commend my colleague who has persistently pursued justice for the victims in this case.  In her excellent contribution, she did not make any extravagent claims, nor did she show any political bias.  She put forward a reasonable, balanced case and I do not believe that can be lost on the Minister or the Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>Six months ago, on 12 December 1995, my party tabled a Private Members' motion condemning the Government for its failure to establish a statutory tribunal to deal with hepatitis C claims.  Since then it has acknowledged that over 600 victims have made application to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  In addition, a substantial number of victims have opted, at their own expense, to initiate High Court proceedings.</P>
      <P>At the outset many of the victims did not have any confidence in the scheme for compensation set up by the Minister for Health.  These people, infected through contaminated Anti-D product, are the innocent victims of gross negligence on the part of officials of this State.  Rammed down their necks is a scheme which many have rejected. Daily public advertisements in national and local press have constantly conveyed the message that victims have only until 17 June to lodge their claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of chaotic delays in the High Court and the expense of mounting a High Court case, many victims are in an invidious position.  On the one hand there is an informal tribunal whose rules and procedures are more relaxed, flexible and speedy and which promises an early settlement with the opportunity to get on with their lives despite the fact that some of them will be adversely affected by this scandal.  With an average payout of £106,000, which includes compensation for loss of earnings, many <Col N="1710" /> claimants properly feel they are not getting fair compensation and a full award given the uncertainty in regard to the progression of the disease in some of the victims.</P>
    <P>Victims are entitled to the highest amount of damages, as is the norm, whether their case is heard by the tribunal or the High Court.  While the tribunal's rules and procedures have a substantial effect on saving legal costs and outlay, it would be a travesty of justice if the victims who had their claims processed by the tribunal were to subsequently find that the level of compensation they received from the tribunal was considerably less than that to be awarded by the High Court in subsequent cases it will hear.</P>
    <P>If there is the slightest bit of humanitarianism in the mind of the Minister, he will have no hesitation in supporting this motion.  We are talking about many hundreds of victims for whom the State is responsible and who are entitled to the highest possible amount of compensation so that the remainder of their lives is subject to the minimum degree of stress and worry.</P>
    <P>The Minister's refusal up to now to extend the deadline for compensation beyond next Monday for compensation claims to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal places the victims in a situation they do not deserve.  It is mean and insensitive because it is forcing on them a decision which they could, in effect, regret for the rest of their days.  They must choose between the tribunal and the High Court.  Whichever way they choose, the alternative might be the better way.</P>
    <P>I cannot help comparing the position of these people with certain television game shows where the element of chance is paramount.  The competitor is given the option of accepting an amount of money or opening the box and possibly ending up a good deal worse off. The lottery show also comes to mind where one of the participants spins the wheel and wins either £10,000 or £250,000.  The victims of hepatitis C deserve something better than to be <Col N="1711" /> part of a lottery.  Will I reject the tribunal award and go to the High Court where I might do better or even a good deal worse?  This is the kind of choice a victim may be called upon to make after next Monday.  One gets the impression that some adviser of the Minister has adopted the role of a bookmaker who is calculating the odds.  In this case the advice would be to remove the option of real choice and thereby save money. There can be no other logical reason for the Minister's attitude.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies on the opposite side who followed this scandal closely to consider the implications of voting against the motion.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the hearing of the case in the High Court which is pending will create a situation where many victims who are having their case heard by the tribunal will regret that they did not have the option of extending the deadline beyond the period being suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann affirms the compensation tribunal as an alternative to court proceedings to provide fair compensation to persons who have contracted hepatitis C from human immunoglobulin anti-D, blood transfusion or other blood products. </P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Hughes for their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to move the Government's amendment to the Private Members' motion put down by Fianna Fáil in relation to extending the deadline of 17 June 1996 for claimants to the compensation tribunal. I welcome the opportunity to reiteriate the Government's firm commitment to fair compensation, to outline the numerous advantages of the compensation tribunal as opposed to court <Col N="1712" /> proceedings and to provide up to date information in relation to the operation of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>All Members carry a responsibility to ensure that people with hepatitis C who are listening to this debate do not have their anxieties and concerns increased by inexact information or by statements which are not in accordance with the facts.  I am conscious of the stress and trauma which can be experienced by persons with hepatitis C.  With this in mind, I granted £235,000 approximately to voluntary groups to provide a support network to their members who are positive for hepatitis C and their families. A total of £130,000 has been granted to Positive Action to support its members who were anti-D recipients and who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.  I would be very concerned if Positive Action is unnecessarily giving rise to additional stress by giving inaccurate and misleading information and advice to its members.</P>
    <P>The tribunal to provide compensation to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti-D, whose blood or blood products as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State was established on 15 December 1995.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is dealing with applications from persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or virus resulting from the use of human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti-D, blood transfusion or other blood products within the State; children and partners of such persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or virus; any person responsible for the maintenance of any such persons who has incurred financial loss and/or expenses as a direct result of providing such maintenance; and any dependent of such persons who have died as a result of having contracted hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>No person is being compelled to apply to the compensation tribunal.  It is a matter for each person to decide whether to pursue his or her claim <Col N="1713" /> through the courts or through the compensation tribunal.  The making of a claim to the tribunal under the scheme does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  It is only if the claimant accepts the award made by the tribunal that the claimant is required to agree to waive any right of action which the claimant may otherwise have had.  If a claimant receives an award from the tribunal the claimant will have a period of one month to either accept or reject it. If an award is rejected, and no award to date has been rejected, a claimant may initiate or continue proceedings through the courts.</P>
    <P>Negotiations between my Department and interested groups, including Positive Action, in relation to the tribunal scheme took place during November 1995.  It is not true to say that no changes were made to the terms of the scheme arising from the negotiations with interested groups.  I remind the House of the amendments to the scheme which the Government approved following on my consultation with the groups during November 1995: the scheme was extended to include transfusee claimants who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies/virus; the children and partners of transfusee cliamants who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies/virus were also included; the time within which claimants must apply to the tribunal &mdash; this was agreed with the interest groups &mdash; was extended from three to six months; in the case of minors and persons of unsound mind, the claims can be made within six months of the cesser of their legal disability; the purpose of the scheme has been extended to include that the scheme shall continue indefinitely; no claimant by virtue of the statutes of limitation will lose their legal right to initiate proceedings because of making a claim to the tribunal; the discretion of the tribunal to hear oral evidence was extended; the making available of medical and other expert reports to claimants is explicitly incorporated into the scheme; a claimant to whom an award <Col N="1714" /> has been made by the tribunal &ldquo;shall be awarded the legal costs and expenses associated with the claim&rdquo;; and the report of the tribunal in so far as is practicable shall not identify any claimant.</P>
    <P>During the course of negotiations in November 1995 it was agreed between my Department and interested groups that the time within which a claimant must apply to the tribunal would be extended from three to six months, as is now the case in the tribunal scheme.  In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must apply within six months of the date upon which they first become aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, whichever date is the later.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant whom it is satisfied was under a legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser and that legal disability.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to extend the time limit for applications any further as there is no valid reason to do so.  The closing date for receipt of applications by the tribunal is next Monday, 17 June.</P>
    <P>Since its inception the tribunal has accepted application forms unsupported by medical data and or records.  The tribunal records the applications when received and the claimants or their solicitors are requested to supply outstanding documentation as soon as it becomes available.  The recent addition to newspaper advertisements to the effect that the application form is accepted by the tribunal without the supporting medical data and or record was made to ease concerns expressed by claimants and solicitors who may be experiencing some difficulties in obtaining medical records or reports before the closing date.  The Compensation Tribunal had indicated that it has &ldquo;made awards in claims where the <Col N="1715" /> claimant has received a blood product but was not in a position to match the blood given to particular batches supplied by the Blood Transfusion Service Board&rdquo;.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will see from that that the interpretation of the balance of probabilities, in terms of the connection between the virus and the blood product, is being looked at and adjudicated on by the tribunal in a very fair way and not the rigid lines she has suggested.  The tribunal has also stated that &ldquo;medical reports submitted to the Tribunal should, in cases of doubt deal with the exclusion of other causes for the contracting of the condition of hepatitis C&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Cases before the tribunal are heard in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  The claimants' cases are decided on the balance of probabilities. The tribunal relies primarily on written medical reports in its consideration of individual claims.  The claimant must, no later than six weeks before the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing, submit in writing, reports prepared by doctors or other health care professionals who have treated or examined the claimant, and relevant reports prepared by other experts, on which the claimant intends to rely.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has been hearing a maximum of 12 cases each sitting week and I am informed that the hearing of the cases in respect of the applications received to date will carry its workload into 1998.  Claims can be listed for hearing before the tribunal on lodgement of all the relevant documentation.  I have been informed by the tribunal that any application for a priority hearing has been and will be dealt with sympathetically by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>To ensure all potential claimants to the tribunal were aware of the establishment of the tribunal and the time within which claimants should lodge their application, the tribunal placed advertisements initially in the national and provincial newspapers on a monthly basis.  As and from the week ending 5 May 1996 advertisements were placed <Col N="1716" /> weekly to heighten awareness of the approaching closing date of 17 June 1996.  In addition, to ensure that all solicitors representing claimants are aware of the closing date, the tribunal also placed an information insert in the April-May 1996 edition of the <i>Law Society Gazette.</i> Such coverage is essential to ensure, as far as possible, that potential claimants are made aware of the tribunal as an alternative to court proceedings to provide fair compensation to persons who have contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions or blood products.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, the total number of persons with hepatitis C who had received a blood transfusion or blood product who have been identified to date is 1,356.  The compensation tribunal has to date received 766 applications and I have been informed by the tribunal that a substantial additional number of applications is expected before the closing date.  Since its commencement the tribunal has heard 69 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £15,500 to £324,321. A sum of approximately £7.3 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal and no tribunal award has been rejected.  Payment of an award is made within 28 days of receipt by the tribunal of notification of acceptance of an award.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently, as I have envisaged, and at this stage it has hearing dates arranged until 31 July, 1996.</P>
    <P>While Deputies have been responsible in their approach to hepatitis C issues, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has acted irresponsibly.  This is particularly true in relation to the charges she made against the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, inside and outside the House. It was suggested, inside and outside the House, by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that as the expert group did not see a particular file, which had been discovered under a court order, it was, therefore, not fully informed on the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis of the donor to the plasma pool used in the manufacture of the anti-D product in <Col N="1717" /> 1976-77.  The clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis of the donor in question was presented by them as a new revelation. This was not a new revelation.  As I previously stated in the House, at the time of establishment of the expert group the Department of Health, the then Minister for Health, the Government and the members of the expert group were in no doubt that the donor to the plasma pool had an episode of infective hepatitis.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the expert group report was based on incomplete information and that the group might have reached different conclusions or made different recommendations if certain documents had been made available to the expert group.  The chairman of the expert group, Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien, following a request to attend the Select Committee on Social Affairs, wrote on 27 May 1996 to the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Pattison.  In her letter to the committee, which she subsequently published, Dr. Hederman O'Brien stated that, neither the other members of the expert group &mdash; Professor Alistair Bellingham and Dr. Caroline Hussey &mdash; nor herself had received &ldquo;any information to cast doubt on the correctness of the conclusions&rdquo; in the report nor were they &ldquo;in doubt about the validity of the recommendations which they made to improve the Blood Transfusion Service Board and medical practice generally relating to blood and blood products in Ireland&rdquo;. In the light of this letter, I call on Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn to make a personal statement to Dáil Éireann to explain why she attacked the good name of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea and why, despite the fact that Dr. Hederman O'Brien's letter has been published for over two weeks, she has not yet offered an apology to him.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House of the terms of reference of the expert group: To examine and report to the Minister for Health on the following matters: all the circumstances surrounding the infection of the anti-D immunoglobulin product manufactured by the <Col N="1718" /> Blood Transfusion Service Board; and the systems and standards in place for donor selection, the manufacturing process and use of the anti-D immunoglobulin produced by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, to make recommendations to the Minister for Health on the above matters and any other matters relating to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which the group consider necessary.  It is clear, therefore, from the contents of the letter forwarded by Dr. Hederman O'Brien to the Select Committee on Social Affairs that the expert group is satisfied that it fully addressed its terms of reference and stands over its conclusions and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The scheme of compensation approved by the Government offers numerous advantages as opposed to court proceedings.  It is worth outlining again for the benefit of potential claimants the main advantages the tribunal affords applicants.  It offers speed, informality, flexibility and privacy; negligence need not be proved; the right of court action is completely preserved unless and until an award is accepted; the scheme is optional and imposes no disadvantage; the concept of a provisional award, which is not available in Irish law, allows a claimant to return to the tribunal for future specified unexpected consequences of the hepatitis C infection.  This is a particularly important option for claimants given the uncertain nature of the infection.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with other criticisms of the tribunal which are without foundation but continue to be recited by Positive Action and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and continue to be published in the media.  In relation to provisional awards, Positive Action raised concerns in relation to a contract between the claimant and the State if a provisional award is accepted by a claimant.  In this regard, I have been advised by the Attorney General that the terms of any award made by the tribunal would be enforceable before the courts.  When a provisional award is made the tribunal will issue a letter to the claimant specifying that the award is <Col N="1719" /> Provisional and that the claimant may make a further application to the tribunal in the event that a particular serious consequence or consequences occur and will specify the time period within which the claimant may apply. This letter to the claimant will support the legal contract which arises following the acceptance of a provisional award. The claimant may request the tribunal to approach a claim on the basis of a provisional award.  It has been claimed that the tribunal will use its discretion against the making of awards on a provisional basis.  I would like to inform the House that all claimants to date who have sought a provisional award in the tribunal have been granted a provisional award.</P>
    <P>Positive Action also raised the question of judicial review of the proceedings before the tribunal.  I have been advised by the Attorney General that proceedings before the compensation tribunal will be subject to judicial review.  It was also claimed that the tribunal would not hear the oral evidence of the claimant.  I understand that in all cases heard by the tribunal the oral evidence of the claimant has been heard and that the tribunal has advised the legal profession and other interested parties &ldquo;that claimants shall be entitled to give oral evidence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will now summarise the reasons I will not extend the time limit within which applications can be made to the tribunal: (i) It is in the best interest of potential claimants that they get legal advice at the earliest possible date on which course of action they should pursue. A time limit within which an applicant must apply focuses the attention of the legal representatives, solicitors and barristers, on the cases of persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C; (ii) The indefinite extension of the date within which a claimant must apply to the tribunal, will lead to uncertainty for potential applicants in regard to the compensation issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> A closing date for receipt of applications to the tribunal should avoid the administrative delays that may arise in some solicitors' offices.  In negotiations with interested groups.  I agreed to extend from three to six months the time limit within which a claimant must apply and this is now included in the scheme.  Sufficient time has been afforded to potential claimants who wish to pursue claims in the tribunal to lodge their applications.  It was agreed by Positive Action in November 1995 that six months was an adequate period for this purpose.  I have been assured by the tribunal that an applicant will not be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement on the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing and Members should note that point.  Consequently, whether a person applied six months ago or applies now or next autumn, the date for the tribunal hearing can be arranged only with the consent of the applicant and solicitor.  Therefore, the issue of extension does not arise.  If applicants wish to wait they may do so, nobody will force a hearing on them on a particular day.</P>
    <P>Following the closing date, I will have a reliable picture of the full financial implications of the compensation tribunal for budgetary policy reasons.  It is essential that the likely demand on the Exchequer is determined to the maximum extent possible.  Members may believe this is not of any consequence, but they will recall that I asked the Minister for Finance for £100 million last year to cover the 1996 costs of the tribunal.  A sum of £60 million has been provided, £30 million of which we expect to be expended.  We need to know the full picture so that sufficient money can be set aside each year to meet claims and that is what I intend to do.  As taxpayers will have to fund these costs, they are entitled to know we are proceeding in the normal way when the Dáil is requested by the Executive to endorse the expenditure of major amounts of money.</P>
    <P>The compensation tribunal is operating successfully, thus ensuring <Col N="1721" /> that the Government's commitment to provide fair compensation for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from blood products or blood transfusion is being honoured.  The scheme will continue indefinitely as an alternative to court proceedings and will serve the best interests of persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  As I already stated, the closing date for receipt of applications to the tribunal is 17 June 1996 and claimants who wish to pursue claims to the tribunal should ensure their applications forms are lodged with the tribunal on or before that date.</P>
    <P>The operation of the tribunal is subject to review.  If I have evidence or am convinced at any time in future that its workings are not serving the best interests of claimants, I will use my powers under the scheme to ensure that at all times it meets the needs of persons infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to difficulties being experienced in tracing records, particularly by persons who have been infected by blood rather than blood product and who are represented by Transfusion Positive.  When this issue was raised by Transfusion Positive with my officials it was asked to forward names.  It forwarded ten names of persons experiencing some difficulties.  My Department has helped to trace the records in two cases and ongoing inquiries are being made in respect of the other eight.  While that is an important issue for those eight people, we are not talking about hundreds of applicants, as suggested by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. In case she or Deputy Hughes do not believe what I say about the tribunal being fair, just and efficient, I will quote from a letter received in my Department from Mr. Brian O'Mahony, chairman of the Irish Haemophilia Society which states:</P>
    <P>I confirm that approximately 25 persons with haemophilia have to date attended the hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal.  All those who have attended have been pleased by the informal nature and thorough <Col N="1722" /> manner in which cases have been heard.  All the individuals have accepted the awards to date and indicated their satisfaction with the entire process.</P>
    <P>That organisation knows how to justly process compensation claims because it previously represented persons with HIV.  Members will recall the circumstances of the 1989 election and the measures put in place subsequently which provided fair compensation for members of the Irish Haemophilia Society.  An endorsement of the tribunal's proceedings by the chairman of the Irish Haemophilia Society is very welcome.  As I said when I inherited this traumatic affair, I set up the compensation tribunal as an alternative for persons who do not want to pursue their actions in the court.  I am not taking away any person's right to pursue his or her action through the court.  Applicants who receive awards through the tribunal will have a month to decide whether to accept them.  If they reject them they are free to continue to process a court action already commenced or to initiate such an action for compensation.  If they go the route of the High Court they will be treated fairly and justly, similar to the way applicants for compensation for personal injuries are currently treated. However, they will not have the advantage of provisional awards because they are not part of Irish law.  By establishing the tribunal on a non-statutory basis we were able to insert a provision for provisional awards, of which applicants who take that route can avail.  Ultimately, this is a matter for individual applicants, their families and legal advisers.  I ask Members not to try for party political reasons to unduly influence people's decisions, which must be made freely and without undue pressure. There are two fair and just routes available to them, the tribunal and the High Court.  I do not have a preference on which course applicants should follow. I could make a good political case for applicants to take the route of the High Court, which would be to the <Col N="1723" /> advantage to the Government.  If applicants pursue their cases through the High Court the Government would not have to pay the compensation because the bulk of it would arise long after the next general election.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a very stout defence of his trust in the tribunal and has given the reasons he believes people have confidence in it. He should, however, allow the High Court to make awards before saying that the awards granted by the tribunal are equitable and fair.  For a variety of reasons, 69 people, out of 1,356, have accepted the awards granted.  We all know people who are affected and there is great pressure to agree settlements.  It is impossible to make judgments on the workings of the tribunal at this juncture. All we are asking is that the Minister extend the deadline, at least until the High Court adjudicates on cases before it.  Until that is done he cannot stand over the workings of the tribunal.  He can then come in here and talk about the fairness of the tribunal and the financial settlements made.  The Minister may be correct in what he says, but equally he may be incorrect.  He should ensure that the High Court speedily <Col N="1725" /> deals with cases before it so that there is a positive outcome for the people involved.</P>
      <P>What is the great rush for a deadline? The Minister said tonight that, through his trojan efforts, he succeeded in getting £60 million in this year's Estimates. He went on to say that he will not need £60 million, that he will spend £30 million in 1996.  He said that the tribunal will work on processing claims until 1998.  If that is the case, why is there panic for a deadline? Why can the date not be extended to allow those who believe that the High Court is the more equitable route to take that course? Having gone through the tortuous procedure of having claims processed through the tribunal there will then be a cut-off point.  That is the reason for the objections to the Minister's actions. The people affected are not agitators or people who will attend protest meetings and they do not wish to get embroiled in the political arena.  They are reliable citizens and tragically for them the State has let them down.  They find themselves in tragic circumstances because of the actions of an arm of the medical service. The Minister is confronted with a major problem.  An arm of the medical service let down the Establishment because it did not handle its affairs properly, and that has resulted in the present serious problem.</P>
      <P>The expert group, set up when Fianna Fáil was in office, reported on this matter. The Minister is taking a liberty with his supposed explanation in this regard. Neither he nor Dr. Hederman O'Brien stated that they saw the file that was produced in the High Court.  That information was not made available and we do not know whether the file would have had an impact on the deliberations of the expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument competently put by my two colleagues is not unreasonable.  The Minister will call in his colleagues from the various Government parties to push through the amendment to our motion and the date will not be extended. Because of the extent of the work of the tribunal and the time it will take, there <Col N="1726" /> is no justification for refusing to extend the deadline.  I suggest an extension at least to the end of the calendar year to allow some of the High Court cases to be processed.</P>
    <P>About half the total number of people involved have made application and the Minister said that information from solicitors and others is that there will be an inflow of applications before the deadline.  A substantial number of people who make application to the tribunal will want to have their case heard in the High Court and should be entitled to do so.  There is a perception that the bureaucrats are dictating the trend in this instance and that the Minister, the political master of affairs in the Department, must accept the rigid guidelines laid down.  He is defending the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Minister previously about matters such as this where health organisations such as the Eastern Health Board made decisions that were not acceptable and that had to be modified later.  I would like to think there will be some degree of understanding and flexibility in this case.  People have requested an extension of the date and in view of their circumstances that is not an unreasonable request.  The Minister said that he will seek funding for 1997 and 1998.  There is, therefore, no urgent need for a deadline.  The cut-off point should not be decided until the High Court has made decisions in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the tribunal is making settlements of between £15,500 and £342,000.  The people involved are entitled to the choice of having their case processed through the tribunal or the High Court.  It is unacceptable that they be put through the torture of a tribunal and if they decide after a period of time that the settlement is not equitable they must embark on a long and protracted High Court case.  People are entitled to see the settlements which emerge from the High Court before deciding that the tribunal is fair and equitable, as the Minister says it will be. Given the tragic circumstances in which so many people find themselves, that is <Col N="1727" /> not an unreasonable demand so, on behalf of those making this request, I urge the Minister to grant the extension. I see no reason for not granting it, as it is being put forward in a balanced way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffat Dr. Moffat">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffat</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion, proposed by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to extend the time limit for application to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal on hepatitis C while keeping the legal venue and option open.  The House has discussed women's health on a number of occasions this year and all Deputies were at one in calling for something extra to be done.  We also discussed health regulations for travellers.  Despite these discussions, we are quibbling about a short extension of time for the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  This does not add up.  I ask the Minister to be gracious in this instance &mdash; it will not cost anything to give people more time to make up their minds on this issue.</P>
      <P>Women have borne the brunt of the hepatitis C problem.  There were difficulties with immunoglobulin, transfusions and transplants, and some children may have inherited hepatitis C from their mothers.  This unfortunate mistake by the Blood Transfusion Service Board should never have happened. The Government has accepted certain liability <i>secundum modem</i>&mdash; after a fashion &mdash; and this is where the problems arises.  I do not see why the Minister will not extend the time to make up one's mind given that, as he said, the legal route is still open.</P>
      <P>The problem is not primarily compensation; although that issue arises the women affected are not anxious about it <i>per se.</i> The main problem is that we do not know the extent of the crisis or what will happen to these individuals in the future.  The Minister said Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn did nothing about the issue when she was in office but the problem had then only arisen &mdash; it took time to evaluate it and to put in place proper methods for dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take the present position, if a person is suspected of having hepatitis C, <Col N="1728" /> she has an initial blood test and, if required, a follow up test to confirm the disease.  If the PCR test is positive, it may be necessary to have a liver biopsy. That may not be the end; the first liver biopsy may prove inconclusive and a second or a third may be needed within a number of months.  This is not a case where one can make one's mind up quickly &mdash; even heppatologists cannot decide overnight &mdash; and this is another reason we should not introduce a definitive cut off date.  People should be allowed time to make up their minds as they gain more knowledge about their cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that treatment may not be successful in every case and may only work in a small percentage of cases.  It is therefore most important that we see how cases evolve. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn mentioned the high number of sufferers who develop cirrhosis of the liver and that others may develop carcinoma of the liver.  We are facing a virulent hepatitis problem, a viraemia which has many implications for the future.  People who do not have all the knowledge at present may wish to weigh up their future health status before deciding whether to go to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal or through the courts system.  They are entitled to more time and it should be made available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the matter and look at the evidence.  He should give women every possible chance and not rush them into hasty decisions.  They may eventually decide to go to the tribunal but they should be given the chance to evaluate all the evidence and the likelihood that they, their husbands and their families, will encounter problems in the future.  Not alone will they suffer liver difficulties, they may also face psychological problems, chronic ill-health, rheumatoid arthritis, vision difficulties and chronic fatigue syndrome.  From the medical viewpoint, we should not rush them into anything.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said he would like to get this matter straightened out as <Col N="1729" /> quickly as possible so that he would be in a position to know how much it will cost the Exchequer.  However, he has the option of making provision on an annual basis for hepatitis C costs &mdash; he does not have to give all the money in one or two years and he does not have to finish all dealings with it while he is in office, as long as there is provision for continual care.  He has already provided for and extended primary care and I laud him for that.  He has examined the consultative aspect and given women every chance to see their own hepatologist. He has also provided for other modes of treatment should women wish to use them.  These are all welcome but the problem is so extensive that, to hark back to my main point, it is no harm to be generous.  Not everyone knows in the initial stages how the disease will progress and in many cases not even a hepatologist can give a definitive prognosis as to the likely outcome.</P>
    <P>The other problem which may arise is that records of blood transfusions may be incomplete and it may take some time to gather them all.  As our spokesperson said, it is therefore worthwile allowing extra time to do so, as a proper defence cannot be mounted unless the records are available.  The Minister said that only 25 to 30 people have sought a definitive records search to date but there will be many more as time goes on and they should be afforded more time to look at the matter.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have raised the bullying nature of this approach, if I may put it that way &mdash; an applicant must either accept the process or take her chances. People should not be threatened by the legal aspects of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is that we have lost the battle against criminals and it is time we regrouped and started to fight back.  In <Col N="1730" /> this context it is necessary to set up a night court which would process minor offences and offences against tourists.  I am sure that every year the Ceann Comhairle receives letters from visitors complaining about attacks on our streets.</P>
      <P>Tourists are being specifically targeted by young criminals who know they will not be present in court to give evidence against them.  It is extremely important, therefore, to bring these youngsters before court on the night they are apprehended.  It is time we got smart in terms of dealing with these young criminals and set up a panel of judges who would work on a roster basis &mdash; working in court at night time is not the most pleasant job.  For many years I called for the setting up of a night court to deal with motoring offences which can take up to two years to be heard in court.  The court system is clogged up and judges are no longer able to deal speedily with cases.</P>
      <P>When cases are heard in court the arresting garda has to be taken off the beat.  If a night court was in place gardaí would be able to bring offenders before it on the night the crime was committed. In 1994 the Garda Commissioner reported that the figure for juvenile crime indicated that 60 per cent of crime takes place between the hours of 4 p.m. and 4 a.m.  According to the national juvenile office, 55 per cent of crime takes place between the hours of 4 p.m. and 4 a.m., 34 per cent takes place between the hours of 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. and 11 per cent takes place during unlisted time.  In 1994 a total of 14,720 crimes were committed by juveniles aged between 17 and 18 years and dealt with by caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem calls out for a solution. I ask the Minister to accept that the streets are not safe at night and it is necessary to deal with these young criminals in the same way they are dealt with in America, that is by putting them in the tank and bringing them before the court.  The Minister of State is from Cork which is beleaguered by the same type of crimes as Dublin.  I ask him to <Col N="1731" /> bring this matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Owen, who must ask the Government to give it active consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister who is dealing with important business in the North.</P>
      <P>Section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which was substituted for section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, provides in part that where a person is arrested under warrant, or charged with an offence, after 10 p.m. and where there is to be a sitting of the District Court for that district before noon the following day, it will be sufficient that he or she be brought before that sitting.  If arrested before that time he or she shall be brought before a judge of the District Court as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>Sittings of the District Court in the Dublin Metropolitan District are held six nights a week that is Mondays to Saturdays, inclusive, as necessary.  The court sits in Chancery Street at the request of a senior member of the Garda Síochána and hears applications for the remand in custody of persons who are arrested before 10 p.m. that day.  The sittings are not designed to deal with the scheduled hearing of cases but rather with applications for remands in custody.</P>
      <P>There would be problems in establishing night courts on the basis suggested by the Deputy.  An arrested person is entitled to legal representation and time to prepare his or her defence. It would not be possible to arrange this at short notice in the evening after normal working hours.  There are also the questions of staffing and security arrangements which would be required if the court were to operate as it does during the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire courts system is currently being examined by the Working Group on a Courts Commission, under the chairmanship of Mrs. Justice Susan <Col N="1732" /> Denham, which was established by the Minister for Justice.  The terms of reference of the group include a review of the operation of the courts system, having regard to the level and quality of service provided to the public.  It is expected that the working group will reflect on the sort of issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this very important matter.  Last Friday morning an incident occurred in the village of Adare, County Limerick, which will enter the annals of legal history as one of the most dastardly, odious and brutal crimes ever perpetrated.  Two policemen who were momentarily stunned and effectively trapped in their vehicle were gunned down in a cold-blooded, callous and merciless fashion.  Those responsible for this outrage were vastly superior in terms of numbers and fire power.  Needless to say, they also had the advantage of surprise.</P>
      <P>These circumstances can be replicated anywhere at any time.  Potential assailants, whether they be para-militaries or ordinary criminals, know the type of security provided for cash in transit, the routes, the time and place of each stop and the type of weapons available for use against them.  All they have to do to virtually guarantee success is ensure that they deploy greater numbers and fire power.  As if that is not enough, they will also have the advantage of surprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the arrangements to protect large consignments of cash in transit are demonstrably and obviously unsafe. More seriously, the lives of those unfortunate plain clothes gardaí charged with providing the security are being placed in deadly jeopardy on a daily basis.  It is long past time to change that system. For example, might it not be prudent or practicable to arrange for routes and times of delivery to be varied?  In any case, is it not now obvious that the <Col N="1733" /> security provided should be strengthened? Available Garda manpower, of necessity, is limited.  However, we have a fully equipped and trained Army that has available to it a considerable amount of weaponry and armoured cars which are highly mobile.  Surely they could be utilised in this context?</P>
    <P>Is it just or justifiable to continue to expose the lives of our gardaí daily to the tender mercies of ruthless, sadistic criminals who obviously have no regard for human life or suffering?  If not, surely it is blindingly obvious that the system of protecting large consignments of cash in transit must be changed immediately.</P>
    <P>While excusing the absence of the Minister for Justice, I eagerly await the comments of the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the Minister's absence.  I want to put on record the Government's utter condemnation of the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the wounding of his colleague, Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan in Adare on Friday morning last.  The full rigours of the law are being applied to ensure that all those responsible for these abominable crimes will be apprehended and brought to justice.</P>
      <P>I also again express the sincere sympathy of the Minister for Justice, my own and that of the Government to the family, relatives, friends and Garda colleagues of Jerry McCabe.  His tragic death has deprived the McCabe family of a loving husband and father and the Garda Síochána of a loyal and dedicated member.  Jerry McCabe lost his life in the performance of his Garda duty in the service of his country and community.</P>
      <P>Out thoughts, too, at this time are with Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan who is, thankfully, recovering in hospital from his injuries.  We wish him a speedy recovery and return to full health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have reported that, on the morning in question, the two detective gardaí were deployed in an unmarked Garda car to escort an <Col N="1734" /> SDS van.  After both vehicles arrived in Adare village at 6.55 a.m., the Garda car was rammed from behind by a black Pajero jeep.  The occupants exited the jeep and shots were discharged fatally injuring Detective Garda McCabe and wounding Detective Garda O'Sullivan. The Pajero jeep was abandoned at the scene and its occupants were driven away in a silver Mitsubishi car which was later recovered by gardaí at Chawke's Cross, a few miles from Adare.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the motive for the attack was robbery of cash from the van which was under Garda escort.</P>
    <P>A major Garda operation was put in place immediately and is ongoing.  A number of persons have been detained for questioning and properties searched under warrant.  The investigation has so far resulted in one man being brought before the Special Criminal Court today on charges relating to the possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and membership of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to detail the progress of Garda investigations and I do not, therefore, propose to comment further on the current investigation, other than to say that there has been a very substantial and heartening response from members of the public to the Garda appeals for assistance.  I encourage anybody who has any further information about this crime, and who has not yet contacted the Garda, to do so without further delay.  Every item of information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can be important in progressing the Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>The safety and security of all persons engaged on cash escorts, including members of the Garda Síochána, is one of the foremost concerns of the Garda authorities.  The Garda authorities report that the security arrangements for these escorts are kept under continuing review and that the level of security provided takes account of all relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>For obvious reasons, it would not be <Col N="1735" /> appropriate to divulge the detailed security arrangements which apply in relation to cash escorts.  These are confidential Garda arrangements and their effectiveness is dependent on their being kept confidential.  However, the level of security provided on cash escorts can and does vary having regard to the Garda assessment of perceived security needs.  There is provision, where considered necessary in the professional judgment of the Garda authorities, to augment the level of security provided on individual escorts where this is deemed appropriate and, of course, there are arrangements whereby the Defence Forces provide extensive operational support for Garda escorts of large cash consignments.  I understand that Army support extends to approximately 27,000 cash escorts per annum and that, in addition, the Air Corps provides a level of aerial crime prevention support.</P>
    <P>It is standard Garda practice to review the operational arrangements following all major crimes.  This practice will, naturally, be followed in this case also and the Garda will fully assess the outcome of that review.</P>
    <P>The immediate Garda focus is on the apprehension of all those responsible for last Friday's atrocity.  The Government has pledged its full support for the Garda in their efforts to bring those responsible to justice.  They deserve our support and the support of the wider community.  The Minister for Justice acknowledges the support already given by many people in relation to this case.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have another opportunity to speak on this subject raised on Thursday last.  Thank <Col N="1736" /> you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your attention to the almost daily changing circumstances which are the Packard scene.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last the Labour Court had just issued its recommendation, when the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment informed us that he had just received it.  Obviously, the expectation was that that recommendation would be heeded and taken on board by Packard Electric and its parent company.  General Motors.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and his Minister of State seek an immediate meeting with the international management of Packard Electric and General Motors following their unprecedented decision to reject a Labour Court recommendation?  Packard Electric would have been the very first to condemn its workforce if it had not accepted a Labour Court recommendation. It is almost unprecedented for a major Irish employer to reject outright proposals of the Labour Court which is renowned for its adherence to equity and balanced decisions.  In this case, it took into account all the circumstances surrounding Packard Electric and issued its recommendation on Thursday last.</P>
      <P>Packard Electric is part of a major multi-national group that takes considerable revenue from our economy. Indeed, the Labour Court recommendation would constitute a mere drop in the ocean to the revenues of General Motors but would make a considerable difference to Packard workers.  The General Motors group should take a broader view of the redundancy payments for the Packard workforce and I call on it to honour in full the Labour Court recommendation.  I also call on the Minister and his Minister of State to meet the international management of Packard Electric and General Motors and impress on them the dim view the Irish public takes of the parsimonious manner in which they are approaching the basic rights of the workers in this plant.</P>

      <P>On 6 June I advised the House that the Labour Court had that day issued its recommendations in respect of certain matters referred to it by agreement between the unions and management of Packard following discussions under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission.  I appealed to both sides having had an opportunity to study the recommendations, to accept them in accordance with long-established precedent in Irish industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies concerns following the Packard Electric's decision to reject the Labour Court recommendations on redundancy terms for the workforce arising from the impending closure of the plant in Tallaght. However, notwithstanding that, I welcome the acceptance by the Trade Unions and the Packard workforce of the Labour Court recommendations, and in the light of this favourable reaction, I again request the company to urgently reconsider its decision in this issue.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the trade unions and management agreed under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission to refer a number of redundancy matters relating to the terms of severance, including the company's offer of five weeks redundancy per year of service inclusive of statutory entitlement, to the Labour Court for recommendation.</P>

    <P>In a fair and balanced manner, the Labour Court entertained submissions from both sides to the dispute and issued its recommendations last Thursday to both parties, which the company has now rejected.  It is useful to recap that these recommendations included: five weeks pay per year of service exclusive of statutory entitlements; that for purposes of calculating redundancy payments the outstanding Phases 1 and 2 of <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> due on 1 March 1995 and 1 March respectively be included; that the company pay the four days holidays <Col N="1738" /> claimed; that for purposes of reckoning service the termination date for employees now in work should not be earlier than 7 July 1996, this is to take account of employees on twilight shifts and so on who may finish and in some cases, have finished before that date; and the court would urge the company to give every assistance to employees in the areas of financial advice and job replacement.</P>
    <P>However, the Labour Court did not recommend a number of other claims submitted by the unions.  I and my colleague, Deputy Bruton, Minister for Enterprise and Employment, are extremely disappointed at the decision by Packard to reject the Labour Court recommendations on redundancy terms for the workforce which has already been dealt a severe blow with the decision to close the Tallaght plant by end July.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting with the parent Delphi Packard company prior to the issue of the Labour Court recommendations, I had urged the company, and also the workers, to accept the pending Labour Court recommendations in accordance with long-established precedent in Irish industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In this context the company is fully aware of the Government's commitment to implement without delay the recommendations of the interim report of the Tallaght Task Force dealing with a wide range of issues, including finding a replacement industry, training and retraining of workers, enterprise initiatives for the displaced workers, Packard suppliers and sub-contractors, support for the development of local SMEs and so on.</P>
    <P>It has also been conveyed to Delphi Packard and General Motors that every effort should be made to ensure that matters arising from the closure of the Tallaght plant should not adversely affect Ireland's reputation as an attractive location for inward investment, particularly for multinational companies. In this regard, it is in General Motors' interest, especially in view of its continuing significant interests in <Col N="1739" /> Ireland and overall corporate image, to manage the closure effectively and ensure that it takes place in an orderly manner.  Accordingly, I again appeal to the company in a spirit of goodwill and in recognition of the considerable contribution of the workforce over the years to accept the recommendations of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>We are in ongoing contact with Delphi Packard and General Motors in the USA and are pressing strongly for acceptance of the Labour Court recommendations. Such acceptance would facilitate the intensive efforts under way to provide alternative employment for the Tallaght workforce and create an environment favourable to tackling the huge social and economic problems arising from the plant closure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief contribution on what is regarded in Donegal as a very serious matter.  Today's announcement by the management of Fruit of the Loom that most workers in its factories in the north west will soon work on short-time until the end of this year has caused much concern among its large staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware the McCarters of Buncrana have made an enormous contribution to employment in Donegal down through the years and their relationship with their employees has been exemplary.  The announcement mentioned various factors beyond the control of management which are responsible for what it is confident is only a temporary drop in demand for its products throughout Europe.  They include the extraordinary unseasonable weather during recent months together <Col N="1740" /> with the sluggish state of many European economies.</P>
    <P>I kept in touch with various parties in Donegal today, including the director of the company.  I have no wish to be alarmist because I am well aware that irresponsible comment in situations like this is not helpful.  Today and in the coming days Mr. McCarter and his colleagues intend to discuss the position with as many employees as possible so that they will be kept fully informed of developments.  I have sufficient faith in Mr. McCarter's ability to be confident that Fruit of the Loom is no fly by night company.  His devotion to his native county is well known.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to ensure the company is provided with every assistance available to ensure that it can overcome this difficulty as soon as possible.  It is essential that every effort is made to reassure the workforce that their future is secure.  I hope no one would be so insensitive as to play party politics with an issue such as this.  I assure the Minister that politicians of all sides in Donegal will give him any support that might be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The McCarter family contribution to employment in Donegal is well recognised, appreciated and probably unparalleled in the country. The news is disappointing for the staff, but this has happened before.  The factories, which are well run, employ diligent staff and produce garments of excellence, are a great boost to Donegal. This very successful team is led by directors whose primary objective for the north west, to use their words, is &ldquo;to ensure that we not only retain but improve our competitiveness in the years to come&rdquo;.  They recognise that Irish workers continue to provide the highest levels of quality and commitment. That quality and commitment was recognised in the Joint Forbairt/ICMF Initiative of May 1996 on the clothing industry.  I welcome that initiative and ask the Minister to act on foot of that report.  I should encourage and enable <Col N="1741" /> all existing and potential industries in Donegal to overcome any obstacles like those currently there to fulfil the last paragraph of his foreword in that document which states, &ldquo;I am confident that, notwithstanding the intensity of the current competitiveness pressures, the Irish clothing industry can overcome these with the full support of Government and the development agencies, thereby securing a longterm viable future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fruit of the Loom is a great enterprise and I am confident that with an improvement in the market the current difficulties can be overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to that of my Donegal colleagues who have eloquently put their case.  I was happy to visit all the Fruit of the Loom plants in the north one day about three years ago at the invitation of Mr. McCarter. While my Donegal colleagues have a greater knowledge of them, I was very impressed by the diligence, expertise and commitment of the staff, management and particularly of Willie McCarter and his family.  I ask the Minister at this sensitive time to ensure due care is taken to focus on ever minute detail to assist the staff in that firm regain full-time employment.</P>
      <P>I understand there may be an opportunity for the Minister to contact Mr. Farrell in the US, who is involved in a parent company. He, in turn can give every encouragement to Fruit of the Loom Industries in the north-west. When one is as far away as he is, one leaves the running of the enterprise to the home management team.  It is doing very well.  However, it would be prudent for him to become involved in the long-term future of the firm and for all to work together to guarantee the much needed, highly acclaimed, highly skilled jobs which are greatly enjoyed by the mostly young population who work there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue in the <Col N="1742" /> very restrained way in which they have, which is born out of their genuine concern for the position in Fruit of the Loom.  I fully share their concern.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Fruit of the Loom informed its workforce that it will be placing the bulk of its production workers on a three-day working week with effect from 1 July next.  The company envisages that the short time working will last for the remainder of this year.  In all about 3,000 workers are involved.  This includes most of the Donegal workforce of 2,650, apart from administrative staff, about 200 workers in Derry and some 250 workers in Morocco.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the concerns of all those involved and I also recognise that these concerns are heightened as this is the second time, within the past nine months or so, that Fruit of the Loom has been forced to introduce short-time working.</P>
      <P>The company's decision to introduce a three day working week was not taken lightly.  I am aware, from the discussions I had last Friday with Fruit of the Loom's Managing Director, Mr. William McCarter, that the company gave very careful and detailed consideration to the matter before reluctantly arriving at its decision.  Fruit of the Loom has been forced to take this action, as the anticipated level of sales for 1996 was not coming up to expectations. While the company is continuing to hold its existing market share, it had been planning to increase this level during the current year.  However, a number of factors beyond its control has resulted in the company not realising its growth targets.</P>
      <P>These include, the continuing sluggishness of the European market, a bad spring, and a slow tourist trade in continental Europe.  Fruit of the Loom, therefore, was left with no option but to respond to the negative impact these factors have had on its sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently the company decided to address the current difficulties by reducing output through a temporary <Col N="1743" /> period of short time working to control its inventory growth.</P>
    <P>Obviously this is a disappointing development for Fruit of the Loom.  I am sure, however, that the Deputies will appreciate that the company must react to the market situation.  In all of the circumstances, they have concluded it was better that the necessary corrective action be taken now, by way of short-time working, rather than later when the situation might be far more difficult to correct.</P>
    <P>As Fruit of the Loom is the single largest employer in the north-west, the company's decision to go on short-time working will naturally have a significant impact on the entire region, not alone on the workers and their families, but also on the local economy on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Fruit of the Loom's managing director has written to all of its employees, explaining the position. In addition he has discussed the situation with the union representatives.  I understand the company's management will continue to keep everybody apprised of developments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that this is a trying and difficult time for everybody connected with Fruit of the Loom, management and workers alike.  Everybody, including members of this House should <Col N="1744" /> work together in the efforts being made by the company to overcome its current difficulties.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with Fruit of the Loom during this difficult period and, that the IDA intends to continue to market aggressively the north-west region as a suitable location for additional industrial developments.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the IDA that we should enter discussions with the US parent companies, and with Mr. Bill Farrell in particular.  I am certainly open to that suggestion.  I will obviously be guided, in the first instance, by the IDA and by Mr. William McCarter who is dealing at first hand with this problem. I can also assure Deputy Keaveney there is available to Fruit of the Loom assistance with research and development and product development to assist the company in addressing the problems it faces.  The present difficulties are not due to problems with the product but to a downturn in the market compared to expectations.  I have already met Mr. William McCarter.  I had a special briefing with the IDA today, and I am determined to ensure the IDA does everything possible to assist this company overcome its present difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 June 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is engaged in a broad-ranging programme of work to further the cause of equality in Irish society.</P>
      <P>I hope to publish the Equal Status Bill in the latter half of the year.  This Bill will deal with discrimination in non-employment areas on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>Work has commenced on the compilation of a report on implementation of the Platform for Action agreed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.  I hope to publish this report in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>I monitor progress towards gender balance on State boards on which much has already been achieved.  My objective is to see the fullest implementation of this policy.</P>
      <P>The Committee on the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women is chaired and serviced by my Department.  In its latest report, published in March, the committee noted that approximately 80 per cent of the recommendations had been implemented or were in the process of being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of employment equality I am currently preparing legislation to strengthen existing protection against discrimination in employment on <Col N="1544" /> grounds of sex.  This proposed legislation, however, will also extend protection to cover discrimination on the other grounds to which the Equal Status Bill will apply.</P>
    <P>I have also pursued series of legislative measures supporting the reconciliation of work and family commitments. The Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, are already on the Statute Book and consultations have commenced about preparing parental leave legislation following the adoption of an EU Directive by the Social Affairs Council on this subject earlier this month.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency, which works under the aegis of my Department, is already involved in addressing cases where issues of inequality exist in the context of sex discrimination in employment.  The agency assists persons in taking discrimination cases before an equality officer or the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The agency also provides information and advice to workers and employers on equal opportunities measures generally with a view to supporting efforts to eliminate inequalities in employment based on sex.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to a commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97,</i> I established the Task Force on the Travelling Community in July 1993, which published its report on 20 July 1995.  The report made recommendations covering a wide range of activity but principally related to the Departments of the Environment, Health, Education and my own Department.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of a Government decision I established an interdepartmental working group under the chairmanship of my Department to consider the implementation of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  The report of that interdepartmental working group was considered by Government on 26 March 1996 and a range of actions decided on.</P>
    <P>I understand that the relevant Departments are preparing action plans and priorities for the implementation of <Col N="1545" /> the recommendations of the report.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal has established a special unit in the Department of the Environment to implement its national traveller accommodation strategy.</P>
    <P>While it is a matter for each Minister to evaluate progress on implementing the recommendations of the task force in the area for which he or she is responsible, I will continue to maintain an active interest in how the implementation process develops.</P>
    <P>I established the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities to examine the disability area and to advise the Government on the practical measures necessary to ensure that people with a disability can exercise their rights to participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life.  The commission is due to present its report to me shortly.  The Government is determined, in line with the recommendations of the commission, to put in place mechanisms for full and equal participation by every citizen with a disability in every aspect of economic and social life.</P>
    <P>Work is also progressing towards the establishment of a Council for the Status of People with Disabilities.  The council will act on behalf of the various interests involved in promoting the welfare of people with a disability.</P>
    <P>I was conscious of the need to improve access to justice and, accordingly, when I was given responsibility for the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service I was determined to do all possible, within budgetary constraints, to expand and develop these services and to put them on a permanent footing.</P>
    <P>To this end, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board and with approval of Government.  I initiated a development plan for the board in 1993.  I secured increases in the Exchequer's grant-in-aid to the board from £2.718 million in 1992 to £3.206 million in 1993, £4.972 million in 1994, £6.2 million in 1995, and £6.5 million in 1996.  This enabled the <Col N="1546" /> board to engage additional staff and to increase the number of law centres. Numbers of staff serving with the board have increased from 99 to 225 in the period from 1993 to date and the number of full time law centres have increased from 16 in 1993 to the present figure of 26.  A 27th, at Navan, will be opening soon and a further three are expected to come on stream before the year's end.  Also, I embarked on a review of the means test limits in the scheme and the various allowances which are deducted from gross income to arrive at a figure for disposable income as these had remained unchanged since January 1991.  As a result of the review I had the income eligibility levels significantly increased with effect from 1 August 1995, thereby making the services of the Legal Aid Board available to many people who otherwise would be ineligible.  The impact of the additional resources on the Legal Aid Board is significant.  Waiting times for legal aid applicants have been greatly reduced, as have the distance an applicant must travel to avail of the board's services.  The board now has at least one law centre, either full-time or part-time, in each county.</P>
    <P>Over the years much interest has been expressed in having a statutory scheme of civil legal aid and advice introduced.  In this respect I am glad to say that the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, which provides a statutory framework for the scheme of civil legal aid and advice was passed on 16 December 1995.  The regulations necessary to give effect to that Act are in the course of being formally drafted.</P>
    <P>A provision of £300,000 has also been made for the development and expansion of the Family Mediation Service in 1996, which is more than double the 1993 provision.  This has facilitated the opening of a second family mediation centre at Limerick, and the engagement of additional staff for the service. Deputies may have noticed the advertisements in the media during the past week seeking persons to fill senior positions with the Family Mediation Service. <Col N="1547" /> Two of these are newly created posts which are critical to the further expansion and development of the service.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Medium-term Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men (1996-2000) was adopted by the EU Council of Social Affairs last December, the first occasion that a programme of this nature has Council decision status.  My Department was fully supportive of the programme in discussions at official level preparatory to the Social Affairs Council meeting.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Council of Ministers also established a management committee to oversee the operation of the Fourth Programme.  Ireland is represented on the committee by an officer of my Department.</P>
      <P>A central theme of the Fourth Programme is to promote the integration of equal opportunities for women and men into all aspects of economic and social life.  This process is also known as mainstreaming equal opportunities and a conference on mainstreaming will be held in Dublin Castle in October 1996, during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.  The conference, which is being co-funded by my Department and the European Union, is intended to develop frameworks for mainstreaming equal opportunities and the European Commission is availing of the occasion of the conference to formally launch the Fourth Programme throughout the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fourth Programme also aims to progress equal opportunities for women <Col N="1548" /> and men through mobilising all the participants involved, promoting the reconciliation of family and working life and promoting a gender balance in decision making.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise awareness of the programme, my Department has recently conducted a publicity campaign through the national media and has developed an information pack targeted at appropriate organisations, including the social partners, NGOs, local authorities, women's organisations and community groups.  The campaign was devised with a view to encouraging Irish organisations to participate in the programme through co-funded projects in the relevant policy areas on which the programme focuses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am still awaiting the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  I understand the commission is close to finalising it and expects to submit it to me shortly.</P>
      <P>A final draft of a working constitution for the interim Council for the Status of People with Disabilities has been prepared by the establishment group.  It is intended this document will be adopted by the interim council as a working document for the duration of its term of office and it contains rules laid down by the establishment group in relation to membership and election procedures. Final approval has not yet been given by the establishment group but it is intended that the final document will be available by the end of this month.  The establishment group is also in the process of preparing a formal constitution for the permanent council.  This document will be passed to the interim council. I understand that it will be the responsibility of the interim council to decide whether this constitution will form the basis of a framework document for the permanent council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Monitoring Committee on the Employment of People with Disabilities, which operates from the Department of the Taoiseach under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> has carried out a survey to establish the end-1995 position with regard to the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service.  The figure stands at 1.49 per cent.  There remains work to be done to achieve the 3 per cent target <Col N="1551" /> already reached in the Civil Service.  My Department has engaged in consultations with the Departments of Finance, Health and Environment to ensure that Human Resources Managers in bodies under their control are aware of the Government's commitment to reaching the 3 per cent quota and to ensure that ever effort is made to reach it as soon as possible.  An officer of my Department is also on the monitoring committee which intends writing to the secretaries of each Department to ask that the matter be taken up with the chief executive officers of each body under the aegis of their Departments.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be bringing forward employment equality legislation which will provide protection against discrimination on a number of grounds, including disability.  I hope to publish the Equal Status Bill in the latter half of the year.  This Bill will provide protection against discrimination on grounds of disability in non-employment areas.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Commission on the Status of People with Diabilities has also been examining the question of legislation with regard to disability. When it submits its report to Government, we will examine its recommendations and any legislation required, to set out the rights of persons with a disability, together with means of redress for those whose rights are denied, will be prepared.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to his written <Col N="1553" /> question of 5 June 1996, in which I outlined the number and nature of ministerial and diplomatic visits to Libya and Egypt in the last five years.  As already indicated, there have been 11 visits to Libya by Irish diplomatic officers since 1991; of these nine were to discuss the importation by Libya of Irish cattle and beef, one was to discuss trade and technical co-operation between Ireland and Libya including beef and cattle imports and the purpose of the remaining visit was to attend the inauguration of an infrastructure project.</P>
      <P>Irish diplomatic relations with Libya have been maintained on a non-residential basis by the Irish Embassy to Italy ever since diplomatic relations were opened with Libya in 1977.  Four ambassadors have been accredited to Libya during this period.  The latst Irish Ambassador to be accredited to Libya was the late Ambassador C.P. Fogarty who presented his credentials in Tripoli on 13 October 1987 and served until December 1991 in that capacity.</P>
      <P>There have been no ambassadorial visits to Libya in the past four years. The Government has nominated the current Irish Ambassador to Italy, H.E. Joseph Small, as Ambassador to Libya and arrangements are being made for his accreditation by agreement with the Libyan authorities.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to questions on 30 May, the Government supports measures which will maintain political and economic pressure on the Nigerian regime to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law.  On that occasion I also confirmed that we have been unequivocal in our support for the introduction of such measures as an oil embargo as a catalyst for meaningful reform.  This continues to be the Government's position.  We recognise however, that to be effective additional measures such as an oil embargo will need widespread international support. We therefore support EU consultation with like-minded states on the adoption of these and other appropriate measures.  We are working closely with <Col N="1556" /> EU partners and like-minded states in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government supports the view that multi-nationals such as Shell should carefully consider the environmental impact of their business operations. There is a clear responsibility on them to do so.  There is also an onus on the Nigerian Government and state partners in oil production to do likewise and to ensure that the benefits of mineral extraction are also conferred on the local population and that they have proper legal redress where they suffer from environmental damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>On my instructions, the delays referred to by the Deputy have been raised by the Irish Embassy in London with the relevant British authorities.  Those authorities have replied that the checks on vehicles and examination of documents at Fishguard, Wales and other British ports are carried out under the provisions of Schedule 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has frequently expressed its concerns regarding the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  While fully accepting the need to counter any threat of violence, the Government has consistently advocated that violence and terrorism should be dealt with as far as possible under the provisions of the ordinary law.  We have <Col N="1557" /> urged the British authorities to ensure that these provisions do not impact in a general and undiscriminating manner on the Irish community and Irish people travelling between these islands.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear before, the Irish Government seeks the dismantlement of emergency legislative provisions to the fullest extent practicable.  We have made our views in this regard clear to the inquiry being conducted by Lord Lloyd which is considering the future need for specific counter terrorism legislation in Britain if there is lasting peace in Northern Ireland and we have also outlined to him our general concerns regarding the operation of the PTA. The Mitchell report stated that early implementation of the proposed review of emergency legislation, consistent with the evolving security situation, would bolster the trust which is crucial to the shared objectives of the two Governments.</P>
    <P>Pending progress on dismantling this legislation, I repeat the assurances I gave at the Irish Club in London in March that our embassy in London will continue to raise any concerns which the Irish community and Irish people generally have about the operation of PTA powers.  We will continue to urge that every care be taken to ensure that the emergency powers are implemented in a sensitive and even-handed manner in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>A major engineering investigation has been carried out by a firm of consulting engineers on behalf of the Office of Public Works to determine the causes of, and to devise solutions for, the flooding problems at Duleek, County Meath. Proposals to remedy the problem are being assessed to ensure that whatever works are eventually undertaken are compatible with the environment and can be economically justified.</P>
      <P>The main works being suggested for the Duleek scheme are concentrated in and about the town itself and the confluence of the Nanny and Paramadden rivers and involve channel works, construction of embankments along these watercourses and works to some roads in the area.  However, the full extent of the works has not yet been finalised pending completion of the environment impact assessment and cost benefit analysis.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the results of the various investigations should be available during the summer and provided the proposals are found to be economically viable and environmentally compatible, scheme documentation to meet the statutory requirements of the Arterial Drainage Acts will then be prepared. It is expected, therefore, that a flood relief scheme for Duleek will reach public exhibition stage in the autumn, when interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on the scheme proposals, with works commencing on site later in the year and running into 1997.</P>

      <P>A special foreign earnings deduction was introduced in section 154 of the Finance Act, 1994.  That section introduced the deduction for persons resident in the State who work outside it for significant periods.  It is aimed at those committed to working aboard for significant periods. It applies to persons who work aboard, other than in the UK, for a least 90 days in a period of 12 months in continuous periods of at least 14 days at a time.  The relief operates on a proportionate basis related to the amount of time spent abroad in a year.  Thus, broadly speaking, if a person works abroad for six months the relief is equivalent to half of the person's income for the year.  The relief is not available to persons employed in the public sector.</P>
      <P>Extending the relief to income earned in the UK would make the relief available to residents of this State crossing the Border to work in Northern Ireland. This would be likely to give rise to widespread abuse leading to significant Exchequer cost.  It would also carry some risk of a relocation of economic activity north of the Border with further adverse consequences for Exchequer revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is not the same justification for providing a special tax incentive for Irish residents to go to the UK for business purposes because of the proximity of the countries, the almost common labour market and common language.  The foreign earnings relief is aimed instead, for instance, at those going overseas, many to <Col N="1561" /> developing countries, where they are selling and carrying out consultancy and other services.</P>
    <P>This relief, introduced in 1994, replaced an earlier concessional relief which provided that unremitted earnings were not taxed.  This earlier relief had not applied to the UK.</P>

However, it has come to notice that certain characteristics of the site and the presence there of pre-fabs housing a number of staff, impose cost pressures &mdash; including the need for construction to be carried out in two separate phases &mdash; which give rise to construction costs higher than would arise on another site. Efforts are being made to locate an alternative site and it is hoped that this process can be brought to a successful conclusion shortly.</P>

      <P>There have been significant developments in recent years in the level of services available to persons with a disability.  With reference to services to persons with a mental handicap, additional funding of £44.58 million was invested in the development of the services in the period 1990 to 1995 which has enabled the health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.  A further £12 million has been provided in 1996 to continue this ongoing development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services.  However, I am aware that more needs to be done. The Government is committed under the health strategy document Shaping a Healthier Future and the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the services as resources become available.  That commitment is reflected in my decision, with my colleague the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to prepare a five year development plan to meet the needs identified by the new national mental handicap database.  I expect this plan to be ready <Col N="1564" /> later this year.  This develop plan will play an important role in the Estimates discussions later this year with a view to having substantial additional funding made available in 1997 and future years for the continued development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, additional funding totalling £6 million has been provided for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  A review group was established to examine the health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities in 1992.  Its report, which is due to be published shortly, will provide a blueprint for the further development of services for people with disabilities into the next decade.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In January 1995 the Eastern Health Board requested a meeting with me to discuss the future development needs of James Connolly Memorial Hospital and on 16 February 1995 a meeting took place between myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, and a delegation from the Eastern Health Board.  Having taken the <Col N="1565" /> views of the Eastern Health Board into account and the fact that no significant upgrading had taken place in 40 years I agreed that the hospital required major development.  The board indicated that it was prepared to utilise funds from the sale of some surplus land to provide funding towards this development.  On this basis, I agreed in principle to participate and match the funding being provided by the board on a £1 for £1 basis to a maximum of £8 million.  The board has identified the need for a new accident and emergency department, intensive care and coronary care units and new ward accomodation and these are being addressed in the new development.</P>
      <P>In relation to the disposal of surplus land on the James Connolly Memorial Hospital site, the Eastern Health Board has advised me that it has recently applied to Fingal County Council for a variation of the county development plan to have the land rezoned for development purposes.</P>
      <P>This is the first major injection of funds at James Connolly Memorial Hospital since it was completed in the 1950s.  A large amount of development is required and all requirements cannot be met in this initial development.  The hospital will, however, have a programme of development to ensure that all areas of the hospital will be brought up to the highest standards of accommodation available in any of the other hospitals in the country.  A project team is now addressing the detailed planning of the new development and the measures leading to the appointment of a design team are under way.  I am happy to be associated with this major development plan for the hospital which I hope can be expedited in order that patients and staff of the hospital can enjoy top class facilities and services.</P>

    <P>An additional £3 million revenue funding was provided nationally in 1996 to facilitate the further development of additional residential-respite and day care places.

The Western Health Board regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee recommended <Col N="1567" /> that this funding be used in 1996 to facilitate the provision of additional respite care services in the region and I have approved its proposal.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am very concerned about the number of people on the waiting list for cardiac surgery and I am anxious to reduce the waiting period for those people at present on the list.  The strategy to deal with cardiac surgery waiting lists has been to provide additional facilities and infrastructure within the public hospital service to increase annual activity.  To date this strategy has resulted in additional cardiac surgeon being appointed at the Mater Hospital where the annual activity for open heart operations has been increased by 250 per year to 1,000 per year, and an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed to Cork University Hospital to increase the output from 200 to 400 open heart operations per year.  The combined effect of this action will be to increase annual activity for cardiac surgery to 1,400 per year an increase of 47 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to expand the current public hospital capacity for cardiac surgery. I am fully committed to the provision of additional capacity including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public hospital system over the next two to three years.  This examination of the long-term requirements has already begun.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take <Col N="1571" /> some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.</P>
    <P>In the interim my Department is engaged in the purchase of open heart surgery from health care organisations at prices which are reasonable and affordable on a once-off basis.  I wish to stress that the major objective is to increase the permanent capacity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector and in the meantime to provide additional procedures quickly to ease the problems of those awaiting cardiac operations.  I am hopeful that the short-term approach, with the long-term planning initiative, will ensure that waiting times for cardiac surgery are reduced significantly and I look forward to co-operation from everybody involved to bring this about as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The waiting periods for legal aid applications in each of the full-time law centres of the Legal Aid Board in the Dublin area as of 30 April 1996 is set out in the following tabular statement.  Waiting times at the law centres are continually monitored by the Legal Aid Board and remedial action is taken, as necessary.</P>
      <P>As a result of the programme of expansion and development of the Legal Aid Board which I introduced in 1993 the number of law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board in Dublin increased from five to seven.  There was a corresponding increase in the number of staff employed in those law centres, from 39 in 1963 to a current figure of 69.  These initiatives have brought about an overall reduction in waiting time at the Dublin law centres, where the waiting times at the end of April, 1996 were as follows: one centre at less than one month; two centres at two months; three centres at three months; one centre at six months.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the reduction in waiting times achieved by the board to date are set to continue in 1996 and beyond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the measures to promote the film and television production industry which have been put in place by this Government will continue to promote a sustained level of both indigenous and non-indigenous production in Ireland in 1996 and in the years to come.</P>
      <P>The indications so far are that 1996 will witness a strong level of film and television production, with 16 films and eight television productions either commenced, completed, or likely to proceed this year, including at least six international productions.  Given the relatively early stage of the year, further film and television projects can be expected to emerge.  Since the introduction of the new section 35 package, I have received eight applications for certification and I have already certified three of these, while awaiting further information on the other applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of improving the promotion of Ireland as a location for film and television production, I am happy to inform the Deputy that I took advantage of a prior commitment to deliver the keynote <Col N="1579" /> address at a United States national conference on Irish film and culture in Charlottesville, Virginia on 9-11 May last, to visit Los Angeles also.</P>
    <P>My message to the many film producers I met during my visit was that, with the new section 35 package in place until mid-1999, and given the proactive logistical support which is available here from both central and local government in terms of the provision of locations, facilities and technical support, the producers should give serious consideration to the location of film and television production in Ireland over the next three years.</P>
    <P>It remains my intention to implement the commitment in the Policy Agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> by proceeding with the establishment of a Screen Commission at the earliest possible opportunity.  I would see the role of such a Commission as targeting the European as well as the American market for film projects to locate here and, now that the new section 35 package of incentives is firmly in place until mid-1999, I would hope to secure the Government's approval to fully exploit the future potential here by establishing such a Commission.</P>
    <P>As for the likely position in respect of the years 1997-1998, I am not in a position to respond to this request since applications for certification of film and television projects are generally submitted to my Department only two-three months before production is likely to commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that, since the establishment of STATCOM &mdash; the Committee of State bodies and agencies involved with the Irish film industry &mdash; there has been an enhanced presence by Irish producers at international film and trade festivals, notably at Cannes, Berlin and Venice.  This increased presence has been facilitated by support from An Board Tráchtála resulting in the &ldquo;Ireland on Screen&rdquo; stand at both MIPTU and MIPCOM international trade fairs at Cannes, and participation at the Film Festivals by Board Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the conference in Los Angeles in February 1996, which is referred to in the Deputy's question, was the annual American Film Market. While I understand that this conference is an important forum for the buying and selling of scripts and projects emanating from the American independent film sector, the position is that this year's conference took place at a time when the main elements of the new section 35 package had just been announced in the budget on 23 January 1996.  My Department was subsequently involved in discussions with the Department of Finance and film industry interests which led to the final package being announced in the Finance Bill.  In <Col N="1584" /> these circumstances, I think the Deputy would agree that to attend the conference at a time when the final package had yet to emerge would not have been productive.</P>
    <P>The primary motivation behind my recent visit to the United States was an invitation which I have received in August of last year to deliver the keynote address at a United States National Conference on the theme of Irish Film and culture in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 9-11 May 1996.  As plans for the trip progressed, I decided to take the opportunity to visit Los Angeles also and to promote the new section 35 tax package for investment in films and other advantages of film production in Ireland to American film producers.</P>
    <P>My message to the many film producers whom I met during my visits was that, with the new section 35 package in place until mid-1999, and given the proactive logistical support which is available here from both central and local government in terms of the provision of locations, facilities and technical support, the producers should give serious consideration to the location of film and television production in Ireland over the next three years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 to 81, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The National Strategy for Travellers' Accommodation, which I announced on 27 March 1996, is the Government's comprehensive response to the recommendations on the accommodation of travellers contained in the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community. Details of the Strategy are set out in the reply to Questions Nos. 16 and 82 on 27 March 1996 and in my statement to the Dáil on 23 April 1996 on the report of the task force.  The strategy takes account of all the problems encountered to date in providing suitable accommodation for travellers and addresses accommodation needs arising from the increase in the number of traveller families and the pattern of migration of the traveller population.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recommendations of the task force concerning the establishment of a statutory Travelling Accommodation Agency, I refer to the reply to Question No. 155 of 21 May last.</P>
      <P>The location of individual halting sites is a matter for decision by the local authority concerned.  While the provision of such sites by local authorities is not subject to the public consultation requirements of Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, like all local authority development, halting sites must not contravene the terms of the relevant city or county development plan.  In this context, I refer to the proposals in the national strategy for amendments of the Planning Acts to put in place an effective framework to facilitate implementation of travellers accommodation plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of facilities and services provided on individual halting sites are matters for the local authority concerned in the first instance.  Services in halting sites are among the matters to be considered in the context of the review of the guidelines for local authorities on the provision of halting sites which is at present under way.  Proposals <Col N="1588" /> submitted by local authorities in relation to individual sites are considered in the light of prevailing technical standards and cost control procedures.</P>

It is understood from the corporation that their allocation this year will be fully utilised in respect of approved projects.

      <P>The statement below in <Col N="1591" /> tabular form sets out the location and number of Youthreach places in the education sector in County Dublin.  At present an expansion of the programme by a further 450 places nationally is under way, and applications for proposals have been invited from all vocational education committees.  A district approach is being implemented in the allocation of these places, which seeks to ensure, as far as possible, complementarity with the activities of other agencies in the area and with the plans of the local area based partnerships under the local urban and rural development operational programme.  In addition, as part of the expansion, innovative proposals have been requested which pilot new arrangements for progression for Youthreach <Col N="1592" /> trainees to higher levels of training, and which cater for groups with special needs, such as lone parents, young offenders, drug addicts etc.</P>
      <P>An application has been received for 110 additional places in Dublin City and County.  My Department will be entering into discussions at national level with FÁS and Area Development Management Ltd. before making final decisions shortly on the distribution of the new places.</P>
      <P>Trainees may enrol on a programme by making contact with their nearest Youthreach centre or Community Training Workshop or with their nearest FÁS or vocational education committee office, or with local community or social workers.</P>

      <P>Schools in the free education scheme are not entitled to charge pupils for a school place.  However, I understand that it is the practice in some schools to charge a booking or registration fee.  Charges of this nature are permissible under the scheme provided that it is clearly indicated that the fee is refundable when the pupil takes his/her place in the school.  There are no proposals under consideration in my Department which would require a school to refund fees to a pupil who has been offered a place but later fails to accept.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 91 and 97 together.  I am aware of the case made by the school mentioned by Deputy Eric Byrne in support of its application for a remedial teacher.  I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools.  I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources. The needs of all schools, including the schools mentioned by the Deputies, will be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education.  I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question. However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources <Col N="1595" /> to best effect.  During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a regional technical college in Blanchardstown was one of a number of developments recommended by the steering committee on the future development of higher education.  Consideration by me of these recommendations, including those relating to Blanchardstown, will continue over the next few months in consultation with my colleagues in Government. As stated in my press release of 28 March 1996 in respect of the site at Blanchardstown, an agreement between <Col N="1596" /> my Department and Dublin Corporation under which 20 acres was provisionally set aside for a new regional technical college ensures the Department's option on these lands remains in place until May 1997.  I am satisfied that this arrangement fully facilitates consideration by the Government and myself of the recommendations of the steering committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>In 1994 some concerns were expressed by music teachers about achievable attainment levels in the leaving certificate music examination.  In response I established a working party with representation from all sectors of music education to recommend some interim changes for the leaving certificate music examination in 1995, 1996 and 1997 pending the revision of the music syllabus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim changes were adopted, well received and implemented in full from 1996.  These included solo singing acceptable for practical in lieu of playing an instrument; wider choice in the area of practicals-projects; reallocation of marks among the various parts of the <Col N="1601" /> examination; and written, practical and aural.</P>
    <P>I have approved a new music syllabus which will be introduced in 1997 and will involve an intensive period of incareer development beginning from September next.  Four teachers have been seconded on a full time basis for two years for this purpose.  A training of trainers programme was also held in January 1996 to provide a cadre of experienced in-career development teachers. The new junior certificate music syllabus, which was examined for the first time in 1994, has been very well received in schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific queries relating to the 1996 examination it is the practice of the examiners to take into consideration any representations made relating to aspects of the examination, in the context of the overall answering.</P>

      <P>In line with the recommendations of the report, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers, and particularly those in rural areas with legal levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to contact the target schools and invite applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  The process of contacting these schools is now under way.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the primary school to which the Deputy refers allowed a Montessori school to use a vacant classroom for a number of years.  The primary school is due to appoint an additional teacher in September next and consequently needs the vacant classroom.  I understand that the primary school has offered to facilitate the Montessori school by allowing the location of a prefabricated classroom on the school site.  As the primary school operates under the aegis of my Department it is necessary for my Department to be satisfied that the proposed arrangement will not interfere with the operation of the primary school.  An inspector from my Department will assess the proposed arrangements and my Department will write to the school in the matter within the next couple of days.  In the meantime, if the school wishes to lodge the planning application, they may do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place for some time with the Irish Medical Organisation regarding a common contract of employment for all doctors.

    <P>Discussions are also taking place with the Eastern Health Board aimed at improving psychiatric care in prisons in the Dublin area by means of the formal sharing of psychiatric posts between the health service and the prisons.  Approval has been granted for this proposed restructuring and discussions are ongoing with a view to my Department entering into a contract with the Eastern Health Board for the provision of the revised psychiatric service to prisons in the Dublin area.  The possibility of having a similar arrangement elsewhere is being examined.</P>
    <P>In addition, negotiations on the introduction of qualified nursing staff into various prisons are progressing.  The presence of nurses would make a considerable contribution to the quality of health care in prisons.</P>

      <Col N="1609" /> The Garda authorities have informed me that the current Garda personnel &mdash; all ranks &mdash; allocated to Coolock Garda station is 92 members.  There are three mobile units allocated to the station and these are utilised in patrolling the subdistrict along with foot patrols.  These patrols are augmented by patrols from the detective unit, crime prevention unit, drug unit and community policing unit all based in Coolock.  The divisional task force unit based in Santry assists when required.  The community policing unit regularly liaises with local residents and the business community in Coolock and their patrols of the area are mainly on foot.  The Garda authorities inform me that two of the gardaí from the community policing unit are assigned to the Moatview-Fairfield area.  I also understand that, as with other stations in the Dublin metropolitan area, a small number of gardaí have been assigned to the Border on BSE protection duties.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present policing arrangements for the Coolock area are adequate. However they have assured me that the deployment of personnel within the Coolock area is being kept under continual review and adjustments will be made as necessary.</P>

However, they also recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 &mdash; three years &mdash; to 520 &mdash; ten years &mdash; contributions.  The report and its recommendations are being studied within the Department at present with a view to bringing forward proposals in a budgetary context.  Any such proposals would have to take account of the future funding of pensions.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 121, 122, 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide income support for the less well-off third level students who are debarred from qualifying for unemployment assistance during the summer months by virtue of the provisions of section 126 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  Priority therefore is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students, who have no other means of support, to take part within the allocation for the 1996 scheme.</P>
      <P>A student who qualifies for unemployment assistance at the current maximum weekly rate of £62.40, would receive a total amount of £374.40 over a six week period.  A student can work 200 hours under the scheme for a six week period and earn £600.  It is however, open to students who complete their work under the scheme in a six week period to take up employment during the remainder of the summer period in order to maximise their earnings.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned completes a course of studies in June he is entitled to claim unemployment assistance if he cannot find work during the summer period.  For the reasons already stated he is not therefore eligible to participate in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961 and its objective is to link entitlement to pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  It applies to all insured persons, including the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While precise figures are difficult to calculate it was estimated that up to 50,000 self-employed people may fail to qualify for an old age contributory pension because they were over 56 years of age in 1988 when social insurance for <Col N="1615" /> the self-employed was introduced &mdash; this was very much an upper limit estimate. Many of these people are likely, however, to qualify for an old age non-contributory pension, which is subject to a means test.  Also, the contributions they will have paid give cover for survivor's contributory pension to which entitlement can arise after three years' insurance.  Persons who enter social insurance for the first time after reaching 56 years of age, may be entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of their contributions provided that they are not entitled to or in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Where a person has less than ten years self-employment contributions paid but has earlier insurance as an employed or voluntary contributor for any period before age 56, both forms of contribution may be combined for purposes of assessing entitlement to pension.</P>
    <P>Also, social insurance contributions paid in an EU member state can be combined with contributions paid here to qualify for an old age contributory pension.  Social security contributions paid in a country outside the EU, but with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, can be combined with contributions paid here to qualify for a special pension under the agreement. This latter situation arises only when the applicant does not have an underlying entitlement to a pension under existing social security legislation in either member state.</P>

      <P>Community employment or CE is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide such person with temporary work experience opportunities together with an element of training that would <Col N="1618" /> enhance their prospects of mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>Under the CE programme, public sector and voluntary organisations are grant-aided by FÁS in respect of sponsoring a CE project and they in turn benefit in a secondary way by being able to carry out worthwhile work which they could not otherwise undertake. Suitable projects would be those that can be shown to respond to a clearly identified community need and which also develop the work skills of participants, thereby enhancing their prospects of mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>To better target CE at the long-term unemployed person, for whom the programme was originally introduced, CE has been split into the following distinct options.  The first is the part-time integration option, which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment would be enhanced by participation in the programme.  The following are eligible to participate in this option: those over 21 years and on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for at least 12 months; those over 21 years and on lone parent's allowance for over 12 months; and special categories such as those referred by the NRB or travellers on the live register or on lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>The second is the part-time job option which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects.  The following are eligible to participate in this option: those over 35 years and in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit for over three years; those over 35 years and on lone parent's allowance for over three years; and special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years or travellers who are over 35 years and on the live register or on lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants are generally engaged for a 12 months period for an average of 39 hours per fortnight.  However, some <Col N="1619" /> participants may be re-engaged for further periods with the agreement of FÁS where such participants are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available or where the participant would benefit from additional training development.  In particular, participants on the part-time job option, who have an annual contract of engagement for twelve months, can have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that some arts organisations have expressed concerns that they may find it difficult to recruit artists who have been a full twelve months in receipt of UB/UA, given that employment in the arts is, for the most part, periodic and short-term, I would like to point out that CE is designed primarily to meet the needs of those who are long-term unemployed and was never meant to provide ongoing core funding for the arts which may be funded by other Exchequer or private sources.</P>
    <P>The changes to CE are being introduced in order to better target the programme at the long-term unemployed so that they may share in the benefits of economic growth along with other sectors of society.  The Deputy will appreciate that, despite the success of the Government's overall economic and employment strategy in creating jobs, recent statistics indicate that such persons are often bypassed in job selection.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>Under Article 3 (c) of the Treaty on European Union the abolition, as between member states, of obstacles to the free movement of persons and services constitutes one of the objectives of the Union.  In 1991 the European Commission introduced a proposal for a Directive on the posting of workers. Earlier this month a common position was formally adopted at a meeting of the EU Social Affairs Council on a draft of this Directive.  Ireland supported the draft Directive in principle and we have been negotiating to ensure that the objective of the Directive will be achieved and that it will facilitate rather than hinder the free movement of services.</P>
      <P>The Directive, when finalised, will apply to undertakings that post workers to another member state to provide temporary services.  It will oblige employers in such circumstances to apply the labour legislation and the terms and conditions of employment of the host country, that is, the country to which they are posted, to such workers.</P>
      <P>Article 4 of the draft Directive requires that member states shall make provision for co-operation between the public authorities responsible for monitoring the operation of the Directive. Such co-operation shall, in particular, consist of exchanges of information on the cross-border supply of workers including information on abuses or possible cases of unlawful cross-border activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Directive marks an important advance in employee protection.  It will apply where workers are sent abroad by their employer or by an employment <Col N="1621" /> agency.  It will not apply to workers who emigrate to another EU country to seek work on their own account.  Such workers, including those in the construction industry, are advised to seek &mdash; from any FÁS office &mdash; pre-departure advice and information on employment opportunities and on the living and working conditions in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>The next stage in progressing the draft Directive is consultation with the European Parliament which is entitled to suggest amendments to the text agreed at the Social Affairs Council.  I can assure the Deputies that Ireland will actively support any measures designed to ensure that the Directive is finalised as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the original study design for the east Offaly project envisaged an initial five year period during which time badgers would be removed from the area and a further five year observation period in which no badger removal procedures would operate.  The purpose of the second component of the study was to assess the speed with which badgers would recolonise a vacant area of countryside and, second, to see if the disease patterns in the cattle population altered with such repopulation.  The speed of repopulation is an important factor to evaluate in terms of its implications for national policy.</P>
      <P>The results from the east Offaly project in terms of bovine TB levels after the first five years were such that it was considered that an extension of the removal period would yield more in terms of scientific knowledge than would be gained by moving on to phase two of the study.  The current position is that the removal phase has been extended and is currently expected to continue until the end of 1998.  Future policy will be determined on the results of the current study, a major report on which is expected later this year.</P>

I am satisfied that the person named would have been aware of the difficulties with his application following inspections on 26 May 1992 and again on 5 June 1992.

      <P>The position in 1992 was that an informal appeals procedure was in place whereby an applicant who was dissatisfied with a decision in relation to headage or premia grants could appeal that decision to the Department.  The case in question was reviewed on a number of occasions on foot of verbal contact from the person concerned, on foot of a parliamentary question on 2 March 1993 and again following representations to my Department in 1994 but the decision to withhold payment was upheld.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>My Department welcomes and facilitates, where possible, the development of these concepts by Irish farmers.  For example, these concepts have been applied to good effect for the development of farm forestry through the &ldquo;farm forestry partnership scheme&rdquo; operated by Coillte Teoranta.</P>
      <P>The concept of share farming has a general aim of enabling and facilitating new entrants to farming.  This aim is also promoted by a range of schemes operated by my Department, including the farm early retirement scheme as well as generous tax exemptions for long-term leasing by farmers.  However, the direct application of these concepts to Irish farming in the same way as they have been developed in other countries is not always possible.  For example, there may be some difficulties with applying share-milking, as operated in New Zealand, to Ireland.  Milk production in Ireland, at producer level, is subject to the provisions of the EU milk quota regulations and the detailed national implementing rules.  Any arrangement for the utilisation of an individual producer's milk quota must meet the requirements of all these regulations.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for operating share farming and partnerships rests with farmers and my Department will continue to promote schemes aimed at encouraging new entrants into farming.</P>

      <P>Farmers can lodge three ten months' premium and three 22 months' premium applications at times <Col N="1628" /> of their own choosing between 1 January and 29 November.  The delay in release of blood tests results from the Brucellosis Laboratory in Cork, which was due to industrial action at the time, does not therefore affect special beef premium entitlement.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to the promotion of wind energy in a manner fully in line with environmental policies and objectives.  In 1994, my Department, in consultation with the ESB, developed the alternative energy requirement AER 1, a competitive scheme to support alternative and renewable energy development.  As a result of the AER 1 initiative, ten wind projects with a total capacity of 73 megawatts are due to be developed.</P>
      <P>In late 1995, I initiated a detailed review of the renewable energy sector in Ireland.  My objective was to consider the success of AER 1 and to develop a long-term support strategy for the sector. I recently announced the details of my new strategy.  I have set a short-term target of 90MW of additional capacity to be secured from wind energy by the year 1999.  Capacity is to be procured through annual competitions.  A capital grant of £65,000 per megawatt installed will be made available to support wind development up to the end of 1999.  In addition, I have set a long-term target of achieving an additional 300 MW for the year 2010.  My policy document, Renewable Energy &mdash; A Strategy for the Future, is available from the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that for my strategy to succeed, possible barriers must be identified and overcome.  The issue of planning is an important one.  Local authorities must look favourably on the wind <Col N="1630" /> energy potential of their regions and ensure that their development plans include adequate positive provision, having regard to the planning guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment. This is of critical importance and will influence the future of wind farm development in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am constantly examining all possible avenues open to the Government to remove the serious threat posed by Sellafield and the UK's nuclear industry.  The Government takes every opportunity to act on and voice its strong objections and concerns about the continuing activities at Sellafield. These concerns are repeatedly conveyed directly to the UK Government and at every possible EU and international fora.</P>
      <P>The Government, in its policy agreement document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> has clearly set out its views on nuclear threats arising from Sellafield/THORP and other installations and has also made proposals for dealing with these concerns.  A blueprint for action was drawn up to implement these proposals on Sellafield and the Irish Sea and are being co-ordinated by a Ministerial task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> The Attorney General is keeping under review the possibility of legal action on Sellafield.  While the Government has always been, and continues to be, committed to legal action to secure the closure of Sellafield, it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sound scientific evidence. In previous examinations of the issue, the advice given to Governments was that there was no sound scientific evidence available to allow for a legal case to be taken against the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>The cessation of activities at Sellafield will remain a priority for the Government. I am committed to action and to implementing a strategy to minimise the threat posed by Sellafield, and indeed the nuclear industry worldwide.  While I am aware of a shared environmental concern about Sellafield among a large cross-section of the UK population, the economic implications and employment factors mean that the closure of Sellafield is unlikely in the short-term.  Apart from recourse to legal action which must rely on the advice of the Attorney General and the scientific evidence available, the focus of my attention will be on: (a)  pressing the UK authorities to adopt and enforce the highest safety standards in relation to plant installations, waste management and reprocessing; (b)  taking all steps to prevent any expansion of the nuclear industry in the UK by attempting to influence the UK authorities' decision-making as exemplified by my participation in the NIREX Public Planning Inquiry hearing in Cumbria; (c)  urging the early closure of ageing Magnox nuclear reactors, including those at Sellafield, and (d) maximum participation at international <Col N="1632" /> fora and the promotion of the conclusion of new conventions such as those dealing with Nuclear Safety Waste Management and Liability for Nuclear Damage in order to secure the highest standards of safety and radiation protection in the UK and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Vacancies exist in units of the FCA for the following reasons: lack of suitably qualified technical personnel &mdash; this is particularly true of medical units; the geographical integrity of the organisation, some units have a surfeit of officers qualified for promotion and no vacancy, while others may have a number of vacancies and have no officer who, at the time, meets the laid down criteria for promotion to fill the vacancy; and the prerogative of the unit commander to decide how best to utilise his personnel resources for the betterment of the unit as a whole.</P>
      <P>Vacancies are filled as soon as personnel who meet the necessary criteria for promotion are available.

    <P>The regulations also provide that where an Army vehicle which has been allotted to a unit or sub-unit is expected to be immobilised for a continuous period of not less than 21 days, authorisation may be granted for the use of not more than two privately owned motor cars in the performance of duties of the unit or sub-unit, in respect of the period during which the Army vehicle is immobilised, subject to an overriding combined maximum mileage for the privately owned car or cars and the Army vehicle of 1,500 miles in any one month.  The rate payable in these circumstances is 24.96 pence per mile in respect of each mile in excess of 500 miles for a vehicle with engine capacity of 1388 c.c. and over.  One officer in the Southern Command was paid an allowance in respect <Col N="1636" /> of mileage in excess of 6,000 miles in 1995.</P>

Prior to my ratifying the constitution of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association a number of amendments were made to the draft document to reflect the provisions of Defence Force Regulations S.7 and the actual administrative practices within the association itself.

      <Quest>the reason recommendation 3.3.2 of the second report of the Sea Trout Monitoring and Advisory Group has not been implemented; when officials from his Department will be instructed to take part in this vital monitoring; the status of the monitoring information gathered to date without the involvement of officials from the Marine Institute or his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Second Report of the Sea Trout Monitoring and Advisory Group, which was presented last March, recommends that Department of the Marine and-or Marine Institute officials participate as observers in the national sea trout sampling programme.  I can confirm that officials of the Marine Institute have been instructed to attend at a representative number of samplings and have been doing so since 23 May last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sea trout sampling programme, which has been in place since 1992, <Col N="1638" /> involves the sampling by staff of the regional fisheries boards of sea trout from key rivers in order to determine comparative levels of infestation of sea lice in sea trout populations.  Samples are analysed by Trinity College Dublin which prepares a report each year for the Sea Trout Scientific Working Group.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the Sea Trout Monitoring and Advisory Group was the result of agreement in the group that arrangements for monitoring and overseeing the sea trout sampling programme should follow as closely as possible those which apply to the fish farm inspection programme.  Staff of the regional fisheries boards attend as observers at fish farm inspections which are carried out by contract staff employed by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>All data derived from sea trout sampling programmes during the season will have to be assessed and validated by reference to all relevant scientific and other criteria.</P>

      <Quest>the number of applications for aquaculture and foreshore licences currently lodged with his Department awaiting approval; the number of pending applications that will be approved prior to the introduction of the new aquaculture licensing legislation; the status of any pending applications in the event of the new legislation being enacted; and whether current applicants will be required to reapply under the new legislation.</Quest>

      <P>There are some 800 applications on hands for licences to engage in aquaculture of which approximately half are estimated to be &ldquo;live&rdquo; applications of serious intent.  The Department is currently analysing and quantifying all applications with a view to definitively establishing the actual level of interest by region and area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> Existing applications are being progressed pending the enactment of new aquaculture licensing legislation.  The process entails comprehensive and technical assessment and full consultation with interested parties, including public notice procedures.  The decision making process must seek at all times to strike the right balance between development needs and local and environmental concerns. As a result, the timeframe for decisions varies in individual cases depending on the complexity of the issues involved.  The new legislation is being accorded every priority with a view to publication at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in that context that applications which remain to be determined at the time of enactment will, subject to certain transitional arrangements, be treated as applications for aquaculture licences under the appropriate provisions of the new legislative framework.</P>
