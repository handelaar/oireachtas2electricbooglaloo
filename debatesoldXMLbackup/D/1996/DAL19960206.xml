    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Since I last reported to the House, I have had further correspondence with the British Prime Minister on the way forward and I reiterated the Government's position as I set it out in the Dáil last week.  In addition, the Tánaiste met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Thursday last and a further meeting will be held tomorrow.  We continue to believe the Mitchell report provides the basis for moving forward to all-party negotiations.  Those who believe an elective process can play a useful role must demonstrate that an election would indeed be useful in facilitating immediate negotiations, rather than representing a further hurdle</P>
      <P>The two Governments agreed last Thursday to intensify the preparatory talks with a view to achieving our joint aim of all-party negotiations by the end of February.  It is particularly important that the British Government and the Unionist parties should use this intensified phase to clarify fully their position on the elective process and to address the genuine concerns which exist on the Nationalist side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil last week, the Government issued invitations to the various Northern Ireland party <Col N="4" /> leaders for a series of meetings with a view to intensifying dialogue.  Arising from these invitations, a meeting was held with the SDLP yesterday and meetings will take place with Sinn Féin later today and with the Alliance Party on Thursday.  In addition, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Social Welfare will meet the Progressive Unionist Party later this evening.</P>
    <P>Regarding contacts with the Ulster Unionist Party, it is clearly important that a meeting with that party should take place as soon as possible.  In that regard it is necessary to refer to the comments made by Mr. John Taylor.  He has been known to have made provocative comments in the past which have been unhelpful to efforts to improve relationships on this island.  His comments about the Tánaiste are not only unhelpful &mdash; they are untrue.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the unavailability of the UUP Leader, Mr. David Trimble, for a telephone call from, or a meeting with, the Tánaiste, these events stand in stark contrast to genuine efforts being made by the Tánaiste and the entire Irish Government to understand the Unionist position and discuss their proposals with them.</P>
    <P>At a time when this Government &mdash; and indeed the other parties in this House, through the work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; have gone to great lengths to both understand and accommodate Unionist viewpoints, some Unionist parties are showing an exaggerated tendency to invent and magnify problems and obstacles, rather than building a genuine cross-community partnership for peace.</P>
    <P>Dialogue is always the best course.  It is only through face-to-face talks among all the political parties and the Governments that we can develop the necessary trust and confidence to reach agreement about any proposals.  A refusal to meet face to face all those who have yet to be convinced in relation to the Unionist party's proposals, displays a lack of confidence in the proposals by their authors, and feeds the suspicion that the proposals could be no more than a delaying tactic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's remarks about unwarranted personal attacks on any Member of the House, whether it is the Tánaiste or a member of Fianna Fáil.  It is unreasonable that anybody defending the peace process or trying to build confidence in it should be attacked and called a mouthpiece for Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that what we are discussing at the moment is the next stage in the peace process, not the internal affairs of Northern Ireland? Will he agree that the attitude of the Unionists to the proposals for an elected body, that this is no concern of the Irish Government's, is a crude attempt to rule the Irish Government out of the three-stranded process?  Will he confirm the Government's total support for the three-stranded process and state also that he considers the proposal for an elected body to involve just Strand 1, and to be an internal matter in the North?  Will the Taoiseach make it clear where he stands regarding the three-stranded process after what we heard in the last ten days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the view of the Irish Government that successful negotiations must take the form of a three-stranded process.  There is no way any successful negotiation can be conducted that is not inherently and in every respect part of a three-stranded approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the British Government will not unilaterally hold elections in Northern Ireland without the agreement of the Irish Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clear that if the British Government did that, it would be involved in going back on statements it made in the past week in which it clearly indicated that it accepted the requirements laid down in the Mitchell report in regard to election proposals, namely that such proposals would have to have widespread support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In his discussions with the British Prime Minister prior to the Mitchell report, did the Taoiseach give the Prime Minister the impression that he was in favour of elections prior to all-party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given extensive indications of my conversations with the British Prime Minister. I made it clear then and on previous occasions that I have no problem discussing proposals for elections in the context of the political track of discussions. That political track remains to be concluded.  I said also that if we respect the concept of widespread agreement and support for any conclusions arising from that track, we should not make any unilateral or pre-emptive decisions of the kind that were apparently being advanced by the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the target date for all-party talks at the end of February is not now realisable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It remains the firm aim of the Irish and British Governments to commence all-party discussions at the end of February and the Government is working intensively towards the objective it agreed in a very formal way with the British Government in the communiqué published on 28 November 1995.  An agreement of that kind entered into by two Governments has a very serious status and is not something that can be unilaterally set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with what the Taoiseach said.  What can the Taoiseach do about it?  Is it not a fact the Taoiseach is working on preparatory talks to lead to all-party talks but the British Government is doing something else?  I know that and the Taoiseach knows it, but it is no good waiting until 29 February.  What will the Taoiseach do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working on the basis of the agreements entered into with the British Government which were published on 28 November 1995. We respect the agreements entered into, both in terms of the commitments given to the Government and the burdens that may be imposed on it.  The Government regards it as a balanced communiqué and intends to follow through on it.  As to what the Government is doing to fulfil that, I have already indicated that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland tomorrow.  There is a proposal that I meet the British Prime Minister later in the month.  In the meantime the Irish Government is intensively pursuing its part of the political track in so far as it will meet all the relevant parties prepared to meet it in that track to discuss the political agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the target date as stated in the communiqué, as a firm joint aim of both Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated in the communiqué and in subsequent discussion that the British Prime Minister would meet the Taoiseach in the middle of February.  Has a meeting been planned for next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A meeting between the British Prime Minister and me is not <Col N="8" /> planned for next week, but the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will have a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland tomorrow.  I do not know whether a further meeting between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State will occur next week.  As of now, there are no plans for the Prime Minister to meet me next week but the plan is to meet before the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the aim of having all-party talks.  Is he satisfied the British Government is doing enough to make that aim a reality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that the British Government should seek in an even handed way to work towards the achievement of that aim. It is very important that the British Goverment should make it clear to the Unionist community that their interests are served by entering into dialogue in the form of talks with all the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland.  The Unionist parties may well have a number of serious questions to ask of Sinn Féin, for instance, about the Mitchell report and each of the six principles and the seven or eight modalities for the implementation of the Mitchell report.  The best way for Unionists to ask those questions and be satisfied about the answers from Sinn Féin is in direct face to face discussion. There is no substitute for sitting across the table from somebody and asking hard questions, seeing how he answers and satisfying oneself as to whether the answer is sincere.  Without meeting people one cannot assess their sincerity.  That is why the Unionist community who are concerned, as we all are, to see arms put out of commission, have an obligation and a duty to put their concerns face to face to Sinn Féin. Equally, if the Unionist parties are convinced about their proposals, what have they to fear from putting them to the Irish Government and listening to the Irish Government's concern about them?  If the proposals are so good and <Col N="9" /> so robust, surely they can withstand that type of discussion.  What have they to fear from discussing those proposals with Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach think of Sir Patrick Mayhew's speech in the House of Commons recently in which he said the British Government cannot force anyone to the talks table?  Does he not agree that the British Government should encourage people to come and facilitate all-party agreements?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is not good enough for the British Government or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to act as Pontius Pilate in all of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a truism that neither the Irish nor the British Governments can force anyone to the conference table.  People must go to the conference table of their own volition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government not have a role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously what we are seeking is to create the necessary conditions to ensure they go to the conference table.  There is a very clear challenge at this stage to the Unionist community and their political leaders to engage in serious discussion with the neighbours with whom they have shared Northern Ireland for generations, to reach an agreement with them that would give security, confidence and respect to both traditions.  The responsibility that rests on the shoulders of the Unionist community to talk through their views with their neighbours is something they can not pass over to Government, whether here or in London. Every community in Northern Ireland has its responsibilities.  It is true the British Government cannot force them to the conference table but surely appreciation of their self interest should force them to the conclusion that it is better for them to talk to their neighbours on how they can build a secure future for both rather than engaging <Col N="10" /> their undoubted intellectual resources in inventing new reasons they cannot talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Taoiseach that the British Government cannot force them to the table but would he accept that because of the precarious voting in the House of Commons, the British Government is now refusing to put pressure on the Unionists to enter into dialogue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  That remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give any assurances that the British Government will commence all-party talks by 28 February or shortly thereafter?  Will he agree that no satisfactory answer is being provided by either the British Government or the Unionists on how an electoral process or body would operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assurance I have is in the form of an international document which was assented to by both the British Prime Minister and myself on 28 November, where he indicated that it was his firm aim &mdash; just as it is mine &mdash; that we should commence all-party negotiations by the end of February. That is the assurance I have and that is the assurance I stand on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not serve the interests of this country to cast doubt on the assurances given because those assurances are ones that we wish to see fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House wants to see them fulfilled but a year ago the framework document was to be advanced building on the three strand <Col N="11" /> process.  Then there was the communiqué in September about a meeting that never happened and the communiqué of 28 November, also about a meeting that will not take place.  The preparatory talks are not moving and we know that the all-party talks are going nowhere.  The British Government is working on a separate agenda from that of the Taoiseach, so we have doubts.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can allay some of the fears of this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, on the issue of an electoral process or body, that we have not had a satisfactory explanation from the British Government or the Unionist parties of what all that means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who reflects on the history of Europe in recent times will recognise that as soon as one begins to accept the politics of the <i>fait accompli</i> and passes away from working on the basis of agreements solemnly entered into, one is on a very slippery slope.  We should accept that any Government with whom we enter into an agreement will use its best endeavours to achieve the firm aim it has jointly agreed with us.  I am not prepared to depart from that because, to my mind, that is the foundation upon which we are working. It is very important to stress that the successes we have had in this area derive from both Governments having worked together rather than unilaterally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept, if elections are held as a route around Washington Three, that subsequent to those elections people cannot insist on Washington Three?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important point which needs to be dwelt upon and considered.  Anybody advocating an elective process must be able to give an unambiguous answer to that <Col N="12" /> question.  Such answers have not yet been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to that question seems to imply that the Taoiseach thought about an elective process or body more than he has admitted.  If that is the case would he also say that no other preconditions could be entered into if, in his mind, there will be elections? On this side of the House we take the view that there should not be elections until all-party talks deal with that matter.  Given the question that Deputy Harney posed, the Taoiseach seems to hold the view that we should look at the issue of preconditions.  Perhaps he will expand on that.  Is the Taoiseach really thinking about an electoral body or process, and what preconditions would have to be dealt with on the other side of that kind of election?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of any objective analysis of that matter has to be getting answers, if they are available, to very pertinent questions of the kind posed by Deputy Harney.  Naturally enough, as we have been discussing the possibility of the value of an elective process in the political track for at least a month now, a number of questions have arisen which need to be answered before we can come to any conclusions about whether such a process would perform any useful function.  This is one of the <Col N="13" /> unanswered questions and there are many others, some of which were referred to in detail by the Tánaiste in his weekend speech at Bandon where he went through five or six points or questions that need to be put in regard to that matter.  We are certainly availing of the political track to put those points and concerns about the matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach is reading my speeches and it would be helpful if he answered the questions posed in that speech.  What assurances does the Government have, and what will happen in an elected body or an electoral process?  What preconditions does the Taoiseach fear, and has he received assurances on any of those matters?  They are the questions I posed in that speech.  I asked him three times if he has received any assurances about what would happen in an elected body or an elective process, or what preconditions would be on the other side of that election.  I understand that these are matters the Tánaiste has been trying to raise.  Did the Taoiseach raise them in his telephone conversation last week when he first heard of the elected body or elective process scenario?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said here last week, and I am saying it again, in my conversation with John Major I made it very clear that any idea of an election would have to flow from all-party talks rather than the other way around.  I also made it clear to him that there would have to be widespread agreement before any such proposal would be workable.  That has been, is and remains, my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> A number of other concerns about an elective process are being put to its proponents who have not yet replied to them.  They are, for example, points made by the Tánaiste: that elections produce winners and losers whereas, in fact, what we need are agreed outcomes; that elections do not necessarily help towards consensus; and that elections can sometimes exclude people whom we need at the table, simply because they do not get enough votes.  In addition, election campaigns can sometimes entrench positions in the course of the race for votes whereas what one needs is a movement of positions towards the positions of others.</P>
    <P>There are other concerns about the way in which any elective body would operate, given that the only way negotiations can be successful is if they are inherently based on a three strand process. Those are among the questions which are being put in the political track by the Government to the British Government and to all those other parties who favour the idea of an elective process.</P>
    <P>The political track has not yet been concluded but we are putting forward the points and concerns I have just indicated, as is our responsibility.  We adhere to the view that an elective process should flow from all-party talks and should not be the means of commencing all-party talks.  We say that for a number of practical reasons.  In face to face dialogue, issues can be cleared up before-hand that might otherwise, possibly, cause unnecessary aggravation in the course of any elective process.  Talking beforehand to clear the ground is the most sensible way forward.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern at Sinn Féin's refusal to endorse the consent principles in the Forum report?  Does he accept that this is damaging the advancement of the peace process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who supports the consent principle very strongly <Col N="15" /> and recognises that it is the only practical and just way forward, I regret the fact that Sinn Féin has been unable, to date, to give their agreement to that principle as expressed in the Forum report.  At the same time it should be stressed that in other aspects of the Forum report there have been significant advances in the position adopted by Sinn Féin and while they have not come the final mile they have come a considerable distance.  We should look at the work of the Forum in that positive light.  A point I would address to the Unionist community is that they should take note of the fact that all parties in this House have underlined their commitment to the consent principle.  That surely should give the Unionists the confidence they need to enter into all party negotiations.  They know they will not be isolated in those discussions. Many on this part of the island fully understand that from a practical and moral point of view a majority in Northern Ireland must agree to any outcome of negotiations.  That reassurance is the best possible incentive for Unionists to enter into all party discussions.  That fact that was reaffirmed by all parties in this House should give Unionists the confidence to enter into all party discussions rather than feel it is necessary to put forward devices that sometimes seem to outsiders to be no more than excuses to avoid dialogue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 17, 22, 24, 26, 29, 38, 43, 46, 59 and 72 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said to this House on the day of its publication, the Government accepts the report of the international body without reservation.  It is lucid, authoritative and balanced.  Adherence on all sides to the six principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report, <Col N="18" /> together with the approach it recommends to the decommissioning question, offers a fair and reasonable basis on which all parties could move into substantive negotiations confident that all present were committed to exclusively peaceful means and to abiding by the democratic process.  This would undoubtedly reinforce our firm aim of achieving the launch of such negotiations by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I have made clear, in this House and elsewhere, our disappointment at the response of the British Government to the report.  I agree that the stress placed by the British Government on the report's very conditional and qualified reference to an elective process has distracted attention from the central thrust of its recommendations on finding a way out of the present impasse on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference held in London on Thursday 1 February, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I reviewed developments in the twin-track approach.  We considered the report of the international body and how it could assist us in bringing all parties to the negotiating table.  We had an open, honest and constructive discussion of the differences in our approaches to the report.</P>
    <P>I made clear that the credibility of our commitment to the goals set out in the communiqué required a significant intensification of the political track.  This intensification was accepted in principle by the British Government and we shall be reviewing at our resumed conference tomorrow the most appropriate way to achieve this, with the urgency we believe is required.</P>
    <P>In the preparatory talks we will continue to seek, as we have from the beginning of the twin-track process, widespread agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda to bring all parties together for substantive negotiations.  The report of the international body will be specifically addressed in the talks, with a view to reaching agreement on how its finding <Col N="19" /> might best be used in assisting the launch of all-party negotiations.  We will also continue to consider, as outlined in the communiqué of 28 November, whether and how an elected body or elective process could play a part in an interlocking three-stranded process of comprehensive negotiations involving both Governments and all the relevant Northern Ireland parties.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the Secretary of State and also with the Northern parties, the question of whether an elective process has a role to play in the launch of all-party negotiations has been considered, as provided for in the November communiqué.  I have made the position of the Government on the question clear.</P>
    <P>Our view is that the report of the international body by itself offers a sufficient basis for the entry to all-party negotiations.  There are serious doubts about the value of elections in the present context and justifiable fears that they are potentially polarising.  It is evident that at present the Northern parties are divided on the issue and it is the parties who would be called on to participate in such elections who must have the final say.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that only if an elective process were to meet the criteria set out in paragraph 56 of the Mitchell report &mdash; that it be broadly acceptable, with an appropriate mandate, and within the three-stranded structure &mdash; could it be considered to have a possible role to play.  It would be absolutely essential that the mandate of an elective process involve an immediate move into all-party negotiations without further preconditions. I am not aware of any proposal so far which would meet the criteria set out by the international body.</P>
    <P>These issues should be debated among the parties and with the Governments in preparatory talks.  There is an onus on those who advocate elections to prove to those who strongly hold the opposite view that their concerns can be met.  Obviously, a refusal on the part of some to enter into dialogue on this issue <Col N="20" /> does nothing to build confidence in the motivation behind the elective approach, or to secure the &ldquo;broad acceptance&rdquo; of the idea which will inevitably be needed if it is ever to be implemented.  As I have said, we are ready to discuss the issue, and have already done so with those parties which have taken part in the preparatory talks.</P>
    <P>These talks were launched on 1 December last, when the Secretary of State and I wrote in similar terms to the UUP, the DUP, the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the PUP, the UDP, The Workers' Party and to Robert McCartney, MP, inviting them to preparatory talks as described in the November communiqué.  The Government has subsequently had bilateral meetings with the SDLP, Sinn Féin and The Workers' Party, and together with the British Government, trilateral meetings with the Alliance Party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin.  Having met the SDLP again last night, this evening we are to meet Sinn Féin once more and, for the first time since the launch of the twin track process, the PUP.  A table setting out the dates of meetings is attached.</P>
    <P>No formal replies have been received from the DUP, the UDP or from Robert McCartney, MP. Further contact at official level has not yet led to any change in their apparent reluctance to meet the Government.</P>
    <P>The leader of the UUP replied to my initial letter, following which we had a further exchange of correspondence.  As the House is aware, this correspondence was, regrettably, published in the media without prior consultation with me. There are evident points of disagreement between us, which I believe can be cleared up only by face-to-face contact. I have made a particular effort over recent days to seek to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trimble before we both depart for Washington.  I took the initiative of telephoning him personally with a range of options and subsequently offered to travel to London for a meeting if that proved convenient for him.  Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to come <Col N="21" /> up with a proposal which suited Mr. Trimble.</P>
    <P>I very much hope that it will be possible to arrange a meeting in the near future so that we can discuss the process of seeking agreement on how to move to all-party negotiations.  Nobody has anything to fear from dialogue, and we all have much to gain in terms of enhanced mutual trust and confidence. There is a responsibility on all political leaders to do their utmost to underpin the present cessation of violence with an agreed settlement and to ensure that the mistakes and horrors of the past are never repeated.  I believe that responsibility should be taken seriously on all sides.</P>

      <P>As regards talks, does the Minister agree that we need straighforward dealing by all sides?  It is not unreasonable to suggest that while the Government sees the Mitchell <Col N="22" /> report as fair and reasonable and a sufficient basis on which to commence all party talks before the end of February and the Tánaiste is having discussions with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the British Prime Minister is having discussions with Mr. Trimble on the mechanics and procedures of an elected body.  While the Tánaiste and others are talking to Sir Patrick Mayhew on the details of how talks could proceed, the British Government has eliminated that from its thoughts and is working flat out on an elective process only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, as I made clear in my response to the various questions today and in a number of statements issued in recent weeks, that we must have face to face contact and, as the Mitchell report made clear, change the mind sets of the people on this island and those involved in Anglo-Irish politics.  That can only be done by having meetings.  No one has anything to fear from dialogue or discussions.  We may not like one another but ultimately we all have to live and work together. That can be established very quickly and it is in everybody's interest.  There is a tremendous opportunity because of events of the last 16 months.  The sooner we build on our achievements and seek to politically underpin the peace process, which is very necessary, the better.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference was held in London last Thursday, we had a meeting last evening with the SDLP and there are meetings this afternoon with Sinn Féin and this evening with the Unionist Party.  These meetings are important.  Obviously we would like to have meetings with other representatives of Unionist parties, but that has not proved possible.  Ultimately we must sit down and talk to one another.  We must work together to find accommodation between the Unionist and Nationalist populations and that will not be done by hurling insults from a distance but by face to face meetings.</P>

      <P>I take it that even though the Minister did not reply <Col N="23" /> specifically to Question No. 17 in my name his views coincide with mine in that regard.  He seems to take a positive view of the matters proposed in that question.  Will he give the House an assessment of whether he thinks there is any prospect of all-party talks being held according to the original timetable, by end February?  If not, when does he perceive they will be held?  Is there any prospect of them being held before an election, which would be very unhelpful in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this matter.  It is very unlikely an elective process can be undertaken unless the criteria set out in the Mitchell report are met &mdash; it must be broadly acceptable, must have widespread support and must be included in the three strand process.  As the Taoiseach said in reply to questions within the last few minutes, we do not see any proposals that meet those criteria.  Reaching the target date of end February is still a priority.  We set out to intensify the preparatory talks phase but it is very difficult to see how we can reach the target unless we find some way of starting negotiations or preparatory talks with the Ulster Unionist Party.  I conveyed my views to the British Government via the Secretary of State at the Anglo-Irish Conference last week and I hope the opportunity has been taken to convey those views to the Unionist Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister receive any indication from the British side that it is acting as a persuader to get the Unionist Party to the table for all-party talks?  Is there any indication from the Unionist Party that it wishes to join in talks?  The Minister shared a platform with me in Bandon last Saturday at which the senior Unionist Party member, Mr. Maginnis MP, was asked whether, in the event of an election process being undertaken, his party would indicate in its programme for an election whether it would be prepared to talk to Sinn Féin and he made it quite <Col N="24" /> clear in his response that under no circumstances would the party enter into talks after an election.  What therefore is the point in going down that road? Surely it is incumbent on the British and Irish Governments to take on the active role of persuaders to bring the Unionist Party to the table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the seminar in Bandon last Saturday afternoon I made very clear, as the Taoiseach did this afternoon, the considered views of the Government on the divisive nature of elections, and that remains our position. The communiqué of 28 December stated that we would discuss with those proposing an elective process any proposals they put forward.  It is very important that when the question was put to Mr. Maginnis MP last Saturday afternoon he replied in the negative.  I would have thought the <i>quid pro quo</i> for holding out the prospect of elections was that they would lead to all-party talks.  If that is not the case, whatever reservations existed initially would be added to.</P>
      <P>Let those who are proposing elections or supporting the concept of an elective process come and discuss the matter with us.  People are entitled to make proposals and if there is a possibility that the elective process, whatever form it may take &mdash; obviously on the absolute understanding that it is not to a Stormant-type assembly, an assembly with legislative authority or powers &mdash; will be undertaken, let those involved come and discuss it with us and with the Nationalist parties in the North, who because of the way this proposal has been brought forward, would have much to do to convince their supporters. One of my concerns from the reaction of the British Government to the Mitchell Commission report is that there is little point in running with a proposal that comes from one side of the divide. As we have seen in the past, that would not hold out the prospect of getting cross-party support, and therin lies the danger.</P>

      <P>We replied to the issue in this House almost simultaneously as the Prime Minister replied in the House of Commons.  We decided that we would make a short statement in acceptance of the report, which we had for some time, with a view to taking it as the basis for discussions with the parties, but that was made much more difficult by the response of the British Prime Minister. Our attitude to elections has been well known for many months but, as has been said in the House this afternoon, at the end of the day regardless of the success we have had in tackling the problems of Northern Ireland it is absolutely imperative that both Governments work together and set out to have good relationships in our dealings.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why he did not attend the Davos World Economic Forum last weekend where he might have met Mr. Trimble? Will he agree that the premature publication in a Sunday newspaper of his meeting this week may have been unhelpful in achieving the objective he wanted to achieve?  Will he agree that premature leaks and publicity in the Anglo-Irish area have often been very damaging, as it was in the case of the Mitchell report?  What is he doing to tackle the carefree publicity habits that apparently exist in regard to leaks?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Davos Conference was primarily about economic matters.  It was not possible for me to attend, but I was pleased the Minister, Deputy Quinn, represented the Irish Government. There was an assumption that Mr. Trimble would attend the Bandon Encounter on Saturday afternoon &mdash; great credit is due to the people who organised that conference &mdash; but unfortunately it was confirmed on Thursday evening that he would be unable to attend due to a scheduling problem relating to the Davos Conference.  As regards press reports, I am in the same position as other Members of this House in that the press gets access to reports and uses them to suit itself.  There are times when I would like editors to take more interest in newspaper stories.  They are sometimes unhelpful in trying to find the solution to these problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government shares the wide-held sense of outrage and disgust at the ongoing and appalling revelations of <Col N="27" /> evidence of mass executions in Bosnia and Hercegovina, particularly the information which is continuing to come to light of suspected mass grave sites and eye-witness accounts of atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs during the conflict in the region. It is a distressing fact that we face the prospect of further such revelations, as investigations develop, and as more and more areas of the territory of Bosnia and Hercegovina become accessible to international organisations following the Peace Agreement and cessation of hostilities. I understand investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will soon begin a thorough investigation of the suspected mass grave sites and that the international Implementation Force will provide appropriate assistance.</P>
    <P>The international community must intensify its efforts to bring to justice those guilty of war crimes.  The Government considers that these efforts must be vigorously pursued by the International Criminal Tribunal.  The Government, for its part, will assist the work of the tribunal in every way possible. Ireland has firmly supported the tribunal since it was established in 1993, and was one of a small number of countries which provided voluntary contributions towards the tribunal's funding during its setting-up stage.  The financing of the tribunal has now been regularised. Ireland has paid in full its assessed contribution to date and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also assisted the work of the tribunal in other ways.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force who have served in former Yugoslavia have, at the request of tribunal investigators, briefed them on their knowledge of events there.  The Defence Forces have also provided technical advice and have staged weapons demonstrations for the tribunal's investigation teams.  The Government will give positive consideration to further such requests for assistance from the tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> European Union bodies, including most notably the European Community Monitor Mission which has been deployed throughout the region since 1991 and to which Ireland is providing personnel, is also giving invaluable assistance to the tribunal's investigators and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The European Union has consistently made clear to the former belligerent parties its deep concerns about the atrocities which were carried out during the conflict.  The Presidency, the Troika and the Fifteen have, on numerous occasions, demanded that the parties, particularly the Bosnian Serbs and the authorities in Belgrade, honour their commitments under international law, and specifically their obligations under the Dayton Agreement, co-operate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal; to comply with orders to produce information on atrocities; to hand over those indicted or wanted for questioning by the tribunal; and to disclose to the International Committee of the Red Cross all evidence on the thousands of persons who remain unaccounted for.  I will continue to support and contribute to these efforts as a member of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers and as a current member of the Troika.</P>
    <P>The Dayton Agreement commits all of the parties to full co-operation with the effort to investigate war crimes and to bring those responsible to justice. During the visit to Dublin of Croatia's Deputy Prime Minister Granic on 30 January, I made clear to him this Government's concerns and strongly urged the Croatian Government's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I will avail of every possible opportunity to raise on a bilateral basis the question of indicted war crimes suspects with the Governments in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's response and I encourage him to use our Presidency this year in this regard.  Immediate action should be taken in relation to Radovan Karadzic and Mladic who went to ground when <Col N="29" /> NATO forces were in the Pale region, although they have been indicted. Crimes were committed not only by one side in that war, but by three sides, particularly by the Serbs.  These war crimes should be investigated and those found guilty should be brought to justice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I expect to bring the White Paper on Foreign Policy to Government within the next fortnight and it is my firm aim that it should be published within a month from now.</P>
      <P>Work on the text of the White Paper has been continuing for the last ten months, following the completion of the process of public consultation arranged to allow the views of the wider public to be taken into account.  Given that foreign policy covers such a wide range of interdependent issues, preparation of the White Paper has involved intensive consultations both within the Department of Foreign Affairs and between that Department and other Departments. More recently, I have sought the informal opinion of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare on the content of the White Paper.  A final draft text of the White Paper is now almost ready for submission to Government.</P>
      <P>The White Paper has gone through many drafts in this process.  Every part of the text dealing with all areas of foreign policy has been continually amended and updated, particularly over the last three months as work has intensified. It would not be possible to list all the changes which have been made to the text during that period, even if it were appropriate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the preparation of the White Paper has taken longer than I had originally anticipated, there has not been an undue delay, given the effort of the Government to take full account of public opinion, and the fact that this is such a complex area of activity.  My priority, rather than meeting any artificial deadline, has been to ensure the publication of a White Paper which will give the people a genuine insight into our foreign policy and will encourage public <Col N="31" /> debate on our role, responsibilities and interests in the world.  I am confident that when the White Paper is published it will succeed in doing just that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the White Paper has been unduly delayed. The Minister's inquires and hearings concluded early last summer.  The White Paper was supposed to be published during the summer, in early autumn, before Christmas and then in January. We must now wait until the end of February to consider it.</P>
      <P>Will military neutrality, our relationship with the Western European Union, NATO membership and the Partnership for Peace be clearly outlined in the White Paper in advance of the Intergovernmental Conference which will start at the end of next month?</P>

Will the Tánaiste assure us that our observer status will be maintained within the Western European Union and that it will not be extended as there is no question of Ireland joining NATO's Partnership for Peace?  Obviously there is no question of our joining NATO.  I give him and the Minister for Social Welfare credit for that.  I do not know how the Tánaiste will resolve that with Fine Gael, but that is his problem.  In advance of the publication of the White Paper, will the Tánaiste assure the Irish <Col N="32" /> people that the positive features of neutrality which they hold dear will be maintained after its publication?</P>

      <P>I am sure that Members on all sides agree that the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body makes a valuable contribution to increased understanding and co-operation in these islands and that its proceedings would benefit from participation by the Unionist parties.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the Unionists have not yet taken up the seats available to them. Successive Irish Governments have strongly supported the work of the inter-parliamentary body since its establishment in February 1990 and they have also made clear that Unionist participation would be warmly welcomed. Most recently, at his meeting with Mr. Trimble and an Ulster Unionist Party delegation on 2 October 1995 the Taoiseach raised the question of Unionist participation.  I understand that on the British side of the inter-parliamentary body there is a similar desire to see the Unionists participate and that this has been conveyed in appropriate ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not discussed the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body with Mr. <Col N="33" /> Trimble but should a suitable opportunity arise in my future contacts with him I would be happy to do so and to encourage his party to participate in the body.

      <P>Having participated in the interparliamentary body as a member of its steering committee when established, I am a firm advocate and supporter of it.  It would be in the interests of the body politic, Anglo-Irish relations, developing relations between the North and the South and in the interests of Unionist parties if they were to participate with us in it.  I cannot see any reason for their objecting to it or any reason to sustain their objection.  I would encourage them in the strongest possible terms to participate in it.  I would be happy to discuss it with them and, if possible, show them the benefits and merits their membership would provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a Northern Ireland committee is one for the British Government.  The Deputy will be aware of a select committee set up a few years ago which has got on with its work and has not unduly disturbed or bothered anybody.  Irrespective of that, the case for Unionists participating in <Col N="34" /> the interparliamentary body is over-whelming and we will take every opportunity possible to encourage them to do so.</P>

      <QRef>[2371/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My official visit to Cyprus on 9-11 January was part of my preparations for the Irish Presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year, though the visit was bilateral and not part of an EU Troika mission. The development of the Union's relations with Cyprus in the perspective of the opening of EU accession negotiations six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference will be an important issue during our <Col N="35" /> term of office.  As Presidency, we will lead the Union's structured dialogue with Cyprus which has been established to prepare the ground for the accession negotiations.</P>
      <P>My visit enabled me to familiarise myself at first hand with the situation on the island and the views and concerns of the Cypriot people.  I had discussions with President Clerides, Foreign Minister Michaelides, the UN Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative in Cyprus, Mr. Gustave Feissel, and the leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community, including Mr. Denktash.  I was also pleased to be able to visit the Irish Army contingent serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus and the Garda personnel attached to the UN Civil Police operation at Pyla.  Except for a brief period in the 1970s, Irish personnel have served continuously with the UN in Cyprus since 1964.  Their contribution to the security and welfare of the people of Cyprus is warmly appreciated on the island.  It was clear from the many tributes paid to their professionalism and impartiality during my visit that they enjoy the full respect and confidence of both communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospect of EU membership has introduced a new dimension to the Cyprus question.  In all my discussions, I stressed the importance of using the window of opportunity which the accession process offers to facilitiate the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to make progress towards a political settlement on the island.  I highlighted the potential of the EU, a community of democratic states based on the principle of unity in diversity, as a framework for accommodating different identities. Membership of the Union could help to resuscitate the relationship between the two communities in a broader framework and to reinforce the existing guarantees of their position.  I indicated my willingness to assist the search for progress in support of the UN process and the EU pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and to share any aspects of our national experience which might be <Col N="36" /> seen by the parties as relevant or helpful. While not drawing parallels between different situations, I explained the importance we attach from our own experience in relation to Northern Ireland to parity of esteem for each community and the need to reflect this principle in appropriate political structures.</P>
    <P>Like our EU partners, we are concerned to ensure that the prospect of accession should be seen to benefit both communities on the island and that the accession process is pursued in a way that facilitates the search for a political solution.  The priority which the Union is giving to the issue is reflected in the appointment at last week's General Affairs Council of a Presidency representative for Cyprus, Ambassador Di Roberto, who will visit the region.  The Council will consider how the Union's approach on Cyprus might be further developed when the representative's report and recommendations are available. Our approach as Presidency will be developed in the light of the outcome of that discussion in the Council.</P>

      <P>As the framework for negotiation on the accession of Cyprus to the EU has been agreed, will the Tánaiste comment on the view of some EU member states, apparently led by Britain, that Cyprus should be excluded from the EU as long as its problems remain unresolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different views within the European Union.  The Irish Government has adopted the view that we have had long and friendly relations with Cyprus and its people, we warmly welcome the Cypriot application for membership and we supported a Council decision to fix a date for the opening of negotiations.  As well as the importance of Cyprus joining the Union, we hope that the historic opportunity &mdash; I believe that is what it will be &mdash; offered by the prospect of accession can be used constructively to facilitate progress towards a political settlement on the island of Cyprus.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste comment on the views of some EU member states, in particular those led by the UK, that Cyprus should be excluded from the Union?  Despite the fact that dates have been set and a framework for the mandate on accession talks has been agreed, will he comment on the point of those discussions if a blocking group led by Britain opposes the accession of Cyprus to the Union while its problems remain unresolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The date for accession negotiations has been set as a result of an agreement reached by European Union member states.  Accession negotiations will commence six months within the completion of the Intergovernmental Conference.  That is what is important.  Member states of the Europen Union, the United Nations and the United States, working together, should use the period up to the commencement of those accessional negotiations to ascertain whether those communities can resolve their differences. My discussions in Cyprus with the various leaders left me with the impression that there is a very strong feeling that, if they do not seriously endeavour to resolve their problems within the window of opportunity accession offers, it will be very difficult to do so thereafter.  The decision of the European Union Council of Ministers that those accessional negotiations would commence after the Intergovernmental Conference provide a catalyst for such resolution.  It behoves both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, with the co-operation of Greece and Turkey, to work together since this presents them with the best opportunity they will have for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the Cyprus issue, is the Tánaiste concerned that the dispute between Greece and Turkey last week will affect the Cyprus resolution?  Would he agree it is crucial that the efforts of the United Nations, United States and the European Union <Col N="38" /> be co-ordinated within this window of opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make two points. First, co-ordination is exactly what is needed between the European Union, the United Nations &mdash; which has had a long involvement in Cyprus &mdash; and the United States because of the linkage between the Cypriot problem, Turkey-Greece relations and overall security in that region which involves the United States as well as the European Union and the United Nations.  In my last contribution to the General Affairs Council at which this matter was discussed I said we must have co-ordination rather than competition because it would be disastrous were there to be any competition between the United States and the European Union on this issue.  I welcome reports that recent tensions between the two countries over their territorial limits in the Aegean Sea appear to have been defused.  I hope that good relations can be fostered between Greece and Turkey, a reconciliation long overdue.  From discussions with my Greek colleagues in recent weeks I detect a certain willingness to come forward, but in this respect the formation of a new Government in Ankara will be important.</P>

      <P>I presume the Tánaiste is referring to the whole island of Cyprus gaining accession to the European Union.  Will he inform the House whether the Turks have been reasonable with regard to that part of the island of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish Army?  Its application for membership of the European Union has been on the back burner for a number of years.  Will he say whether that application for membership will remain on the back burner as long as Turkey impedes any settlement in Cyprus?</P>

      <P>In 1989 the European Commission made available its opinion on the Turkish application for membership, which was to the effect that it would not be useful to open accessional <Col N="39" /> negotiations straight away.  The Commission also took the view that a range of steps should be taken to intensify European Union-Turkish relations.  The Deputy will be aware that the customs union which came into effect at the end of last year constituted a major step forward in European Union-Turkish relations.  When a new Government is formed in Ankara I hope intensive discussions will take place between the European Union and that new administration with a view to ensuring full development of the customs union which can lead to other things.  If I may borrow an expression from Anglo-Irish relations, the &ldquo;totality of relations&rdquo; between the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots, Greece and Turkey must be taken into account, all working together for the same objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of the United Nations in peacekeeping in Bosnia and Herzegovina is now limited to its civilian police operation, the International Police Task Force, with a strength of 1,721 police observers.  The Government was approached by the UN in December to make a contribution to this task force.  On 9 January, the Government decided to make available an Assistant Garda Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald, as Commissioner of the task force.  He has since travelled to Sarajevo and assumed his duties there. The question of providing a contingent of Garda to the force is being considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to military peacekeeping operations, the Deputy will be aware that UNPROFOR &mdash; the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia &mdash; to which Ireland made available a number of military observers, is no longer in existence.  The UN Security Council has authorised a coalition of member states to form the International Implementation Force &mdash; IFOR &mdash; which is now tasked with implementation of military aspects of the peace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Ireland has not been requested to participate in this force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is, however, determined to make a significant practical contribution to implementation of the peace agreement on the ground in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  In addition to <Col N="41" /> commitments with the International Police Task Force, the Government is currently providing 18 personnel, including 17 members of the Permanent Defence Force to the European Community Monitor Mission in former Yugoslavia.  The number of personnel deployed with this mission will be increased to more than 80 during Ireland's Presidency of the EU later this year.</P>
    <P>The Government is also making available members of the Permanent Defence Force to the mission of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; OSCE &mdash; in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This mission is tasked with organising elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina and will be assisted in this regard by the European Community Monitor Mission which I have just mentioned. Irish Defence Forces personnel are also currently active with the European Community humanitarian assistance task force and the border-monitoring mission of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia which plays an important role in implementing sanctions against the Serb-held territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>

The Tánaiste referred to increased involvement by Ireland.  Is he worried at the lack of commitment on the part of member states to provide the requisite number of trained policemen?</P>

      <P>Within the constraints of personnel available, we will make every effort to send police officers to Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The Government has considered this matter.  It was honoured to be requested to send Assistant Garda Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald, to head the police force there and has agreed to send additional policemen.  There is <Col N="42" /> always concern with regard to the availability of police and troops for these missions but, having regard to the mission and the tasks imposed on it, it is important that the 1,721 police observers be <i>in situ</i> as quickly as possible.</P>

These men appear to be still in danger and their position seems to have been neglected. Could the Tánaiste arrange that police and other peacekeeping troops, as a matter of priority, seek the release of these people, most of whom are refugees from Srebrenica and Zepa?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation the Deputy described.  The European Union has made it very clear that we want refugees returned and allowed to go back to their place of residence. That has been the consistent policy of the European Union.  I am not sure if there is a role for our police officers but it is certainly a matter which I can take up with the Departments of Justice and Defence.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy O'Malley, there were reports of massacres at the time of the Seb take-over of Srebrenica after the Dutch peace-keepers left.  Those reports have been confirmed in the last few days and we have seen horrendous photographs and pictures on television.  Is it intended <Col N="43" /> that the EU or the UN will reopen the investigation into the departure of the troops from Srebrenica and the abandonment of the men of Srebrenica to the worst the Serbs could do to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard of any intention to reopen the matter of the departure of the Dutch troops from Srebrenica. However, as the Deputy is aware, there is a UN Commissioner on the ground who at this stage has started her investigation.  She will provide the UN with a full report and one will then be in a better position to judge what needs to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most important that the UN Special Commissioner has the opportunity to carry out an investigation and she will seek the co-operation of people on the ground.

      <QRef>[1977/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Col N="44" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming UNICEF's 50th anniverary report, The State of the World's Children 1996, I acknowledge the outstanding work carried out by UNICEF since its establishment in 1946. Ireland's appreciation of UNICEF's achievements has been reflected in the level of our voluntary contribution to the organisation over many years.  It is the Government's intention to increase this contribution to £1.05 million in 1996 as compared to £950,000 in 1995.</P>
      <P>UNICEF's report documents in harrowing detail the disproportionate impact of warfare, poverty and disease on children and the extent to which their rights are all too often ignored in zones of conflict, including by the widespread use of child soldiers.  The Government fully shares and endorses UNICEF's objectives and programmes to foster and enhance the rights and dignity of all children and to ensure that these rights are fully respected.</P>
      <P>Irish aid programmes attach particular importance to the rights of children, especially in the areas of health and education.  Irish aid is also engaged in rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes in countries which have recently emerged from prolonged civil conflicts.  Two such countries, Ethiopa and Uganda, have now been designated as new priority countries for Irish aid programmes.  In Uganda, Irish aid is co-financing a project which seeks to assist children traumatised by warfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland fully supports proposals for an international ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel landmines.  Ireland is also contributing to UN mine-clearing operations in former zones of conflict.  At the bilateral level, Irish aid has supported a project in Mozambique under which demobilised soldiers were trained to clear the land surrounding schools of landmines.  Wars and situations of violent conflict over recent years have significantly added to the huge numbers of displaced people and refugees around the world, at least half of whom are children. Ireland seeks to play its part in addressing the needs of refugees and <Col N="45" /> displaced people through our annual voluntary contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to which £1.1 million is being given in 1996.</P>
    <P>UNICEF's report notes that one of the most disturbing traumas for a child is separation from parents.  For that reason, Irish aid funding is provided, both through NGOs and through the UN, for family reunification activities in Rwanda.  The Government also recognises the need for the prevention and prosecution of infringements of human rights.  Irish aid funding has been provided for UN human rights monitors and the international tribunal to investigate the genocide in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Children represent the future and it is essential that they be enabled to fulfil their potential and contribute to the peaceful progress of their societies. Ireland will continue to do its utmost in seeking to ensure that children can grow to maturity free from violence and exploitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his response.  Can he be specific as to the objectives of this excellent UNICEF report, The State of the World's Children 1996, on which I congratulate the United Nation's Secretary General and all concerned?  The UN receives much criticism but this is an excellent report which it would be right and proper for the governments of the world to follow.</P>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that it is essential to build on an ethic against violence directed at children, drafting children as combatants, planting anti-personnel landmines and holding children as hostages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the specific recommendations and, as I said in my response, we agree with those recommendations.

      <P>Would the Tánaiste arrange for the introduction of legislation here or at EU level outlawing the purchase of goods manufactured through child labour?  The carpet industry has received much publicity recently but it is not alone.  There have been allegations about clothing from Morocco and elsewhere being sold in some of the major stores.  I do not know the truth, accuracy or otherwise of these allegations but they exist and require answers. A monitoring body should be established to examine these issues within the Department of Enterprise and Employment or within the Tánaiste's own Department.  There should be a single agency to monitor operations and products in the marketplace which may be manufactured through child labour.  We want to stamp it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that we want to stamp out child labour in any part of the world where it exists and it would be irresponsible of the Government to say otherwise.  It is important that in our own economic and trade policies we take steps to ensure we are not allowing situations to develop whereby we encourage or facilitate child labour in any part of the world.  The Department of Trade and Tourism, which has primary responsibility for trade, is examining this area and assessing what measures, legislative and otherwise, are necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with both these questions in the House.  On 7 December I dealt with the landmines question.  In regard to the latter, previous Irish Governments have taken a <Col N="47" /> lead in relation to convincing our European Union colleagues and others that we want a total ban on landmines wherever they are produced.  When there was a question of whether we should introduce legislation, I noted that Ireland had no armaments industry and that the example of Belgium, which was formerly a substantial producer of landmines, was not applicable to the position here.  Ireland's position on the landmines question was fully appreciated in the international community.  I repeat, it is the Government's priority to continue to work in a realistic and focused way in the multilateral fora open to us for effective international action against landmines and as a priority for the objective of a total ban on antipersonnel landmines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of options were considered, for example, a troika visit, a démarche against the Chinese Government and co-operation with the various agencies.  After a good deal of discussion and consideration it was felt there would be a troika visit to China at official level and, more importantly, to see where we could co-operate to improve conditions to give health and welfare support to the orphanages.  Discussion will take place with the Chinese authorities, whose co-operation we need if we are to overcome the appalling situation as shown on our television screens.  I would be hopeful from the initiative taken by our Swedish colleagues at the General Affairs Council of our being in a position to offer assistance and to co-operate with the authorities in health care, education and other fields.</P>

Will the Tánaiste join with <Col N="48" /> me in congratulating the concerned citizens who joined together to promote assistance to the Chinese authorities in relation to the problem of the orphanages and the numbers of children they have to cope with?  Secondly, will he take action at national level in negotiations with the Chinese Embassy to seek their support for voluntary bodies here and will he introduce amending legislation to remove whatever barriers exist to the adoption of some of these children by Irish parents who would wish to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Grave concern has been expressed and effective action is being proposed by various citizens here.  That is very much to be welcomed and encouraged.

I had discussions as late as this morning with the organiser of one of our NGOs in regard to the appalling situation in Calcutta where we have funded a programme in recent years and will continue to do so.

The seriousness of this issue was emphasised by the delegation of Kuwaiti parliamentarians which visited Ireland in October last to ask for our assistance, and that of our EU partners, in pursuing this matter.</P>

      <P>It is worrying that there are talks about sanctions against Iraq being lifted and that it may be allowed to sell oil on the open market in the near future, while many matters such as the whereabouts of the 625 Kuwaiti hostages remain unresolved?  Will the Tánaiste oppose the lifting of these sanctions until such time as there is a satisfactory conclusion and explanation as to the whereabouts of these 625 individuals? The Kuwaiti authorities believe that most, if not all of them, are still <Col N="50" /> alive and in prisons or places of detention within Iraq.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 47 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>In the statement of the Government's position on the situation in Nigeria which I made to the House on 7 December, I expressed our grave concern at recent human rights abuses in that country.  I also enumerated the EU sanctions against Nigeria which have been adopted with Ireland's strong support under the respective EU Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995.  To date, there has not been an infringement of the sanctions involving Ireland.  As I unequivocally stated to the House on the previous occasion, we will continue to fulfil our commitments under the two common positions and monitor the situation in Nigeria.  We will support those measures which will put political and economic pressure on the Nigerian regime to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context the Government continues to support the introduction of an oil embargo to help bring about meaningful reform in Nigeria.  However, to be effective such an embargo would need international support.  As oil imports to Ireland are predominantly from the North Sea a bilateral oil embargo, <Col N="52" /> would have no real impact on Nigerian oil revenues.  The Government, therefore, supports EU consultation with like-minded states on the adoption of this and other measures.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the reported link between Shell Nigeria and the supply of arms to the Nigerian security forces which was recently discussed at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It seems highly inappropriate for an oil company to be involved in the supply of arms.  It is the Government's view that multi-nationals should carefully consider the human rights' implications of their commercial decisions.</P>
    <P>The EU Common Position of 4 December provides for review in the light of developments, including any further human rights abuses and actions against the Ogoni people.  It is clear that further sanctions, including an oil embargo, may need to be considered. The Government will continue, with its EU partners, to keep the situation under close review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Minister is in favour of an oil embargo, but has the European Union addressed the matter bearing in mind that oil revenues are sustaining this regime in power?  What is the position on the remaining Ogoni detainees whom, we understand, are facing a special military tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the House on 7 December, I argued in favour of an oil embargo at the General Affairs Council where I was supported by a number of my colleagues knowing, from Ireland's point of view, that I had more freedom to do so because we do not import any oil from Nigeria.  Virtually all our oil is supplied from the North Sea.  The majority, however, were not in favour at that time of either an assets freeze or oil embargo and other decisions were taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the remaining Ogoni detainees, I understand the question of further hearings by tribunal is being reviewed by the Nigerian High Court.  The implications of that are not clear.  With our European <Col N="53" /> Union partners, we will monitor developments and press for the presence of EU or other human rights monitors at any further hearings.  We will also give strong support to any measures deemed necessary, including further sanctions for which we have already argued, to ensure full respect for human rights and international and legal norms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the undesirability of Shell's involvement. What is the position on the payment of adequate compensation for the environmental damage done in the area reported at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs?  If there is a spillage, how soon does the company become involved in the cleaning up process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the European Union, we would remind Shell of its international obligation to restore the environment to its former condition as quickly as possible and minimise the effects of any damage done.  That is our position which is well known to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it still the case that the Irish Ambassador and the Ambassadors of other member states have been withdrawn from Lagos and it is not intended to send them back until these matters have been resolved?  Will the Minister express a view on the allegation that Shell has imported arms into Nigeria?  The purpose is not clear, but it could hardly be described as worthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with the decision of most European Union capitals, our Ambassador designate returned to Nigeria on 12 January for consultations in response to the executions which have taken place.  It is important from Ireland's point of view, as a member of the Troika, that we have somebody on the ground to take <i>demarches,</i> as necessary, and safeguard the interests of the Irish missionaries and others working in Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most Members of the House, I am aware of the allegation that Shell <Col N="54" /> Nigeria has been involved in the supply of the arms to the Nigerian security forces and intend to consult my European Union partners on the issue.  We will consider further, in the light of any information available, whatever steps are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs failed to secure an answer from the representative of Shell Nigeria on the royalties or moneys paid to prop up the murderous regime in Lagos.  Will the Minister raise this matter at European Union level to bring further pressure to bear on the Nigerian Government?  Highlighting the payment of this money will bring about the necessary changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government supports the view that multinational companies, such as Shell, should carefully consider the human rights implications of their commercial decisions.  This matter will be discussed at the next meeting of the General Affairs Council where I will raise my voice along the lines the Deputy suggested.  It may be possible for the European Union to take action in relation to Shell's activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoghis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoghis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoghis-Offaly):</i> Will the Minister arrange for his officials to supply him with a full account of the meeting to which Deputy Burke referred?  He would find this most instructive in his dealings on these matters. The joint committee heard not alone from a representative of Shell, but also from a human rights lawyer who was active in the defence of Ken Saro-Wiwa. Will the Minister have representations made in the strongest possible terms to the Nigerian Government to protest at the harassment last weekend of the principal defence lawyer of Ken Saro-Wiwa?  Will he redouble his efforts at European Union level to secure support for an oil embargo on Nigeria and to have pressure brought to bear on companies such as Shell the representative of which, in the opinion of most members of the joint committee, was <Col N="55" /> most unconvincing in his presentation last week?  When it suits it, it has nothing to do with the Nigerian Government, yet, as an organisation which is supplying a major portion of its revenue, it is in a position to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I read some of the reports of the meeting of the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs last week, but will make sure that I receive the full report. The question of whether there have been improvements or disimprovements in the activities of the Nigerian Government will be further discussed at the next meeting of the General Affairs Council where I will press again for oil sanctions.  I have not seen any improvements since the matter was discussed in December &mdash; quite the contrary &mdash; but, as I said on 7 December, an oil embargo will not have any effect unless it is supported worldwide.  This will require agreement at United Nations level by resolution.</P>
      <P>On the question of harassment of the lawyer mentioned, this is a matter I have been considering and it may also be discussed at European Union level.</P>

That would be preferable to the charade at the moment where we must wait weeks for the matter to go before a particular committee, where answers are buried and where an attempt is made to defer giving truthful answers.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Bill which has two main aims. First, it seeks to provide a sound statutory basis for certain powers and functions traditionally exercised by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Some of these have been called into question since the High Court judgment in the Howard <i>v.</i> the Commissioners of Public Works case on which I will elaborate shortly.  Second, it seeks to provide the necessary power for the commissioners to give effect to a scheme to offer humanitarian assistance at reasonable cost to a small number of people whose houses have been damaged beyond repair or who have suffered long duration flooding during the exceptionally high floods of late 1994 and early last year.  It will also provide the power for the commissioners to implement humanitarian assistance schemes in other cases where the Government decides to do so.</P>
      <P>On the first issue, the Attorney General has advised that the opportunity should now be taken to establish the general powers which the Commissioners of Public Works require in order to carry out their functions.  The commissioners are a statutory corporation, a kind of body which has no functions, powers or duties other than those which the statute or statutes setting it up confers on it.  This problem is compounded by the fact that the commissioners did not come into existence for any one purpose and their functions have never been comprehensively set out.  They were simply given extra functions over the years as various Governments required them to carry out a variety of tasks.  The assumption always was that the commissioners had sufficient legal powers to carry out these functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> However, the Attorney General advises that this has serious legal and practical consequences.  The practical consequence is that to discover whether the commissioners have power to carry out a specific task it is necessary to go through approximately 200 statues, the earliest of which is 150 years old.</P>
    <P>The legal drawback is that powers conferred in one statute may be exercisable only for the purposes listed in that statute and the fact that several statutes give similar powers may not necessarily mean that the commissioners have any general power to act in a particular way. To state it simply, the problem is that the full range of functions which the Government requires the commissioners to perform have not been set out unambiguously in legislation and the powers which it needs to carry out these functions have not been made sufficiently explicit.  This difficulty was highlighted in the recent case of Howard <i>v.</i> the Commissioners.  The House will recall that the High Court found that the Commissioners of Public Works had no general powers to carry out construction works.  The net effect of this judgment was that they did not have powers to carry out the general building, construction, maintenance, and supplies functions which had been such a large part of their work for decades. This immediate problem was resolved with the passing of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The strict interpretation of powers by the High Court in the Howard case and problems which have arisen with other specific cases since then have led the Attorney General to advise that the only way to avoid further legal problems is to set out in legislation the functions of the commissioners and the powers which are requiired to carry them out. This is the only way to achieve certainty and to avoid doubt over their legal powers to carry out their work.  That is why we are now taking the opportunity to do so in the Bill before the House.  It is important that the House should know <Col N="240" /> that it is not the case that nothing was being done to clear up these legal doubts.  The commissioners and the Attorney General's office had in fact been working for some time to see how these legal uncertainties could best be tackled.  Both had finally concluded that new legislation would be necessary and work on this had already begun. Obviously it now makes sense to combine this with the emergency legislation which is necessary in any case to allow the humanitarian relief scheme to be implemented.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not give any expanded authority to the commissioners with the exception of that for the administration of the humanitarian scheme.  All it does is list the functions of the commissioners and remove any doubt over powers to carry these out.  There are many areas where there is no doubt over the commissioners' powers &mdash; for example the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, the Canals Act, 1986, State Property Act, 1954, and many other enactments give specific powers in specific areas.  The Bill now before the House does not interfere with or substitute for any of these specific provisions but merely removes doubt in areas which are not now specifically covered.  The Bill also provides that the commissioners can act in the exercise of these powers only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On the second matter, i.e. that relating to the scheme for humanitarian assistance which arises as a direct result of the flooding of late 1994 and early 1995, I would like to say a few words on this general issue and the efforts of the Government to deal with the matter over the last year.  There is no need for me to remind the House of the seriousness of the situation which arose during the period in question.  It was the subject of extensive debate both here and in Seanad Éireann on a number of occasions during the year.  In the worst hit areas the flood waters rose with very little warning and remained at a high level in some areas for long periods &mdash; several months in the most extreme <Col N="241" /> cases.  As a consequence there are a number of home owners who have been so severely traumatised by their experience that they simply cannot face the prospect of a recurrence.</P>
    <P>We are all aware, of course, that the immediate cause of the flooding in the periods in question was the cumulative effect of the exceptionally heavy rainfall which occurred in the preceding months &mdash; in some areas rainfall was more than twice the normal level for the period.</P>
    <P>The flooding and the problems associated with it have all been extensively reported on many occasions.  The exceptional problems in the south Galway area were the main focus of publicity during the period in question but severe conditions were also experienced in many other parts of the country &mdash; Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Cork, Kerry, Laois, Offaly, Roscommon, Wicklow and Wexford.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the problem was both sympathetic and comprehensive. It included the following measures: (1) An interdepartmental committee was established, of which I am currently chairman, to co-ordinate the Government's response to the effects of bad weather; (2) a sum of £2 million was made available through the agricultural compensation scheme to assist farmers for losses of fodder, stock, etc., farmyard relocation, arising from the flooding; (3) £4 million was made available for the repair of county roads and (4) £750,000 was made available by way of humanitarian aid to be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society to alleviate the hardship of flood victims.</P>
    <P>This was on top of some £398,000 which the EU had provided by way of humanitarian aid, which had also been distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.  The latter was made available in no small measure due to the intervention of my predecessor, Deputy Jim Higgins.  Further approaches have been made to the EU in the context of the hardship caused by the more recent flooding, particularly in the south east region.  I will refer in more detail to them shortly; (5) the Arterial Drainage <Col N="242" /> (Amendment) Act, 1995, expanded the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works contained in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, thereby enabling them to carry out relief schemes for the alleviation of localised flooding in addition to their powers to carry out major arterial schemes which dealt with problems in river-catchment areas as a whole; (6) permission was given to undertake a major multi-disciplinary investigation into the causes of flooding in the Gort-Ardrahan area of south Galway, which is currently ongoing and which, it is hoped, will make recommendations as to means of dealing with these problems; (7) the Army, Air Corps, Fire Service and other local authority services and the health boards provided considerable emergency assistance to distressed persons in the flooded areas; (8) the Commissioners of Public Works established an emergency co-ordination centre or one-stop-shop in Gort which was staffed by representatives of the Western Health Board, the Department of Agriculture, Galway County Council, the Irish Red Cross Society and the Office of Public Works.  More than 500 callers to this facility were assisted in relation to claims for compensation, rehousing and humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on progress made under some of the principal items to which I just alluded.  Members will agree that the outcome of the Irish Red Cross Society's distribution of the humanitarian aid fully justifies the decision taken earlier to route the funds in question through that organisation. In determining the most appropriate apportionment of the funds available a number of criteria were used by the society.  These included death, personal injury, damage to houses and loss of income.  Applicants were assessed on an individual basis taking into account their circumstances both prior to and as a result of the flooding, as well as their overall ability taking into account their insurance status, to help themselves in overcoming the effects of the crisis. Where necessary, officers or experienced volunteers of the society checked <Col N="243" /> details of the claims by visiting applicants.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the society rightly regards the precise details of individual claims as confidential between them and the applicants.</P>
    <P>While the EU aid made available through the society made a valuable contribution, I stress it did not reflect in full the hardship and distress suffered by many applicants.  In the circumstances the interdepartmental committee was directed at an early stage to examine and report, as a matter of urgency, on the possibility of Exchequer funding being made available during the year and on the extent of the funding required to provide additional humanitarian relief, taking account of the need to ensure that relief through the Red Cross Society, from the European Union, and through the supplementary welfare allowance system were elements in a coherent and cost-effective programme involving acceptable Exchequer cost.  It was against this background that, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, I reported to Government in July 1995 that an additional £750,000 should be made available.  This followed extensive consultation with the Irish Red Cross Society and officials of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>This amount was considered by the society to be adequate to enable it to put those who applied to it for assistance reasonably close to the situation they were in before the flooding, and the amounts to be paid would take into account assistance which was available from other sources such as insurance.</P>
    <P>Funding at this level would enable the society (a) to make payments to a number of people who sought assistance under the earlier EU package but could not be assisted because of the limited funds available; (b) to pay additional amounts to applicants who received payments which fell far short of their real losses and, (c) to deal with a number of claims which were received after the deadline for application for EU aid <Col N="244" /> and were previously ruled technically ineligible.</P>
    <P>Applications for assistance were invited through the press and local radio stations and while there may be a certain amount of dissatisfaction among a small number of victims that the aid did not compensate them adequately under headings such as devaluation of property, I believe that it was seen as reasonable by most claimants and independent observers.  Both the Irish Red Cross Society and my office have had a very favourable response to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on the arrangements made with the Irish Red Cross Society to deal with the disbursement of the EU and Exchquer funds made available for humanitarian aid in 1995.  Before going on to deal with other issues which arise in the context of the winter 1994-95 floods I would like to take the opportunity to dwell for a moment on more recent events.  Such are the vagaries of the Irish weather that it is difficult to forecast where the next major flood will arise.  However, we are all very much aware of the severe problems in the south and south-east of the country arising from the extreme conditions in that area between late December 1995 and mid-January 1996. The pictures which emanated from places such as Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Wexford are very familiar.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, replied on my behalf to an Adjournment debate on the matter on 24 January 1996.  I would now like to bring the House up to date particularly in the context of the debate on this Bill, on the action so far taken in response to the most recent floods in these areas and the position as it stands.</P>
    <P>At an early stage I became aware both in general and specific terms from reports received from around the affected areas of the extent of the hardship caused to families by the flooding of homes throughout the south and south-east, including County Wexford where, I understand, a substantial number of houses suffered flooding; and <Col N="245" /> from personal experience resulting from visits to Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, two areas which were particularly badly affected.  I am also aware, from preliminary reports which were provided at my request by the local authorities to the Department of the Environment, of the nature and extent of the flooding and the resultant hardship in counties Cork, Kilkenny and Waterford.  The Government too is very conscious of the traumatising effect such flooding can have on individuals, particularly the elderly, and sympathise with the plight of the flood victims.  In doing so, it recognises that individuals may require assistance from time to time to get them over very adverse situations and acknowledges their need to be treated on a humanitarian basis, particularly where they are uninsured and in poor financial circumstances. Deputies will note that in the recent past this has been done by a combination of EU and Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>In this context, accompanied by officials of the Office of Public Works, I was pleased to make a personal visit to Brussels on Monday, 22 January 1996, where I met Mr. David Williamson, Secretary General of the EU Commission. This followed a detailed submission, including press cuttings from national and local newspapers as well as video footage from RTE, which gave a clear indication of the nature and extent of the difficulties and of the resulting hardship. I am also pleased that I received a positive response from Mr. Williamson who indicated he would propose to the Commission that aid be provided to Ireland and Portugal, where severe flooding had also occurred.  I understand that his proposal has since been approved by the Commission and that a request is now being made to the EU Council and Parliament to provide the necessary funding as it had not already been provided for in the 1996 budget.  It is now up to the EU Parliament to decide the transfer of the necessary funding from other allocations, a process which could take up to 60 days.  I <Col N="246" /> am very hopeful of a positive outcome to these representations.</P>
    <P>Consideration will be given to Exchequer assistance in the light of the Parliament's decision.  I envisage that any additional funding provided, EU or Exchequer, would again be routed through the Red Cross Society.  This is customary practice with EU member states where experience is reflected in the success of previous measures, including the most recent ones here.</P>
    <P>I revert now to the second element of the 1995 humanitarian aid scheme, that relating to home relocation.  On 26 July Dáil Éireann passed a Vote, designated Vote 46, to provide for expenditure to defray the costs of various flood relief measures, including the allocation of £750,000 for home relocation assistance. This, we have just recently been advised, also requires the passage of legislation to give a statutory footing to the scheme since devised.  To fully apprise the House of developments on this I would like to outline in general terms the main provisions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme itself is straightforward. Anyone who can show to the satisfaction of the commissioners that the house in which they resided was damaged beyond repair at reasonable cost by flooding at the end of 1994 and early 1995 or suffered flooding for an extended period, i.e. in excess of three weeks, will be eligible for relocation, provided no flood relief scheme that would protect the property has been undertaken or is planned within a period of approximately 12 months.  Householders who are eligible for assistance will have the option of (a) having a house constructed on a site to be provided by them, the cost of which to a reasonable level will be borne by the commissioners.  Construction would be by the local authority acting as agent of the Commissioners of Public Works or; (b) receiving financial assistance to enable them to relocate themselves. Under both options it will normally be a condition that benefiting householders demolish their existing house, and any <Col N="247" /> insurance compensation received (less reasonable loss adjusters' fees) in respect of structural damage to the property will be offset against any financial assistance payable.  The scheme is being offered in a humanitarian context and the intention is that beneficiaries will be owner-occupiers who fulfil the qualifying criteria.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that householders will be required to covenant with the commissioners to demolish the existing house to the latters' satisfaction within a reasonable period, failing which, the commissioners would have a legal right to undertake or complete the demolition. Some of the amount payable would be retained to ensure fulfilment of this condition.  The householder will be permitted to retain the site and any salvage recovered.  Applicants for assistance under the scheme will be required to sign a form authorising insurance companies to furnish the commissioners with any information they possess in relation to the insurance position in respect of their properties.</P>
    <P>An appropriate monetary value based on local authority housing which, with appropriate allowances for purchase of site and fees, will form the basis of any offers of assistance to applicants who seek that option.  It is expected that most applicants will choose the financial option.  It is expected that applicants will incur legal fees in connection with the purchase of a site, completion of contracts, etc, and other professional fees in respect of the design and construction of their new houses.  They will also incur costs associated with demolition of their existing houses and site clearance.  An allowance will be included in the scheme in respect of all such costs.  It is not proposed to seek recovery of any costs incurred by the State arising from the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that, following extensive investigation and consultation with public representatives and with representative bodies such as the IFA and south Galway flood victims action <Col N="248" /> group, the Commissioners of Public Works are now ready, subject to the passage of this Bill, to deal individually with applications received for assistance. I recently wrote to each of the householders concerned advising them of the details of the scheme and that applications would be sought from those interested as soon as the necessary legislation comes into effect.  Payments would be expected to follow very shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to elaborate on the works proposed under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995.  The House will appreciate that it is not sufficient to introduce various relief and humanitarian aid schemes.  It is essential too that a programme of physical works is introduced to combat the recurrence in future of the extensive flooding which has occurred all too frequently.  During the debate on the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, early last year, resulting in its passage into law in July last, many references were made to the extensive programme of works already completed by the Commissioners of Public Works under earlier legislation and their immediate plans for a programme of localised flood relief works in a number of selected priority areas.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the major investigation being undertaken into the possibility of ameliorating conditions in the Gort-Ardrahan area of south Galway. This investigation, costing £750,000, is well under way and the consultants have submitted a preliminary report which has been discussed at a public meeting in Gort and with the IFA and the south Galway flood victims' action group. These bodies have also received copies of the report.  The report outlines some conceptual approaches to solving the problem and work will continue during 1996 to develop further these approaches.  A final report is expected in early 1997.</P>
    <P>A scheme of works has already been undertaken in the Belclare area of Tuam, County Galway.  A start has also <Col N="249" /> been made on the preparation of proposals for schemes in no fewer than eight other areas.  These are Carlow; Cappamore, County Limerick; New-port, County Tipperary; Duleek, County Meath; Dunmanway, County Cork; Gort town in County Galway (which is being considered separately from the main study of the Gort-Ardrahan area of the south of the county); Kilkenny city; Sixmilebridge, County Clare; and Williamstown, County Galway.</P>
    <P>Consultants have been engaged for some time in the preparation and consideration of various options for the relief of flooding in these areas in the context of both economic and environmental implications.  Every effort is being made to ensure the early completion of the design process in each of the areas listed so that the necessary sanctions can be sought to initiate the next stages, i.e. public exhibition and the preparation of contract documentation should schemes evolve which meet the necessary economic and environmental considerations.  I hope that all qualifying schemes will be in progress during 1996.  In the case of Sixmilebridge, I expect to receive the necessary sanctions to proceed with the publication of the scheme within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I have in my preceding remarks dealt solely with the priority programme for 1996.  I am, of course, aware from all that has been said in the past on this subject that there are many other areas which will require consideration and attention &mdash; we are constantly reminded of this as flooding recurs.  It is the intention as soon as all the relevant data has been collected to review the situation in relation to some of these.</P>
    <P>This should enable the setting up of a national priority programme with a view to carrying out future schemes in the light of conditions prevailing from time to time and in the context of the resources available for works of this nature. I regard the preparation of this programme as an urgent priority.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions <Col N="250" /> of the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995 which are drafted to give a sound statutory basis to those matters referred to which do not already have an existing statutory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the interpretation of some of the terms used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 describes some of the main functions which the Commissioners of Public Works are required to carry out, specifically the purchasing, building, leasing and maintaining of accommodation and properties of all kinds, real and personal, for all Departments of State and other public bodies.  It also provides for the addition of a new function to which I have alluded in some depth in my earlier remarks, with particular reference to the administration of the humanitarian aid scheme which we are advised requires specific statutory provision.  With regard to this latter issue a number of amendments to the Bill as originally published were agreed on Committee Stage in the Seanad in December last.</P>
    <P>These provide a mechanism for appeal by an individual to the Minister for Finance in the event of dissatisfaction at the commissioners' response to an application under the scheme.  The Government was happy to accept these amendments which are now incorporated in the Bill in subsections (2), (3) and (4).</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives the commissioners the power to undertake their functions where such power is not already prescribed by statute.  This is the kernel of the problem highlighted by the Attorney General that while the commissioners have individual powers under specific enactments, these do not confer general powers to deal in property outside the scope of those enactments.</P>
    <P>Section 4 enables the commissioners to exercise their functions and powers for the provision of living accommodation under the humanitarian aid scheme by arrangement with a housing authority who would act as their agent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> Section 5 deals further with the interpretation of the Bill, specifically in relation to references to land which have particular meaning defined in local government legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a general provision in relation to the funding of the functions carried out under the earlier sections.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the short title.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad a number of largely technical amendments were also made to the Bill as originally published.  One example was the addition of the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had&rdquo; in a number of places where the commissioners are cited as having certain powers.  As I explained, the Bill is intended to give legal certainty to what exactly are the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works and underpin those which the commissioners have traditionally exercised.  The purpose of these amendments is to validate actions taken in good faith by the commissioners over the years.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill as it now stands will of course be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.  I again express my thanks to the House for its response in facilitating the introduction of the Bill. I look forward to the co-operation of Deputies in securing its rapid passage into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill, however belatedly it has come before the House.  I regret that it has taken 13 months since the serious flooding, particularly in the west.  I totally reject the reasons given for this delay. We were told the problem resulted from a High Court decision in the case of Howard <i>v.</i> the State.  I reject that because it is obvious to anyone who examines our political and parliamentary history that the Commissioners of Public Works are the country's oldest State agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>History confirms that flooding has been a problem for centuries.  When Ireland was under imperialist rule a <Col N="252" /> specific Drainage Act was brought forward in the House of Commons in 1842 dealing entirely with flooding in this country.  The same Act was later used to create employment in the Famine period. From 1842 to 1854 not less than £2.5 million was spent on drainage in Ireland and specific powers were given to the Commissioners of Public Works at that time.  The investment in drainage works during those 12 years would amount to approximately £2.5 billion in current monetary values.</P>
    <P>Ireland gained its independence in 1922 and in 1945 this Parliament passed the Arterial Drainage Act.  I presume when the Act was being drafted by civil servants that consultation took place with the then Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Attorney General. Amendments were subsequently tabled both in this House and in the Seanad and the Act became law.  The present powers of the Commissioners of Public Works are grounded in the 1842 Act. These were confirmed in the 1945 Act and were later copperfastened by several Government decisions, directives and Statutory Instruments.  The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out specific functions at any time are given to them by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 contains no less than five sections dealing with compensation.  Four deal with actual compensation while a fifth empowers the Land Commissioners to withhold any payments to people who owe money to the State.  The balance would have to be paid to the Commissioners. Financial management was well ahead of its time when the 1945 Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, for the delay in introducing this Bill because he is the third Minister to have dealt with this flooding problem over the past 13 months.  I publicly thank him for his humane and generous approach to this problem since he started to deal with it last July.  I also pay a special tribute to the Commissioners of Public Works and their <Col N="253" /> staff for the very fine and specific commitment they gave.</P>
    <P>On 16 February 1995 Senator Daly published the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995 which gave specific powers to the commissioners to pay compensation.  He was harried by Government Members in the Seanad and the Bill was voted down.  Senator Daly is an experienced parliamentarian. He was a Member of Dáil Éireann and served in Cabinet.  He was Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, brought forward a Bill and Senator Daly tabled amendments dealing with compensation.  Once again Government members harried the Senator and the amendments were defeated.</P>
    <P>I became aware that there were problems with the payment of compensation. Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn, Killeen and I tabled a motion on the issue on 4 February 1995.  Many parliamentary questions and special notice questions were raised on the matter by Deputies from all sides.  In reply to a question I tabled in December I was told that the matter would be considered in due course and the problem would be resolved.  A Bill published in December and passed in the Seanad on 20 December gives specific powers to the Commissioners of Public Works to pay compensation.  If there were problems with the payment of compensation as a result of the Howard case the Government should have appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  However, rather than carry out the necessary legal research and copperfasten the powers of the commissioners this Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments regarded the Office of Public Works as having great expertise.  Matters which could not be dealt with in other Departments were referred to that office for execution and discharge.  When we were in power with Labour in 1993 an effort was made to downgrade and diminish the powers of the commissioners.  We resisted that <Col N="254" /> until we were hounded out of office. The Office of Public Works has been politically raped by this Government. The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht took over many of its powers. When there is positive, buoyant news he is responsible for waterways but when there are serious problems the Office of Public Works is responsible.  As a result of the treatment meted out to the commissioners and their excellent staff the Government found itself in a dilemma. It transferred some of the powers of the Office of Public Works for political expediency and then found that it could not discharge its obligations to the victims of flooding.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas I was assured by our party Whip that the Dáil would deal with this Bill on 23 January 1996.  I was surprised to learn that it was to be budget day and that the Bill would not be before the House.  We are dealing with the matter 13 months after the flooding occurred.  However, it is better late than never.  I wish to place on record the gratitude of the flood victims in my county to the professional and voluntary members of the Red Cross for their tremendous contribution and the humane way in which they dealt with the problems.  The national treasurer lives in County Galway and did trojan work co-ordinating, meeting and discussing the problems with people and ensuring they would receive compensation.</P>
    <P>Those far removed from the flooded area may not understand the seriousness of the matter.  People's homes were flooded overnight and the effects of that were felt for five or six months.  The property around their houses was also under water.  Livestock were threatened, outhouses were flooded and the roads were impassable.  I pay tribute to Galway County Council for its response, especially in creating alternative access routes to homes and schools and ensuring there was food for families and animals. The level of trauma, pressure and difficulties experienced by the flood victims has not been witnessed in this country for a long time.  People had to <Col N="255" /> leave their homes and live in rented accommodation.  In some cases they had to leave that also.  They had to go across land to bring children to school.  These people still suffer the psychological and financial effects of the flooding.  Until these matters are resolved and they have a normal family home they will not be able to rebuild their lives.  The problem would have been seriously compounded if people had not taken the initiative to carry out local drainage works.  I pay tribute to Deputy McCormack who spearheaded the political initiative to ensure support was available from local authorities and the Government to complement the local initiative taken.  The Kiltiernan-Ballindereen flood relief group ensured that houses were protected and that schools and roads were accessible.</P>
    <P>The works carried out were relief works and I am delighted that the Government made money available to the Office of Public Works to compenstate those who raised money in the banks.  We must pay tribute to the financial institutions who made money available so that the works could commence. The Government picked up the tab when it was satisfied that <i>de facto</i> work was being carried out.</P>
    <P>There is much confusion and frustration. Ireland is the victim of serious flooding.  Many studies, programmes and reports have been published, yet year after year the problem arises.  A detailed consultancy study is being carried out in south-west Galway, particularly in the Gort-Ardrahan area which was badly flooded.  That area is unique and, therefore, I hope the report will be conclusive.  The best professionals are employed on this matter and much State money is being expended.  Many experts can make a contribution in this area, including staff of the Office of Public Works who have experience in arterial drainage, professional staff of the Geological Survey of Ireland, engineering staff of Galway County Council, engineering and other staff of the Department of the Environment and officials <Col N="256" /> of other State agencies.  There must be consultation with professional staff who produced reports on this issue in the past and, most importantly, with the local people.</P>
    <P>People in south and north Galway believe that the only solution to the flooding problem is drainage.  Action is necessary to ensure the problem does not recur.  Account should be taken of the topography of the area as well as natural amenities such as Coole Lake, wildlife, the Slieve Aughty mountain range, forestry effects and so on.  There is no point in continuing the study of this problem <i>ad infinitum</i>.  I had hoped it would be completed this year but it now appears it will not be completed until next year.  I appeal to the Government to ensure that when the study is concluded south Galway will be used as a pilot area for future flooding problems.</P>
    <P>West Galway is bordered by the sea, an area of south Galway is bordered by the Slieve Aughty mountain range and in the centre there is a very complex geological system, with small farms dotted around the area, interspersed by hamlets, villages and residential areas.  It is an ideal location for study of the flooding problems.  I hope that action will be taken in this regard sooner rather than later to ensure the people in the area do not suffer further trauma.</P>
    <P>The people of north Galway have also been the victims of flooding on many occasions in the past.  Under the Drainage Act, 1945, an area of north Galway, including Curragh West, Dunmore, in the parish of Williamstown and Glenamaddy, was identified by the Office of Public Works for drainage work, but because of local political rivalry that work was never carried out.  Since then perhaps once in every decade there have been serious flooding problems.  I hope the necessary action will be taken to ensure flooding of this areas does not recur.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Minister for the work carried out in Belclare, which has been of great benefit to the area.  Other parts of the county have been affected <Col N="257" /> on a regular basis by flash flooding. Resources should be given to the Office of Public Works who, in co-operation with the local authority, should work to prevent a recurrence of the events of January 1995 when people in Ballinasloe had to leave their homes and animals had to be removed from outhouses on farms.  Similar problems were experienced in New Inn, Kilconnell, Ballycrissane and Portumna.  People had to vacate their houses in Loughrea and in Moylough houses were flooded and roads blocked.</P>
    <P>Public representatives have a responsibility to address these problems &mdash; I commend Senator Brendan Daly in this regard.  We acquire expertise in dealing with matters but unfortunately on many occasions, regardless of who is in Government, our views are not taken on board in legislation.  The best possible legislation should be enacted by taking on board sensible proposals and suggestions for amendments to Bills.</P>
    <P>This Government inherited a buoyant economy and had much money to spend in the past 12 months.  I put down a question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking him to make available, under the community scheme, funds for the South Galway Flood Victims' Action Group which does much voluntary work in this area, but that request was rejected.  However, the Minister provided money to various groups of dubious reputation, particularly in Dublin, in the past 12 months.  Obviously, he is cultivating his own corner and has no interest in the problems that bedevil the people of the west.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare for agreeing, at my request, that compensation payments to flood victims would not be taken into account for unemployment assistance purposes. However, I was extremely disappointed that in the case of people who applied to the local health board for supplementary welfare assistance, insurance payments were taken into account.  While the health board in the area has done tremendous work in terms of the one <Col N="258" /> stop shop in Gort, there is no justification for that decision.  The State and its agencies have a duty to provide support for these people.</P>
    <P>On 16 January last the Minister issued a circular on compensation to flood victims. I welcome the preliminary offer of compensation but I do not accept one can compare local authority houses with private houses.  Some houses that were flooded will never be used again and will have to be demolished.  I put forward suggestions to the Minister at various meetings &mdash; I thank him and his officials for their co-operation during the past 12 months; it was deeply appreciated &mdash; on the level of compensation that would be acceptable to flood victims.  The people concerned are dissatisfied with the payments offered to them.  Many of them built houses to a certain specification and standard on a site purchased by them or on a farm where they live.  It is unfair to compare that with a local authority house.  In addition, they would have paid stamp duty if they had bought a house, or VAT if they built one.  The compensation being offered means they must acquire a site or build on their own site and as they had a house before they will not qualify for a new house grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to claw back the insurance compensation paid to these people.  I accept that nobody is entitled to be compensated twice for the same loss.  However, there must be equity in this proposal.  If a person is compensated for their losses at the rate of 25 per cent by the insurance company, the claw back should be 25 per cent of the Minister's offer, not the compensation they received.  If the Minister's offer does not match their assets, they are not entitled to be penalised at the level of compensation they received but at a <i>pro rata</i> figure, that is, 25 per cent of £62,500 or £51,500.  The Minister must act responsibly when discharging public funds, but this is exceptional.</P>
    <P>Many victims of the flooding in County Galway invested their life savings in building new houses.  Those who came home from overseas with a wife <Col N="259" /> and children settled down in areas close to where they were born.  Those houses may be affected by flooding again unless major drainage work is carried out. Adequate compensation must be paid to ensure that equity prevails and that those people do not have to leave this country again.  We must take exceptional situations into account such as where people have no job or there is only one earner in a family.  We must try to keep honest, hard working people here.  We must have a commitment to the renewal of rural Ireland and to maintaining its population.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill has a speedy passage through the House.  I will table amendments and I look forward to discussing them on Committee Stage.  I hope this Bill will copperfasten the powers of the commissioners of Public Works to make decisions.  They have been in existence for 150 years during which time they garnered a lot of power and discharged it with dignity, efficiency and professionalism.  I hope the oldest State agency in the country does not have to confirm its powers through such legislative measures in the future.</P>

      <P>Fáiltíonn an Páirtí Daonlathach roimh an mBille seo.

Ba chóir go mbeadh údarás Stáit ann go mbeadh sé de dhualgas air agus an chumhacht aige teacht i gcabhair ar dhaoine i sáinn de bharr tubaiste mar seo a tharla ar fud na tíre ach i gContae na Gaillimhe go háirithe mar thoradh ar an mbáisteach uafásach ní amháin anuraidh ach ar thrí ócáid le cúig bliana anuas.  Bhí an bháisteach chomh trom sin nach raibh na haibhneacha in ann an t-uisce a thógáil go dtí an fharraige.  Bhí na tithe báite agus bhí ar dhaoine imeacht astu mar go raibh an t-uisce ag teacht isteach iontu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuireadh isteach ar dhaoine ar bhealaí éagsúla.  Cuireadh isteach ar lucht gnó, ar fheirmeoirí agur ar <Col N="260" /> dhaoine a bhí ina gcomhnaí i dtithe a bhí slán dar leo.  Chaith siad an saol ag bailiú airgid chun teach a thógáil; bhí an teach tógtha agus an t-airgead infheistithe sa teach ach tar éis na tubaiste seo níorbh fhíu faic na tithe sin.  Bhí faitíos orthu dul arais iontu mar go mb'fhéidir go dtarlódh a leithéid arís agus arís eile bliain i ndiaidh a chéile.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome this Bill, although we wish these matters had been attended to at an earlier date. However, as a Deputy from a Galway constituency.  I am conscious that the Government has acted reasonably satisfactorily in relation to this disaster.</P>
    <P>The flooding was worse in south Galway than in most other places.  The trauma of having one's house, farm, land or shop flooded leaves people in a state of despondency and despair.  Their investments and life's work have been destroyed and their source of income has been washed away.  The Minister listed the places with flooding problems.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy and the sympathy of my party, to those who suffered loss.  From visiting the houses in south Galway which were affected by the flooding I know that extending sympathy is no good unless one is in a position to offer help.  Serious flooding occurred in south Galway on two previous occasions in the early 1990s, but little action was taken to help those affected.  The third disaster which struck at the end of 1994 and continued until this time last year showed it was no longer an occasion for Ministers and public representatives to look at the problems and go away when the television cameras leave.  People were left in dire circumstances with no offer of help from official quarters.</P>
    <P>I extend my appreciation to the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Hogan, the first person appointed by the Government to head an interdepartmental group to examine this problem and to try to find solutions to help the people.  He did not last long in that Department, was replaced by Deputy Jim Higgins who <Col N="261" /> was then replaced by the present Minister of State, Deputy Coveney.  As a public representative from one of the disaster areas, I am grateful to the Minister for his sympathetic approach, his willingness to help, his understanding of the problem and the action he has taken.  We wish those actions had been taken more quickly and that measures would now be in place.  However, I recognise that the Minister had to start from scratch.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State cannot be blamed for difficulties that have arisen which made this Bill necessary to underpin the powers of the Office of Public Works to distribute humanitarian aid and to enter into arrangements with a housing authority to provide homes for the people concerned.  I listened carefully to Deputy Treacy's contribution.  It is appropriate that the Minister, having been advised that this Bill is necessary, should ensure there is absolutely no doubt about what the Government can do.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed that the level of financial compensation being offered to householders may not be adequate to meet the losses suffered in individual cases.  I take it from what the Minister of State said that there will be a cap of £65,000 on the level of compensation. That is an arbitrary way to deal with this matter and I suggest he consider matching compensation to losses suffered in individual cases rather than introducing a standard figure of compensation which would not offer an appropriate level of compensation in all cases.</P>
    <P>The Howard case in the High Court raised the issue of whether the Office of Public Works had power to do certain things and many of us were surprised to discover it did not.  The Minister had a duty to bring forward legislation to have it firmly placed in the statutes that the Office of Public Works has power to undertake various functions on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The big issue in South Galway is housing compensation and the long-term solution to the flooding problem. If the consultants appointed by the <Col N="262" /> Minister put forward proposals which recommend a solution to this problem, the flooding may not recur.  If it is proposed to construct a channel from the area of Coole Lake to the sea at Kinvarra as a relief for flooding above a certain level, it is likely that those areas will not be flooded again as the subterreanean rock structure and underground waterways in that region are unique in Europe.  I do not know what solution the consultants will recommend, but it is clear that in times of exceptionally heavy rainfall the under ground system is not capable of taking the waters to the sea.  Flooding in low lying areas in that region has become progressively worse.  Since we have not had heavy rainfall this winter that region is likely to escape serious flooding this year.  However, if there is heavy rainfall this year and that area experiences worse flooding than last year, the Government will have to make firm decisions.  We can only speculate about a solution to the flooding problem, and that would be idle speculation.  It is better to wait and see what the consultants come up with.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the consultants submit their report it will be published and we will have access to it.  I also hope we will be able to establish clearly if the Government intends to accept their proposals and implement them.  There was widespread surprise and dismay at the recommendations in the consultants' preliminary report made available some months ago.  It did not do much to raise people's hopes that the consultants' final report would provide a satisfactory solution.  I am entering into the realm of speculation here, and that is not helpful.</P>
    <P>My reason for contributing to the debate is to indicate my party's support for the proposal to extend powers to the Office of Public Works to ensure, in particular, that it can use the housing authorities as agents to provide homes for people in drastic circumstances similar to those which resulted from flooding in Galway last year.  The State agencies reacted in a very humanitarian way during the time of this disaster.  The <Col N="263" /> Garda, the Civil Defence, local authorities, the Red Cross, although not an agent of the State, the health boards and the Air Corps gave exceptional aid to families and farmers on that occasion. This work was co-ordinated by a Government committee to which we must be thankful.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the determination, vigilance and persistence of the South Galway flood victims support committee and the work of the IFA South Galway committee in keeping pressure on the Minister and on public representatives, we may not have achieved so much.  I join Deputy Treacy in expressing surprise that financial assistance was not made available to the flood victims committee to compensate its members for administration, travel and other incidental expenses they incurred because of a tragedy over which they did not have control.  They acted out of community spirit to help their neighbours and some of them were affected personally. They had to organise themselves into an action committee which was not prepared to accept inadequate assistance. Their determination is an example of outstanding community action.  I hope the Minister will provide some financial assistance to cover the out of pocket expenses incurred by the people who established that committee and undertook the necessary difficult work involved in documenting and presenting their case to the Minister of State who was gracious, helpful and sympathetic on every occasion they met.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill and I accept its principle although I may table amendments on behalf of my party on Committee Stage.  The real test of its effectiveness will be determined by the level of compensation provided.  If the Minister sticks to the figures he mentioned in public, there will be dissatisfaction. I hope much of the good work he attempted will not be spoiled by niggardliness as not many houses will need to be replaced.  The report of the multi-disciplinary consultants appointed by the Minister and the action taken on <Col N="264" /> foot of it will be the most important factor for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The work done to date is fire brigade action to help people deal with their immediate problems.  The biggest concern is the alleviation of the long-term problem and what steps can be taken to ensure that massive flooding of the region does not recur.  I hope it is within the competence of the consultants appointed to make a feasible recommendation. I hope it will be within the capability of Government to support such recommendation and provide the funds necessary for its implementation. While all of that is for the future, I welcome the Bill and look forward to detailed discussion on some of its provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill, like many other Members I regret the necessity for its introduction. Having followed these proposals closely over the past 12 months, I have to say the events leading to its introduction were the fault of nobody.  I can also verify that neither the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Coveney, nor anybody else was aware until the very last moment that this enabling Bill would have to be passed by both Houses. While one may quibble about a few days' delay one way or another, all parliamentarians know the duration of parliamentary processes.  I hope it will be passed quickly because its enactment will result in many applicants receiving long awaited compensation.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, with whom I have worked closely over the past 12 months and who, along with many others, devoted a great deal of time and energy to the preparation of this Bill.  It would be fair to say that, from the time we public representatives in east Galway were deemed responsible for the general Gort area, we too put much time and energy into its preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had thought the Commissioners of <Col N="265" /> Public Works already possessed statutory authority to handle this type of brief.  However, as this matter arises every day in legal circles, we cannot express too much surprise at the necessity to introduce this Bill based on a formal court judgment.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whenever and wherever it occurs, flooding brings great damage and hardship in its wake.  People whose homes and lands are flooded never obtain sufficient compensation for all the damage wreaked.  When all of those compensatory claims are met, involving the relocation of dwellings and so on, one is talking of a total sum just short of £8 million.  This will be of considerable benefit to applicants in a region such as Gort and south Galway which had been submerged under water levels unknown in the history of the State.  In the height of the flooding, standing outside one person's dwelling. I noticed a mere three feet still visible at the top of an ESB pole; one can hardly imagine a greater depth of flooding.  I am very conscious that it will take much engineering expertise and experience to ensure that such flooding does not recur.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment about the manner in which compensation was paid.  The way it was handled was about the only practicable one, in that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made £2 million available almost instantaneously having inspected the flooding.  While some people found fault with the manner of its distribution, ultimately most people who had experienced problems received some type of compensation.  It transpired that those £2 million were not entirely taken up. The balance is to be reallocated under this new scheme in the relocation of farmyards.  I will revert later to this topic on which I have very strong views.</P>
    <P>I share the sentiments expressed by my constituency colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy.  I too take my cap off to the Irish Red Cross Society which undertook the huge task of distributing those funds. Without the benefit of previous criteria <Col N="266" /> or precedents, they distributed that humanitarian aid honestly and reasonably, bearing in mind the huge difficulties and misery endured by the victims of flooding.  While there may be a few, they are very few who would find fault with the Irish Red Cross Society and its handling of that humanitarian aid.  It will stand to their eternal credit that they correctly ascertained the overall problem on the ground and covered themselves in glory in the distribution of that aid.</P>
    <P>I have been closely involved with the Minister's proposals to compensate those whose dwelling houses have been flooded but I would not be telling tales out of school in informing the House that, when the compensatory amounts were first mooted, I found fault with them.  I note that some of my ideas have been incorporated in the final Government decision.</P>
    <P>Although I know almost all of those people who had the unfortunate experience of having had their dwellings flooded, the compensatory payments, being comprised of taxpayers' money, will have to be seen to be fairly and justly distributed to all concerned.  Nonetheless I accept it is very difficult to devise a system with which everybody will be relatively happy.</P>
    <P>As most Members representing the area will readily testify, some people will do quite well, others all right and a few may complain, based on the preflooding condition and value of their dwellings.  The Government has gone about as far as it is possible to go.  As the Minister and some of his officials are aware, I argued strongly that there were deficiencies in the original proposals. The relevant groups, the South Galway Action Committee and the IFA, know exactly what I am talking about but I am aware that a number of people remain unhappy.</P>
    <P>Immediately this Bill is enacted, an appropriate offer should be made and, if accepted, the relevant compensation should be paid forthwith.  Many applicants for compensation are living in rented accommodation, having moved <Col N="267" /> once or twice already and, in the strict sense of the word, they are homeless.  It is time they were allowed to resume their normal lifestyles, build new homes or purchase second-hand ones with such payments.</P>
    <P>In the case of a four-bedroomed house in Gort, bearing in mind current house prices and building costs, the final offer is quite reasonable.  Some applicants have complained it was unfair to deduct any insurance compensation, but any other proposal would have enormous difficulty being approved by any Committee of the House engaged in the scrutiny of compensatory payments, which Members will readily appreciate.</P>
    <P>While in 1995 we in the west were blessed with as dry a year as I can remember, the fact that there were two or three very wet days at the end of October/early November when the town of Gort was flooded for a couple of hours one evening highlights the susceptibility of such areas to flood damage. One could immediately see how frightened the residents were, fearing the heavier flooding would recur.  If such flooding can happen over two or three days in a very sunny, dry year, what can be expected in a year with normal rainfall?</P>
    <P>I had the good fortune to be in Gort on the evening the consultants spoke publicly about what it was proposed to do to remedy the potential for future flooding.  We were bamboozled by science, hydrology and other scientific arguments.  While I was impressed by Mr. Peach's presentation, I hope he knew what he was talking about.  Having said that, I sincerely hope there is action on the ground.  I know enough about the problem in Gort to know the answer to it.  Some sort of escape valve is needed whereby, when the water gets to a certain level, it can be released to the sea. One does not have to be a hydrologist to know that.  The problems relate to how this can be done and the damage it could cause.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed with the consultant. I have observed what is happening <Col N="268" /> around the Gort area and the problem is being tackled in a way that no consultant used previously.  Despite all the money that has gone into the area, people still say &mdash; with justification &mdash; at any public meeting in Gort that very little is being done for them because they remember the three days I mentioned and how easily the area could again be flooded.  We know the process will take 21 months and six or seven have already passed.  There is a huge area under review.</P>
    <P>I asked Mr. Peach whether he had encountered an area like Gort in his travels around the world.  He said there was only one area, in Burma of all places, where there might have been something like it.  This gives some indication of the uniqueness of the drainage in south Galway.  Leaving aside the issue of flora and fauna, he said that the basin in the Coole area will have to be drained in three different ways.  When this is taken into consideration, it will be a fair engineering feat to remove much of that water.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, I and some local people took the opportunity to walk back five or six miles from the mouth of the shoreline at Kinvara along a route designed by people who were very involved in the drainage business.  This is a long shot and I might have egg on my face after 12 months but I believe that an escape valve is possible without interfering much with wildlife and the other factors which must be taken into account.  The cost has yet to be worked out but we cannot allow people in an area as large as the Gort/south Galway area to live with the fear that, after three or four days of incessant rainfall, they will witness what they saw in early 1995.  One would not expect any local community to live in that situation.  Following the consultant's report, we must do anything we can to alleviate the situation, irrespective of which party is in Government.</P>
    <P>This Government pumped more money into the problem than anybody else over the years, including Governments of all hues.  Despite this, we were <Col N="269" /> no nearer a permanent solution until the consultants went into the area.  I take this opportunity, as Deputy Treacy very generously did, to compliment our colleague, Deputy McCormack, on the initiative he took with local people and a variety of others.  It was a bold experiment but it proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that something which did not have official blessing was sensible and workable.</P>
    <P>I share the views of Deputy Molloy and Deputy Treacy in regard to the Office of Public Works.  It is a professional body and I have always found it will do the best it can to give a fine quality service.  If it has one small fault, it is the need to recognise that there are other ways of doing the same job and sometimes of doing it better.  There is a change in this mentality and it is important that the change is linked to modern technology.  It will be possible to do things next year that could not have been done ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I hope that the signal we send out from Dáil Éireann on passing this legislation is that we have done the best we could for the people affected.  I hope we were humane and gave them every reason to be confident in the future. However, unless there is a permanent solution to drainage problems in Gort, south Galway drainage and many other places, the Exchequer and the European Union will have to pick up the tab in years to come for a problem that should have been solved in another, more permanent way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is looking at the possibility of relocating a number of farmyards.  There is about £600,000 available for this project.  I have some very definite views on it.  The money should be shared out equitably and should help small farmers.  There should be 90 to 100 per cent Exchequer help for the building of small slatted houses and-or cubicles.  The scheme should operate more or less on the same basis as the control of farm pollution grants.  Small farmers should be given this opportunity across the board where <Col N="270" /> they are entitled to it.  The powers that be are now vetting the applications.  The amount of money per farm should be capped so that no single farm can take up too much of the available resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the Williamstown-Curragh west area.  I have asked the Minister to ensure that the survey in that area continues.  There was a development in that area over Christmas whereby a number of drains were assessed privately.  I do not know the outcome of this work and whether it will integrate with the overall system but I want the Office of Public Works to finish that survey.  The area's drainage should be assessed on the basis of the ongoing official survey and there is no reason that survey should not finish to enable us evaluate the situation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and hope it will have an easy passage.  I also hope that the offers made to the people who cannot live in their houses will be processed quickly to ensure there will be cheques in the post for those who need them most urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  De bharr na báistí troime i 1994 agus i dtús 1995 bhí an-tubaist agus damáiste déanta sa tír seo agus go háirithe i nGaillimh.</P>
      <P>This time last year as public representatives, we visited the south Galway area looking at the serious damage which resulted from heavy rainfall and flooding in that area.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, visited the region.  I pay tribute to all three for their work and particularly to Deputy Coveney for being accessible to the many deputations who came to meet him.  I pay tribute to the public representatives in Galway West, particularly Deputy Padraic McCormack, who did trojan work there, and Senator Frank Fahey who worked with my colleague, Senator Brendan Daly, in introducing legislation in the Seanad and who kick started the whole question of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> It was disappointing &mdash; in the words of the Minister &mdash; that there was a deficit in the power to provide for the administration of the proposed relief scheme and that we had to wait 13 or 14 months to have this Bill before the Dáil.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, introduced legislation in May 1995 he had in mind the relief of localised flooding, not only in urban and residential areas but in any part of the country and especially in south Galway where there was heavy rainfall.  He did not accept the legislation introduced in the Seanad by Senator Brendan Daly. Despite many questions on the Adjournment, we understood everything was in order to enable localised flooding to be tackled and the other relief schemes to be brought into operation. That did not happen but I am pleased we are now discussing the Bill.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have said the ultimate solution is drainage.  This is the view put forward by the south Galway IFA and the south Galway drainage action group.  They realised that an environment impact assessment would have to be done and that engineers would have to survey the area.  Having done that, they understood that we could proceed to a draft drainage scheme and carry out the actual drainage.  They made the point that when one talks about helping householders, the farming community and the business community there are many different situations within those categories.  They highlighted, for example, that householders may or may not have insured their homes and that there may be isolated householders who were cut off and could not go about their daily business.</P>
    <P>The farming community mentioned the need for immediate assistance.  I pay tribute to the then Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who ensured the Air Corps was made available to assist the farming community in south Galway.  The two groups highlighted a number of problems in the business sector: the loss of earnings, the loss of and damage to business assets <Col N="272" /> and structural damage to businesses, many of which were not insured against such damage.  I appreciate it was difficult for any Minister to tackle all these issues simultaneously.</P>
    <P>The Minister has visited the area and has met numerous delegations but I would ask this evening, through the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, that he meet again with these delegations when the question of payments is being finalised as that will be a major issue in the future.  Deputy Noel Treacy and others raised the question of the maximum payment for people who have to relocate to a newly built house or purchase an older house.  We must be careful not to stick rigidly to one figure because of the different circumstances for householders in south Galway.  Part of the proposal is that the old house be demolished within six months of taking up occupation in one's new accommodation. This could be a problem for householders.  A grant of £2,000 is available to householders for demolition. The south Galway IFA and the south Galway action group have made the point that this may not be enough as there is the question not only of demolishing the house but taking away materials which could be an expensive undertaking.  I advise against adhering rigidly to figures for rehousing, demolition or the taking away of materials. These issues will have to be examined and I hope the Minister of State will meet again with the south Galway IFA and the south Galway action group when the proposals are being finalised. The Minister of State has come a long way and we welcome the fact that the Bill is before the House but there are a number of outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry of grants for the relocation of farmyards is welcome.  In his reply the Minister might say how many people are eligible.  My information is that over 100 people have applied for this grant but I do not believe it was envisaged that that number would be eligible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> All the delegations to the Minister raised the question of swallow holes.  In reply to questions in the House in November 1995, the Minister said the consultants stated that no action was to be taken to open swallow holes.  I accept what the consultants have said but many people are convinced that local work should be done on this.  I welcome the fact that consultants have been appointed and I hope they will work as quickly as possible on this issue.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the matter of the north Galway flooding, particularly Curragh West near Williamstown.  The people in that area, as mentioned by Deputy Connaughton, are disappointed at the delay in having the studies and surveys carried out.  The Minister of State informed us at the last meeting I attended that the Office of Public Works would have to carry out an environmental study and that the wildlife study could not commence until March or April.  In effect, this means the studies will not be completed until July or August.  I would impress on the Minister that any other study should not have to wait until the wildlife study is carried out.  For example, the cost benefit analysis could be done at the same time as the wildlife study.</P>
    <P>Severe flooding occurred in Curragh West at the end of 1994 and early 1995. I received the following letter from a householder living in the area whose parents were isolated because of the flooding:</P>
    <P>On a personal basis, my parents have been unable to attend the post office to collect their pensions.  My mother had to cancel an outpatients appointment at University College Hospital, Galway because she was unable to make the hazardous journey across waterlogged fields and boundary fencing.  Both of my parents have been unable to attend their doctor to collect medication which is vital to their health and well-being.  I am sure I need not preach to you <Col N="274" /> about the effect this hardship is having upon their lives as normal, independent old age citizens or, indeed, mine as their carer.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton mentioned, some work was done privately in the area during the Christmas period.  I hope it will fit in with whatever plan is eventually proposed following the completion of the studies being conducted of the environment and wildlife as well as the cost benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State informed us last year that nine areas were being given high priority where the process of designing flood relief works could commence immediately: Belclare, near Tuam, County Galway, where I am glad some work has been done; Carlow, Cappamore, Duleek, Dunmanway, Gort town, Kilkenny, Sixmilebridge and Williamstown. It is significant that three of these areas are in County Galway.</P>
    <P>These are not the only areas in the county in which there was serious flooding. It also happened in Ballinasloe when the water level rose on both the Suck and Deer Park rivers and the people living along side them were badly affected.  Although it was understood that Iarnród Éireann would do something about the problem in Ballinasloe, sadly, it now believes this would not benefit it, although it will co-operate with the local authority.  I hope the matter will be further investigated.  If the local authority is expected to undertake some of the work, it will require funding, for flood relief measures or road repairs.</P>
    <P>There was also flooding at the turlough in Glenamaddy, Portumna, Loughrea, Fohenagh, Moylough, Caltra and Castleblakeney.  I pay tribute in particular to the local engineer and local authority for their efforts to relieve it. The Irish Red Cross Society, the Garda Síochána, the Army and the Air Corps should also be thanked for their sterling efforts.  The Western Health Board also played its part through the provision of supplementary welfare allowances.  The campaign was spearheaded by the IFA <Col N="275" /> and the south Galway flood relief action group.  I hope their efforts will bear fruit following the completion of the various studies being conducted and the presentation of the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that, because of the vagaries of the weather, it is difficult to forecast where flooding will next occur.  This year there has been serious flooding in the south east, in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Wexford which caused grave hardship.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the European Union has been quick to help us and I hope that will always be the case. I understand that a survey is being conducted of the effects of flooding along the River Rhine.  I have been in contact with the MEP for my area, Mr. Mark Killilea, to see if the findings of that survey could be applied to Ireland.  There is an acknowledgement that the effects of flooding can be catastrophic for farmers, householders and businesses and we should be thankful that funding has been made available.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, for making the case in Europe.  In the past the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jim Higgins, made the case for south Galway.</P>
    <P>I had hoped we would not need this Bill, but the Minister of State has been advised that such legislation is necessary. I hope it will have a speedy passage to allow those badly in need of assistance &mdash; particularly householders and farmers who have had to be relocated and businesses which lost most of their assets &mdash; to benefit from its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is necessary to provide for the payment of compensation to householders who were forced to abandon their homes and had to be relocated because of serious flooding throughout the country, particularly in south Galway and parts of County Clare.  I hope it will have a speedy passage with whatever amendments are deemed appropriate.  It is noteworthy that the Deputies who <Col N="276" /> spoke represent County Galway, parts of which were devastated by flooding in early 1995.  The picture shown most often on television was that of the four houses at Glenbrack, outside Gort, which had to be abandoned and to which the families concerned will never return because of the extent of the structural damage and the fear that flooding will recur unless there is a solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>Several other rural farmhouses were also flooded and the families concerned are in a serious dilemma from the point of view of relocation.  In Ardrahan, the home of Tommy Fahey was flooded for a period of three months and because of the location of his farmhouse he must continue to live there in constant fear of further flooding.</P>
      <P>People who live outside the area may not be aware of the seriousness of the flooding in Galway.  Even some of my colleagues here do not have a proper concept of the mental anguish suffered by the people concerned during the peak flooding time.  One would need to have seen their faces to realise their suffering. Each time flooding occurred in that area in the past five or six years public representatives were seen on television on the back of trailers monitoring the position.  They also attended public meetings in south Galway, but the problem was not resolved.  Early last year I detected that people were getting fed up with this attitude from public representatives and at a public meeting in Gort I said I would stop attending meetings until we could do something to resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note the measures proposed by the Minister.  A total of £2 million has been made available, through the agricultural compensation scheme, to assist farmers who lost fodder and stock and for farmyard relocation. A sum of £4 million has been made available for the repair of county roads, £750,000 in humanitarian aid will be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society and a further £750,000 has been provided to carry out a study to determine how to resolve the problem in the <Col N="277" /> south Galway area, making a total of approximately £7 million.  This must be considered in conjunction with the aid distributed through the Irish Red Cross Society, whom I compliment for its great work in the south Galway area during the flooding.  Air Corps helicopters were also used and there was great community effort to bring food to isolated houses and livestock.  In total, up to £10 million will be spent on solving the problems arising from flooding throughout the country, particularly in the south Galway area.</P>
    <P>While compensation is welcome it is not at the top of people's agenda.  Their overriding concern is to have the problem resolved so that they will not have to live in fear of recurrent flooding.</P>
    <P>As an Opposition Deputy I was not in a position to do a great deal about flooding in previous years.  However, in 1995, when the worst flooding in living memory occurred in the Gort area, I was a backbencher in a Government party.  On 9 January 1995 the then Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Hogan, visited the Gort area.  His commitment to resolving the problem was quickly followed up by Deputy Jim Higgins in his term as Minister of State with responsibility for that office who, at short notice, frequently met people to allay their fears.  He spent many late nights in Gort and surrounding areas outlining the proposed Government action, some of which the Minister covered today.  He succeeded in opening a one-stop-shop in Gort to deal with the problem at first hand, a great consolation to people who did not know where to turn for assistance.  At the peak of the flooding in late January and early February of 1995 the people affected were very distressed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, spent much of his time dealing with the compensation package and introduced this legislation to allow for compensation to relocate householders.  He has spent much time and effort dealing with the problem.  All public bodies have done their part in this regard.  I compliment <Col N="278" /> the manager and engineering staff of Galway County Council who acted swiftly to make emergency provisions available for those affected.</P>
    <P>Since the flooding constituency boundaries have been redrawn and as a result Deputies Treacy and Connaughton will be candidates for the affected area in the next general election.  From the tone of the debate today Members will have observed that the area concerned has been mapped into east Galway for election purposes.  However, the fact that I will not represent that area following the next election has not deterred my determination to find a long-term solution to the problem. Many of those people elected me to this House.  I saw houses, schools, churches, businesses and a nursing home flooded and roads cut off.  Consequently, I know what people suffered.</P>
    <P>People outside the area might not be aware of the geographical layout of the region.  Three rivers rise in the Slieve Aughty Mountains, west of Loughrea, which flow into a valley around the Peterswell-Blackrock-Grannagh area.  In a normal year in terms of weather those rivers flow underground for approximately four or five miles and rise again at Lough Cutra or in the Gort river which flows underground until it emerges approximately one-and-a-half miles outside the town where it flows into Coole Lake.  In a normal year Coole Lake drains by underground passages into the sea at Kinvara.  Because of heavy rainfall and a combination of other factors, 1995 was not a normal year and, consequently, that area experienced the worst flooding in living memory.  The flood waters gathered in the Blackrock-Grannagh area of Gort and continued to rise until many houses were flooded and roads were cut off with water 15 or 16 feet deep.  This type of flooding does not subside after a few days' sunshine.  It remains there for five or six weeks, and up to three months in some cases, because the underground channels fill up and the water backs up from the overflow from Coole Lake which is overflowing simultaneously.  As <Col N="279" /> a result, flooding occurs in five or six districts in the south Galway area including Tarmon, near the Clare-Galway border, Coole Lake, which is constantly spreading out.  The houses in Glenbrack were flooded as a result of that.  There was also flooding in Gort town from the river at Kiltiernan, at Castletaylor and at Blackrock valley at the base of the Slieve Aughty mountains from where the water originates.  Those areas may be connected by underground channels or perhaps the pressure in one area is transferred to another. I do not know exactly what causes the flooding but when Coole Lake, for example, continues to expand and enters a valley through which its water has never run before, flooding will continue to occur in new areas.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Treacy and Kitt for their generous remarks about my efforts in this regard.  I took a passionate interest in this matter because I saw what the people endured at that time.  I was called to a meeting in one of the flooded areas, Kiltiernan, on a Sunday night.  Nine houses in the village of Carraghadoo, off the main road between Ardrahan and Kilcolgan were flooded. The national school was flooded also, the water was actually across the main road.  The flood waters in the village which was cut off in 1990, when the flood waters were at two feet, did not recede until 10 May, a period of three to four months.  On this occasion the flood waters were as high as the houses in the village.  The villagers had poor field access which, on the evening of the meeting, was actually cut off.</P>
    <P>The people who attended that meeting said that they were no longer prepared to tolerate these conditions.  They also said they would not wait for somebody else to solve their problem and that they would solve it themselves. Subsequently a small drainage scheme was initiated to relieve the Carraghadoo village, the flooding at the national school and on the main road.  Those people were driven by the frustration of seeing their houses and farms flooded. <Col N="280" /> They set out on what has now become the Kiltiernan-Ballindereen drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>Due to other factors, including the possibility of drained water affecting the village of Ballindereen three or four miles down stream water had to be drained a further mile and a half to the sea at Kiltiernan.  That caused consternation among environmentalists and others who did their best to prevent this drainage scheme proceeding &mdash; it took them approximately five weeks to obtain a road opening licence from Galway County Council to cross the road at Ballindereen.  The scheme has not been completed &mdash; the area from Keamsella to the national school at Kiltiernan has yet to be drained &mdash; but when it is it will be seen as a successful pilot scheme and proof that water can be drained a distance of five and a half miles, in this case from Kiltiernan to the sea at Killinarden, one and a half miles outside Ballindereen, without affecting the environment.</P>
    <P>People will complain about the effects of such schemes on bees, birds and bats which might be disturbed, but the rights of humans come before any consideration for bees, birds or bats.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been helpful rather than harmful to the environment because it has not affected the natural turloughs.  This was a relief drainage scheme which involved making a channel to take water over the natural turloughs to the sea without affecting the level of those natural turloughs.  Last spring nesting birds were driven out of those turloughs because they could not hatch in their natural environment. When this drainage scheme was completed not only did it relieve the Caheradoo village of flooding in 12 hours &mdash; it took three months to relieve it in 1995 &mdash; it also relieved the danger of flooding at the school, the nursing home and on several roads.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for the flooding in south Galway and other areas is the works carried out by county councils in the past ten to 15 years in raising roads. The county councils are doing their duty <Col N="281" /> in raising roads to allow traffic use them but that results in natural dams being formed which stops the water in south Galway following its natural course to the sea.  I will not be satisfied until there is a channel from Coole Lake to the sea at Kinvara.  It does not have to be a continuous channel but one going from a high area to a lower area, to another turlough and, eventually, to the sea. That is what has been done by the Kiltiernan-Ballindereen pilot scheme and I challenge environmentalists and others to examine that scheme, carried out by a few local farmers with the help of a co-operative, local contractor and bank manager as well as the co-operation of the Office of Public Works and the engineer, Mr. John Kelly.  A study of that scheme will show how the flooding problem can be alleviated in south Galway so that in future people will not have to be concerned about serious flooding.  Due to the good weather so far this year there has not been a recurrence of flooding in south Galway but I will not rest until something is done about the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I do not have much time tonight to dwell on its intricacies but I wish to make some comments on it.  A fundamental issue which has not been dealt with satisfactorily is the question of replacement housing.  I agree that was a step in the right direction but, as is the case with many schemes, a penny pinching attitude always seems to be adopted to such schemes.  There appears to be an unwillingness to go the final step and put a proper effective scheme in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How often do we as politicians come across schemes that are right in concept but wrong in execution because of small clause conditions?  As there is a claw-back on insurance, this scheme should be based on the full reinstatement value of the house rather than on nominal values where people are told they can get £40,000 for a three bedroom house or £42,000 for a four bedroom house.  If a person has a £60,000 <Col N="282" /> house, they should get back that amount less the claw-back from the insurance company.  Given the small number involved, it is not good enough to give half compensation to people who have put a lifetime of work into their houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on introducing the Bill and the Minister for accepting it.  I would like to see less confrontational and more consensus politics in the House.  There is no more important issue on which there should be consensus than law and order which is of paramount concern to everyone.  The main concern of people is not unemployment &mdash; for a country of our size we have the best social welfare system in the world &mdash; but the escalation in the level of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies on this side of the House, I totally reject Fianna Fáil's hypocritical contention that the present unacceptable level of crime is somehow the fault of the Minister for Justice.  Like cancer which has a long incubation period, crime has been a growing problem for many years.  Less than two years ago the then number one criminal, Martin Cahill, was gunned down on the streets of Dublin by the most ruthless gang of terrorists in Europe, the IRA, yet sweet Fanny Adams was done about it.  Some of the howls of indignation from the benches opposite are totally over the top.  Political parties play the political game and they avail of any temporary problem to cast aspersions on the Minister of the day.  They are aided and abetted in this by the gods in the media, the so-called feature writers who sometimes are merely an extension of public house gossips.  I am not referring to John <Col N="283" /> Drennan in the Press Gallery; rather I am referring to some of the more seasoned gods in the media.</P>
    <P>My views on law and order are well known.  I believe I am known in the House as &ldquo;hang them and flog them&rdquo; and to the more intellectual Members I am too extreme while to some of the sneering media I am further right than Genghis Khan.  However, I know the thinking of the people on the street and they want protection, particularly for the youth.  It is said that youth comes at the wrong time in a person's life; it is a troublesome time for young people who are faced with many decisions.  The Minister said she would introduce legislation on juveniles, fraud and crime. Does anyone really believe that these measures will eliminate drugs and drug misuse?  They will not because they are not draconian enough.</P>
    <P>If we want to stamp out the awful scourge of drugs we need draconian and radical measures, not commissions or inquiries.  We also need to change the system which pertains in the courts and introduce punitive measures along the lines of penitential systems.  Last week a young man who was shot and seriously injured in Dublin had 33 convictions.  It is a terrible indictment of the system that he was allowed out on the streets. He and many others like him belong to the criminal class.  He is a hardened criminal and should not have been let out on the streets.  Repeat offenders should be put away, in some cases forever. It is a nonsense for a judge to sentence a person to six years in prison when he will be released after two years.</P>
    <P>Serious measures must be taken against drug pushers.  We should look to the Middle East where successful deterrents have been imposed, one of which is to shoot professional drug barons. Regrettable though they may be, such measures must be introduced if succeeding generations of young children are to be saved from the awful scourge of drug pushers.</P>

      <P>The several recent high profile and brutal murders have shocked and appalled everyone. However, it must be remembered that many crimes are committed on a daily and nightly basis in every city, town and village.  These include muggings, break-ins, robberies, burglaries and beatings and involve houses, shops, public houses, cars and property.  Very often the criminals use knives, syringes and guns.  The media probably regard this as small scale crime which is not necessarily newsworthy.  Nevertheless many people now experience real fear about crime.  I am referring in particular to vulnerable people, such as the elderly, women who live alone and wives whose husbands travel as part of their work.</P>
      <P>Much of this crime is drugs related and is now estimated to be responsible for up to 80 per cent of all indictable offences.  Drug barons are perceived to be beyond the scope of the law.  Society as we have known it is under threat, and this is happening right under our noses. The threat is the drugs crisis.  The Government, and to some extent the Oireachtas as a whole, is seen to be complacent.</P>
      <P>Some people, however, accuse politicians of being hysterical in their response.  We are ridiculed for seeming to promote a &ldquo;hang 'em high&rdquo; or &ldquo;lock 'em up and throw away the key&rdquo; policy. Such people are out of touch with reality.  They seem more concerned with the rights of the criminal than with the rights of the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly all my neighbours have been robbed in recent times.  Several of them were confronted with guns or knives. One neighbour, whom I know very well, a young mother, was beaten black and blue in her home two weeks ago for £10. Another neighbour ended up in Beaumont Hospital for the night having been stabbed in the head &mdash; that happened <Col N="285" /> about a week ago.  I can supply the names and addresses of these people if necessary.</P>
    <P>A report which makes frightening reading was presented by the Garda Síochána to the Oireachtas Committee on the Family in October last year.  It indicated that drugs have replaced terrorism as the number one threat to the security of the State, that arrests and prosecutions almost quadrupled between 1987 and 1994, that the Garda Síochána know of 11 drug related deaths in Dublin alone in 1995, that three fatal shootings are being linked to drug dealing and that Dublin has the worst heroin problem, the most affected areas being the inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.  Ecstasy is a fast growing problem in Cork with dealers there also supplying Limerick and Galway.  These are the findings of a Garda report so let no one accuse me of being hysterical in my response.  Criminals must be targeted by introducing rational and reasonable laws.</P>
    <P>What are the people's expectations of society and Government?  They are a roof over their heads, clothes on their back, food on the table, security and protection for their families.  The State must protect its citizens.</P>
    <P>This Bill is most welcome.  It deals with the supply side of the drugs problem. This legislation was promised last summer by the Minister for Justice in a blaze of publicity.  She promised to give the Garda Síochána, under supervision by the courts, the power to detain suspected drug traffickers for up to seven days with adequate safeguards in place. She promised to give Garda chief superintendents the power to issue search warrants in urgent drug related cases and she promised to give Customs officials the power to question persons whom they had arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil Bill, introduced by Deputy John O'Donoghue, attempts to deal with those promises and more besides.  It gives legislative effect to the <Col N="286" /> three objectives announced &mdash; the abolition of the cumbersome system of preliminary examination of indictable offences as at present carried out in the District Court and its replacement, for drug trafficking offences, with a fast track system which guarantees a trial within 90 days of arrest and the updating of the unsatisfactory temporary release scheme.  This would mean amending the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  These are reasonable measures. One must wonder why those objectives have not been brought forward in the form of a Bill before now.  I understand the Minister has agreed not to oppose the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>We must take into account the composition of the present Government to realise why there is paralysis when dealing with the criminal justice system generally. The Government is made up of three parties &mdash; Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left &mdash; and there is no agreed political philosophy on the issue of crime.  There is, therefore, no political will to deal with serious crime.  There are different philosophies within the Government and agreement cannot, therefore, be reached.  Legislation can be brought forward only if there is consensus among three very different parties. Unfortunately, crime is an issue where the consensus approach, the lowest common denominator of agreement, will not work.  We need radical measures to deal with this very real threat, the drugs crisis which is threatening the very fabric of our society.  There cannot be consensus and the general public, unfortunately, are left to cope with the situation as the Government muddle through from day to day.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public support for a tough response to drug barons in particular, the godfathers of drugs.  If that means the temporary suspension of their civil liberties, so be it.  Obviously a democratic society has to have adequate safeguards and anything Fianna Fáil has produced over the last year has incorporated that.  I can assure the Minister for Justice &mdash; I think she knows it but, <Col N="287" /> unfortunately, she cannot persuade her colleagues in Government &mdash; that there is widespread public support for tough decisive action, as demonstrated by MRBI public opinion polls.  When the Minister made the announcement last July MRBI conducted an opinion poll which showed that about 90 per cent of those polled agreed with the Minister's proposals incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of the reform of the bail laws, while not specifically dealt with under this legislation, is also an issue which is concentrating the public mind at present.  Again, the issue is being looked at calmly and rationally.  Nobody is being hysterical, it is strange that people have not been more vociferous until now in demanding action on crime. There are divisions in Government on the issue of the bail laws, although it must seem sensible to reasonable people to bring forward proposals to refuse bail if there is a probability that an accused person is likely to commit a crime while out on bail.  I have no doubt that, if that were put to the people in a referendum, it would be accepted.  The financial cost and the threat to civil liberties must be considered, but those issues can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a serious problem. There is huge public support for amending the law.  Recent public comment by a former judge and by other commentators in last Sunday's newspapers indicates that we are becoming a banana republic by not providing adequate prison places.  Obviously more prison accommodation will be required if we reform the law on bail.  When notable people suggest that we are becoming a banana republic because we cannot accommodate the prison population, we must ask serious questions.</P>
    <P>A ground swell from the grassroots in the community is demanding action on the drugs problem.  In spite of the pressures of modern living, we still have a very strong sense of community, very active voluntary organisations and a sense of justice and fair play.  Parents have woken up to what is happening in <Col N="288" /> their communities.  They see their children being exposed to drugs on the streets and to syringes on the pathways outside their doors.  We have been complacent because we were never confronted by anything like this before.  The Oireachtas and the Government will ignore this ground swell in public opinion at its peril.  It is not too late to do something about the drugs and crime problems.  We do not have to take the same route as other societies, in fact, we can learn from how they tackled this problem.</P>
    <P>This ground swell of public opinion is not being reflected in the media as of yet and I am not sure it has filtered through to this House, but it will be evident at the next election that parents want action against drugs as they are no longer prepared to put up with the risk to life and security.  I believe this issue will be the most important political force in the community.  I am sure many Deputies, particularly from Dublin, have attended public meetings on the drugs issue.  Deputy O'Donoghue and I attended a public meeting in the north inner city last July at which we witnessed anger which has not been experienced by the policy makers at this stage.</P>
    <P>This is an emergency and we have to confront the crisis which poses a threat to our society.  This is clam, reasonable and pragmatic legislation dealing with the drugs problem and I am happy the Government is not opposing its Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, on bringing this Bill before the House.  We live in an age where major break-throughs are announced daily.  Great strides have been made in health care, engineering, communications and computer technology but, unfortunately, the tremendous potential which such scientific advances promise for everyone is often not realised for a variety of reasons.  Some may attribute blame to our political institutions and structures, our education system and our inherited <Col N="289" /> system of social organisation and behaviour. Others argue that the individual must take a degree of responsibility to ensure the overall well being of society.</P>
      <P>The truth is to be found in understanding that many problems in society do not lend themselves to simple and rapid solutions.  One must deal with many aspects of a problem on a number of levels over an extended period.  This is certainly the case in dealing with drugs.  In spite of the wide range of difficulties that must be tackled in a modern society, those associated with substance abuse are particularly dangerous.</P>
      <P>When one has no personal or family experience of drug abuse it is almost impossible to gain an insight into the phenomenon.  The logical consideration of the problem reveals the absolute tragedy that lies in store for those who experiment with drugs.  Media focus on drugs is generally responsible and strives to highlight the disastrous consequences of drug abuse.  However, in spite of all of these factors, the extent of the problem in society is increasing rapidly &mdash; some would say running out of control.  The use of Ecstasy has added a new and extremely unwelcome dimension, with the loss of life becoming more common long before persons have reached the addictive stage.</P>
      <P>What are we to do?  I firmly believe that every step taken to deal with the problem must be well planned.  It is totally unaceptable to remain paralysed by the challenges posed by drug abuse.  It is becoming increasingly clear that a series of inter-linked policy changes will arrest the current downward spiral and bring about an improvement in the long-term.  Deputy O'Donoghue's proposed Bill is designed precisely for such a purpose.  In his Bill he has crafted a number of changes which will greatly improve the potential for an effective security response to the detection and the prosecution of drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part I makes provision for much needed extra scope and flexibility for the Garda Síochána in their management of cases during the early detention phase.  While reducing the likelihood <Col N="290" /> that a suspect may use the current loop-holes in the law to avoid vital questioning in the immediate post-arrest period the proposals are sensitive to the need to protect basic human rights.  In this regard I welcome the Deputy's sensitivity to those who are under 18 years.  It makes provision also for much needed improvements in the procurement of search warrants at the earliest possible time in the prosecution of a possible drug abuse case.  Once the Garda Síochána become reasonably certain that an offence has taken place, it is vital that the rapid pursuit of the likely offenders meets with the least possible level of official obstruction.  While it is necessary to maintain core legal protection to safeguard the basic rights of privacy of the law abiding citizen, equally, the potential for the criminal to abuse such provisions must be cut down to the absolute minimum.  Any reasonable assessment of section 3 of the Bill clearly shows that the proposals in this regard are certain to result in shifting the advantage in favour of the gardaíin their battle against drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refines our current legal provisions in the Customs and Excise Act.  Since the vast majority of illegal drugs are brought into this country, the Customs and Excise service provides a first line of defence against drugs.  Therefore, we must take every opportunity to strengthen these services both in terms of resources and supporting legal provisions.  In spite of our fervent desire to tackle the problem of drug abuse effectively and without compromise, it is vital to retain full respect for the rights of the individual.  The operating principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty must not be lost sight of in the pursuit of solving crime.  In particular, it is important that the proceedings after arrest be both fair and prompt.</P>
    <P>Part II of the proposed legislation addresses such needs in a comprehensive manner.  If adopted, I have no doubt that these provisions will help to maintain full respect for the rights of the accused while, at the same time, <Col N="291" /> enabling the legal system to vigorously pursue genunie abuse.  Because of the increasing level of drug related crime it is vital that the Government fully supports this Bill.  The fact that the overall performance of the current Administration, to date, has been totally inadequate may allow those of us in Opposition frequent opportunities to indulge in simple political point scoring.  There is little merit in adopting such a response to the Government's failures, however, since the needs of the vast majority of law abiding citizens are far more important.</P>
    <P>We have a grave responsibility to the victims of crime, many of whom strongly assert that nobody can have a real insight into the evil of personal assaults unless one becomes the victim of such behaviour.  It is very difficult to argue with such sentiments.  It goes without saying that we must make every effort to assist the victims of crime in a practical and effective way.  Legal improvements such as those proposed in the Bill are valuable since their application will lead to reduced levels of drug abuse and, consequently, a reduction in drug related crime.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Government's unfair criticism of this side of the House and of Deputy O'Donoghue in particular. The week before last, the Minister, Deputy Owen, used terms like &ldquo;he does not seem to understand&rdquo; in relation to matters we were pursuing on a Private Notice Question.  In fact, Deputy O'Donoghue has been very responsible, and all the legislation introduced either by the Government or by him, as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, has been widely welcomed in the community as a real and genuine attempt to deal with the problem.  We have supported the Government and have assisted it in a constructive and positive way.  The Minister for Justice is a very nice person but, unfortunately, she represents an Administration that has run away from its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Last year the Finance and General <Col N="292" /> Affairs Committee discussed the Estimates for the Office of Public Works. The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, was questioned by myself and other Members who were critical of the decision not to proceed with the building of Castlerea prison and the women's prison at Mountjoy.  On that occasion the Minister's response was that, because of the peace process, we would not need the additional space.  If ever there was a cop out by a Government in relation to its responsibilities this was it. It should have admitted at the time that it was cutting back because of financial problems.  It should not have tried to hoodwink people with that kind of response.  Last week the Minister told the House that things had changed and we got a high powered press conference announcing that the building of the Castlerea prison would proceed.  The Government's delay was because, of course, it had to do research.</P>
    <P>We never said we had all the answers. There are no easy solutions to these problems but we must all face up to our responsibilities.  The evidence is there for all to see.  When in Government we brought in legislation and agreed to build additional prison spaces.  That, however, is not the only answer because such problems have to be tackled on different fronts.  We cannot lock everybody up.</P>
    <P>Over 600 people were released from prison in Cork last year but what happened to them when they came out? What back-up services are being provided for them?  What hope have they in the community?  We have fallen down in these areas.  Unless we address these issues we will have more and more drug barons, more and more youngsters taking drugs and more and more people ending up in prison.</P>
    <P>In Cork last week a court application for the renewal of a licensed premises was refused by the Garda Síochána.  I welcomed that and so did the people in Cork.  They saw, perhaps for the first time, that a proper approach was being taken towards known drug offenders <Col N="293" /> and drug barons who were using a certain premises for their business.  Gardaí had the building under observation and saw a young boy of 16 being carried out of it and laid on the ground by the proprietor or one of his staff.  Tough decisions have to be taken.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I commend Deputy O'Donoghue for his excellent proposals and his hard work to enhance our criminal law.  While he might be excused for contenting himself with pointing out the failings of the Government in this area, he has instead shown great commitment to his brief by drafting a succession of Bills designed to improve the security and safety of citizens.  I sincerely hope the Minister, Deputy Owen, will generously adopt Deputy O'Donoghue's many excellent suggestions.</P>
    <P>Current crime levels are simply unacceptable and all sides of this House must clearly demonstrate a united determination to tackle wrongdoers in our communities.  Clear messages must go out from the Oireachtas.  Decent law abiding citizens must be given clear evidence of a new confidence that crime, particularly violent crime, will be successfully detected and decisively punished. Citizens deserve nothing less from the Legislature.  Those with criminal leanings must be left in no doubt that we are making every effort to remove all legal loop-holes which facilitate them in the pursuit of crime and the avoidance of justice. Furthermore, the State must make every resource available to put an end to such illicit activities.</P>

      <P>I find it incredible listening to some of the Fianna Fáil speakers talking about our serious crime problem as if it were something that sprang up over the past year.  They fail to recognise this has been festering for a great number of years.  It is the direct result of failed <Col N="294" /> Government policies and the neglect of many important issues which has been perpetrated by successive Governments. It is rich to hear their sudden concern about this issue.  There is no doubt that we are facing a crime crisis at the moment but it is something that has been inherited from previous Governments. This Government is now faced with tackling this issue when it is at crisis point.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak in this debate because, as a Dublin Deputy, I realise that the drugs and crime are critical problems.  The Garda Síochána estimates that 80 per cent of crime in Dublin is directly related to drugs but this is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
      <P>Over the last decade we have seen the welcome development of local groups actively participating in the management of their own areas.  Under the social housing programme, local authorities are mandated to involve tenants in the wider issues of estate management.  While there has been a slow start on that I look forward to estate management being further developed in future.  In addition, many community, women's and single issue groups have played a huge role in revitalising community life in some of our most economically deprived areas.  These positive developments are, however, being seriously undermined by the increase in drug related crime and by those who profit from it.</P>
      <P>I recently attended a meeting in my constituency at which the main item on the agenda was the level of intimidation local people were enduring at the hands of drug pushers.  I am pleased we are having this debate because the issue at stake is enormous.  I commend the Minister for not advocating the complete rejection of this Bill.  I welcome her announcement that the Government will soon publish the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill which will take precedence over this one.  Any meaningful response to the drugs problem must be multifaceted and, as it will transcend existing administrative arrangements, it must be initiated and pursued vigorously by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the measures advocated in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill were outlined <Col N="295" /> by the Minister when she announced her proposals last July.  The proposed seven day detention for drug traffickers and giving power to Garda superintendents to issue search warrants will be dealt with.  It would appear that a working agreement between the Garda and Customs and Excise officers has been reached.</P>
    <P>Concern about delay in bringing drug cases to trial is understandable.  The appointment of 15 new judges should go some way towards solving that problem as will the Minister's announcement that the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the purpose of which is to limit the amount of time spent by gardaí in court, will be brought to Government within two months.  Much Garda time is wasted hanging around courtrooms waiting for cases to be called and the Bill will result in them having extra time to engage in more productive duties.</P>
    <P>The media and Opposition have enjoyed talking-up a crime crisis.  While there has been considerable exaggeration, the public are living in fear.  In urban areas this fear is not necessarily related to the number of murders but the prevalence of petty crime, such as muggings, car break-ins, bag snatching and burglary.  The majority of us will not have known a murder victim but we all know someone who has been affected by crime.  In Dublin much of the crime is heroin related.  Try as we might we will not succeed in controlling it by introducing criminal justice measures alone.  It is important to remember that the supply of hard drugs is cyclical.  If those controlling the current drugs supply were removed, others would take their place. Drugs damage young people's lives and our response must be a broad one touching on health, education and policing issues rather than an isolated criminal justice one.  While it may be difficult to determine an appropriate crossdepartmental response we must do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement in the budget of further increases in funds for schools in disadvantaged areas.  It is a <Col N="296" /> sincere effort to tackle educational disadvantage which leads to social exclusion where the drugs culture thrives so easily.  Young people who find it difficult to foresee a future for themselves are easy targets for the purveyors of death.  Policy in the education field should concentrate not only on making teenagers aware of the dangers of taking drugs but on self-development and self-esteem.</P>
    <P>It is vital to expand existing treatment facilities.  The Eastern Health Board has made some progress in this area by seting up satellite clinics.  Progress is far too slow and there are long waiting lists for all treatment centres.  The Minister's commitment to create a drug free unit in Mountjoy Prison is welcome in light of the visiting committee's recent report.  On the face of it, it appears ludicrous that a drug free unit should be established in a prison but the problem is so bad there that such a facility is needed.  The provision of extra prison spaces is welcome.</P>
    <P>We have made a start on developing a cohesive response to the crime problem but much remains to be done. While I understand the concern of rural Deputies about the recent horrific incidents in rural communities, the figures published in one of the weekend newspapers indicate that the crime problem remains fundamentally an urban one.  In particular, it is Dublin based and inextricably linked with drugs.  If we are serious about solving the problem, we must deal with most issues in tandem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and am pleased the Minister has accepted the Bill in principle.  The Government is committed to bringing forward legislation and some of the points raised in this useful legislation, for which I commend Deputy O'Donoghue, will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers dealt with the need to enshrine in legislation matters contained in the Bill.  In the time afforded to me I will deal with the issue of bail which is fundamentally linked to the <Col N="297" /> drugs problem.  There has been much debate, conducted in a less than satisfactory manner in the media, on changing the laws relating to bail.  We have heard sound byte politics from far too many spokespersons.  I was appalled recently to hear a representative of a rural organisation that has been to the fore in putting forward proposals to combat the escalation of rural crime state that it was time to change the bail laws; they were unsatisfactory because convicted criminals were roaming the countryside while on bail.  Much of the debate has been misunderstood.  We have not focused sufficiently on the nature of our law relating to bail and why we have such a bail regime.</P>
    <P>No person who has been recently convicted of an offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment has been released on bail.  Bail is a form of remand until the trial takes place.  It is a fundamental right rather than a privilege.  Against the background of daily calls for immediate change it must be remembered that bail is a fundamental constitutional right, not something that may be granted, withdrawn or revoked at the whim of a Garda officer in a District or Circuit Court.  It goes to the heart of our criminal justice system and represents a basic pillar of justice &mdash; the right of innocence until proven guilty by a court of law.</P>
    <P>If you start from that premise a number of points must be recognised and accepted in the Ireland of 1996 for which to legislate.  It must be recognised and considered unsatisfactory that we have the most liberal bail regime in western Europe and that approximately 4,500 crimes per year can be committed by those released on bail pending trial. Both issues weaken confidence in the criminal justice system.  While it is appropriate and necessary to change our bail laws, it would be absurd for the State not to restrict the freedom of dangerous persons who put life and property at risk.</P>
    <P>The courts should have a measure of discretion in the matter of bail.  To enable such discretion it appears a constitutional referendum is necessary. <Col N="298" /> People in certain quarters are taking for granted the result of such a referendum, but they should not do so.  The Government should decide on the legislation consequent on a referendum gaining the approval of the people.  Changes to our bail laws must be clearly and narrowly defined.  Perhaps consideration should be given to dealing with cases where an accused is caught red-handed and is deemed likely to strike again before trial and where an accused might avail of the opportunity to dispose of the proceeds of crime if free to do so.  Perhaps where an accused jumped bail before consideration should also be given to refusing an application for bail on a second occasion.</P>
    <P>Changes in our bail laws must not interfere with the fundamental liberties of the individual.  In this regard I have two major reservations, and I ask that they be clearly addressed by Government before changes in the law are even contemplated.  The first relates to delays.  The unacceptable delays in our courts are contrary to a reasonable criminal justice system.  The need to proceed speedily to trial is essential. Current delays between the time of arrest and charge and the actual trial are totally unacceptable.  They militate against an efficient and fair administration of justice.  Delays very from urban areas to provincial centres, ranging from six months to two years.  Such delays are unacceptable.  They must be minimised by the introduction of acceptable timeframes having regard to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister for Justice to proceed with the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Bill and the appointment of extra judges will go some way towards remedying the problem, but it is important that the Garda Síochána plays a role in ensuring there is no delay in the collating of documents that ultimately form the book of evidence served on the accused.  The preparation of witnesses for an early and speedy trial is essential.  Changes in our bail laws that are not pre-addressed in <Col N="299" /> terms of delays would be fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>My second reservation relates to the lack of a special remand centre.  If bail is to be revoked regularly a specific place of remand would be necessary. The absence of such a facility would make the revocation of bail unworkable. The present shortage of prison spaces is well documented.  Restrictions on bail would result in people being detained before trial, and the need for a remand centre has not been considered. Such a centre will have to be established as a separate arm of the prison system. It is unjust to treat the innocent &mdash; people are innocent of a crime for which they are charged until they are tried for the crime &mdash; in the same manner and circumstances as those already convicted for offences and those detained in prison for serious offences.  That matter has not been addressed.  Comprehensive assurances are absolutely essential in the interest of natural justice.</P>
    <P>How many people are likely to be detained before trial?  What will that represent in terms of cost to the State? The wrangle over prison spaces has given rise to circumstances where 25 prisoners will be detained in Castlerea. Over a period of 18 months an extra 278 prison spaces are to be provided.  That is not a huge number, bearing in mind the comments of the Garda and prison officers associations that 1,000 extra prison spaces are needed to deal adequately with early release, temporary release and what has become known as the revolving door system within our prisons.</P>
    <P>In the context of extra prison spaces what will happen the person who is remanded in custody having been refused bail?  The promised change in our bail laws should take place alongside what I hope will be fundamental, root and branch reform of our prison system.  As constituted and operated at present, prisons are no more than recycling centres where people are in and out as though they are on a conveyor belt.  We must consider whether <Col N="300" /> prisons will be places of punishment. Will there be an independent prison inspectorate, which I have sought for some time?  Will the concept of prison visiting committees be changed?  Will there be a special parole board?  All these issues must be addressed by the Minister for Justice as a matter of urgency.  Unfortunately they have not been considered adequately in the context of the sound byte, knee-jerk reaction we hear on the news, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  The politics of the sound byte has done little to make a positive contribution to our penal justice system.</P>
    <P>The position in Britain and the United States is well known.  In many inner cities in the United States one adult male in four spends time in prison. Is that the type of society we want, where we pick people off the streets in an attempt to contain the response to crime rather than find the solution to our crime problems?  The treatment, education and welfare of our prisoners while detained are also in need of radical reform.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the issue of bail appears to be high on the Government agenda, but I counsel caution in so far as the principle of innocent until proven guilty is a basis on which our criminal justice system is founded.  In certain cases the operation of bail is no longer in the best interests of society.  However if changes are to be made to people's fundamental rights they must be done only in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this Bill is being accepted.  I look forward to the response of the Minister for Justice by way of her own legislation which, I understand, will be published in a matter of weeks.  I hope the Government will take on board some of the very laudable suggestions and proposals put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue.  Having been in this House for nine years, I believe that if we are to formulate the best legislation we must take on board proposals other than from the Government side. That would be a positive and healthy practice and would be an indication that <Col N="301" /> legislators make a contribution to the enactment of legislation rather than simply act as a rubber stamp for Government proposals and legislation, which has been the case for too long.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy O'Donoghue for his work not only in this area but in a wide range of areas in recent months.  He has shown there is a constructive side to opposition.  He has not behaved himself on all occasions, but he has been prepared to play the political card when he felt it necessary.  This Bill is important and I look forward to discussing it in detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, good suggestions come from all sides of the House. It is important to take a constructive approach to this matter.  I agree with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, that we should seek as broad a consensus as possible when introducing measures to deal with the current crime and drugs problem and that we should avoid futile divisiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My thoughts are with the many families who have been through horrific times.  We must always try to keep the needs and the plight of victims in our thoughts.  However, it is clear there has been an institutionalised paralysis in the justice system, the prison system, the courts and in our approach to juvenile crime.  I spent most of the day visiting secure units in Trinity House which keep 30 young people between the ages of 12 and 16.  It is appalling that we have neglected to address the problem of juvenile crime.  I welcome the steps which the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, is taking to introduce juvenile justice legislation. This is important because crime begins at a young age.  Crime statistics show that it is mostly men aged about 25 who commit crimes.  An article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> showed that the statistics decrease for people over 35.  It is critical that we do something at <Col N="302" /> an early stage.  We must have proper juvenile justice legislation.</P>
    <P>There are problems and, perhaps, constitutional difficulties with this Bill as proposed.  It is important that we meet our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  If we want to extend periods of detention, practical safeguards must be built in.  I look forward to seeing the balance between those rights in the Government's Bill when it is published.  It is important to have a reasoned and balanced debate in the House on this issue given the fundamental freedoms and human rights involved.  There may be scope for looking at our bail laws.  As Deputy Flanagan said, we must get the balance right.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill and the Government's legislation is only part of what is needed to tackle the drugs and crime problems.  Some 40 per cent of the prison population at any one time has a background of drug abuse.  Recent figures show that the number of cases of HIV infection detected in this county is almost 1,600 and that many people contracted the virus through intravenous drug abuse.  We must reduce the supply and demand of drugs.  It is an international and a national problem which must be tackled on a multi-agency basis. Departments and agencies must play their part in seeking a solution through close co-operation and co-ordination of policies and strategies.  This has not happened in recent years.  Agencies, whether the Garda, Customs and Excise, health boards or local communities must work together.  The Merchants Quay project, for example, offers counselling, care, respite and training to people at all stages of the drug using cycle, including stabilising, detoxification and drug free programmes.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on a protocol for the prescribing of methadone which the National AIDS Strategy Committee published three years ago raises important issues in tackling crime. Progress must be made in implementing the recommendations in that report.  We must offer treatment and alternatives to <Col N="303" /> heroin addicts.  Muggings have increased in Dublin because drug addicts need to get money to feed their habit.  Can the health boards deliver the type of community care clinic services, outreach networks and support to GPs which are necessary to implement the types of programmes we need?  At present there is a gridlock which prevents action and this must be broken.  Community clinics must be established despite the difficulties. GPs must get support so that more of them can offer treatment to drug addicts.  It is not good enough that there is such a small number of GPs treating heroin addicts.  This needs political will and a practical support.  This is an important step towards tackling the problems which Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill seeks to address.  We must learn from other countries which do research in this area.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Health said earlier this year, drug addicts are difficult people.  They wreck their own lives and their families and they create havoc, yet in a civilised society appropriate care must be available to them to meet their needs.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice on her co-ordinated plan and I look forward to the Bill she will shortly present in the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I pay tribute to Deputy O'Donoghue for introducing this Bill.  Over the past number of months he has brought many Bills to the House.  This highlights the neglect by the Department of Justice in dealing with crime, drugs and other problems. Deputy O'Donoghue is regarded by the public as the Minister for Justice on the Opposition benches, without the salary or the backup services enjoyed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan who <Col N="304" /> said it is good that Deputies highlight serious problems, particularly in relation to drugs.  The drugs problem has been out of control in Dublin for many years, but it has now spread to towns and villages throughout the country. Drug-related crime has been identified as being responsible for 80 per cent of all indictable offences.  In the first six months of 1995 gardaí made 2,385 drug seizures.  This represents a 10 per cent increase on the same period in 1994.  Many of the largest drug seizures took place at Rosslare Harbour.  I pay tribute to the Customs and Excise and to the Garda in Wexford for their efforts in this regard.  However, these seizures are only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that Ireland is a major location for drug traffickers who want to sell drugs on mainland Europe.  The Minister must take action in this regard. It is practically impossible for a country with thousands of miles of coastline to stop drugs coming in on ships.  It is important to seek adequate EU funding. We have heard a lot about the Taoiseach having talks with Mr. John Major and other EU partners in Brussels to secure funds for this area.  I understand the Minister for Justice was also involved.  We must press for as much EU funding as possible to prevent illegal drug trafficking along our coastline.</P>
    <P>The powers available to the Garda to deal with drug traffickers are wholly inadequate.  Despite repeated announcements by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, of proposals to extend those powers, nothing has happened. The delay in introducing worthwhile legislation to deal with drug pushers has provided a financial killing for drug barons.  Happy in the knowledge that our inadequate laws make them practically untouchable, they continue to make millions of pounds while causing severe damage to young people's physical and mental health and, in some cases, death.</P>
    <P>I, and I am sure, other Members meet constituents who express concern <Col N="305" /> about the effects of drugs on their children. Drugs seem to be freely available on our streets, in disco halls and in public places where they are blatantly pushed and peddled to young people and action is not taken against the pushers. Parents call for drastic measures to deal with drug barons and pushers who ply their trade so freely throughout the country.  The public lack confidence in a system which allows known drug barons to display their ill-gotten gains without fear of the law.</P>
    <P>It baffles me that in practically every town and village the public and the media openly name people involved in drug racketeering, but action cannot be taken against them.  If a person who is working signs on for social welfare benefit and is caught, the social welfare officer will be on his back.  The Revenue Commissioners put pressure on people within weeks of setting up a small business to declare their interests.  Yet many drug barons and pushers claim social welfare benefit, live in up-market houses and may own two or three houses which they rent out, but no action is taken against them.  Social welfare officers and the Revenue Commissioners could play a greater role in pressuring people they suspect are making money from illegal operations. The Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance should take a deeper interest in this area.  People in Wexford can name drug pushers to me but it appears the gardaí cannot touch them.  The problems posed by pushers should be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a distinct lack of co-ordination and co-operation between the Garda and Customs and Excise officials in tackling the drugs problem. The work should be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has a major role to play in highlighting problems associated with drugs.  I was pleased to hear today that the Southern Health Board intends to introduce a major package to highlight and to deal with the drugs problem.  Members and <Col N="306" /> officials of health boards are not sufficiently aware of and do not adequately highlight the dangers posed to young people by drug abuse.  The Minister for Health must put pressure on health boards and health agencies to become more aware and to deal more comprehensively with drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has a significant role to play in highlighting problems associated with drugs.  The dangers posed to our young people by the widespread use of illegal drugs requires the Department to consider how best, young people from the time they set foot in primary school, can be educated about the dangers posed by drug abuse.  There is no point in highlighting them at second or third level. The Minister for Education in conjunction with the three powerful teachers unions, who have an effective voice, should negotiate the introduction to schools of a programme designed to deglamourise the drugs scene and which would highlight the dangers posed by drug abuse and the serious effect it may have on young people's lives during their school years and later.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's appropriate Bill calls for distinct co-operation and co-ordination between Government agencies to tackle the drugs problem.  It will not simply disappear.  I do not attribute all the blame to the Minister or any other individual.  It is a wider issue that must be dealt with by the public and concerned people in the community. Teachers, the clergy, youth organisations, youth clubs and those involved in GAA, soccer and rugby clubs who play a prominent role in doing much good for young people must pull together to deal with this problem by highlighting the dangers associated with drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister must without further delay introduce the legislation she promised last July.  In the eight months since then she has had adequate time to introduce a Bill to deal with the drugs problem.  As she did not, it is appropriate that the Opposition spokesperson should do so.  Deputy O'Donoghue has <Col N="307" /> given us an opportunity to raise our fears and concerns and highlight problems relating to drug abuse.  We are not highlighting those problems for the sake of highlighting them.  It is important to get across the message to our young people that involvement in drugs is dangerous.</P>
    <P>Drug barons, pushers and dealers who supply young people with drugs are directly responsible for murder.  In the past year many young people have died from overdoses of ecstasy.  The drug barons and pushers are directly responsible. When charged before our courts for drug offences, they should be charged with murder when it is proved they have sold drugs that caused death and if convicted, they should be given life sentences.  Many of my constituents who have faced the ordeal of having their children abuse drugs call for the death penalty for drug pushers, and who can blame them.  Young people have died, or have been physically and mentally damaged by drug abuse while the drug barons and pushers get off scotfree. That is not good enough.  There is too much thought and concern for the rights of the criminal here and very little for the rights of the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will incorporate many of the fine provisions of this Bill in hers and have them implemented without further delay.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say she will introduce her Bill shortly.  Within any Government Department certain issues must receive priority.  Surely the difficulties presented by drugs, addicts and drug-related issues must be at the top of any Government agenda.</P>
    <P>I support the general thrust of this Bill and hope Deputy O'Donoghue will have prompted the Minister to introduce her Bill without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue on having allowed me some time to make a few comments on his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to many Members discuss this issue, very much at the forefront of the public mind at present, <Col N="308" /> bearing in mind events over recent weeks, when politicians were castigated for not having appeared on a television programme, it is interesting to note that while this debate takes place, no member of the media is present.  Tomorrow I will be interested to see how much coverage this debate receives in the press, whether journalists will act responsibly and convey to the electorate the viewpoints and active involvement of Members in their efforts to combat the very serious crime levels obtaining in a responsible, effective manner.  Their absence this evening would seem to bear out their lack of interest.</P>
    <P>As most Members will know, I have a specific interest in the drugs problem. I compliment Deputy O'Donoghue on having obtained the appropriate advice to help him formulate this Bill within a short time.</P>
    <P>While attention is being focused on the need for new legislative measures, even to the extent of constitutional change, while everybody calls for action, we can lose sight of a very important matter which has concerned me much in recent weeks.  Despite long delays in bringing people charged by the Garda before our courts, despite all the shortcomings in our bail laws, the lack of resources available to the Garda, from next week, a significant number of heroin dealers will appear before our courts &mdash; one a drugs baron, the remainder in the middle range of activity <i>vis-à-vis</i> heroin.  Despite all these factors, very few, a handful only, have appeared before our courts over the past ten years.  In ensuing months I predict that up to a dozen &mdash; within my constituency I predict up to six &mdash; such individuals will appear before our courts, some having already pleaded guilty and facing trial.  While not wanting to predict the outcome of such hearings, on the basis of the relevant evidence, the likelihood is they will be found guilty.</P>
    <P>I was a Member of this House in 1984 when the Misuse of Drugs Bill was passed.  It included a provision rarely referred to, imprisonment for life, in the case of drug dealers found guilty.  Yet <Col N="309" /> no drug dealer in this State has been imprisoned for life.  Practically all Members of the House &mdash; repeated by the media and others &mdash; contend that 80 per cent of violent crime in our cities is drug-related, huge State resources are directed at detecting these people, thousands of young addicts are seeking treatment and many not obtaining it and many other young people dying but no drug dealer has yet been imprisoned for life.  We already have the requisite power available to us, to be administered by our courts and Judiciary, to deal with these people when eventually caught.</P>
    <P>In the past I witnessed heroin dealers eventually appearing before the courts &mdash; not addicts but dealers in heroin who manipulate young people, derive profits therefrom, directly responsible for the crime wave and horrors about which so many people are fearful &mdash; receiving sentences less than half those handed down in the case of people caught in possession of cannabis.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to influence the Judiciary in any way &mdash; I am not naming people specifically so I hope I am not out of order in my comments &mdash; but, if such people are not subjected to the full rigours of the law, a huge opportunity will have been missed.  I would go so far as to say it will send out a message that, despite all the media hype and the Government contending this is its highest priority, people when caught, can get away with the crime with which they are charged.</P>
    <P>I have sufficient time to put across one simple message only which is that it will be absolutely disastrous, in our fight against crime, the drugs menace and barons here, if those who appear before our courts in coming months and plead guilty to the distribution of heroin in this city get off with light sentences.  In that event we can forget about our bail laws, about this fine Bill, about the Minister's package and, instead, throw our hats at it.  Despite the absence of the media, those charged with informing the electorate of what is being debated here, I hope the Judiciary on whom that <Col N="310" /> onerous responsibility will rest in coming months will pay attention to what is said here.  When members of the Judiciary are faced with a heroin dealer who has been found guilty, I hope they will connect that heroin dealer with the huge, dreadful, horrific drug scene that is gripping the country, particularly Dublin, and destroying so many young lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are times in this House when one is anxious to speak but having listened to Deputy Gregory I feel a bit of a cad for interrupting him. I was very interested in his speech and I hope he continues it on some other occasion because I agreed with every single word.</P>
      <P>Newspaper reports, which appear to be true, are suggesting that the principals of a Dublin PR agency paid £1 million in penalties, arrears and interest to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of payments received by them through a Panamanian shipping company and banked by them overseas.  These newspaper reports have naturally caused a great deal of public concern.  Many people want to know exactly why there appears to be a discretion by means of which some taxpayers are personally held up to public judgment and obloquy in respect of their tax default while others are afforded the privacy of the veil of incorporation in respect of similar acts of tax default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain in detail to the public whether the Revenue Commissioners exercised discretion in failing to name the principals involved, whether there are any guidelines by reference to which such discretionary decisions are made and whether the Minister can give an assurance to this House that in similar circumstances a similar decision will not be made again <Col N="311" /> in the future.  It would appear that there must have been a substantial personal liability to taxation involved in the circumstances published in the newspaper. Surely, it cannot have been a question of liability to corporation tax alone.  If personal liabilities existed at the back of or in conjunction with the Panamanian company's tax liability, the public are entitled to know on what basis corporate rather than personal penalties were imposed.</P>
    <P>We operate in a system where there is virtually complete Revenue confidentiality and, therefore, I appreciate that the exact circumstances of the tax liability and penalties are unlikely to be revealed to this House and I am not asking that they should.  However, we know that someone, somewhere, with inside knowledge was so angered by the circumstances that he or she blew the whistle.  Without engaging in moral condemnation of any of the people involved, because we do not know the full facts, I believe the Government has a duty to tell the ordinary, compliant taxpayer just how the decision to publish the penalties under an obscure corporate name was arrived at and whether, in similar circumstances, a similar decision will be made in the future.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises is the effect of the utterly arbitrary and indefensible tax amnesty legislation of 1993. If the transactions which are the subject matter of this debate had been the subject of the tax amnesty, we would never have heard of the transaction and the amount recovered by the Revenue Commissioners would have been less than £100,000, that is, a 90 per cent gain to the taxpayers.  Finally, the ordinary tax inspectorate would have been kept in the dark about the <i>modus operandi</i> of the tax default.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this issue is not to make holier than thou pronouncements about the Revenue activities of others but to uphold the rights and dignity of ordinary compliant taxpayers and to be assured that tax compliance is <Col N="312" /> not a virtue confined to the weak, the unimaginative or those who lack appropriate connections.  The ordinary men and women who pay their taxes, pay heavy interest, borrow and mortgage their homes to comply with their Revenue obligations and have to produce tax compliance certificates simply to survive in the business world find it impossible to understand how those who break every rule can not only avoid any serious consequences in some cases but actually avoid the public embarrassment of hard questions being asked about them.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly raised with the appropriate authorities the failure of the State to prosecute or disqualify from holding company office the small handful of persons identified in the Hamilton report as having been responsible for the largest tax fraud ever perpetrated on the Irish Exchequer.  The relevant amount was £10 million and involved were what Mr. Justice Hamilton termed the &ldquo;top management&rdquo; of the Goodman companies.  To date I have had no adequate explanation as to why real accountability in the form of civil and criminal responsibility was not established on that occasion.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions juries have refused to convict people of serious offences because they regard the real perpetrators and real beneficiaries of certain tax offences and other frauds as going unpunished.  I ask the Minister to indicate to the House whether there was a discretion involved in the decision to fail to mention the persons involved as opposed to the company, whether there are any guidelines by reference to which such discretionary decisions are made and whether the Minister can give this House and compliant taxpayers an assurance that a similar decision will not be made in similar circumstances in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell has raised a serious matter.  I regret that the Minister for Finance cannot be here, he has asked me to deal with the question on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are obliged under the provisions of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1983, to compile a list of the names and addresses and the occupations or descriptions of certain tax defaulters for inclusion in their annual report to the Minister for Finance. The section also provides for the exclusion from the requirement for publication of two categories of tax defaulter; namely, where the taxpayer has made a complete voluntary disclosure of previously undisclosed liabilities, and where the settlement inclusive of tax, interest and penalties does not exceed £10,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the legislation allows for non-publication in a case where a taxpayer pays in full the fine or other penalties provided for under the Tax Acts &mdash; as opposed to the mitigated sum which the Revenue has power to agree, depending on various factors such as the level of co-operation and the gravity of the offence.</P>
      <P>Section 23 specifically provides that the name and other details to be published are to be those of the person, whether an individual or a company, upon whom a fine or penalty was imposed by a court, or with whom the Revenue Commissioners made a compromise settlement inclusive of a mitigated penalty.  The name to be published, therefore, is the name of the person who is liable for the tax under any of the provisions of the Tax Acts.  There is no provision in law for the publication of the name of any other person in lieu of, or in substitution for, the person who was taxable in respect of these liabilities under the Tax Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides, as I said earlier, that the name to be published is the name of the person upon whom a fine or penalty has been imposed by the <Col N="314" /> courts or with whom the Revenue Commissioners have made a compromise settlement inclusive of a mitigated penalty. In circumstances where a limited company has not declared its full liabilities for tax, that company is regarded as the legal person which is accountable for the failure to do so.  Where a settlement has been reached with a company following a tax investigation, it is the company which is legally liable for the additional taxes, interest and penalties.</P>
    <P>Section 23 does not provide for the publication of the names of the directors or proprietary shareholders of companies which have themselves made tax settlements with the Revenue.  It may be noted in this context that, since section 23 was enacted, the list published in the annual report has included a significant number of companies whose directors or shareholders are, quite properly under the law, not identified.  Whether there would be a public benefit in revising these arrangements is something the Minister will consider but it is undoubtedly a complex issue.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, the amounts of tax, interest and penalties included in a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners will not be published separately. This only arises in circumstances which do not allow the liability to be defined with precision, or where there is a doubt as to the possible outcome if the Revenue view were to be appealed to the courts.  In such circumstances a global settlement deemed to be inclusive of tax, interest and penalties will be reached and published.  This is in accordance with section 23.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that, when compiling the list for publication, the commissioners carefully consider each case to ensure that the conditions for publication have been met.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot discuss the tax affairs of any particular person or company.  I might, however, make the general comment that the lists in the annual report show that the Revenue Commissioners have been successful in securing sizeable tax <Col N="315" /> settlements which come under section 23 and I commend them for their efforts in this regard.</P>

      <P>As the matters raised by Deputies Nealon and Martin are similar I suggest each Deputy make a statement to be followed by the Minister for Education who could then reply to both Deputies.  Deputies have ten minutes in total and the Minister for Education has ten minutes to reply.  The Deputies concerned have five minutes each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this important matter. As the Minister is aware a major blunder has now been revealed in the marking of the leaving certificate art examination last year.  This arose initially from the disappearance of all the work submitted by students for the craft option of the art examination and it has been grossly compounded in the meantime by the inexplicable failure of the system to detect what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure has obvious implications for the whole marking system of the Department of Education examinations and it has created major problems for students directly affected.  Of those 46 students, 14 came from the Ursuline College, Sligo.  The crafts component was allocated one-fourth of the marks in the art examination &mdash; 100 marks out of 400 marks &mdash; this was obviously of considerable significance to the students doing the art examination and one would assume also for those compiling the results.  Yet we had the extraordinary development of the entire craft work of 46 students going missing and, more extraordinary still, this not being detected for many months afterwards despite warnings and rechecks.  Were it not for the persistence of the Ursuline College, Sligo, students, teachers, parents &mdash; and one parent in particular &mdash;<Col N="316" /> the blunder might never have come to light.</P>
    <P>The craft work was sent by the Ursuline College to the examination centre in Athlone.  I presume the same happened so far as the other colleges were concerned.  Receipts for dispatch by registered post were obtained by the Ursuline College.  We know from official documentation that the craft work from Sligo arrived in Athlone.</P>
    <P>The next stage of this saga came with the announcement of the results of the leaving certificate examination.  We can imagine the shock and consternation among the students, teachers, parents and everyone concerned.  The principal of the Ursuline College, Sligo, an experienced and respected person in teaching and in examinations wrote to the Department of Education and warned that something had gone badly wrong.  The Department responded that she would have to await the official recheck.  All 14 Ursuline College, Sligo, students asked for the recheck, paid their money, got the rechecks and got the result &mdash; no change.  For all these 14 students there was no mark for one component of the examination and still nothing was discovered.</P>
    <P>Later when one persistent parent asked for a breakdown of the marks for the component parts the blunder emerged.  Finally, the Department informed the students of the college on 21 December that each student had been upgraded without the work being found.  This was too late and the damage has been done.  I have two specific examples of the upheaval this has caused for the students.  One student who failed to get a place in third level education directly because her craft option marks were missing is now repeating the leaving certificate. Another student is in a third level institution in Britain, an excellent college no doubt but not the college of her choice. I am sure the same has happened with many of the other 46 students.</P>
    <P>There are two major issues for the <Col N="317" /> Minister.  There must be an improvement in the examination marking system which will ensure that such a blunder can never be repeated.  The other question, which is of particular interest to me since the Ursuline College and most of the students are in my constituency, is what the Minister intends to do by way of compensation and making amends.  For some of the students and their parents there are serious financial implications.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary that despite the fact that the craft work was dispatched from Sligo and despite the fact that it arrived in Athlone &mdash; we have the official documentation &mdash; despite the warning from the principal that something had gone wrong, despite the checks asked for by 14 students, the blunder did not surface until one parent persisted and asked that the art examination marks be broken down by their component parts?  It is no surprise that the board of management of the Ursuline College, Sligo, in a statement issued after a meeting last night said it was annoyed at the unnecessary disappointment, frustration and stress caused to students, parents and the teacher as a result of what happened.  It was a very strange reaction.</P>

      <P>I, along with Deputy Nealon, raise this issue on the Adjournment to highlight the need for an immediate and full explanation as to how 46 students from 29 schools around the country received no credit for the craft work section of the leaving certificate art examination last year and how the rechecking system failed to uncover this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate examination is an extremely important event in the life of any young person.  Blunders such as <Col N="318" /> this should not happen.  Public confidence in the integrity of our examination system has been badly shaken. The Minister will have to take immediate steps to restore public confidence in the system.  She could start by giving the full facts to the House this evening.  She should publish the results of the interim internal review that has been carried out within the Department and also indicate what remedial action has been taken to date on the matter.  The Minister confirmed last Friday that an internal review had taken place and that remedial action had been taken &mdash; the results of both should be published.  The Minister should clarify when specifically she was made aware that this error had taken place.</P>
    <P>Rumour is rife in the educational world concerning this issue.  The Minister should use this occasion to clarify a number of points.  Why did it take so long for the parents and school involved to secure an admission from the Department that something drastic went wrong?  Why did the Department not take seriously the sincere protestations of a committed art teacher, a school principal and the parents involved in the first instance?  The principal wrote to the Department on 1 September 1995 asking for a review of the art results for all the students who took the craft work option.  The principal and the art teacher knew something was wrong. The Department refused this request and insisted that each pupil apply individually. It is extraordinary that the rechecking of the papers in question did not bring the error to light.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that on 24 January 1996 two departmental officials came to Sligo and told the parents the rechecking was carried out by competent and experienced examiners and that they placed a note on one student's file to the effect that the practicals were missing?  Apparently the officials went on to admit at this meeting that there was no follow up to that note.  On the face of it, this seems incredible, and one wonders why, if this did happen, the matter was not properly investigated at <Col N="319" /> that stage.  Were such notes put on the files of the other students whose papers were being rechecked?</P>
    <P>I am also aware that after the rechecking process was completed and a negative reply was sent to the parents, further correspondence was sent to the Department which, as Deputy Nealon pointed out, sought a breakdown of the component parts of the art examination results.  According to my information it remained unanswered for over a month in the Department and it took further action to eventually force a reply before Christmas.  It is my understanding that the particular communication with the parents suggested the results had been calculated and that the practical section had not been taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify these points and give a full account of what actually happened.  She should take the opportunity to confirm whether any new procedures have been introduced for the handling of the crafts section of the art paper.  Was the old system, developed over the years, changed in any way?  It is worth pointing out that the crafts section has to be submitted in June.  In addition, the Department is aware, as early as January each year, of the number of students who have opted for the section and the particular crafts chosen.</P>
    <P>Given what has happened, a full review of the examination system should be carried out to ensure that something like this will never happen again.  The students, teachers and parents have suffered enormous trauma and upset.  The Minister must consider offering compensation to the students who were wronged and whose lives have been severely disrupted as a result of the error.  It is clear that without their persistence we would never have known anything about this.  That is most worrying and highlights the need for far greater transparency in the examination system.  In the future school authorities should have access to the papers at the rechecking stage to ensure everything is in order.</P>

      <P>I wish to voice my concern as the Ursuline College, Sligo, was my <i>alma mater</i>.  This incident has affected the lives of the young women concerned, the board of management and staff of the school.  There is a need for full disclosure.  Without the persistence of a particular individual we would never have known there was a problem. The Department should have been big enough to admit there was a problem. This would have allowed us to deal with it in a more cogent way.  Proper compensation should be paid to the students who have been badly affected by this blunder.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to state in the House my concern at the failure to correctly credit marks in the case of some art students in 1995.  Not only does it cause distress and worry for students, their families and teachers, but any failure in this area has an impact on the overall integrity of the certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>As soon as I became aware of this problem my first priority was to notify schools and the 46 students of their revised results and to offer help and advice to those concerned.  As part of this process and on foot of a request from the Ursuline College, Sligo, officials from my Department met with candidates, their parents and members of the school board of management two weeks ago.  In addition, the parents of some individual candidates have been in direct contact with my Department over the last number of weeks.  I wish to emphasise again the continued availability of advice and assistance to any candidates or parents seeking it.  In addition, where a case to make good losses incurred by a candidate is put forward, it will be examined in a fair and even handed way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned to secure the standing and integrity of the certificate examinations. Mr. Tommy Francis, President of the ASTI, made the point recently that these examinations involve 133,000 <Col N="321" /> students in 800 schools and are supervised and corrected by 11,000 teachers. He also emphasised the dedication, efficiency and professionalism of those involved.  This is a sentiment which I, as Minister, share.  Given my responsibility for ensuring that the examinations retain the full confidence of parents, students and the many institutions which rely on them, I considered it essential that this problem be the subject of a full independent inquiry.  This inquiry is now being conducted and I intend to publish its report when it becomes available within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>This report will provide a full and detailed explanation of the circumstances which led to the failures in the running of the art examination in 1995. While it is true to say that in an operation as large as the certificate examinations some mistakes will occur, the central issue is that these mistakes should be detected by the various checks in the system.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to pre-empt the report of the independent inquiry, I will comment in broad terms on the failures which arose.  In the case of craftwork, one of four parts in the art exam, the finished materials are sent from the schools to the Department's offices in Athlone for examination.  Where this work fails to arrive it should be followed up directly with the school.  In addition, as part of the marking process, a missing part should be investigated.  Finally, the appeals process should always detect a missing part of the examination.</P>
    <P>In the case of these candidates the system of checks failed in 1995.  There is no excusing this failure.  The inquiry which I ordered and which is ongoing will arrive at the reasons for the failure. Its report will be published.  The fact that this report is an external independent one will enhance both its public standing and the acceptability of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>In addition to the inquiry which will deal with all aspects of the running of the 1995 art examination, I have asked Price Waterhouse to review the entire <Col N="322" /> appeals procedure in the case of all subjects. Such a review is essential to fully secure public confidence in this process. It is my intention that any recommendations for improvements in this area will be implemented for the 1996 examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and the Minister for coming into the House to respond.</P>
      <P>When I became aware that the two firms concerned were experiencing difficulties I made contact with my party's Deputy Leader and spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke.  I thank her for coming into the House to support me on this issue.</P>
      <P>In the past Dundalk had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.  Thankfully, in 1991-92 the numbers unemployed were stabilised and began to drop following the attraction of a number of new industries to the town.  There was a belief, on the part of the powers that be, that this resolved the problem but they failed to realise that the town was starting from a low base.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it was dealt a bad blow in recent weeks.  In the region of 209 workers have been laid off at two industries, at KeyTronic, one of the largest employers in the town for the past ten years, and Ecco, a long established industry, now known as Harris Ireland.  At KeyTronic 91 workers were laid off prior to Christmas and a further 78 last week.  At Harris Ireland 40 workers were laid off in January.</P>
      <P>There is also a serious industrial dispute at the AIBP plant at Ravensdale.  I ask the Minister to instruct the Department to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a necessity &mdash; my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has been vigilant on <Col N="323" /> this point &mdash; to put an early warning system in place to allow State agencies intervene at an early stage when they become aware companies are experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>US companies, in particular, are experiencing difficulties because of the differential between the punt and the US dollar.  At least one of the companies concerned experiences grave difficulties in terms of profit margins and costs, much of which are related to that differential. I understand that at least £17 million is to be allocated under the Delors package and Members from this side of the House have been exhorting the Government to allocate some of that money to industrial infrastructure in Border areas.  If some of that money were allocated to Forbairt, jobs could be created in that region.  Will the Minister directly intervene to ensure that further losses do not take place at these companies and that they receive whatever assistance is necessary from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Ahern who clearly outlined the dangerous position facing these firms.  He stated that the general employment position in Dundalk has improved due to the commitment and hard work of the people of Dundalk, various industrial bodies and chambers of commerce who are determined that there will not be a repeat of the bad days when employment was in a downward spiral.  It is important that immediate key aid is given to these companies to help them over this rough patch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there is not an over-supply of jobs in firms locating here in response to major initiatives in the computer world?  While we welcome an influx of new jobs to towns throughout the country, it should not happen at the expense of displacing <Col N="324" /> worthwhile existing industrial employment. It is pointless opening a firm in one town if a similar firm in another town lays off workers.  This displacement element appears to have been overlooked in the race to make attractive announcements and I have noted this in the midlands region.  The two firms in Dundalk or the people of that town should not have to suffer because of the good fortune of firms in other towns.</P>
    <P>I support the comments of Deputy Ahern who outlined clearly his concerns in regard to his native Dundalk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I will examine the problem in AIBP but, as Deputy Ahern knows, we rely on the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, the proven experts in this field, to assist such parties.  Their services are available to assist them in resolving disputes.  All Governments have correctly taken the view that direct intervention would only undermine those valuable services which have succeeded in reducing the rate of industrial disputes in recent years.</P>
      <P>I note the Deputy's comments about industrial infrastructure.  My Department is working with the agencies concerned and public representatives to ascertain what can be done in that area. Many Deputies have referred to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share Deputy O'Rourke's concern about over-reliance on the electronics sector.  We have successfully built critical mass in this sector, we have built skills around it and brought in big players.  Following sub-supply opportunities for domestic industry and follow-on green field investment by overseas companies, given our track record in this sector, we secured a first mover advantage in the electronics sector and we are now developing the fruits of that <Col N="325" /> advantage.  The electronics sector, in particular, is changing rapidly.  It is inevitable that in any sector markets will change, products will become redundant and if companies do not develop new products they will suffer.  We have a strong and creative electronics sector and we should continue to exploit our advantages in that area.</P>
    <P>In the past two months, 175 jobs have been lost in the Key Tronic plant and, recently, Ecco Limited &mdash; Harris Ireland &mdash; laid off 40 temporary workers.  I will outline the position in relation to both of these companies.</P>
    <P>The launch of Microsoft's &ldquo;Windows '95&rdquo;, heightened distributors' demand for the keyboard manufactured by KeyTronic. As a result, KeyTronic increased production, purchased extra equipment and employed an additional 200 people to meet this demand.  Now, however, increased stocks and a lower than anticipated demand have led to excess manufacturing capacity.  Simultaneously, some of KeyTronic's other customers reduced orders as a result of a less buoyant than anticipated October-December 1995 quarter which has led to a significant build-up in personal computer inventories.</P>
    <P>These factors, taken together, have left KeyTronic with no alternative but to reduce capacity.  It is unfortunate that the anticipated demand did not materialise and I know that IDA Ireland is examining the position very closely to see what can be done to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>Ecco established a facility in Dundalk as far back as 1966 to manufacture electronic protection devices.  The company laid off 40 of its temporary workers who were employed specifically to cater for a seasonal demand in their product. Unfortunately, Ecco sales projections for the latter half of 1995 proved to be too optimistic and did not materialise as anticipated.  Overall, however, Ecco has performed extremely well in recent years with employment increasing from <Col N="326" /> 265 permanent people in 1992 to 300 permanent people at present.  While the company does not foresee the temporary staff being re-employed in the short-term, neither does it foresee any further layoffs.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that County Louth is the location for an impressive array of overseas companies: Quantum, from the US customises the PC hard disc drives produced by IKEI Panasonic, from Japan; ABB from Switzerland manufactures process control equipment for the paper making industry; AFL/Stribel is involved in the manufacture of auto components; National Penn, is involved in the mail order business and Riverside Manufacturing Company Limited manufactures industrial clothing.  Clearly, therefore, the north-east region has a significant base of high technology companies which is a key factor in attracting overseas investors.  Indeed, the north-east region as a whole has more than 40 overseas clients.</P>
    <P>In addition, the announcement last November that American Power Corporation is to locate its uninterruptable power supplies project in Drogheda will result in an investment of £14 million and employment for 300 people at full production.</P>
    <P>As regards indigenous industry.  Forbairt, through its north-east regional office, continued to actively promote the area for industrial development.  For example, during my visit to Boston with Forbairt officers last November.  I announced three specific business partnerships between Irish and US companies, including one from County Louth. This was between Creative Media Training Services Limited in Drogheda and Paradign Incorporated of Florida.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also working with Dundalk regional technical college in seeking to source potential technology based startup companies.  In addition, on the indigenous side, I draw the Deputies' attention to the recent opening of <Col N="327" /> Potato Cuisine Limited in Drogheda which will create more than 60 jobs.</P>
    <P>Both IDA Ireland and Forbairt will continue to build on the developments in Dundalk, and County Louth in general. The big challenge for 1996 is to add to the impressive list of developments in <Col N="328" /> the area.  The current peace process will assist the industrial development agencies promotional efforts in the appeal of the entire north-east region and Dundalk in particular.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 February 1996.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 25 January recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite the Russian Federation to become a member of the Council of Europe.  It is expected that the Committee of Ministers will take its decision at an early date.</P>
      <P>The Russian Federation has taken part in activities of the Council of Europe since 1992 &mdash; through its participation in intergovernmental &ldquo;cooperation and assistance&rdquo; programmes notably in the fields of legal reform and human rights and through the participation of its &ldquo;special guest delegation&rdquo; in the work of the Parliamentary Assembly and its committees.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has agreed with Russia a wide range of commitments, the widest range undertaken by any applicant state.  Most importantly, Russia will sign the European Convention on Human Rights at the moment of accession and will ratify the Convention within a year.  This will include recognising the right of individual application to the European Commission and the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court.  Individuals in Russia who consider that there has been a violation of their human rights will thus be able to take proceedings against their government.  The judgment of the court will be binding and its execution will be supervised by the Committee of Ministers. This will be the first time that Russia has laid itself open to such a judicial procedure, a procedure which has proved to be of great benefit to the citizens of the longer established democracies not least our own.</P>
      <P>In addition, Russia has given a commitment to sign within one year, and ratify within three years, Protocol No. 6 on the abolition of the death penalty in time of peace and, until this enters into force, to place a moratorium on executions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Russia has also given a commitment to sign and ratify within a year from accession the Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and <Col N="57" /> Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The supervisory mechanism established by this convention aims at preventing violations, in particular, torture and ill-treatment, by a system of visits to places of detention.  In total Russia has made 20 specific commitments, a list of which I will make available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Assembly has established a detailed mechanism for monitoring the commitments of new member states, the so-called Halonen-Columberg Order and this will be applied to the Russian Federation.  This order instructs the Assembly's Political Affairs Committee and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights to monitor closely the honouring of commitments undertaken and to report to the Assembly at regular six monthly intervals.  The report should include a draft resolution in which clear proposals are made for the improvement of the shortcomings in the country in question. The monitoring process will continue until all undertakings have been honoured.</P>
    <P>As regards the sanctions available against member states, the most important is, as I have said, the right of individuals in Russia to take their government to the European Court of Human Rights.  It is, of course, open to another state or a group of states to take a case against a member state if it is considered that the state in question is breaching the European Convention on Human Rights.  The ultimate sanction remains the explusion of a member state by a decision of the Committee of Ministers, which is provided for under Article 8 of the Statute of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe has more than 40 years experience in creating human rights instruments and mechanisms which have contributed greatly to the development of democracy in Europe. During the past number of years the Council of Europe has provided expert assistance with the drafting of constitutions and legislation in the newly democratic countries of Central and <Col N="58" /> Eastern Europe, and provided assistance in the training of judges and lawyers. This work will continue as long as it remains necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 57 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department received an additional £3.5 million for Presidency preparations.  This year, my Department's allocation for the Presidency is £8.7 million.  Some further cost will arise next year because of our continuing membership of the Troika until 30 June 1997 but these cannot be estimated at this stage.  Other Departments will also incur expenditure in relation to the Presidency and any questions in this regard should be addressed directly to the responsible Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the Presidency budget for my Department will be used to cover the cost of salaries for the additional temporary staff to be recruited for the Presidency, extra travel and subsistence <Col N="59" /> expenses, additional communications and IT expenses and additional expenditure on press and information activities.</P>
    <P>The allocation for press and information services will be used by the relevant sections of my Department to produce information materials to promote Ireland's image abroad and to provide services for the international media who will be focusing on Ireland during our Presidency.  My Department does not have any plans to recruit a public relations firm for Presidency purposes.</P>
    <P>Approximately 100 additional staff will be recruited to my Department on a temporary basis for the Presidency. Some 85 of these will be civil servants recruited by the Civil Service Commission from either inter-departmental promotion or recruitment panels.  The remaining 15 will be employed directly by my Department on temporary contracts. This includes a small number of retired officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and locally recruited staff at certain Missions abroad.  In addition to the additional temporary staff from outside the Department, approximately 30 officers within my Department will be redeployed for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The temporary Presidency staff will be used to strengthen the divisions of the Department at headquarters and the diplomatic missions abroad which will be most directly involved in the Presidency. These include the political, economic and development co-operation divisions in Dublin, the permanent representation to the European Union in Brussels, the permanent missions to the United Nations in Geneva and New York and the delegation to the Organisation on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly condemned the series of killings which took place in the period up to 1 January of this year and which were alleged to be related to drug dealing.  I am aware that the so-called Direct Action Against Drugs has claimed responsibility for these killings.  I am also aware of the speculation linking this group to the IRA and of the view of the security forces in Northern Ireland in this regard.  In addition to these so-called punishment killings, both republican and loyalist groups have been linked to so-called punishment attacks and threats.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that at all meetings with those parties which are close to the thinking of paramilitary groups, the Government have urged them to use their influence to the utmost to bring so-called punishment killings and attacks to an end.  We have forcibly brought home to them our utter condemnation of these barbaric acts. We have also pointed out how such practices undermine the trust and confidence which are critical to moving the peace process forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International body has recommended, as one of its six principles of democracy and non-violence, that the parties to all-party negotiations affirm their total and absolute commitment to bringing punishment beatings and killings to an end.  I repeat the Government's call on all the parties to accept the six principles and to reinforce public <Col N="61" /> confidence, as the Mitchell body recommended, that violence or the threat of violence would never be used in the future to pursue political or other ends.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of a breach or a breakdown of the ceasefire, I would hesitate to make a definitive pronouncement for two reasons.  First, I would not wish, on such an important issue, to make a definitive judgment without the utmost certainly as to the facts.  Second, without in any way minimising the scope and impact of these crimes, we must not lose sight of other areas where the ceasefire has been sustained in a disciplined way.</P>
    <P>I share fully the concern expressed by the Deputies regarding the killings in question, as they, no doubt, share my hope that these have now ended.  The Government will continue to work to bring an end to all so-called punishment attacks and to encourage all parties to accept unequivocally the six principles of democracy and non-violence recommended in the report of the international body.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against a background of continuing ethnic violence, growing civil unrest and the alarming report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights which has highlighted increased ethnic polarisation there, the situation in Burundi <Col N="62" /> continues to be a matter of serious concern to the Government.  We are making every effort, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, to prevent any further deterioration in the situation.  As Deputies are only too well aware, the humanitarian, economic, ethnic and political aspects of the situation in that country have far-reaching implications for the stability of the entire Great Lakes region.  The Government therefore see an urgent need for the Government of Burundi and all interested parties to engage in substantive political dialogue and to avoid further violence and human suffering.</P>
    <P>As part of the international community's efforts to resolve the situation in the Great Lakes region, an EU Ministerial Troika visited Rwanda and Burundi last September.  In Burundi, it addressed various aspects of the situation there, including the initiation of national dialogue; the establishment of a commission of inquiry into events in Burundi in 1993; the repatriation of refugees; human rights and judicial reform; and the holding of an international conference on peace, stability and security in the Great Lakes region. Since then there have been continuing intensive diplomatic efforts to establish a political framework to promote peace and stability both at national and regional level in Burundi and neighbouring countries.  Facilitated by former US President Carter, the Presidents of Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda and Zaire and a special Presidential envoy from Tanzania held a regional summit and issued a joint declaration in Cairo on 29 November.  It was agreed that a followup meeting would be held early in 1996.</P>
    <P>In December the UN Secretary General appointed a new Special Representative to Burundi, Mr. Marc Faguy.  He is actively engaged in promoting peaceful dialogue.  The Secretary General has also written to the Security Council suggesting the deployment of a military intervention force in Zaire to intervene in the event of a sudden deterioration of the situation in Burundi.  The UN Security Council, in Resolution 1040 of <Col N="63" /> 29 January, has stated its readiness to impose a ban on the supply of all arms and related material to Burundi and has supported the efforts of the UN Secretary General to facilitate comprehensive political dialogue.  In addition, the Secretary General is sending a technical mission to Burundi to examine how to improve security and the protection of humanitarian operations.  The Organisation of African Unity and former-President Nyerere of Tanzania are actively engaged in preventive diplomacy at both national level in Burundi and throughout the Great Lakes region. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Ogata, visited Burundi in January and has agreed to send an initial team of five human rights monitors to Bujumbura with EU funding. The US Ambassador to the UN, Mrs. Madeleine Albright, visited Burundi on 20 January.</P>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council in Brussels on 29 January, Ireland strongly supported the decision to appoint an EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region.  It is envisaged that this envoy, who will be appointed as soon as possible, will act as a facilitator to help resolve the crisis in the region in conjunction with the efforts of the United Nations, the OAU and other interested parties.  The EU envoy will also help in preparing for the holding of an international conference on peace, stability and security in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the UN and OAU.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that there is an urgent need for the International Commission of Inquiry into the assassination of the President of Burundi in October 1993 and the ensuing massacres to do its work, so that justice may be done.  We have recently allocated a grant of 150,000 US Dollars to support the commission's work.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in Burundi is critical at present.  Hutu rebel groups have cut off water and electricity supplies to towns and cities: cholera is reported to be on the increase in the capital, Bujumbura, and attacks on <Col N="64" /> humanitarian aid workers have crippled relief operations in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The rebel military activities have occured predominantly in the north of Burundi where refugee camps are situated. Recent violence between forces of the National Army and armed bands in Muyinga province, provoked the flight of 15,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees into Tanzania.  Although the border between Tanzania and Burundi has remained closed since March 1995, the Government of Tanzania admitted these refugees on humanitarian grounds.  I commend the Government of Tanzania for their generous response to the recent crisis.</P>
    <P>Within Burundi, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates that there are 180,000 Rwandan refugees mainly in refugee camps in the Northern provinces of Burundi and over 450,000 internally displaced people who have fled their homes.  It will be vital to ensure that humanitarian relief continues to reach vulnerable people in Burundi in the coming months, if a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation is to be averted.  In addition, the UNHCR are committed to maintaining priority for the voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees in Burundi to their homes in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Since the current crisis in Burundi began in October 1993, the UNHCR estimate that 740,000 refugees have fled Burundi to the neighbouring states.  In 1995, however, Burundi refugees returned home spontaneously.  At present the UNHCR estimate that there are 180,000 Burundi refugees in neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>This week, senior officials from my Department are due to travel to Burundi as part of a special EU Troika mission specifically aimed at helping to resolve the crisis in that country.  It is the Government's firm objective that the concerted efforts of Ireland and its EU partners in supporting the OAU, UN, former Presidents Carter and Nyerere and other intermediaries, will result in the prevention of any further escalation in ethnic tensions in Burundi while <Col N="65" /> at the same time resolving the refugee problem and other pressing issues at regional level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The remark ascribed to the Spanish Prime Minister and to which Deputy Brennan refers pre-dates the Madrid meeting of the European Council on 15 and 16 December last.  The Deputy will be aware that important decisions were taken at Madrid in relation to future enlargement.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the Commission is to expedite preparation of its opinions on membership applications so that they can be forwarded to the Council as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Commission was also requested to prepare a composite paper on enlargement. This procedure will ensure that the applicant countries are treated on an equal basis.</P>
      <P>Second, the Commission is to submit, immediately after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from the year 2000, having regard to the prospect of enlargement.  The Commission is also to take its evaluation of the effects of enlargement on Community policies further, particularly with regard to agricultural and structural policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> Third, the Council will, at the earliest opportunity following the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, and taking into account the Commission opinions and reports which I have mentioned, take the necessary decisions for launching the accession negotiations with the Associated Countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  The Madrid European Council expressed the hope that the preliminary stage of these negotiations will coincide with the start of negotiations with Cyprus and Malta which are due to commence six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, taking into account its outcome.</P>
    <P>The decisions taken at Madrid represent important progress in preparing for enlargement.  Together with the pre-accession strategy approved by the earlier European Council meeting in Essen which is now in place, these decisions help to chart a steady course towards an enlarged European Union.</P>
    <P>There are currently 12 applications for membership of the European Union on the table.  These are from Cyprus, Malta, Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Bulgaria, Romania. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Turkey.</P>
    <P>Ireland's general attitude to the question of enlargement of the Union as expressed in the conclusions of successive meetings of the European Council is open and positive.  As noted by the European Council meeting in Madrid. enlargement of the Union is both a political necessity and an historic opportunity for Europe.  We believe that enlargement is necessary in order to consolidate peace and stability in Europe.  We also believe that enlargement can bring greater prosperity to existing and prospective member states, by increasing trade and investment opportunities, provided the overall conditions are right.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the issues raised by future enlargement are significantly different from those raised by previous enlargement rounds both because of the nature of the challenges facing the countries concerned and the changes which <Col N="67" /> the Union itself will have to undergo in order to maintain the process of European integration.  It will be important to ensure that future enlargement does not compromise the essential interests and effectiveness of the Union or in any way dilute or threaten its achievements over so many policy areas of vital importance to its member states.  Ireland is committed to maintaining the Union's character as enlargement proceeds and to maintaining economic and social cohesion within the EU.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the further enlargement of the Union will offer both opportunities and challenges as far as Ireland is concerned. In particular, the accession of countries which are less developed than our own poses important questions, especially as regards the future of the CAP and the Union's cohesion policies.</P>
    <P>Last year, the European Commission produced two studies on enlargement. The first addressed the effects of enlargement in the context of the Union's present policies and of their future development.  The second document was a study on the means of developing relations in the field of agriculture between the Union and the Associated Countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  Neither document contains proposals &mdash; they are discussion documents only and represent starting points for in-depth examination by the Union and its member states of the impact of enlargement.  It will be recalled that the Commission's studies, and in particular its agriculture strategy paper, were debated in this House last December.  For its part, the European Council meeting in Madrid, as I have already mentioned, called on the Commission to take its evaluation of the effects on enlargement on Community policies further, particularly with regard to agricultural and structural policies.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial implications of enlargement, the House will be aware that the Edinburgh European Council adopted the budgetary framework for the Union's finances up to 1999.  Analysis of the situation after 1999 can have at <Col N="68" /> this stage an indicative character only, given the many uncertainties associated with this process.  However I would recall a point made by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, in this House on 5 December in the course of a debate on the future enlargement of the Union, that agreement will need to be reached by the existing member states of the Union, in advance of enlargement, on the provision of the financial resources necessary for the continued implementation of EU policies in the existing member states as well as in the new member states.  Since then, the Commission has been requested by the Madrid European Council to undertake a detailed analysis as soon as possible of the Union's financing system in order to submit, immediately after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from the end of 1999 having regard to the proposed enlargement.</P>

      <Quest>if he will respond to recent reports that there is growing support in the European Union for the establishment of a common armaments policy in Europe with a view to supporting the ailing arms industry; and if the Government is supportive of such an initiative.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2366/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Táinaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Táinaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Táinaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the establishment of a common armaments policy in Europe has arisen many times over the years in a number of different contexts.  It has arisen in the context of the completion of the single market and the EU's industry and common commercial policies; in the context of foreign policy co-operation in the framework of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP); and in the context of proposals to develop European co-operation in the <Col N="69" /> security and defence fields.  Consideration of this issue and its implications has always been complicated and difficult, as it touches directly on some sensitive policy areas for EU member states, in particular in relation to national security and defence policies, export policies, and economic and employment policies.</P>
      <P>The absence of a common armaments policy reflects, among other things, the fact that under the provisions of Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, any member state &ldquo;may take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material&rdquo;.  One effect of this provision has been to permit member states to exempt arms procurement from the rules of the internal market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a possible common armaments policy has evoked renewed interest, primarily against the background of three developments.  The first relates to the well documented decline in demand for and production of defence equipment throughout the world.  This is a welcome development which reflects not only the end of the Cold War but also the development and implementation of disarmament and arms control agreements.  Ireland has worked actively to promote and support such agreements and we will continue to work for reduction in the levels of weapons stockpiles.  Within the European Union, this downward trend in arms production and trade has, however, given rise to severe employment challenges. The Commission has noted that the global arms market has been practically halved in the last decade and that employment in the defence industry within the EU has declined in recent years by over 600,000, to its current level of one million &mdash; a drop of 37 per cent.  The Commission has also noted that this has particularly impacted on certain regions within the EU.  The annual output of the defence industry within the EU still represents nearly 3 <Col N="70" /> per cent of the EU's total industrial output and it remains a major source of employment and economic activity in a number of EU member states.</P>
    <P>The second development underlying the renewed focus on armaments co-operation arises from interest in greater European security and defence co-operation. It has been argued that such co-operation ultimately requires a European armaments industrial base, and therefore increased co-operation between European partners in such areas as armaments production, armaments procurement policy and arms export policy.  In this context, the Western European Union agreed in its Maastricht Declaration 1991, to examine further proposals for enhanced co-operation in the field of armaments with the aim of creating a European Armaments Agency under the auspices of the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>A third development is the growing profile of the European Union in the control of arms exports.  This has included the elaboration of common criteria to underpin the national arms export policies of EU member states and the involvement of Ireland and our EU partners in a number of multinational weapon-related export control fora, for example, the Australia Group which deals with controls of components used in chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, acting on its own authority, has recently sent a formal communication summarising developments and challenges in this area to the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Council and the Committee of the Regions.  The Commission's communication points to the arguments for further restructuring of the armaments industry as it exists within EU member states, and proposes a range of responses, essentially based on existing Community policies.  In addition, it is possible that proposals relating to armaments co-operation may be tabled at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It will be recalled that the Reflection Group report noted the views of a majority of <Col N="71" /> EU partners that the question of European armaments co-operation is one that the Intergovernmental Conference should consider.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the issue of armaments derives in the first instance from our strong and enduring commitment to disarmament and arms control.  Our primary concern therefore will be to ensure that any developments in this area are consistent with our priorities in disarmament and arms control and our overall approach to international peace and security.  We would wish to ensure also that any development of co-operation in the field of armaments includes a strengthening of arms export control policies at the level of the European Union.  Ireland is not a producer of armaments and will not become one.  The Government will continue to work for enhanced EU co-operation on arms export policy to achieve the maximum possible transparency and restraint in arms transfers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 42, 74 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>One formal meeting of the European Council is scheduled to be held in Ireland during the Presidency.  It will be held in Dublin Castle in December.</P>
      <P>Due to the size of the formal European Council &mdash; which requires facilities for up to 6,000 people &mdash; Dublin Castle is the most appropriate location for this meeting.  If a second European Council meeting is required during the Presidency, and depending on whether the meeting is formal or informal, venues other than Dublin Castle may be considered. However, it is likely that if a venue outside Dublin Castle is chosen for an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government, Dublin Castle may in any event have to be used as a press centre due to the extensive investment in press facilities made there.</P>
      <P>A draft calendar of meetings of the Council of Ministers has been drawn up which indicates the dates of all formal and informal Council meetings during our Presidency.  All formal meetings of the Council will, of course, be held in either Brussels or Luxembourg.  The calendar includes the venues for the seven informal Council meetings scheduled to take place in Ireland.  Of the seven informal Council meetings, two will be held outside Dublin Castle: one in Killarney and one in Tralee.  It is of course, a matter for each individual Minister to decide the venue of the informal Council meeting he or she will be hosting.  A copy of the draft calendar of Council meetings has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library for the information of all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the seven informal Council meetings, arrangements are currently in train for a range of meetings, seminars and colloquia to be held in Ireland at both ministerial and official level, during the Presidency.  These events will be held in a variety of <Col N="73" /> locations around the country.  The organisation of each of these meetings is the responsibility of the Minister or Department concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to consult other Departments about intentions with regard to hosting meetings.  When a full list of meetings in Ireland is available I will arrange to have it lodged in the Oireachtas Library.  In the meantime I have lodged in the Library a provisional draft list of all meetings scheduled to date.</P>
    <P>Dublin Castle has been developed by the State as a venue for international conferences.  Its facilities have been specifically designed with EU meetings in mind.  Nevertheless, my Department has taken every opportunity to encourage Ministers and Departments to hold meetings, where practicable, in locations outside Dublin Castle and we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputies should also bear in mind that groups from political parties or from the institutions or bodies of the European Union may visit Ireland either before or during the Presidency. Arrangements concerning the timing and location of such meetings is a matter for each group concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 17 October and 7 December last, some progress was made during the first session of the Vienna Review Conference towards agreement on practical steps to reduce the negative impact of landmines on civilians and to facilitate the task of mine clearance in the wake of conflicts. The resumed session which took place from 15 to 19 January in Geneva concentrated exclusively on the substantive prohibitions and restrictions on the use of landmines which are to be included in an amended Protocol 2 to the Convention. In particular, attention was focused on the following additional restraints: a ban on the use of non-detectable anti-personnel landmines: a ban on the use of long lived, remotely delivered anti-personnel landmines; and a ban on the transfer of landmines which do not comply with the new rules. However, the outcome of negotiations on outstanding issues, such as the length and content of transition periods and specific exemptions sought by one or more States Parties, could limit the impact and scope of the additional restraints.  As a member of the EU Troika, Ireland is directly involved in efforts to persuade key third countries to accept the widest possible prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one of twenty-two countries which espouse a total ban on landmines, Ireland is acutely aware that, from this perspective, the outcome of this first review conference is likely to fall far short of our objective.  We are doing all we can, together with like-minded countries, to ensure that the new Protocol will represent a real and credible step in the right direction.  This means ensuring that recognition of the imperative humanitarian need to end the indiscriminate use of landmines must prevail over entrenched perceptions of the military value of landmines.  However, a number of States Parties have considerable difficulty in reconciling these approaches on an even moderately <Col N="75" /> satisfactory basis.  For these reasons, it cannot yet be stated that the review conference will be a step towards achieving a world wide ban on landmines. I hope that it will make real progress towards ending the indiscriminate use of landmines.</P>
    <P>The review conference process is only one strand in international action for the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines.  A growing number of countries have adopted unilateral moratoria on exports of landmines, as advocated by the UN General Assembly. One component of the EU Joint Action of 12 May 1995 is a common moratorium on exports of anti-personnel landmines.  In a number of EU countries, there is currently no production of anti-personnel landmines.  Ireland, of course, has never produced landmines. Five of the fifteen EU countries, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden are among the twenty-two countries which espouse a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.  There is thus a prospect that other partners will be persuaded to take steps beyond the common moratorium on exports. However, a number of partners continue to see landmines as a legitimate element of their defence strategy, provided they are responsibly used in strict conformity with the relevant international norms and these partners are unlikely, at least in the short-term, to join Ireland and the other countries I have named in advocating a total ban.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 45 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> The Intergovernmental Conference, which will consider amendments to the European Union Treaties, is due to be launched by the Heads of State or Government in Turin on 29 March 1996. The first working session of the Intergovernmental Conference at Foreign Minister level is expected to take place on the following day.</P>
    <P>The precise agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference will be established by the Intergovernmental Conference itself.  The Maastricht Treaty already identified certain items for consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference including the role of the European Parliament in the legislative process and the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Subsequently, several meetings of the European Council have added further items to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference including institutional questions such as weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, the threshold of qualified majority decisions, the number of members of the European Commission and any other measure deemed necessary to facilitate the work of the institutions and guarantee their effective operation in the perspective of enlargement.</P>
    <P>The report of the Madrid European Council in December from the reflection group, which was set up to help in the preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference, gives further important indications regarding the issues likely to arise in the conference. The role of the reflection group was not, of course, to negotiate but to clarify issues and options.  Its report was described by the Madrid European Council as a sound basis for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The reflection group concluded that results should be achieved at the Intergovernmental Conference in three main areas: making Europe more relevant to its citizens, enabling the Union to work better and preparing it for enlargement, and giving the Union greater capacity for external action.  Copies of the reflection group report have been sent to all <Col N="78" /> members of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas library.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union, on which the Treaty provisions are set out in the Maastricht Treaty, is not on the agenda of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The Italian Presidency is using the period between now and the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference at the end of March to try, in so far as possible and in consultation with partners, to clarify further the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. Opinions are also awaited from the European Parliament and from the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government has sought since last year, through a series of speeches and in the context of the preparation of the forthcoming White Paper on Irish Foreign Policy, to encourage informed public debate about the issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and their implications for Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to the role of both Houses of the Oireachtas in helping to shape Irish policy in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Union more generally.  The Government's preliminary approach to issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference has been set out on several occasions in both Houses, including by various members of the Government in reply to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has, of course, been kept fully informed of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference Reflection Group.  The Government will continue to keep the Oireachtas regularly informed of issues arising or expected to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and of the approach which it is intended to take.  It would not, of course, be appropriate or in conformity with normal practice in Ireland or indeed any member state, to publish in advance of negotiations a statement <Col N="79" /> which it is intended to make at those negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to restate in detail today the implications for Ireland and Europe of the Intergovernmental Conference. The forthcoming White Paper on Irish Foreign Policy will set out the Government's broad approach to Intergovernmental Conference negotiations. However, the implications for both Ireland and Europe in broad terms are that the European Union must use the Intergovernmental Conference to equip itself to function more effectively, to address the most direct concerns of citizens and to facilitate the further enlargement of the European Union over the years ahead.  At the same time, the Government considers that the broad institutional balances have served the Union well, are essential to its further success and must be preserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply of 7 December 1995 to another question on this issue, the Government considers the voluntary and organised return of refugees to be central to a solution of the political and humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes region.  On that occasion I set out in some detail the <Col N="80" /> importance of refugee return both from the perspective of stability in the Great Lakes region as a whole and that of reconciliation and recovery in Rwanda itself.</P>
    <P>The most recent estimate of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is that there are 1.9 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi.  The registered refugee population by country of asylum is one million in Zaire, 600,000 in Tanzania and 180,000 in Burundi.  Since September the rate of return of refugees to Rwanda has been 2,000 per day.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the UNHCR established a formal mechanism for consultation with all the regional parties concerned with voluntary return of refugees.  As a consequence, in addition to daily contacts at field level, regular meetings take place in the framework of what are known as Tripartite Commissions which bring together the UNHCR, the Rwandan Government and the government of the host country.  Since December, meetings of these Tripartite Commissions have been held with the Government of Zaire and the Government of Burundi.  A meeting with the Government of Tanzania is scheduled in the next two weeks.  All the Governments concerned agree on the need to take concerted measures to give a new impetus to repatriation and also on the importance of taking steps against intimidators in refugee camps.</P>
    <P>I understand that within the camps in Zaire tension and uncertainty remain about the intentions of the Zairian authorities concerning voluntary repatriation. From our contacts with UNHCR in Geneva we understand that Zaire has mentioned the despatch of 250 gendarmes to supervise camp closures.  Our position on this matter is clear; we will not condone forced repatriation and we will remain in close contact with UNHCR and the aid agencies on this issue.  Within Rwanda itself, planning is at an advanced stage to prepare for increased numbers of returning refugees. This planning involves close co-operation between the Government of <Col N="81" /> Rwanda, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, international aid agencies and the UN human rights field operation for Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that the restoration of a functioning and independent system of justice is essential to the process of national reconciliation. Bilaterally and with our EU partners, we have confirmed our prepardeness to assist in the restoration of such a system. We continue to encourage the Government of Rwanda to take steps to that end and we look forward to an improvement in this regard over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly supported the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which was set up under Security Council Resolution 988 of 8 November 1994 to prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda. It is estimated that up to one million people were killed during the appalling genocide which took place in 1994 and thousands have died in violence since that time.  Investigations by the international tribunal, which held its first plenary session last June, have been focused on approximately 400 identified suspects.  On 12 December the tribunal announced its first indictments of eight people in connection with massacres at four locations in the Kibuye region.  The tribunal prosecutor, Justice Richard J. Goldstone, hopes to begin full trial hearings before the end of March.</P>
    <P>The Government has disbursed a total of £6.9 million for emergency relief and rehabilitation efforts in the Rwandan region since 1994.  Last year the Government spent over £1.35 million on the justice sector and on human rights initiatives in Rwanda, including support for the International Committee of the Red Cross to ease the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda's prisons.  Assistance was provided for communal police training and to restore legal structures in the Ministries of Justice and the <Col N="82" /> Interior.  The Government also allocated grants to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the UN human rights field operation and for the UN High Commission for Human Rights programme to rehabilitate the system on justice in Rwanda.  Finally Ireland co-sponsored the Genocide Summit in Kigali last November, with the US Government.</P>

      <P>My special adviser was requested by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to assist him by serving on a committee whose purpose was to assess and evaluate presentations from six advertising agencies in connection with the divorce referendum.

    <P>I was not involved in any way with the selection of any advertising agency for the purposes of the divorce referendum campaign.  It was neither appropriate nor necessary to bring correspondence in the matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>An Intergovernmental Conference is convened specifically to consider possible Treaty changes.  The precise agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference has not yet been established and Treaty amendments have not yet been put forward by any member states for consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference.  One priority of the Intergovernmental Conference, however, will be to give the EU greater capacity for external action. Ireland will, of course, continue to support, in this regard the general principles of just and equitable relations between the EU and the developing world.</P>
      <P>Title XVII of the Treaty on European Union outlines the broad objectives of Community development policy, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the promotion of sustainable development, the promotion of human rights and support for the UN system.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question in this House from Deputy Noel Ahern on 7 December last, Ireland in 1992 decided to become an observer in the Western European Union on the basis of the relationship established between the EU and the Western European Union in the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.  Article J.4.2. provided for the EU to &ldquo;request the Western European Union, which is an integral part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty also provided for the convening of another Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 to review, <i>inter alia</i>, its CFSP provisions, including the relationship established between the EU and the Western European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, our observer status in the Western European Union is proving to be useful, particularly as the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are advancing.  Moreover, like the other neutral states which are observers at the Western European Union &mdash; Finland, Sweden and Austria &mdash; we see scope for exploring further the Western European Union Petersberg tasks in regard to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.  This is an area where I see potential for Ireland, in view of our accumulated expertise in peacekeeping and humanitarian work, to make a contribution. The other European neutrals which are observers at the Western European Union are thinking along <Col N="86" /> similar lines.  I should make clear that Ireland's approach to involvement in the Petersberg tasks of peacekeeping or humanitarian operations in no sense entails any mutual defence commitments that would be incompatible with Ireland's policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, in the context of preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference, various possible institutional options for future EU-WEU relations have so far been identified.  In the Reflection Group report, which was presented to the Madrid European Council on 15-16 December 1995, and in the Western European Union contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference, which was adopted by the Western European Union's full member states at the Western European Union Ministerial Council in Madrid on 14 November 1995, a range of possible options have been identified.</P>
    <P>The options so far identified range from maintaining the EU and Western European Union as seperate organisations, but with enhanced co-operation between them, through to proposals for eventual full merger.  Both the Reflection Group report and the Western European Union input for the Intergovernmental Conference have been useful in providing insight into the development of the positions of partners at this stage in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>A central question in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to determine how the CFSP provisions, including the EU-WEU relationship, can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security.  There is an emerging consensus that the EU should be better able to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management tasks in such areas as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.  It is possible that these peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks could provide a focus for the further development of the EU-WEU relationship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> At the Madrid meeting of the Western European Union on 14 November 1995, I commented on the acceptance by the Western European Union members in their contribution for the Intergovernmental Conference that a comprehensive definition of security is required, rather than an exclusively military one.  The Western European Union members also explicitly acknowledged that the Intergovernmental Conference will need to harness to the best effect the diverse contributions to security and defence that European nations are able to make, and that the national security and defence positions of each country must be respected.</P>
    <P>There is also an understanding that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference must be acceptable to people in each member state.  The Government's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations and to the Western European Union, will continue to be in harmony with our outlook and traditions and at the same time responsive to the new and still evolving challenges that face us in promoting peace, security and progress at the European and global level.</P>

    <P>The Government's concern about the effect of excessive arms exports, to developing countries as well as to regions of tension, is well understood by the international community including the United States.  The Government <Col N="88" /> attaches great importance to the eight common criteria which were identified by the European Councils of Luxembourg in 1991 and Lisbon in 1992 as the basis of the national arms export policies of EU member states.  The common criteria relate to factors such as the respect for international commitments and for human rights, the existence of tensions or conflict and the risk that arms or equipment would be diverted or re-exported under undesirable conditions. The common criteria form the basis of a set of principles on conventional arms exports to which all OSCE countries, including the United States, have subscribed.  At the United Nations, Ireland is continuing its effort to broaden the political acceptance of certain principles which we think should apply in the field of international arms transfers.</P>
    <P>Under the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, member states are encouraged to inform and consult each other increasingly on matters of arms export policy.  They are endeavouring to build a shared understanding of the application of the common criteria with a view to developing more effective controls on the export of arms from EU countries.  In this context, Ireland's overriding concern is the promotion of responsibility and restraint in the matter of arms exports, especially to developing countries.  We are in favour of reducing over-armament through restraint in all conventional arms transfers. However, conventional arms transfers are seen by certain other countries as legitimate instruments in the service of broad foreign policy goals, with particular reference to regional peace and stability.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that, with strong US support, work is at an advanced stage on a new co-operative arrangement, to be known as the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies.  The participants in the Wassenaar Agreement, which include the world's major arms producers, will seek to ensure <i>inter alia</i>, <Col N="89" /> that their transfers of arms and dual use goods do not contribute to military capabilities which undermine regional and international peace and security.</P>

      <P>The Framework Document describes the shared understanding of the Irish and British Governments on the parameters of a possible outcome of the process of negotiations between the two Governments and the northern parties.  While it is intended as an aid to negotiations and not as rigid blueprint to be imposed, both Governments believe it sets out a realistic, balanced and achievable framework for agreement.</P>
      <P>On its publication in February 1995, both Governments offered the Framework Document for consideration and strongly commended it to the parties, the people in the island of Ireland and more widely.  It has since then been widely read and debated in this House, at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The arrangements envisaged in the Framework Document can only be implemented if they are agreed in substantive all-party negotiations which arrive at a comprehensive settlement, based on consent, covering relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.  The Government has been energetically working towards the convening of such negotiations since before the Framework Document was adopted, and it is our firm aim that they should be launched by the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Last year the Government disbursed a total of £150,000 for medical programmes in the Chernobyl region.  This assistance was channelled throught the World Health Organisation and to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  The first grant of £75,000 was allocated to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to support a medical programme for early identification and treatment of children with thyroid cancer in Chernobyl.  In August we also responded to the World Health Organisation's appeal to contain the diphtheria epidemic which has broken out in the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and the other newly independent states in recent years.  The Government's donation of £75,000 was targeted at the worst affected areas in Belarus and the Ukraine.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the excellent work carried out by voluntary groups in Ireland, set up in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion, which focus on the special needs of affected children in the region.  Their activities include arranging summer holidays in Ireland for up to 250 children from Chernobyl and last year Government funding for the holiday programme was made available by my Department and by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Further appeals for assistance to the Chernobyl region will be viewed sympathetically by my Department.</P>

      <P>The sanctions on Iraq were imposed by the UN Security Council after the Gulf War as a consequence of the consistent refusal of Saddam Hussein's regime to comply with Security Council resolutions, which were aimed at bringing about the dismantling of Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and the ending of its massive violations of human rights. While I am very concerned at reports of a sharp deterioration in the food and nutrition situation in Iraq, especially as this affects children, I must point out that the Security Council has adopted a number of resolutions allowing Iraq to export substantial quantities of oil in order to fund the purchase of food, medicine and other items for essential civilian use.  The most recent such resolution was Security Council Resolution 986 which was adopted in April last and which considerably expanded the terms under which Iraq could sell oil for this purpose.  It was intended that this resolution, like its predecessors, would relieve the suffering of the civilian population.  Iraq must comply fully with all relevant Security Council resolutions as this is the only means whereby lasting peace and stability can be established in Iraq and the Gulf region.  I, therefore, very much welcome the recent announcement that the Iraqi authorities intend to start talks with the UN Secretary General today on implementing the oil for food formula, which is the basis of Resolution 986.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to her question of 7 December that any consideration of measures to restrict trade would have to be undertaken initially in the European Union and would have to have regard to our obligations as a contracting party to the GATT/WTO.  There have been efforts to include the issue of labour standards in the agenda of the World Trade Organisation.  These efforts have <Col N="95" /> given rise to fears that labour standards could be used as a pretext for trade protectionism. Ireland favours the examination of this issue in a transparent and multilateral way which is not protectionist.</P>
      <P>While the Union's common commercial policy and its relations with the WTO are primarily matters for my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, I should like to add that the EU has taken a number of measures relevant to this general issue.  First, special incentive arrangements under the EU Generalised System of Preferences shall be applied, with effect from 1998, to those countries which abide by ILO Conventions on, <i>inter alia,</i> the minimum age for entry into employment.  Second, all new EU agreements with third counties will contain provisions committing both sides to respect democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and providing for measures, up to and including the suspension of the agreement, if such provisions are violated.  Third, the EU/US Joint Action Plan, signed in Madrid on 3 December 1995, commits both sides to work together &ldquo;in the WTO and other fora with a view to dissipating various misunderstandings and preoccupations of trading partners regarding the relationship between trade and internationally recognised labour standards.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The peace agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was concluded between the parties on 21 November and signed in Paris <Col N="96" /> on 14 December, is now being implemented.  A wide range of international organisations have a role in assisting with and monitoring its implementation. These include the Office of the High Representative, Carl Bildt, the United Nations, and the international Implementation Force, IFOR.</P>
      <P>To date, two reports on the operations of IFOR have been transmitted to the United Nations Security Council, the most recent of these on 23 January. On that date, the assessment of the IFOR command was that a spirit of good co-operation was continuing between the parties and the Implementation Force and that substantial progress had been made in complying with the terms of the peace agreement.  Overall, the country-wide cease-fire was continuing to hold firm and the number of breaches of the ceasefire was diminishing. Most importantly, the parties had, by 19 January &mdash; the deadline specified under the agreement &mdash; complied with the requirement to withdraw their forces from the 4 kilometre wide zone of separation.  Considerable progress had been made with regard to mine clearance, although, due to the scale of the problem, it had not been possible for this to be completed by the same date.  The assessment was that the parties were also making every effort to ensure that all foreign forces leave Bosnia and Herzegovina as required by the agreement.</P>
      <P>However, on one issue, that of prisoner releases, there was non-compliance on all sides.  The terms of the agreement specified that all prisoners should be released on 19 January.  In the event, 217 prisoners were exchanged under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), leaving some 645 still detained.  Intensive negotiations, involving the High Representative, the ICRC and IFOR, ensued and most of the remaining prisoners were freed on 27 and 28 January. The issue of some 37 prisoners who should have been freed, but remain in detention, continues to be a cause of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> With regard to civilian aspects of the implementation of the agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the High Representative has been reporting regularly to the EU Council of Foreign Ministers on this issue, most recently on 29 January. Arrangements to co-ordinate the efforts of the many organisations which will be involved in the implementation of the non-military aspects of the agreement, including the Joint Civilian Commission within Bosnia and Herzegovina, are now in place.  Work in relation to ensuring the observance of human rights throughout that country is well under way.  Mechanisms for the channelling of rehabilitation and reconstruction aid are in place, and the most urgent work, concerned with the restoration of basic amenities, is going ahead in many locations.</P>
    <P>Tension persists over some issues, most notably over the future status of a member of Serb-populated suburbs of Sarajevo which are to be restored to the control of the Bosnian Federation.  The high representative is working closely with the parties on confidence-building measures aimed at creating conditions under which the Serb population will feel that they can continue to reside in the Bosnian capital in safety.</P>
    <P>The deployment of the United Nations International Police Task Force will be an important contribution to this effort, as well as to the broader effort towards fully implementing the civilian aspects of the agreement.  The Government has made available an Assistant Garda Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald, for the post of Commissioner of the Task Force.  He has already assumed his duties in Sarajevo.</P>
    <P>The implementation of other provisions of the agreement, including steps towards the establishment of new constitutional structures by the parties within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the task of assessing the suitability of conditions for elections &mdash; which is being carried out by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), assisted by the European Community <Col N="98" /> Monitor Mission (ECMM) &mdash; and negotiations on confidence and security-building measures and arms control measures in the context of regional stabilisation arrangements, are proceeding well at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the lead agency concerned with assistance to refugees and displaced persons.  The UNHCR has prepared a plan for the phased return of these people, in safety and on a voluntary basis.  The parties have accepted this plan, and the various international organisations involved in the implementation of the agreement, including the EU and its member states, stand ready to assist in putting it into operation.</P>
    <P>With regard to Croatia, an agreement was reached on 12 November between the Croatian Government and the Serbs who have control of the Eastern Slavonia region of that country.  Under the terms of this Agreement, Eastern Slavonia will revert to the control of the Croatian Government after a transition period.  During this period, the United Nations Transitional Administration, which was established by a UN Security Council resolution on 15 January, will ensure implementation of the agreement. The transitional administration will have both military and civilian components. A ceasefire which is in force in and around Eastern Slavonia is holding, with only sporadic breaches.</P>
    <P>Serbia was less directly affected by the fighting in former Yugoslavia.  Sanctions which had been in force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, were suspended by the United Nations Security Council following signature of the peace agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina by President Milosevic.  However, the situation regarding respect for human and minority rights in the federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and particularly in those areas where there is a significant non-Serb population, including Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandjak, continues to be of concern, and is being <Col N="99" /> pursued at every opportunity by the EU with the authorities in Belgrade.</P>

      <P>Permission is granted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, for foreign military aircraft to land in the State.  Permission is granted subject to acceptance by the requesting government that certain conditions must be met, the most important of which are that the relevant aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of military exercises or operations.</P>
      <P>Application for permission to land is made by the embassy of the applicant country accredited to Ireland.  The application procedure involves the provision of detailed technical information with regard to aircraft specification, crew, cargo and flight plan.  Each application is examined and cleared by the technical Departments concerned before permission is granted.</P>
      <P>Under these procedures a total of 342 requests for permission for foreign military aircraft to land in the State were received in 1995.  All requests conformed to the requirements which I have outlined and permission was granted in each case.</P>

      <P>In fulfilment of our obligations my officials, Ministers of State, and I travel to meetings and conferences abroad on a regular basis, particularly in the context of our membership of the European Union and the United Nations.  Diplomats posted abroad are obliged to travel regularly within and between the countries to which they are accredited.  My Department also incurs costs which arise from presidential and official visits and from transfers of officers between posts.</P>
      <P>My Department's provision for this purpose in 1995 under the Foreign Affairs Vote was £3.863 million in total. The provisional outturn in 1995 amounts to a total of £3.321 million.  Not all travel costs arising in a particular year can be brought to account within the same year.  Of the travel costs charged in 1995 some will fall to 1994 and equally some 1995 costs can only be charged in 1996.</P>
      <P>Total travel costs charged in 1995 from the Vote for the Office of the Tánaiste were £47,000 from a provision of £60,000.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, every effort is made to keep the cost of departmental travel to the minimum necessary.  Since my appointment I have been conscious of the need to keep expenditure on ministerial travel to the minimum consistent with the appropriate discharge of my responsibilities as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The costs charged in relation to my private office in 1995 show a saving of 54 per cent on the allocation under this heading.</P>

      <P>The first priority of official development assistance is to provide assistance to poorer developing countries.  This assistance is designed to meet basic needs and to contribute to long-term economic and social development. There is also an emphasis that the assistance provided is both targeted and cost-effective.</P>
      <P>Irish aid projects are subjected to regular reviews and evaluation from sectoral experts within the Development Co-operation Division.  They are also subject to the scrutiny of Dáil Committees such as the Public Accounts Committee and the ODA sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and to review by international bodies such as the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.  Agencies in receipt of public moneys for emergency assistance and from the NGO co-financing scheme are required to produce reports on how the moneys are spent.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Irish aid programme is producing good results.  It is also my concern to ensure that the money spent both bilaterally and multilaterally reaches its targets and is used in the most effective way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method for making voluntary contributions to international agencies is the best available and I am satisfied that all pertinent factors and information are taken fully into account in the course of deciding allocations.  Allocations are made following a process of careful consideration which involves inputs from a wide range of sources including, in the case of UN development agencies, the Department's permanent missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva.  The performance of the international development <Col N="102" /> agencies concerned are carefully monitored on an ongoing basis, and their policies and assistance programmes are assessed in terms of their relevance to the needs of the developing countries and their effectiveness in addressing those needs.</P>

      <P>The only relevant information available is in respect of recipients of social welfare pensions, of whom some 32,000 individuals aged 65 years or over are estimated to have taxable incomes.</P>
      <P>Income tax statistics do not distinguish between the amounts of tax that arise from pensions and from other sources.  In 1994-95 terms the amount of all types of social welfare pension income returned by individuals aged 65 years or over who were liable to tax is estimated at approximately £139 million. The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>

However, there is a large measure of uncertainty regarding trend output measurement.  Indeed the relevance of the concept for a small highly open economy such as Ireland is open to question.

      <P>Ireland's system of indirect taxation is already grounded in EU law both in <Col N="105" /> relation to excise duties and value added tax.  The EU rules were agreed in the run up to the 1993 Single Market. There is no necessary connection between the introduction of a single currency and the EU rules on indirect taxation.</P>
      <P>With regard to excise duties, there are definitive harmonised EU rules for production, holding and movement of excisable goods in the Community. These rules specifically relate to tobacco, hydrocarbons and alcholic drinks.  There are also EU harmonised rules governing the structure of excise duties on these products and the minimum rates which member states must apply.  The Irish excise duties regime operates satisfactorily within the framework set by these EU rules, which allows member states to set their own rates of duty provided that they respect the minimum rate.</P>
      <P>As regards value-added tax, the entire system, including the rating structure, is governed by EU VAT law.  The main legal instrument is the Sixth VAT Directive.</P>
      <P>The rules on VAT rating were agreed at European level in the run up to the 1993 Single Market.  The main features are as follows: a single standard rate of at least 15 per cent applicable to most goods and services; the option of applying one or two reduced rates (subject to a minimum of 5 per cent) to certain specified goods and services (we have one reduced rate of 12.5 per cent); application of a reduced rate for restaurant meals and housing if member states applied such a rate to these items on 1 January 1991 &mdash; we are availing of this facility; application of a &ldquo;parking rate&rdquo; of at least 12 per cent to goods and services which were at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991 but which are not on the reduced rate list.  This is a transitional measure only: these goods and services are ultimately destined to be standard rated &mdash; we availed of this facility for certain labour intensive services; retention on a transitional basis of existing zero-rates and super-reduced rates, such as our special livestock rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> Our standard rate is currently 21 per cent.  This is not significantly out of line with other countries in Europe; in the enlarged Union, the arithmetic average of the standard rates is about 19 per cent.  Three member states have rates higher than ours.  Moreover, our standard rate has been reduced considerably in recent years from 25 per cent in 1990 and a sizeable proportion of Irish business enjoys the benefit of zero or reduced rating; only 52 per cent of the VAT base is standard rated.</P>
    <P>The present transitional VAT system for intra-Community trade is based on taxation in the country of destination. The directive envisages that this will ultimately be replaced by a definitive system based in principle on taxation in the country of origin of the goods or services supplied.  It is generally accepted that such a system would involve a closer convergence of rates within the Union.  A discussion paper from the European Commission in relation to the definitive system may be produced later this year but the target date of 1 January, 1997, for the introduction of the definitive system seems unlikely to be met.  The Commission and the majority of member states consider that the transitional system is working well.  Under the terms of the directive the transitional system will continue in operation until the Council has decided on the definitive arrangements.</P>

    <P>According to the Revenue Commissioners, random audits are selected from within the self-assessment system applying to companies and self-employed individuals.  Each such audit includes a comprehensive examination of the liability to other taxes such as PAYE, VAT and capital gains tax in addition to income tax and corporation tax.  It is not possible to distinguish any additional tax yield which may arise in these audits between the different taxes. The results of the random audit programme for 1995 to date are incomplete. In the interest of completeness, the figures supplied relate to audits initiated in both the years 1994 and 1995.  The number of random audits initiated in those years was 184.  These included some companies but the bulk related to self-employed persons.  The number of those audits completed to date are 119, with just over 70 per cent assessed as having no additional tax liability.  These figures include the results for farmers which are 27 audits completed to date with 85 per cent found to have no additional tax liability.</P>
    <P>Notes on table</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (a)</i>
    </P>
    <P> (i)  The average tax payment is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in the calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1995 net receipt is divided by the estimated number liable to tax in 1995-96.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The figures in column (a) of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax <Col N="108" /> on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals. </P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (b)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers in the calendar year has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units which were formally assessed for tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1995 receipt is divided by the estimated number assessed for the year 1995-96, irrespective of whether tax was actually payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The current figure for average tax payment does not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession.  Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures show for tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated. </P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in the calendar year from tax units whose main sources of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" />
      <i>General Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P> (i)  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.  </P>

        <b>):</b> The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based &lsquo;good neighbour&rsquo; scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community services.  Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  This gratuity is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.</P>
      <P>The payments made to home helps vary throughout the country and the rates are determined by the particular requirements and type of task undertaken. It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each health board is in the best position to decide on these issues and my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation of the home help service came under scrutiny in a report <Col N="110" /> commissioned and published by the National Council for the Elderly in November 1994.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, is currently considering a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the variations from board to board.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> There were 12 patients on trolleys in the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital on the night of 29-30 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> The number of patients in the accident and emergency department awaiting admission can vary considerably depending on the overall workload of the hospital at any given time. However, it has been estimated that since early October 1995 the number of patients per day diagnosed in need of admission and waiting more that six hours for a bed was nine.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency department of Beaumont provides a 24 hour service.  Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention. Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the avilability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.  In addition, funding has been provided to Beaumont Hospital to develop a 12 bed observation ward adjacent to the accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>All patients, while in the accident and emergency department, are under the care of medical and nursing staff.  The hospital ensures that patients are made as comfortable as possible and this includes the provision of food to patients while they are awaiting a hospital bed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of reports of alleged cases of child abuse received by health boards on an annual basis is in excess of 4,000.  The procedures followed by health boards in pursuing allegations of child abuse are in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department in 1987 and the guidelines for the &ldquo;Notification of Suspected Cases of Child Abuse between Health Boards and Gardaí&rdquo; which amend the 1987 guidelines.  These guidelines do not require health boards to routinely notify the Department of individual allegations of abuse.</P>
      <P>In this context, therefore, I am replying to the Deputy on the present position in relation to major inquiries into suspected cases of child abuse, namely, the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the &ldquo;West of Ireland Farmer&rdquo; case and the Madonna House investigation.  The position in relation to the Kelly Fitzgerald case is that following the completion of the inquest in London into the death of the late Kelly Fitzgerald the Chief Executive Officer of the Western Health Board appointed an independent team to examine the Western Health Board's involvement with the child and her family. The inquiry team has submitted its report to the chief executive officer.  I understand that the chief executive officer is taking legal advice as to the legal implications of publishing the report.  It is my strong wish that the results of the inquiry be made public at the earliest possible moment and I have made my views known to the chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the health board concerned with the &ldquo;West of Ireland Farmer&rdquo; case that the work of the review group established to review the board's involvement in the case has been suspended on legal advice pending the outcome of civil legal action by the victims concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the investigation into the operation of Madonna House which was commissioned by the Sisters of Charity.  As I have already indicated to the House, <Col N="113" /> the report of this investigation was referred for legal advice with a view to determining how much of it could be published, without undue risk of legal complications.  In the light of the legal advice available to me on this matter my Department is preparing a report on the investigation.  This report will be ready shortly for referral to the Attorney General for clearance to publish.  It is not possible at this stage to give any indication as to when any of these reports will be discussed by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>The arts plan launched by An Chomhairle Ealaíon in February 1995 was formally adopted by the Government in November last.

I agreed with the Minister for Finance that the funding requirements <Col N="119" /> set out in the plan could be phased realistically over the five year period 1995-1999 rather than the three years as proposed.  An Chomhairle has agreed to recorder its priorities over five years starting in 1995.</P>
      <P>My success in securing a funding level of £18.4 million for An Chomhairle Ealaíon for 1996, an increase of some 13 per cent on the 1995 allocation, and of almost 86 per cent on the allocation for 1992, the year before I assumed responsibility for this area, shows the commitment of this Government to the long-term development of the arts in Ireland.  The level of funding that will be made available to An Chomhairle in 1997 will be decided in the context of the budgetary situation for that year.</P>

      <P>Leitrim County Council did not submit any application to my Department for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme, 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in February 1995, Leitrim County Council did write to me informing me that they had been advised that the former courthouse would not be suitable for restoration for use as civic offices, but would be suitable for use as an interpretative centre/museum, and that they had <Col N="120" /> therefore decided to proceed with the provision of new civic offices at another location in Carrick-on-Shannon.  They requested that consideration be given to the Office of Public Works taking over the courthouse for development as an interpretative centre, with particular reference to interpretation of the Shannon-Erne Navigation.</P>
    <P>In August 1995, I wrote to Leitrim County Council, informing them that I had been advised by the waterways services that the State heritage services already owned waterfront property upstream and downstream of Carrick-on-Shannon bridge, and also owned associated office etc. premises in Rooskey where there was ample space for development.  I also stated that the best option for the preservation of the building was to keep it in active use as a courthouse.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, I was informed by the Minister for Justice that the cost of restoration of the building for continued use as a courthouse would substantially exceed the cost of constructing a new courthouse and was therefore not a viable option.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that it was not possible in this case to provide for the continued use of the building as a courthouse, as finding new and appropriate uses for old buildings such as this is difficult.</P>
    <P>Leitrim County Council may wish to seek the advice and assistance of the statutory Heritage Council, which I appointed last year under the Heritage Act, 1995, in relation to the future use and preservation of the building.  The address of the Heritage Council is 4-5 Harcourt Road, Dublin 1 (Telephone 01-4752736, Fax 01-4752739).</P>

      <P>The overall archaeological survey of County Sligo is well advanced.  In 1990 the first phase, &ldquo;The County Sligo Sites and Monuments Record&rdquo;, was completed.  The second phase of the Sligo survey, involving detailed fieldwork for the entire county, has also been completed.</P>
      <P>Fieldwork serves two principal purposes. Fundamentally it generates an archive of material on a site-by-site basis, which is of enormous, practical assistance to the task of recording, researching and protecting monuments, and also to the planning consultation process.  As a secondary function, the completed fieldwork provides the basis for an &ldquo;Archaeological Inventory&rdquo; publication</P>
      <P>The Sligo Inventory will be published in two volumes and preliminary drafting will shortly be completed on the first volume.  The second volume is unlikely to be scheduled for this preliminary drafting until 1997, on account of the more immediate fieldwork priorities elsewhere.  When the drafts are written up the Inventory volumes will require to be edited and prepared for publication. At this stage it is not possible to say when the Inventory volumes will be published but there will be no undue delay.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, a local development plan must indicate the development objectives for the area including objectives for preserving, improving and extending amenities.  In this context, amenities can include open spaces; game and bird sanctuaries; buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest; plasterwork, staircases, woodwork or other internal fixtures and features of artistic, historical or architectural interest; places and features of natural beauty and interest; and caves, sites, features and other objects of archaeological, geological or historic interest.  Planning control and other powers are available to local authorities for the purpose of achieving these objectives.</P>

    <P>In pursuance of commitments in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> an interdepartmental working group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works has been established to examine and report back with recommendations on improving the <Col N="132" /> arrangements for the protection of listed buildings.  On the basis of that report consideration will be given to introducing changes to the Planning and Development Acts in order to give better protection to buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  The question of issuing guidelines, etc., will also be dealt with in this context.</P>

      <P>I allocated 55 remedial teaching posts to primary schools with effect from September 1995.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data by my Department's primary inspectorate. This allocation brings the total number of remedial teachers now in place in the primary sector to 1,188.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the question of further appointments in this area under regular review as resources become available. The needs of all schools, including the schools to which the Deputies referred, will be considered within this context. My Department has no record of an application for a remedial teacher post for the school to which Deputy Kitt referred.</P>

      <P>Records indicate that over 450 applications seeking grant aid under the sports capital programme were received in my Department in 1995.  In addition, approximately 1,000 <Col N="140" /> applications were on hand from previous years.  The estimated total grant aid sought from all of these applications amounted to £62 million.  I am not in a position to furnish the Deputy with a list of all applications received or to provide details of applicants who did not receive a grant allocation as this would place a serious strain on scarce staff resources.</P>
      <P>A tabular statement of the organisations who were successful in obtaining a grant allocation under this programme in 1995 is contained in the Official Report of 23 January 1996 in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 357.  Grants were paid in respect of a variety of projects under the sports capital and current programmes such as the construction of community-sports centres, club premises, pitch development, dressing rooms, scout dens and youth clubs and projects funded through Vocational Education Committees.</P>
      <P>In 1995, my Department considered thirty applications from clubs-organisations in County Louth seeking grant aid under the sports capital programme to the value of £1.1 million.  Projects were selected in ten counties for funding under the major facilities scheme. While County Louth was not one of these counties, nevertheless, 2.8 per cent of the funds available in 1995 under the recreation facilities scheme was allocated to projects in the county.  This percentage allocation compares favourably with the percentage which would accrue to the county on a national population basis.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not maintained in such a way that would enable me to give precise details of the percentage of lottery funding allocated to the county in 1995, I can say, however, that County Louth received 1.6 per cent of the total value of grant aid approved under both the sports capital programme and the vocational education committee youth and sport grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the youth sector specifically, it is not possible to produce meaningful statistics on a county basis given the nature of the funding arrangements. A large proportion of overall funding is <Col N="141" /> allocated to national bodies of the various voluntary youth organisations and local units are assisted by these national bodies in a variety of ways, including direct grant aid.  It is not possible to quantify the level of grant expenditure specifically in any one county.  However, two projects for disadvantaged young people in the Muirhevnamore and Coxes Demesne areas of Dundalk are funded through the National Youth Federation under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth.  Grants to these projects for 1995 amounted to £48,333 or 0.8 per cent of total grants under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department has no direct function in the day to day affairs of any university.  I have, however, made inquiries in the matter through the Higher Education Authority which maintains a continuous review of the sector.</P>
      <P>I understand that the BA programme referred to is a University of Limerick standard undergraduate degree programme. It incorporates an off-campus element by way of academic placement or approved work placement.  Such placements are an integral element of all programmes run by the university and are resource intensive in that they involve the development of the placements, their supervision and their subsequent evaluation.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the fee levels for the programme are in line with the fees in other universities for similar programmes. While the cost of the programme varies from year to year, the actual fee charged is much the same for each year of the programme.  Students following the programme have access to all of the normal services provided by the University Co-operative Education Division through the placement officer at Mary Immaculate College of Education.</P>

      <P>There are no island schools currently included in the disadvantaged areas schemes.  Under present arrangements schools are selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of a range of criteria agreed between my Department, schools' management and the teacher unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing occupancy and medical card holders among the parents of <Col N="144" /> the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios among applicant schools.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has, at my request, carried out a review of current approaches to the selection and support of schools in disadvantaged areas.  Arising from this review, consideration is now being given to the appropriate criteria to be applied in the future selection of schools for disadvantaged status.  The needs of all schools will be considered in the context of any further expansion of the disadvantaged areas schemes which may be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that in 1994, I took a particular initiative in relation to communication technology for island schools.  In the case of the 14 schools designated as island schools, arrangements were made for the installation of telephones, fax facilities, modems, computers and printers.  My Department's inspectorate is in continuing contact with these schools to offer support and guidance to them in utilising this additional equipment to best effect.</P>

      <P>Primary or second-level schools are not required to notify my Department of cases where children are suspended or otherwise excluded from schools and, consequently, I am not in a position to supply the Deputy with the information she has requested.  Under the rules for national schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative <Col N="145" /> arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problem of children who are not attending school because they have been expelled or excluded from second-level schools and the related difficulties this presents for both schools and parents.  The managerial authorities of second-level schools are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
      <P>Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school. Accordingly, the most effective method of countering indiscipline is for each individual school to draw up its own code of behaviour.  In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued <i>Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline</i> together with <i>A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline</i> to all schools.  Within these guidelines individual boards are given the discretion to work out specific details.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only as a last resort and I am satisfied that schools also see it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behavour and where alternative arrangements need to be made.  In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through its Inspectorate to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school or alternatively, his-her placement in another school.  In more difficult situations, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine <Col N="146" /> the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner. Programmes such as Youth Encounter Projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 143 and 144 together. The Deputy will be aware that in early 1994 I accepted the recommendations of Dr. Bannon's report and decided not to proceed with the construction of a post-primary school for the Knockylon area. Following this decision, the question of the disposal of the site arose.  A senior official from my Department met the county manager of South County Dublin Council, primarily to ascertain if that council had an interest in purchasing the site for other purposes.  The response was negative.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding further, I asked that the position regarding the need for a school be re-examined by Dr. Bannon, in the light of the Knockylon post-primary committee's response to the original report and the assessment of it carried out by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp at the request of the committee.  This examination is now completed and the conclusion is that no new information emerged in either the committee's response to the original report or in the assessment carried out by Mr. van der Kamp which would justify a change of decision.  Dr. Bannon is satisfied that the latest information available was used to arrive at the conclusions and recommendations in his 1994 report and in his more recent review.</P>
      <P>As I undertook in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 29 November last, a meeting to explain the outcome of the review can be arranged with officials from my Department.  Any plans to dispose of the Scholarstown Road site will, of necessity, take some time and therefore the site will not be disposed of in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The free fees initiative and the third-level student support schemes facilitate students with limited means who wish to progress to third-level. It is recognised, however, that ensuring greater access to third-level by students from disadvantaged backgrounds is not solely a matter of costs at third-level.  Fuller participation in third-level depends on ensuring retention of students in full-time education up the age of 18.  To achieve this I have taken a range of initiatives.  These include: targeting of resources at first and second-level on disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for first and second-level students including psychological and guidance services, career guidance and remedial teachers; the continuing development of the home-school links programme; a <Col N="150" /> major re-structuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt them to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle; and the introduction of alternative pathways for students to progress to post-second-level education and training.</P>
      <P>I have also supported the development of links between disadvantaged schools and third-level institutions. These links include initiatives involving Trinity College and Dublin City University and a number of disadvantaged schools in Dublin.  These links are in line with the commitment in the White Paper which indicates that, &ldquo;Each third-level institution will be encouraged to develop links with designated second-level schools, building on existing good practice&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy in regard to special arrangements for candidates with disabilities is outlined in a comprehensive circular which was issued to schools on 1 November 1994, following the deliberations of a Departmental review group.  I will make arrangements for a copy of this circular to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The circular introduced a number of changes to the existing system.  Schools were informed that applications for special arrangements would have to be made much earlier than hitherto.  They were also informed that decisions would be issued much earlier than hitherto and that an independent body would be established to consider appeals against decisions.</P>
      <P>The appeals committee consists of five members, three from outside the Department, including the chairperson and two from the Department.  The Department personnel are not involved in making decisions on the original applications.</P>

      <P>The matter of the development of the network of education centres is currently under active consideration.

      <P>Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, is obliged to do so in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools.  This inevitably means that the time-table often requires some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings. This is, and has always been, a feature of the school transport scheme as operated throughout the country.  Every effort is made, however, to keep waiting times to a minimum.</P>
      <P>With approximately 2,500 vehicles involved each day in operating the school transport scheme, it is inevitable that the occasional delay or breakdown will occur.  I can assure the Deputy that all reasonable steps are taken to minimise such problems.  The condition of the school bus fleet is continually monitored, and stringent checks are put in place to provide the most reliable service possible.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for a full-scale review of the school transport scheme, and a committee to carry out this review has recently been set up.  This committee will examine all aspects of the operation of the scheme, and I expect that its report and recommendations will be available later in the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that for the current year, 1995-96 the vocational education committees are administering the vocational education committee scholarship scheme to third-level institutions.  As I have already announced in this House, I do not now intend to proceed with the establishment of a central agency to administer third level student grants as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support.</P>
      <P>I still consider that rationalisation of the organisational arrangements for the administration of student support is desirable and necessary.  However, I believe a central agency would not be in a position to give grant applicants a service which was sufficiently accessible and user-friendly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> The option which I am now considering, of making the regional education boards envisaged in the White Paper responsible for administering student support, may be the option which would best balance the need to rationalise cost-effectively the administration of student support with the need to ensure a service which is user-friendly and accessible.  However, as the boards will be set up on a gradual basis, it is not possible at this stage to say when they would be in a position to take over the administration of the student support schemes.  The Irish Vocational Education Association will be consulted about this matter shortly.</P>

      <P>Examination entry fees are in existence in order to defray in part the cost of running the certificate examinations.  Examinations entry fees cover only part of the costs involved.  It is expected that about £6 million in fees will be collected in respect of the 1996 examinations but the cost of running the examinations will come to about £14 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department operates a number of measures in order to alleviate hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees and to reduce any disincentive for those intending to sit the examinations.  In the case of necessitous pupils, the ordinary fee payable may be reduced at the discretion of the school principal and subject to a maximum notified to each school or vocational education committee by my Department. My Department has made <Col N="156" /> £500,000 available to schools and vocational education committees for this purpose in connection with the 1996 examinations.  This amount is greater than the amount allocated in 1995 by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of fee alleviation, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment; prolonged illness of parent; large family with inadequate means; single parent; more than one child from the same family doing the certificate examinations; and other circumstances that would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    <P>A special entry fee of £125 is payable in respect of a candidate who remains in school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate examination.  A course fee of £100 is also payable in respect of such candidates.  Where, however, the parent or guardian of a candidate repeating the examination is the holder of a current medical card, the course fee is waived and only the ordinary fee of £46 is payable.  I should add that a candidate attending school with a view to repeating the leaving certificate and who was already due to pay a reduced fee arising from possession of a medical card, could have the fee further reduced at the discretion of the school authority under the scheme for the alleviation of examination fees as described above.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 34 on 14 December 1995.  As stated in reply to that question, the Cannes European Council mandated a group of experts to submit to the Madrid European Council an analytical report dealing with the <Col N="158" /> measures to be taken to ensure practical implementation of the medium-term plan to combat drugs which was approved by the Cannes Council.  The Madrid European Council approved the expert report and stressed the urgency of translating these guidelines into precise, co-ordinated operational activities within the Union.</P>
      <P>The Madrid Council invited the incoming Italian Presidency, in collaboration with the future Irish Presidency and after consultation with the member states, the Commission, the Europol Drugs Unit and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, to prepare a programme of activities which takes account of the guidelines in that report.  The Dublin European Council will examine progress in the application of that report.</P>
      <P>An <i>ad hoc</i> group has been established to oversee the translation of the recommendations of the expert report into co-ordinated operational activities within the Union.  This group will oversee a series of practical measures aimed at demand reduction, the reduction of illicit trafficking, international co-operation, and co-ordination between national authorities, EU institutions and international organisations.  Measures to combat illicit trafficking will focus on the Union's external borders, intra-EU actions, preventing the diversion of precursors, money laundering, training and judicial co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Madrid Council also mandated that a group be established to develop a mechanism for co-operation between the European Union and Latin America, including the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking.  This group is considering consumption, production, processing, transit, money laundering and trade of precursor chemicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Italian Presidency has begun implementing a joint declaration to combat drug trafficking agreed by the member states, the Commission and the Ministers of the Andean Group under the Spanish Presidency.  A meeting with the group is scheduled for March this year to consider practical <Col N="159" /> measures to tackle the fight against drugs e.g. illicit drugs production, the criminal organisations controlling the trafficking routes towards Europe, chemical precursors and EU training and assistance.</P>
    <P>As outlined in my previous reply, Ireland secured funding in excess of £200,000 for a pilot training exchange programme which focuses on the development of joint strategies, methods and closer co-operation in policing drug trafficking in the European Union.  The first phase of this programme commenced last week.  Delegates from the UK, France, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland exchanged views on operational measures to combat drugs trafficking and on informal co-operation between member states regarding such measures.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the question of providing a Garda station at Donaghmede has been carefully considered on many occasions. It has always been considered that an additional station in this area could not be justified and this still remains the position.</P>
      <P>There has been a Garda clinic for some time in Donaghmede which was closed while work was ongoing in the shopping centre.  The Garda clinic reopened on 1 February 1996, following construction work at the centre.  This clinic is located on the first floor of the centre and is open to the public six days a week at the following times:</P>

      <P>7.00 p.m.-8.00 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities point out that the drawback in opening a new Garda station, apart from the capital cost involved, is that it would divert personnel who could be better used in outdoor patrol duties.  The essential point they make is that it is far better to maximise <Col N="162" /> the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up personnel indoors in staffing a new Garda station.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the policing needs of the area are adequately catered for by personnel attached to the Coolock Station.  The Donaghmede area is constantly policed by two neighbourhood gardaí and by mobile patrols which include patrol cars and vans, the district detective unit, the divisional task force unit, the crime prevention unit and the drug unit at Coolock.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">

      <P>While under our criminal law the general rule is that a person is not required to answer any questions in connection with an offence of which he or she is suspected, it would not be correct to say that there is an unqualified right to silence. The general rule &mdash; which is in line with a general constitutional protection against self-incrimination &mdash; is subject to a number of statutory exceptions. The most recent of these were included in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. Sections 18 and 19 of that Act allow a court or jury to draw inferences from an accused's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters: marks on his or her person or clothing or presence in the vicinity of a crime.  These inferences cannot be drawn unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of failing or refusing to provide the relevant information might be.  While inferences can be treated as amounting to corroboration of other evidence the Act specifically provides that they cannot alone form the basis of a conviction.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that in this area of our law conflicting and competing rights are at issue.  On the one hand, it is argued that the right to silence is an old and important protection of a suspect's rights and that its removal could place in jeopardy those innocent of any crime.  On the other hand, the concerns which have been increasingly expressed in recent times to the effect that the present situation helps those involved in serious crimes to avoid conviction require that at the very least the law in this area is constantly kept under review in the light of changes that have taken place in the nature of crime and the nature of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> It is right to sound a note of caution in relation to any possible change in the law in this area: there are clear limits to what any such changes could achieve.  In particular, it is difficult to imagine any change in the law in this area which would not continue to provide that inferences from silence alone are not a sufficient basis for a conviction.  In other words, other evidence linking the suspect to the crime would also have to be available.  I mention this not to indicate any unwillingness on my part to consider further changes in the law in this area but to emphasise that we should be realistic about what such changes might achieve.</P>
    <P>A further major consideration in this area is that there is a developing body of jurisprudence under the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination is an implicit element to the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention and that this, in turn, has implications for the exercise of the right to silence.  Some key cases in this area await to be decided at present which are likely to have implications for any legislative changes which might be proposed in this area.  I will, of course, have the judgments in these cases fully examined once they become available.</P>

      <Col N="167" /> The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, came into operation on 15 December 1995.  It increases the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the courts.  On 30 January 1996 I obtained Government approval for the appointment of 15 additional judges, that is, three to the Supreme Court; two to the High Court; seven to the Circuit Court and three to the District Court.  These appointments will be made as soon as possible.  I have written to the Chief Justice requesting that the Judicial Appointments Board should recommend to me, as soon as possible, a list of suitable candidates for the appointment to the various courts in accordance with the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>The gardaí at Mary Street currently operate out of a porta-cabin type building erected in the rear yard of the old station which was closed due to its dangerous condition in 1987.  It is proposed to build a new Garda station at Mayorstone to accommodate the gardaí at Mary Street and Mayorstone.  The Office of Public Works are in the process of finalising the purchase of the site.  Plans for the new station have been drawn up and these will be finalised in <Col N="168" /> the near future.  It is not possible to say at this stage when work will commence on the building but there will be no avoidable delay.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the concerns of the elderly living in the area I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the police service in the locality is comparable to that in other parts of the city.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the opening hours of Ballybofey Garda station were changed in March 1995.  The station is now open to the public from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday inclusive and from midday to 2 p.m. on Sundays.  This change in opening hours was introduced to provide a more efficient service to the public. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that any increase in opening hours would involve having more gardaí in the station, with a corresponding <Col N="172" /> reduction in the number of gardaí available for policing duties on the streets. The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current opening hours at Ballybofey in conjunction with the direct communication link and the telephone call diversion system provide for the most efficient and effective policing service to the local community.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are not convinced that the opening of a new Garda station at Portrane-Donabate is justified at this time. They point out that the difficulty with opening a new Garda station, apart from the capital cost involved, is that it would absorb personnel which could be better used on outdoor patrol duties. The essential point they make is that it is far better to maximise the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up personnel indoors in staffing a new Garda station.  The Portrane and Donabate areas form part of the Swords sub-district and are policed from Swords station on a 24-hour basis.  Patrols are regularly carried out by uniformed patrol cars, detective vehicles and drug and task force patrols.  In addition, the community Garda service has been recently extended to provide two such community gardaí who have the use of a community police van to assist them in carrying out their duties.  The community gardaí also hold a clinic each week at the Portrane Credit Union office and they also provide crime prevention advice to the public on local radio.</P>

    <P>I should point out that prior to 1989 Garda recruits were included in the overall strength figures.  Since April 1989, with the introduction of the two year training programme for recruits, only those members who have been attested to the force, that is to say, completed phase 3 of training, are included in the overall strength of the force. There are 436 recruits in phases 1, 2 and 3 of training at present.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputies' attention to the replies provided to similar questions on 23 January 1996.  I reject any suggestion that I misled the House in regard to this matter.  The procedures followed by me in making these appointments were strictly in accordance with the standard practice to date, by current and previous office holders going back to 1973. Accordingly, announcement of these posts within the Department, or to staff unions, or by public advertisement, did not arise.</P>
      <P>The <i>Forum</i> document referred to is not a magazine.  It is an internal Democratic Left newsletter circulated privately and free of charge.  The notice in <i>Forum</i> relating to my staff appointments could not be regarded as an advertisement in the commonly accepted sense of that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> Two of the people appointed worked previously, but not recently, for Democratic Left public representatives.  Two have assisted our representatives at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Some have done voluntary work from time to time for Democratic Left.  The five people concerned were selected by me from some 25 applicants on the basis of their expertise.  One was, at the time of appointment, in a full-time job.  Three were in part-time or occasional work. One was unemployed.</P>
    <P>The posts were approved by Government in the normal way.  The appointments procedure involved no cost to public funds.  Provision for the staff salaries is made in the normal way under the Department's administrative budget: salaries subhead A1.</P>

    <P>Restrospective equal treatment payments are made to married women who were receiving certain social welfare <Col N="184" /> payments during the period December 1984 to November 1986.  The people concerned were among a number of married women who engaged the services of solicitors to initiate legal proceedings to obtain equal treatment arrears.  Arrears due on those claims were processed in accordance with a schedule agreed with counsel for the plaintiffs.  Court orders specified the dates on which computations were to be submitted to the relevant solicitors.  The orders provided for payments to be made within 14 days of the settlements being agreed.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the relevant court order, the computation of the arrears due to the people concerned was forwarded to their solicitors on 19 January 1996.  When the settlements are agreed, payments will be made through the solicitors within 14 days.  In the meantime, thay are advised to contact their solicitors regarding any inquiry they may have about their claim.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>The living alone allowance is an integral part of social welfare pensions and is payable to recipients aged 66 or over who live alone by way of an increase of those pensions.  There are no plans to create a similar payment to people in receipt of private occupational pensions.</P>

    <P>In last month's budget I announced a number of improvements in the free schemes of electricity allowance, telephone rental allowance and colour television licence.  From next July, these schemes will be extended to low income pensioners who do not qualify at present because they do not get a social welfare pension.  The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose will be the new maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension &mdash; £75 per week &mdash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.  Pensioners whose means are under these limits who only have access <Col N="186" /> to free travel at present will now, for the first time, have access to the other free schemes.</P>

The question of extending the scope of the living alone allowance to other categories, such as persons under 65 who are in receipt of blind pensions, would have financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of available resources.  In so far as people with disabilities are concerned, this matter will also be considered in the light of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated overpayments made to social welfare recipients in the year 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Details of overpayments made to social welfare recipients in respect of the year 1995 are being compiled at present and will not be available for some weeks.</P>
      <P>In the year 1994, 26,837 overpayments amounting to some £16 million were recorded by the Department of Social Welfare.  Overpayments arise due to a variety of reasons including fraud or suspected fraud on the part of claimants as well as errors in the provision of information and the processing of payments.  In 1994, £11.5 million, representing 11,040 cases, was recorded as being attributable to fraud or suspected fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the value of overpayments is <Col N="187" /> substantial in absolute terms, it represented less than half of 1 per cent of total scheme expenditure in 1994.  Similarly, the number of overpayments should be viewed in the context of the Department's scale of operations.  In this connection, there were some 823,000 recipients of a weekly social welfare payment at the end of 1994 and nearly 500,000 families were in receipt of child benefit.</P>
    <P>While every effort is made to recover overpayments, due regard must be had to the capacity of individuals to make repayments.  A total of £5.4 million was recovered in 1994 in respect of overpayments which occurred in that year and in earlier years.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the substantial loss of income suffered by Irish residents in receipt of United Kingdom pensions in view of the disadvantageous exchange rate; and the plans, if any, he has to have these pensioners paid in Irish punts.</Quest>

      <P>Exchange rates can fluctuate frequently.  In view of this and the fact that a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to reassess entitlement to old age non-contributory pension each time currency exchange rates move.  A realistic approach for resolving this problem has, therefore, been adopted by my Department. When calculating means based upon EU pensions, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism which is used within the EU in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age (non-contributory) pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions, who, for instance, may be waiting for the non-contributory old age pension application to be processed and who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he may wish to give me the details <Col N="189" /> so that the case can be investigated to ensure that the claimant is in receipt of his or her full entitlements.</P>
    <P>Since these are United Kingdom pensions they are paid in the currency of that country, i.e. sterling, in the same way as Irish pensioners abroad are paid in punts.  I have no plans to change the current means testing arrangements but the position is being kept under review.</P>

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3 is entitled either to a contributory old age pension or to a refund of social insurance contributions; if not, the reasons therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to either an old age contributory pension or a refund of social insurance contributions under current arrangements.</P>
      <P>To qualify for either an old age contributory pension or a retirement pension, a person must have entered social insurance at least 10 years before pension age, must have at least 156 contributions paid and must have a yearly average of not less than 20 relevant contributions (for old age contributory pensions) or 24 contributions (for retirement pension) paid or credited from 1953, or from the date of entry into insurance (whichever is the later) up to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislation, the period over which the yearly contribution average <Col N="193" /> for the person concerned was calculated for pension purposes was from 1953 to 1995.  The records of the Department show that he had a total of 364 reckonable social insurance contributions in that period, which is equivalent to a yearly average of only 8.  This is not sufficient to qualify him for an old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>His prior insurance from 1984 at the special class K PRSI rate, covering the health, employment and training levies only, is not reckonable for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>A person who fails to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension can be entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of any contributions paid, provided he or she aged 56 or over when entering social insurance for the first time.  These arrangements apply equally to employed and self-employed persons. As the person concerned entered social insurance for the first time before he was 56 years of age, taking his pre-1953 National Health insurance into account, he does not qualify for a refund of contributions under existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The regulations dealing with contribution refunds are under review in my Department at present.  The review is at an advanced stage and will be completed very shortly.  Situations such as that of the person concerned, where refunds are precluded when pre-1993 insurance is taken into account, are being reconsidered as part of this review.  The person concerned may be eligible for an old age non-contributory pension.  An application form for this pension issued to him on 5 February 1996.  On receipt of a completed application form, his entitlement will be examined and he will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1994 the Competition Authority refused to issue a licence or a certificate under the Competition Act, 1991 to the net book agreement &mdash; NBA &mdash; a voluntary agreement administerd by the UK Publishing Association whereby book publishers impose a minimum net price on the sale of most of their publications in the UK and in this State.  In its detailed and comprehensive decision, the authority noted that the NBA involved a degree of resale price maintenance and concluded that the weight of evidence indicated that resale price maintenance and restrictive of competition.  The authority concluded further that NBA did not contribute to improving the production of goods or the provision of services or to promoting technical or economic progress.  Consumers could not therefore share in such benefits and the restrictions could not be regarded as indispensable to the achievement of such objectives.  As UK published books accounted for a substantial proportion of books sold in Ireland and as most UK published books were net books, the Competition Authority found that the restrictions contained in the NBA eliminated competition in a substantial part of the market for books within the State.</P>
      <P>Under the Competition Act, 1991, an appeal against a negative decision by the authority is open to those aggrieved by way of judicial review.</P>
      <P>Those who favoured the retention of the NBA claimed that small or specialist book shops or publishers might be put at a disadvantage and that special interest titles might not get published if the resale price maintenance in the NBA were abolished.  These points were taken into account by the authority in reaching its decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the net book agreement has not, effectively, been in operation in Ireland since 1992.  I have no evidence to suggest that there have been untoward consequences as a result of the non-operation of the NBA since then.  On the contrary, the consumer is <Col N="195" /> now benefiting from lower prices on an increasing scale.</P>

      <P>Under the contract which was negotiated with ISPAT International and which was signed on 6 September 1995 ISPAT International entered a contractual commitment to employ a minimum of 331 full-time workers in Irish Steel for the first five year of their ownership of the company. The figure of 331 concurs with the level of employment that Irish Steel would have attained under its own agreed restructuring plan with some further investments.  The contractual commmitment with ISPAT International also <Col N="196" /> provides that it will pay to the State specified liquidated damages in the event that the number of full-time workers falls below 331.  The commitments of ISPAT International will be one of many items for discussion with the company over the next few weeks in the light of the restrictions on production and sales which were necessary to overcome UK objections in order to achieve unanimous approval of the State aid involved in the Irish Steel restructuring plan under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.</P>

      <P>Over the past two months, a total of 175 jobs have been lost in the KeyTronic plant in Dundalk.  These job losses have been as a direct result of severe cost pressure in the manufacture of keyboards.</P>
      <P>KeyTronic anticipated heightened demand for its keyboard as a result of the launch of Microsoft's &ldquo;Windows `95&rdquo;.  They increased production, purchased extra equipment and employed an additional 200 people.  Now, however, increased stocks and a lower than anticipated demand have led to excess manufacturing capacity, leaving KeyTronic with no alternative but to reduce capacity.</P>
      <P>Ecco Limited (Harris Ireland) recently laid-off 40 temporary workers who were employed to cater for a seasonal demand in their product.  Overall, Ecco has performed well in recent years with employment increasing from 265 permanent people in 1992 to 300 at present.</P>
      <P>The north-east region has a significant base of high technology companies which is a key factor in attracting overseas investors.  There is an impressive array of over 40 overseas companies in County Louth including Quantum, ABB, AFL/Stribel, National Penn and Riverside Manufacturing Company Ltd.</P>
      <P>In addition, the announcement last November that American Power Corporation (APC) is to locate its uninterruptable power supplies project in Drogheda will result in £14 million investment and employ 300 people at full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards indigenous industry, Forbairt through its north-east regional office continues to actively promote the area for industrial development.  For example, during my visit to Boston with <Col N="198" /> Forbairt officers last November, I announced three specific business partnerships between Irish and US companies including one from County Louth. This was between Creative Media Training Services Ltd. in Drogheda and Paradign Inc, of Florida.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also working with Dundalk regional technical college in seeking to source potential technology based startup programmes.  In addition, on the indigenous side, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recent opening of Potato Cuisine Ltd. in Drogheda which will create over 60 jobs.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that both IDA Ireland and Forbairt will continue to build on the developments in Dundalk, and County Louth in general, which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Official control on the prices of goods and charges for services was discontinued in 1986, with the disbandment of the National Prices Commission.  In the meantime, the policy of successive Governments has been to promote free and fair competition with the aim of creating greater price competition and wider consumer choice. Consumer welfare is also, of course, furthered by the consumer shopping around.</P>
      <P>I would expect that competitive forces would act to ensure that consumers here would benefit from any price reductions by UK suppliers, consequent on the recent appreciation of the punt <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling.  In addition, the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which has now completed Committee Stage, provides for the public enforcement of the Competition Act, 1991 including the sections dealing with anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices.  It is my intention to enact the Bill at an early date.  I would also refer the Deputy to my reply of 15 March 1995 at columns 1465-1467 of the Official Report.  In addition, in respect of magazines I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs if in his view it is necessary to carry out a survey to establish the extent to which price reductions resulting from the appreciation of the punt have passed on to consumers.</P>

    <P>Assistance is currently available to <Col N="201" /> farmers participating in the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) who convert to or continue with organic farming.  The rate of payment, which is in addition to the basic REPS grant, is as follows: (i) in the case of producers with areas greater than 3 hectares (ha.) and also for cereal and grassland producers an annual payment of £150 approx. is made for a two year conversion period.  The payment is £75 approx. per ha. for full organic status.  (ii) £200 approx. per ha. annually for vegetable producers farming less than 3 ha. during the two year conversion phase and an annual payment of £100 approx. per ha. thereafter for those with full organic status.  My Department is also operating a scheme of grant-aid for the development of the organic farming sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  This scheme provides the following assistance: (i) To farmers, groups, companies or co-operatives for the provision of facilities for grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce.  The level of aid from my Department is 50 per cent in respect of capital expenditure subject to a maximum investment of £70,000.  (ii) To recognised bodies e.g. An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas for marketing and promotion in support of organic farming. The level of aid from my Department is 70 per cent subject to a maximum investment of £30,000 per year.  Expenditure by my Department under this scheme is eligible for recoupment from the European Union at the rate of 75 per cent.  A total of £1 million has been allocated to this scheme over the period 1995 to 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department also makes a contribution towards the cost of each inspection carried out by the three approved organic inspection and certification bodies in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91, as amended.  An amount of £10,000 has been provided in the 1996 Estimates for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the important role played by winter fatteners in the beef industry and the difficulties which they are facing as a result of the fall in market prices since the end of last year.  This fall has been mainly due to difficulties on the British market and the uncertainty created by the reductions in export refunds during last autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> I have impressed on the EU Commission and my colleagues at the Council of Ministers the need for a restoration of the refunds to levels which would underpin the income situation of beef producers and, in particular, winter fatteners.  I am pleased that the Commission have responded to this pressure by increasing refunds by 5 per cent for live cattle and male carcase beef and 7.5 per cent for boneles beef at the meeting of the Beef Management Committee on 2 February.</P>
    <P>While this increase, following on a 14 per cent increase last December, is welcome I will continue to press for a restoration of the refunds to levels which would make Irish beef and cattle competitive on international markets and at the same time would provide producers with a reasonable return on their investment and effort.</P>
    <P>The level of export licences, prefixed at the higher rate of refund last autumn and which are in adequate supply to cover normal exports until the end of this month, will also be an important element in maintaining prices for winter fatteners.  In addition, the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which is worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring, will be an important boost for these producers.  This scheme has been very successful in preventing an autumn glut of cattle coming on the market with consequent benefits for the industry in general.  I will be pressing to have this scheme continue again in 1997 in order that the improvements brought about can continue.</P>

      <P>Towards the end of 1995 every herdowner in the country was supplied with an advice package on herd health protection by my Department. It was also decided to avail of the opportunity to send comprehensive details to all herdowners of the arrangements and requirements relating to compensation where reactors are disclosed. Form ER83 is an integral part of the compensatory arrangements especially for dairy farmers.  It was not practical to send different packages relating to compensation to the different types of farmers.</P>
      <P>Form ER83 is a form which may be completed by a dairy farmer declaring the existence of suckler cows in his herd which do not qualify for premia under the EU suckler scheme.  Suckler cows so identified can be excluded in determining the notional herd milk yield average for reactor grant purposes.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of these animals enhances the notional herd milk yield average for dairy herds and possibly the rate of reactor grant payable.  It is important to stress that suckler animals must be declared while the herd is clear of disease and before the commencement of any test.  Cows that attract grants/premia under EU schemes are automatically taken into account in the notional herd milk yield calculation and pre-declaration is not required in relation to herds where EU payments are made.</P>

      <P>Under the conditions of the afforestation grant scheme operated by my Department, the person who undertakes planting is responsible for ensuring that the plantation is up to grant standard.</P>
      <P>Moveover, the grant-aid available includes an element to cover the cost of maintaining the plantation for the initial four years.  Accordingly, aside from natural disasters, it is reasonable to expect that a plantation would be up to standard at the four year stage when the second instalment inspection takes place.</P>
      <P>In 1995, some 1,003 second instalments inspections were undertaken and 19 per cent of these failed.  These inspections covered plantations established under the Western Package and Operational Programme 1989-1993 schemes. The main reason for failure was lack of maintenance.  This highlights the need for farmers and others undertaking planting to exercise the utmost care in their contractual arrangements with forestry contracting companies to ensure that this work is properly carried out.</P>

    <P>Applicants are informed why their plantations have failed and what remedial work is required.  The normal position is that this work is undertaken quickly so that the vast majority of failures subsequently pass the inspection.  In general, premium payments are deferred until the remedial work is completed.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department supported the development of a master forestry contract which was jointly promoted by the IFA and the Irish Timber Council. This contract is agreed between the <Col N="211" /> farmer and the forestry contracting company and covers all aspects of planting and management of the plantation for the first four years.</P>
    <P>In March last year, I announced that Teagasc would play a key role in promoting and developing farm forestry. As part of the strategy for the forestry sector, which I expect to bring to Government shortly, I will be including specific proposals in regard to the work to be undertaken by Teagasc.  The strategic plan will also include particular measures aimed at enhancing farmer training in forestry.</P>

      <P>Under the proposed new arrangement for the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes farmers will in general pay their veterinary practitioners for the first annual herd tests each year.  The level of fees payable will be a matter for negotiations between the farmer and practitioner.  The proposed new arrangement includes a reduction in farmer levies of some 65 per cent.

    <P>I have sought the restoration of refunds to adequate levels in order to underpin the income situation of cattle producers and, in particular, winter fatteners.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago Telecom Éireann submitted proposals to me for a comprehensive re-balancing of leased lines charges.  These charges had not been adjusted in many years and a serious shortfall had developed, especially in the provision of national leased lines, between the costs of providing the service and the revenue earned from it.</P>
      <P>Following lengthy discussions between officials of my Department and the company I agreed a range of increases in leased line charges to be implemented by the company in two phases; the first in 1996 and the second in 1997.  These affected the tariffs for national leased lines, leased lines to the UK and analogue lines to Europe.  Having regard to all the circumstances I am satisfied that these increases are appropriate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to national leased lines it is not possible to provide the information in the precise form requested by the Deputy because the actual charge <Col N="215" /> for any one leased line is the sum of the various cost elements involved i.e. connection fee, rental charge, fixed network charge and distance related charges. These cost elements vary with the type of leased line used (i.e. analogue or digital), with the capacity of the line in question and with the distance involved. It is the charges for these elements which are being varied (increases in some cases and decreases in others) and the impact on the cost of any one leased line would depend on the particulars of that line.  The charges for some leased lines will actually decrease.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I can tell the Deputy that as a result of these adjustments it is possible that the final charges faced by some customers will increase substantially. In the case of national leased lines this is necessary in order to bring charges into line with costs, something that had not been done for years.  I have instructed Telecom Éireann that where such increases are likely, customers are to be assisted in finding the least cost reconfiguration of the service they require.  In many cases this would entail moving away from leased circuits altogether to a more appropriate service e.g. an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) or other date service.</P>
    <P>In the case of circuits to the UK, charges are being standardised so as to equate them with the equivalent tariffs of British Telecom and Mercury.</P>
    <P>With the exception of increases in analogue circuits to Europe, all other international leased line tariffs are set to decrease.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has approved the expansion of Aer Rianta into China; and the concerns, if any, he has about the expansion in view of the fact that controversy continues to surround China and its treatment of orphans.</Quest>

      <P>Duty free is an important element of Aer Rianta's revenue.  The income from duty free helps to keep airport charges to a minimum thus reducing access costs to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Duty free sales to travellers between EU member states are due to be abolished from 1 July 1999.  Aer Rianta is endeavouring to reduce the potential serious negative impact to the company of the loss of these sales by extending its portfolio of duty free businesses in countries other than member states of the EU.</P>
      <P>Against this background my Department and the Department of Finance approved, in July 1995, the formation of a subsidiary company by Aer Rianta International to exploit developing business opportunities in China and the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>I understand that the new subsidiary, ARI East Asia, has recently signed a business consultancy contract with the China National Duty Free Corporation to provide a number of services at Beijing International Airport including retail management, computer systems, business training, marketing etc.  I should point out that individual contracts entered into by the company which do not involve any significant capital exposure are a day-to-day management matter for the company and are not subject to my approval.</P>
      <P>I do, of course, share the wide concerns expressed about the recent Channel Four programme &ldquo;Return to the Dying Rooms&rdquo; and the report by Human Rights Watch/Asia about the treatment of children in State-run orphanages in China.</P>
      <P>While the reaction of the Chinese authorities was to reject the allegations as a fabrication, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has written to the Chinese Ambassador expressing the Government's deep concern about the contents of the programme.  He asked for complete transparency and openness in respect of the allegations.  I support him fully in this approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 the Minister may grant or refuse to grant a permit authorising dumping at sea operations.  The procedure is that an applicant requests permission to dump at sea giving details of: (1) the proposed <Col N="219" /> disposal site; (ii) the quantity and constituents of the material to be dumped; (iii) the dumping vessel; (iv) why no suitable land-based alternatives exist.</P>
      <P>Each application is examined by the Department's marine licence vetting committee (MLVC) which is composed of a chemist, biologists and an oceanographer from the Marine Institute, a marine surveyor and an engineer from this Department and a biologist from the Central Fisheries Board.  Each application is examined to ensure that: (i) the disposal site is acceptable from a fisheries and navigational point of view; (ii) the quantity and constituents of the waste are such that they will cause no harm in the marine environment; (iii) there are no suitable land-based alternatives; and (iv) the vessel to be used in disposal of the waste is properly licensed and certified.</P>
      <P>The Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in the disposal of dredge spoil.  The Minister may require surveys of both the waste and the dump site to be undertaken at the expense of the prospective dumper.  If the proposed site is unsuitable for any reason alternative sites are investigated, and if the material itself is found to be unsuitable for dumping at sea, the application is refused.</P>
      <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have applied to the Department to dispose of dredge spoil which will result from capital dredging works in Drogheda Harbour.  As there are extensive fishing grounds in the vicinity of Drogheda Harbour, problems arose in identifying a suitable dump site. Officials from the Department have been actively seeking a site which will not impact on fisheries.  My officials have now identified a site which has some possibilities.  Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have now been given details of the suggested site and their confirmation is awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners are preparing an environmental impact <Col N="220" /> study (EIS) in respect of the proposed capital dredging works.  They will be required to include in the EIS a study of both waste to be dumped at sea and the dump site to ascertain the potential impact of the dumping on the marine environment and on fisheries.  On receipt of this study the application will be assessed further in consultation with all relevant parties.  I cannot guarantee that the site now under consideration will be suitable until the EIS is carried out.  The onus is on the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners to prove that dumping on this site will not impact on the environment and fisheries.</P>
