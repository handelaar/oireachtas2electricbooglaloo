      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of inquiries regarding information leaks that have been instigated by him and/or his Department colleagues since the Government came into office; the number of such inquiries that have concluded; the result of the concluded inquiries; the action, if any, that has been taken as a result of such inquiries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have instigated no further investigations beyond the four indicated by me in my reply on 4 April 1995.  These inquiries have not reached any conclusions beyond those indicated then and on 17 May 1995 in my reply to Questions Nos. 6 and 7.  They did not reveal any sources of unauthorised disclosure.</P>
      <P>Since that date I have initiated procedures for each departmental secretary to investigate disclosure of information arising in their areas of responsibility. There have been no subsequent inquiries arising in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related not only to the Taoiseach's Department but to others.  How many of these inquiries arose from press reports and how many journalists have been or are being interviewed in what have now transpired to be useless inquiries?  How much Garda time has been wasted on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering here for my Department and any inquiries about other Departments in respect of material which may have been prematurely disclosed should be addressed to them.  I am not aware of any Garda time having been expended on any of the inquiries instigated by me or arising within the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a number of journalists have been interviewed in inquiries instituted into Government leaks.  In view of the information available to him, does the Taoiseach agree all of these inquiries have proved to be useless, have not revealed anything and were a waste of Garda time?  Furthermore, would he agree that the level of paranoia demonstrated by all these inquiries contrasts strangely with his commitment to operate his Government as if it was behind a pane of glass?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever Government is considering confidential commercial information from a company seeking assistance from the Government and that confidential commercial information is disclosed publicly, it can have serious disadvantages from the point of view of the competitiveness of that company and the security of its jobs.  As I am sure Deputy O'Dea will readily appreciate, there is a very important public need to maintain the confidentiality of some Government transactions.  Obviously there is also a need to maintain confidentiality only in regard to those matters that meet that test.  It is with a view to allowing greater access to public information, without <Col N="1439" /> loss to the public interest, the Government is promoting the freedom of information legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that a <i>Sunday Business Post</i> journalist, writing on financial matters, was interviewed by two gardaí?  Will he also accept that such behaviour is in conflict with the Government's promise of open Government and amounts to a serious interference with the freedom of the press?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, the premature revelation of information, given in confidence to Government by a third party, can be injurious to that third party.  If that information is revealed in a manner damaging to that third party, it can damage the relationship which should exist between Government and those who furnish it with such confidential information.  In pursuit of that ideal I consider it entirely reasonable, and in accordance with the law, that Government and relevant agencies should seek to ascertain who was responsible for revealing information that ought not to have been revealed.  It is important to make the point that the Official Secrets Act, for example, has operated under successive Governments and to my knowledge, no previous Government has sought to amend or repeal it to restrict the level of secrecy that applies.  However, this Government is doing so through its proposal for its amendment to provide for a freedom of information Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should realise there is a balance of rights here.  There is certainly a right to public information but the Government also has a right to be able to assure people who give it confidential information that the information will remain confidential.  Furthermore, the Government has a right when negotiating on behalf of the people with another <Col N="1440" /> party, not to have its negotiating position undermined by premature disclosure. There are a series of competing rights which it is necessary to balance in appropriately drafted legislation.  In that respect, the Government is preparing its freedom of information legislation, on which I look forward to Deputies' contributions.</P>

      <P>Whom does the Taoiseach regard as the offender: the person who leaks the information or the person who received the information?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deciding where an offence is committed is a matter for the appropriate legal authorities and not for me.  It is not for me to act as a judge in any case and I do not propose to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a question to the Taoiseach on this matter along the lines of a question he answered here on 14 February 1995 but he has transferred it because it was about budgetary leaks. Will the Taoiseach accept, given the current crime wave, there is no justification for using scarce resources in having the Garda investigate leaks by one element of the Government against other elements of the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been to my knowledge any leaks by one element of the Government against another element of the Government.  There is no need, political or otherwise, for such to occur because the Government is operating in a concerted manner as a team in regard to the budget and all other matters.  The Deputy referred to a question she put down in February which I accepted and said similar question was referred this time.  The Deputy will recollect that in my reply here today I said that since February I initiated procedures whereby each departmental secretary now has the <Col N="1441" /> responsibility of investigating any disclosure of information that occurs in his or her area of responsibility.  For example, the responsibility for initiating an inquiry into any unauthorised disclosure of financial information does not rest with me any more but with the secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any question the Deputy wishes to put down about investigations in that area should be addressed to the Minister for Finance and, in order to assist the Deputy, I refered the question to the Minister who will answer it for her.</P>

      <P>We have dwelt now for nearly a quarter of an hour on this one question.  I must be fair to the Deputies who tabled questions.  It will have to be brief, Deputy Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach initiated a Garda inquiry into the leak to the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week of the Mitchell report?  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the House that this report was not leaked with the knowledge or connivance of any member of the Government or its politically appointed staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption the Deputy is making that this item was disclosed in this jurisdiction is not necessarily correct.  I believe it is not correct. The appropriate Department to initiate an investigation of any possibility that the disclosure might have occured in the jurisdiction is the Department of Justice. I understand the secretary of that Department is considering what action, if any, he should take in regard to the matter.  If the Deputy wishes to put down any question seeking further elaboration on that matter he should address his questions to the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <asker>Miss Harney</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has received a request to meet representatives of ISME to discuss the social partnership.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received requests from a number of organisations, including ISME, for inclusion within the social partnership process and for their formal participation in the central review committee which monitors the implementation of national programmes.</P>
      <P>The existing social partnership mechanism of the central review committee is working well.  I have no plans to change it.  However, I intend to ensure that in the preparation of any new programme, mechanisms will be developed to allow for a contribution in areas of direct relevance to their members from a wider number of groups than at present, including ISME.  With that in view, I have asked Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to meet ISME to discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach refuse to meet ISME before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be meeting ISME because Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell will be meeting it. The Deputy is well aware of the situation in regard to the representation of small firms.  There are two organisations competing with one another in this area, one is a member of IBEC.  The small firms association, is represented through IBEC on the central review committee. The Government should not do anything to encourage the splitting of organisations by giving representation to break-away organisations, as of right, merely because they have broken away from a larger organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time the Government has an obligation to ensure, where there is a split, the members of the smaller organisation receive proportionate access to decision making, which is what is being done in this case.  I have offered <Col N="1443" /> ISME a meeting with Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell and I understand ISME has meetings on a regular basis, in regard to small firms matters, with the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The Deputy may also be aware that I have appointed one member of the council of ISME Mr. Lar Sheeran to the National Economic and Social Council.  Although he has been appointed in a personal capacity and not as a representative of ISME, he is in a position to convey ISME's concerns through NESC into the whole area of social partnership.  The Deputy will be aware that earlier this month I asked the National Economic and Social Council to prepare a report which will form the basis for the hoped for next agreement and ISME, through its member there, will be able to make a contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Taoiseach that the reason he refused to meet ISME was that he did not want to encourage a further split in the organisation that represents small businesses? If that is the case, why did he appoint a member to the NESC and why did the Minister for Enterprise and Employment address their recent annual luncheon and annual conference?  If the Taoiseach's view is that by doing these things he is encouraging fragmentation surely none of these things should have happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered all those questions.  We should not encourage fragmentation, therefore, I do not propose to appoint ISME to the CRC and I do not propose to meet it. Equally, once ISME exists there is an obligation to give it proportionate representation. The proportionate representation it is being offered involves, in one instance, allowing it one person who is not there in a representative capacity but in a personal capacity, on the NESC and accepting it will meet other Departments from time to time. There is no right answer to this type of <Col N="1444" /> problem.  Where an organisation splits, there is no right answer to determine exactly what level of representation one should give to each new organisation. The Deputy has only to look at the farming sector where now a fourth organisation has been established.  It is appropriate, if they represent people to listen to them, but equally we should do so in such a fashion as not to encourage further fragmentation.  The Government in this instance, as in others, has the invidious task of striking a balance and I believe we struck the right balance in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of historical interest there were two organisations: the FUE and the CII.  They amalgamated and the people who represented the smaller business people decided that was not a good idea and formed ISME.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will be more fragmented soon.  In Martyn Turner's cartoon last week it was assigned to making the tea.  I hope it was Barry's tea.  Will the Taoiseach accept that we cannot have real social partnership if key elements of the economy are not represented in that partnership?  Will he agree that key private sector interests are not represented in the current social partnership?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In an earlier reply the Taoiseach referred to the formation of new farming groups.  It is clear that <Col N="1445" /> those groups enjoy access to the Taoiseach and Government Ministers.  Double standards are being adhered to in respect of the representative groups of small business.  Given the crucial importance of small business to the economy and in future job creation it is insulting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it insulting that small businesses are being referred to a Minister of State whose primary responsibility is European Affairs and who has the task of organising our Presidency of the EU?</P>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government should give access to them which is proportionate to their size and representation. That is the course we have adopted in this case.  The Small Firms Association, which has remained part of the united business representative body, namely IBEC, is the larger organisation and gets proportionately greater access. We may regret the split but ISME now exists and it gets lesser but proportionate access to Government decision-making in the context of social partnership. We have struck the right balance and I am somewhat puzzled about the position of the two Opposition parties who seem to be taking alternating stances in their questions.  In the first question they say ISME should have more representation and in the second question they imply that it should not get any representation at all.  This confusion among the Opposition parties illustrates the difficulty inherent in deciding what to do when there are two organisations <Col N="1446" /> of differing sizes in the same sector.  By adopting this approach, which I would describe as proportionality, the Government has struck the right balance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe I addressed the Parliamentary Assembly on Thursday, 25 January last.  In my address I focused primarily on the peace process in Northern Ireland, the role of the Council of Europe, Russia's application for membership of the Council, and the European Union with particular reference to the relationship between the EU and the Council of Europe.  Following my address I answered questions from members of the Parliamentary Assembly.</P>
      <P>In my address I made a strong plea to the delegates of the Assembly to vote in favour of the Russian application for membership of the Council of Europe. I was, therefore, very pleased with the Assembley's decision taken later that evening in favour of the Russian application.</P>
      <P>During my visit to the Council I also had meetings with Ms Leni Fischer, President of the Parliamentary Assembly, and Mr. Daniel Tarschys, Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.  I also signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights on behalf of Ireland. While in Strasbourg I visited the new Human Rights building which houses the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.  I also hosted a reception for members of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Irish community in Strasbourg.</P>

I agree with the comments he made at the Council of Europe but it would have been possible for him to remain in the House to put forward the Government's response. When I raised the issue the Tánaiste was clearly not aware of the various developments which had taken place. Why did the Taoiseach, who was aware of the developments, not stay in the House to respond to the statement?</P>

      <P>The position which obtained at the time of my conversation with the British Prime Minister on Tuesday evening was that the debate would be taken by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for the Irish side and by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for the British side.  The British decided to change the process on their side.  I do not think there is any requirement on us to imitate any arrangement they might choose to make in this regard, particularly as the Tánaiste is handling the operational aspects of the twin track series of discussions.  It was entirely appropriate that he should have taken that debate.  On the question of my attendance at the Council of Europe, the time and date of the meeting had been fixed well in advance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends to take to restore confidence in the sheep industry in view of Bord Bia's recent report on the sector.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1998/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the difficulties in the sheep sector last year, I requested An Bord Bia to carry out a study of the Irish sheepmeat industry which would comprise an evaluation of market changes and provide recommendations for a response to these changes.  I welcome the completion of this report which identifies clearly the main issues to be addressed, namely competitiveness, efficiency and especially the improvement of quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious effort on the part of all those involved in the industry is required to enable these changes to be introduced.  Clearly, the first step is to tackle the issue of quality and to this end, I have recently secured the agreement of the processing plants to implement a lamb carcase classification <Col N="1453" /> scheme on a nationwide basis.  Some details regarding the operation of the system have still to be finalised but there is full acceptance in the industry of the need to introduce this scheme. The aim of the scheme is to improve the quality and marketability of sheep, particularly in the latter part of the year where the report showed a serious shortfall in quality.</P>
    <P>Breeding and ram selection are crucial contributory factors to lamb quality. The Department already operates a pedigree sheep improvement programme and I have directed both Teagasc and my Department to examine this programme with a view to improving its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>While France will continue to be our main export market, it is important that our industry should reduce its dependence on that market in the longer term. With that in mind, an expanded marketing drive is now being embarked upon by An Bord Bia with emphasis on the German market and on moving towards consumer ready cuts.</P>
    <P>The report also identified the need for improved efficiency and productivity. A major offensive is now required on tight cost control and productivity if competitiveness and profits are to be increased at farm level.  Teagasc, as the national research, advisory and training body, has a vital role here.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I succeeded in negotiating a special aid package for Irish sheep farmers last month to compensate them for the low prices here in the early part of last year.  The package, which, with an increase in the overall level of the ewe premium, is worth £26 million was of particular assistance to lowland early lamb producers who suffered most from the price falls last summer.  For the longer term, there are aspects of the application of the sheepmeat regime which could be improved and I will be considering these in advance of reviewing the ewe quota system later this year.</P>
    <P>In particular, I have initiated consultations with the various interests in the industry on the dry hogget rule with a <Col N="1454" /> view to putting forward proposals to the Commission on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have the full agreement of all plants on the implementation of the carcase classification scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been advised by his officials that he has full agreement from all plants.  Can the Minister say whether all meat plants have agreed to the voluntary carcase classification scheme which he announced some weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mystery here. A number of principal operators, such as Irish Country Meats and KEPAK, have agreed and my understanding is that smaller meat groups, such as Slaney Meats, either have been or will operate this scheme.  I do not know the level of abattoir to which the Deputy is referring but I intend that all export related plants will operate the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that he cannot yet confirm that despite announcing the scheme is under way, he does not have full agreement from everybody?  Since this is a key recommendation of a report which the Minister has promised us for months on end as a means to deal with the sheep meat crisis, can he explain why he has not insisted on a compulsory scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of detail that has to be negotiated relates to the technical aspects of the EUROP grading and what level of fat confirmation as against the carcase confirmation would be the <Col N="1455" /> base price.  It is not that they have not agreed to operate the scheme.</P>
      <P>The reason I have not opted for a statutory scheme is that it would inevitably mean a levy and a large bureaucracy, which is not what I want.  I want a straightforward scheme that will have quality, rather than volume by weight, as the basis of payment for sheep meat. That is in place and will move ahead.  I did not want to deduct money to producers from their meat factory cheques or to look for extra inspectors for the Department of Finance.  This is the best way to proceed.  I am confident this scheme will, in the medium term, revolutionise the whole thinking of producers on the need to have quality in our sheepmeat sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a classic case of refusing to take a decision that might involve hardship on someone to pay for the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the £26 million special aid package he negotiated and hyped to the best of his ability before Christmas.  How much of that package, if any, has been paid to farmers? Is it not the case that he awaits Parliament approval for it to be paid and that he is not likely to get it before the middle of the year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

This not only requires a regulation to go before the Council as an aid point but it is also required to go before the Parliament.  I imagine this would be done in the first half of this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24, 47, 67 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>To control the level of subsidised exports of beef and live cattle from the EU to third country markets to comply with the GATT export ceilings, in this the first year of the GATT agreement, the EU Commission cut export refunds on four different occasions between September and November last year. These cuts and other measures were made in an effort to achieve a more orderly flow of licence applications. These adjustments had little or no effect on the price of cattle in Ireland in that period &mdash; prices in early December were only marginally below those in late August.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I was &mdash; and am &mdash; deeply unhappy with the approach the EU Commission has adopted in managing the beef market and believe it has overreacted to the slightly elevated levels of applications for export licences by cutting export refunds.  I considered that the level of refund which resulted from these cuts was too low relative to cattle prices in the EU and prices in third countries and would eventually cause difficulties for producers who were wintering cattle for sale in the first half of 1996.  This is now beginning to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> I discussed this issue last week directly with Commissioner Fischler and at the Council of Ministers in Brussels where I impressed upon my colleagues and the Commission the need for an immediate increase in export refunds to ensure adequate returns for our beef producers.  The matter was again raised at the Beef Management Committee meeting on Friday last, but the Commission refused to propose an increase in the refunds, citing the strong market prices in the EU overall, as one of the reasons for not doing so.  I will continue to press through every avenue open to me for a restoration of refunds to adequate levels before the current licences expire at the end of next month.</P>
    <P>Prices remained relatively steady between the early autumn and early winter despite the refund cuts.  They have fallen by about 4 per cent since then.  It is important to emphasise that beef exporters have been operating from licences which were prefixed at the higher refund rates, before mid-November. These higher rate prefixations are in adequate supply to cover normal exports until the end of February.  No export licences have been taken out by beef traders here at the current relatively lower rates.</P>
    <P>The average market price reported to the EU Commission for R3 grade steers slaughtered at beef export premises for the week beginning 1 January was 98.6p per lb, including VAT.  Since then prices have remained relatively steady.</P>
    <P>The payment of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which is worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring and about £14 million in total, will be an important factor in maintaining returns to winter fatteners.  This, in conjunction with premia payments which have increased by £250 million since the onset of the CAP reform agreement in 1992, should help to undepin the income of beef producers in general.  Nonetheless, an increase in refunds &mdash; or equivalent action &mdash; is urgently needed and I will continue to press our case on this until it is achieved.</P>

      <P>While we all share the Minister's unhappiness, he is the only one who can do anything about it.  He has issued three press statements in recent months.  On 13 November, he stated that he did not expect &ldquo;the cuts in refunds to have an immediate impact on the export trade or cattle prices&rdquo;.  On 17 November, when there was a further cut, he said that it would have no adverse consequences for cattle prices in the immediate future.  On 1 December, he stated that he did not expect the new level of refunds to have any immediate effect on cattle prices. Does he agree that this is hogwash as cattle prices have collapsed since late November-early December when they stood at £1.03 per pound?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Those statements were reiterated in an attempt to convince the beef processing industry, including the slaughtering plants, that I will not tolerate a situation where they opportunistically seek to deal with the matter by lowering prices.  The existing prefixations will cover the slaughter of about 85,000 animals between now and the end of February.  The same level of refund applied to cattle purchased and slaughtered in October, November and December.  The meat factories, therefore, were not justified in cutting prices overnight, from 1 January, when the deseasonalisation premium fell due for payment, almost as if saying they would pocket the payment of £60 per head. When I meet the representatives of the IMPA and IBEC at 5.30 p.m. this evening I will tell them bluntly that I am <Col N="1460" /> not satisfied, on the technical information available to me, that the price cut can be justified.</P>
      <P>When the prefixations work their way through the system here and throughout the rest of the European Union there is the prospect of a further price cut.  Both the Beef Management Committee and the Commission will have to take this extremely seriously.  I am circulating a further paper to Commissioner Fischler today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the purpose of which, apart from the general response of the Commission when the prefixations work their way through the system, is to ensure the introduction of a special measure for Ireland.  It was apparent at the meeting of the Beef Management Committee last Friday and at the Council of Ministers this day week that Ireland was on her own.</P>
      <P>The price of bull, steer and cow beef has increased throughout the rest of the European Union.  I am not satisfied with price trends here.  It has been argued that this is due to the BSE scare in Britain, but prices have recovered there and in Northern Ireland.  This leads me to believe that a price of around or in excess of £1 per pound can be afforded by the meat factories given the current level of prefixations.  The other issue will still have to be confronted by the Commission.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the spokesman for his Department is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as having said yesterday that, politically or otherwise, there is no hope of export refunds being restored to the figure they were at the beginning of November? What are the prospects for the future, particularly in view of the information given by the Minister to the House today that factories and other exporters will operate on the basis of prefixed refunds until the end of February?  I hope that will be the case.  If there has been a drop in prices of 7p per pound <Col N="1461" /> to date while the prefixed refunds ramain in place, what will be the position when they expire at the end of February? On that basis, is it possible that the price of beef could drop by 15p or more per pound?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>At the Beef Management Committee meeting last Friday the Commission stated clearly that it would not have an Irish solution to what it did not perceive as a European problem; in other words, beef producers across the Union are not experiencing a problem, there is only a problem here.  The Commission will not, willy-nilly, increase export refunds now as it believes this would lead to the market overheating.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that when the current prefixations, in excess of 400,000 tonnes, work their way through the system between now and the end of March they will have to reopen for business. The GATT quota is 1.1 million tonnes. This works out at a weekly average of about 22,000 tonnes.  The reason export refunds were cut was that the weekly average was about 60,000 tonnes.  Since the cuts were carried out the level of prefixations have varied between 2,000 and 7,000 per week.  It is quite clear that the European trade cannot service third country markets on the level of refunds. It is inevitable therefore that they will be increased but my fear is that it will be too little too late for Ireland.  That is why I am seeking special measures for Ireland in the interim.  However, it is true that if the Commission refused to alter the refunds indefinitely there would be another price cut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told Deputy O'Malley that at the beef management committee meeting last Friday they were not open to an Irish solution to what he called an Irish problem. However, he allowed his spokesperson in last week's <i>Farming Independent</i> to indicate that what he called a &ldquo;reduced damage strategy&rdquo; would be available to the Minister at that beef management committee meeting and he held out every prospect of being successful.  The <Col N="1462" /> Minister will have to come clean with the public at some stage.  Is he suggesting that the Commission was justified in reducing the export refund to the extent it did?  If so, he is flying in the face of every statement he has made.  If that is not the case, will the Minister let farmers, particularly winter fatteners, know when he will have a situation that will allow them to survive in the present environment, given the fact that over a third of the winter fattener kill will be gone through under the present regime?</P>
      <P>The beef management committee meeting is not to be held until 16 February and, allowing for the lead in period, there will not be a new export refund regime until 26 February.  In the meantime, what will the Minister do to change the situation?</P>

      <P>They have rewarded speculators, engendered panic and allowed a situation where traders gave out licences instead of the Commission. All of that was very badly handled.  We put forward proposals about non-transferable licences, increasing the security and shortening the validity period.  The question remains as to the best way for us to deal with this issue.  The best way is to try to ensure that a special measure is brought forward for Ireland in the form of aids to private storage or an increase in live exports or in the form of <Col N="1463" /> dealing with special cuts such as boneless hind quarters for beef which Ireland takes out more than any other State.</P>

It is, perhaps, not terribly helpful of the Minister to describe them in these terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether to be glad or sorry that we are not, it appears, going to get an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Some of them in the past were not a success, although they might have been in the agriculture sector. Will the Minister clarify the question of prefixations?  In his reply the Minister said they would expire at the end of February.  However, in his subsequent reply to Deputy Cowen he said they would expire at the end of March. There is a major difference there. <Col N="1464" /> Would the Minister agree that when they do run out and if things continue as they are the drop in the price of beef is likely to be as much as 15 pence per pound or even more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter point, because Europe took out heavy prefixations in November, their prefixations are likely to run out at the end of March.  However, the Irish prefixations are likely to run out at the end of February.  The level of price cut would be somewhat nearer to 90 pence in the worst case scenario; I do not envisage it moving beyond that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about my relationship with DG6.  It is true that the Government and I have three burning issues with DG6 and the Commissioner. The first is the issue of export refunds. The second is the deseasonalisation premium for which we no longer qualify. The threshold for the three month period is over 40 per cent and as the outturn for last year was 35.8 per cent we no longer qualify for that.  It is worth £14 million per year to Ireland and I must get it back.  Finally, there is the not inconsiderable sum of over £100 million in fines which is a matter for the Commission in its entirety.  The Commission knows the way I operate &mdash; I believe in calling a spade a spade and in trying to ensure that the good relations we have had with the Commission can continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 41, 58 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to make significant progress towards the introduction of new arrangements for the disease eradication schemes from 1996 onwards.  The new approach is designed to improve the effectiveness and reduce the cost of the schemes to both farmers and taxpayers. It results from intensive negotiations with the relevant organisations over the past four months.  The general reaction to the proposals has been positive and all the farming and agricultural bodies have indicated that they will participate in the forum which I propose to establish.  Prior to the establishment of the forum discussions are continuing, especially with the IVU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key features of the proposed new programme are: payment for annual herd testing will be devolved directly to farmers; a reduction of 65 per cent in farmer levies, from £28 million to £10 million per annum; pre-movement testing will be carried out on a voluntary <Col N="1466" /> basis, and there will be encouragement also for voluntary post movement testing; additional laboratory procedures and epidemiological considerations will facilitate the early removal of restrictions on some herds; and there will be improved quality control, increased epidemiology and an enhanced research programme, including tackling the spread of TB by wildlife.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for payment for annual round testing will be devolved to farmers which means that a major portion of the cost of the scheme will in the future be removed from the taxpayer.  In addition, the new procedures will enable me to reduce farmer levies from 1.3p per gallon to 0.5p per gallon for milk deliveries and from £7.30 per animal to £2.50 per animal for beef cattle. I intend to bring these measures before the Dáil shortly.  This amounts to a reduction of £18 million per year in farmer contributions.</P>
    <P>My Department will, as part of the new arrangements, continue to bear the costs of the administration of the scheme.  The administration arrangements for the eradication schemes will be reviewed by independent consultants in the context of the strategic management initiative and the current overall reorganisation of my Department. Under Revenue Commissioners regulations, veterinary surgeons fees are liable for VAT at 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will VAT be passed on to the farmer in terms of the fee he will pay the vet?  An old man told me once that something is never a mistake if one does it twice, so why did the Minister disregard the IVU the second time after messing the matter up last May and walking away from the rotation question by coming up with this new scheme?  Why did the Minister announce the scheme again prior to getting the full agreement of the IVU? Third, when will the Minister start the scheme and can he do so without the agreement of the IVU?</P>

It is simply not the case that I disregarded the IVU.  I intend to establish the TB forum and I intend to proceed with this scheme.  I am not giving anyone &mdash; farming group, nor the IVU or otherwise &mdash; a right of veto, but in good faith and following discussions senior officials in my Department and I have had with the IVU, I have deferred for a few weeks the first meeting of the forum in an effort to bring the vets on board.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that nobody <Col N="1468" /> will have a veto on the scheme.  Had he not got the prior consent of the farming organisations would he be proceeding with the scheme?  If that is not the case, will he confirm that the IVU was not on board when he announced the scheme at an IFA annual general meeting?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In setting up any new scheme it is crucial to get the funders on board, those paying the levies &mdash; the farmers &mdash; and the Department of Finance. If a scheme does not have funding, it will not get off the ground.  The role of the implementators of the scheme &mdash; in this case the veterinary surgeons &mdash; takes second place.  Once I published the board proposals on 22 November I met members of the IVU and informed them that I would not procrastinate on the matter and that I needed a decision by Christmas.  I extended the deadline to the new year and have now extended it further.  I am not prepared to revert to the position of last year whereby in good faith the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, entered into talks with the IVU which became protracted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept a position whereby, on the basis of a boycott or otherwise, a group decides that it alone should decide on the type of TB scheme that should operate. Deputy Cowen is aware that more than £1.5 billion of public funds has been spent in an attempt to eradicate TB and that many people have done well out of it.  It is time the matter was resolved and these proposals provide a basis for competition in the veterinary sector, greater farmer control, less bureaucracy and more effective measures to deal with black spot areas. The scheme is cost effective and I look <Col N="1469" /> forward to farmers being notified of testing dates before 1 April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to concentrate on black spot areas which have had a continuing high incidence of TB despite additional staff and funding?  As a continuing high incidence of TB adversely affects co-operatives, stock and so on in those areas, a special effort should be made to assist them.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem in County Monaghan, Deputy Crawford conveyed to me his serious concern about the matter.  The new measures targeted at wildlife, such as the east Offaly project, should be extended to other parts of the country and, if appropriate, I would favour the extension of that project to the Monaghan area.  It is also proposed to establish a mobile quality control unit to ensure that more rigorous testing is carried out in certain areas; such a unit could be established in Monaghan.</P>
      <P>In regard to practical operational matters, the forum will allow farming organisations and, I hope, the veterinary surgeons to put forward their suggestions about the most useful way to proceed. This scheme is a partnership between all interested bodies and I will ensure that the problems in County Monaghan are at the top of the forum's agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that since he took up office the incidence of TB has increased and that at this stage he cannot see the wood for the trees?  In the past year a row has developed between him and the veterinary surgeons and, as it is a question of who will win, scant attention is given to reducing the incidence of tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that £1.5 billion has been spent on the scheme.  In 1995 a sum of £62 million was spent on it and, as he stated, many people made plenty of money out of it.  In 1995, £21 million was allocated for administration costs, the veterinary surgeons received £18 <Col N="1470" /> million, the farmers received £17 million and £0.5 million went on research.  Does the Minister agree with those figures? Does he also agree that if a realistic attempt is to be made at reducing the high incidence of TB there must be a large increase in funding and activity under the research programme?  A figure of £0.5 million for research in comparison with £21 million for administration purposes is unacceptable. Under the 1996 budget for TB eradication, how much funding will the scheme receive, what will be the division of spoils and how much will be available for research?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident of winning this battle.  The Deputy raised a genuine question about the level of administration costs.  I am arranging to have an independent consultancy study carried out in that regard and if savings can be made, I will implement the necessary measures.</P>
      <P>I will focus specifically on research under the scheme.  It is hoped that a blood test, which will be more foolproof than the false negatives and false positives under the present system, can be developed.  It is also hoped to develop a vaccine.  There is no limit to the amount of money one could throw at such research.  I will monitor procedures in New Zealand and European states in an effort to devise the necessary technological developments in this area.  That is the ultimate way to eradicate TB.  I am confident that such a blood test will be developed in the next three years.  I support a specific scientific targeted approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> In terms of funding for 1996, arrangements will be revised because the gross amount applied under the Appropriations-in-aid will change.  Farmers' levies will be reduced and the Department will no longer have to pay £14 million for annual testing.  A post-budget table setting out detailed figures will be published within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the fact that there will be pre-movement and post-movement testing of animals not prove that store producers will have to pay for herd testing on an annual basis which they did not have to do heretofore, and that this will cost smaller producers more than it did prior to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  I have arranged to give farmers a £10 million discount this year.  Not only have I reduced the difference between the reduction in the levies and the cost of the testing by £4 million but I am paying for the two new plastic tags which will cost £2.5 million.  I have arranged that the levies will only be paid into a compensation fund and, because this is a three-year scheme, there will be a ceiling on the amount paid.  The detail of that is being finalised.  It is an exceptional deal for farmers.  There are farmers who have paid nothing, others who have paid something in terms of cattle fatteners, and dairy farmers who have borne the full burden to date.  That is not equitable.  Neither is this an issue between small and big farmers; it is a sectoral issue.  What we are doing is bringing equity into the funding of it, but we are bringing in a huge discount factor and, for the first time, farmers and their organisations, as opposed to the public sector pay machinery, will be able in the long-term to dictate the level and cost of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to question the Minister regarding the serious TB problem in Monaghan which has existed for some years.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, met the <Col N="1472" /> personnel in Monaghan and has tried to alleviate some of the technical and structural problems.  However, I want to further emphasise the serious situation regarding badgers, deer etc.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that Monaghan will be specifically targeted in the context of badgers and deer. There is much anxiety among farmers, many of whom have lost their livelihoods and all prospect of a future.  The wildlife issue in the Cavan-Monaghan region has to be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take note of what Deputy Crawford has said and will be attentive to the problems of County Monaghan.  The incidence of TB there is not only high but persistently and stubbornly so and it requires targeted action.  An extension of the east Offaly project is one of the options I will consider. The new activities of the quality control unit will be focused also on Monaghan.  If the Deputy has any other suggestions for dealing with the problem I will be happy to give them due attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to ask has been highlighted by Deputy Ellis in his question.  The Minister indicates that this is not a problem between the small and the big and talks about the £10 million reduction given to farmers.  Of course there is a reduction in the payment of levies, but the new aspect of this scheme is that the farmer pays direct.  In his discussions with the Irish Veterinary Union, has the Minister been able to quantify the payments vets will be demanding from farmers in lieu of being paid through the levy system as heretofore? Does the Minister not feel that that aspect of the scheme might also be highlighted in the context of reducing costs?  The Minister does not yet know what the cost will be.  Does he intend to leave it to the free market to decide on the costs of these tests?  How can he say that there is continuing equity in the market when in the previous scheme cross-subsidisation took place in favour of small producers?  Does the Minister <Col N="1473" /> not believe that small producers should be assisted in this way, or is he suggesting that he will look after the larger producers by reducing their costs and leaving the smaller producers to their own devices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the unrelenting support of Deputy Cowen for the IVU at all stages over the last 12 months, I will be interested to see which side he will take on the issue of fee levels.  I want to see this taken out of the area of public sector pay machinery.  It is not appropriate that special pay awards and other facets of the public sector pay machinery should be involved in what will now be private testing.  I have every confidence that, given their ample national organisational strength, the farm organisations will be able to negotiate a scale of fees that will be acceptable to everybody. One would think we were introducing fee scales for private testing for the first time, but this is not new.  All the pre-movement testing done heretofore was freely negotiated between veterinary surgeons and farmers.  There were different bases for different herd sizes and different scales of fees.  I am happy to leave it to the farm organisations and their veterinary representatives to resolve that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to the House the difference between the scale of fees the private sector would obtain in the marketplace and the fees charged by vets under the TB scheme which were reduced because of cash flow arrangements in the Department? Is the Minister suggesting that he is prepared to introduce a scheme without knowing what that factor is?  In other words, will he leave it to individuals and have no input into deciding what would be an equitable price, particularly for small producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is missing the point.  We are moving towards market forces deciding this issue instead of the Department of Agriculture.  One example of one of the effects is already <Col N="1474" /> happening in one county where, in anticipation of this scheme going ahead, two veterinary graduates are establishing new practices to specialise in testing.  They will be very competitive on fees and, for the first time ever, farmers have the prospect of different vets queuing up at their doors looking for business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 33, 46, 60, 61 and 63 together.  The budget allocation for the REPS scheme for 1996 is £41.561 million as against an estimated 1995 outturn of £29.6 million.  The 1996 allocation will provide payments for a total of approximately 12,100 existing and new participants in the scheme.  The average payment in 1995 was approximately £3,400. I am keeping the funding of REPS under close review with a view to ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet expected demand.  I have no plans to give preferential treatment to any category of applicant under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not much to the point.  Does the Minister accept that £80 million is required for the REPS scheme <Col N="1476" /> in 1996 even though he has rightly said that only £41.5 million has been allocated? Given that £31.5 million will be paid to those already in the scheme, that leaves £9.5 million for the 14,000 applicants about whom Deputy Deenihan told us.  Does the Minister agree that only 3,000 of the 14,000 new applicants may expect payment in 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of the Deputy to make any presumptions about the number of people who will avail of the scheme in 1996.  Changes in the TB scheme, to which I referred earliier in the post budget table, will release funds which can be transferred within the Department.  This is one of many possibilities for providing extra revenue and resources for REPS.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <P>Will there be an allocation of £350 million to Ireland for REPS, 75 per cent of which is to be paid by the EU and the remainder by the Government?  Does the Minister agree that farmers have shown tremendous interest in the scheme and that his failure to make an impact at Cabinet level to secure any meaningful matching funds has effectively resulted in the discontinuation of the scheme for many?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and I have worked unrelentingly to develop the scheme. One of the difficulties we inherited was that it had a bad name when we came into office.  The number of applications was appallingly low when the scheme was launched in 1994.  Changes with regard to over-grazing, converting the CFP rule from one to three years and the latest concession in the budget which will mean that the first £2,000 of REPS money will be discounted from the means test, are significant indications of the Government's commitment to the scheme.  I will carefully monitor the financial requirements of the scheme based on the level of applicants.</P>

We must keep a balance between different schemes.  Afforestation grants and premiums are now being outstripped by REPS grants.  The <Col N="1480" /> former are tax free and making the latter tax free would hinder us in achieving our national forestry targets.  I do not see a prospect in the short-term of REPS grants being so exempt.  There is a principle at issue here.  All other premium and headage payments are liable for tax.  In fairness to the rest of the community all income, from whatever source, should be liable for tax.</P>

      <P>There has been obfuscation on this issue and we should get down to brass tacks.  The purpose of question time is to obtain information, not to listen to vague policy aspirations as to how the Minister will solve his problems.  Can the Minister confirm that the allocation for 1996 is £41.5 million, that there were 9,200 applicants for the scheme last year and that the average payment last year was £3,500 to those 9,200 applicants, giving a total payment of £30 million?  Can he confirm that the number of new applicants envisaged by his Department for 1996, in addition to the 9,200 applicants in 1995, is 12,500? This has been stated by the Minister of State.  The question I ask is simple.  Of the £41.5 million allocation for 1996, £30 million is already committed as a second payment to 1995 applicants.  Will the Minister confirm that £6 million has been already paid out in 1996, leaving a total of £5.5 million remaining in the scheme as of now.  Will he confirm also that in the event of him not getting any additional funds for the REPS in 1996, based on present financial allocations he will run out of money within the next two months?  That being true, was the Minister also making the tea with the Taoiseach when he was doing the budget allocations, as portrayed in Martyn Turner's cartoon recently?</P>

I compliment the Minister on the £2,000 exemption for small farmers applying for unemployment assistance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finucane referred to the exemption regarding unemployment assistance.  I hope the same consideration will be given in respect of medical cards, which is the same principle.  Despite the Minister's customer friendly approach and the Department's transparent policy, there are delays in the payment of REPS grants and it appears there will be major delays in the future if the Minister cannot come up with the funding.  In that respect, why has the Department decided to inspect 5 per cent of all the REPS plans lodged with the department, causing further delays in payments of grants to farmers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that all aspects of REPS are self-financing.  It is estimated that for every gross pound spent under REPS, 22 per cent of it is absorbed in direct and indirect taxation.  If we are funding only 25 per cent of it, it is an exceptional deal for the Exchequer.  My understanding is that the problem in relation to REPS planners for Teagasc has been already sorted out and it is in the process of recruiting some of those staff.</P>

I am sure the Minister and Deputy Finucane are aware that scheme ended in June of 1995 and the rate of grant payment is less than 13 per cent with 18,451 applicants as of 30 November, 2,300 of whom <Col N="1485" /> have been paid.  Is the Minister in a position at this stage to give a commitment to the payment of REPS grants to all 1996 applicants from the re-allocation of resources in his Department, or will he have to seek further allocations from the Minister for Finance?  Will he be able to make up the £40 million shortfall from his Department?</P>

      <P>There is no mystery about what I revealed.  As Deputy Byrne will confirm, I spoke on &ldquo;Agriview&rdquo; in relation to the budget and said I was seeking extra money for REPS.  My concerns are not a secret.  I can count in terms of the number of applicants and the average payment.  It is not a matter of obfuscation and Deputy Cowen should not try to attribute some sort of Hercule Poirot nature to himself in discovering this fact because it was as plain as day that there was a shortfall in funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mystery about this.  The report containing a suggested way of proceeding is available but I have not seen it.  The report was circulated to the members of the milk quota review group, comprising of representatives from all the industry and farmer organisations, who will critically examine it.  I will receive their recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues to which they will refer will be the price of temporary leasing for this year at 27p per gallon which is perhaps too low to be attractive and the priority to be given to certain categories <Col N="1487" /> of milk producers in terms of the volume band categories.  The first category is a 30,000 gallon quota defined as the quota of a small producer; the next category is 30,000 to 50,000 gallons and the third category is for producers with more than 50,000 gallon quotas.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the non-availability of milk for these leasing and restructuring schemes and I introduced a clawback arrangement to counter the overheating caused by what I term cheque book acquisitions of leases of milk quotas and land, some of dubious legality.  I introduced a 10 per cent penalty surcharge which would go into a pool.  If the report suggests more stringent measures to ensure there is an adequate pool of milk for deserving categories of producers I will be sympathetic to it.  I want to establish, as has been the case of my predecessors, a consensus in the quota review group before making final decisions on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in order that the most deserving applicants receive leased temporary quotas it should be confined to those who hold the low quota, that is, producers with under 35,00 gallons quota and that their requirements should be met before the next band's needs are met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms I agree with the Deputy that those producers in the lowest category are the most deserving as they can least afford to acquire quota.  Of all member states, we have had since 1984 when the quota was established the most elaborate and the highest volume percentage rise of milk restructured in a political way favouring the small producers and some 80 million gallons of quota has been leased annually under these schemes.  It is my intention to continue that level of active intervention to help those who are least able to help themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm the European countries that would <Col N="1488" /> not conform to their quota requirements in the past year?  If there is a European milk pool what is the possibility of Ireland taking up extra quota from the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I am explicit because we are facing a milk quota super levy bill of £25 million as a result of being almost 2 per cent over production at the end of December and there is no prospect of Euro flexi-milk being available.  We have to manage within the quota and I urge all farmers to consult with their Teagasc or co-op advisers to ensure that they feed whole milk to calves or take whatever steps are necessary to ensure they manage their own quota as they did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the issue of clear breaches of the terms of the milk quota leasing scheme because of the dubious legality of some of the leases where land is not going with the quota.  The Minister acknowledges that but given the number of leases it is surprising there is no monitoring of them or no requirement for people who lease their quota to get prior approval from the Department which can check on the bona fides of the lease.  The co-ops would normally lease 7,000 to 12,000 gallons but this year they were offered 3,000 to 4,000 gallons.  Would the Minister agree it is imperative to establish a monitoring mechanism for each lease, given that this national asset is being concentrated in fewer hands each month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for that reason in 1995 I stepped up the level of inspection of dubious leases.  I issued strict warnings stating that people found to have participated in a dubious lease will face very little super levy consequences themselves because we will not hesitate to invalidate them.  It is not possible administratively to give prior clearance to these leases but people who engage in dubious practices run a serious risk.  I take the Deputy's point and I will seek <Col N="1489" /> a report on the outcome of that vigilance and will try to ensure we stamp out any such nefarious activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time there was some regulation.  Due to the scarcity of milk quota leases last year, many producers who anticipated they would be able to lease a quota were caught out and find they have a substantial amount of milk in the month of January.  It is even inflating the price of calves because people are buying up calves. The small to medium sized producers anticipated there would be available quota and as it is not available they are in a serious position.  Will the Minister support the Border co-ops proposal on the additionality of milk under the peace process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that the co-ops do not have as much milk for restructuring under the temporary leasing scheme because it has not been offered to them.  That is one of the problems I am examining.  I am considering whether to increase the price from its present 27p level.</P>
      <P>On the question of extra milk quota for the Border counties I have had discussions with Baroness Denton and Douglas Hogg, the UK Minister for Agriculture.  The British are wholly unsympathetic on this issue.  The best advice available to me is that if this is to be pursued through the usual agricultural channels, in other words through the special committee on agriculture, the dairy management committee, there would be little or no prospect of that coming to fruition.  It will have gone through a political rather than agricultural route.  I am not aware that the British authorities are particularly enthusiastic about it.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that in all circumstances I will be supportive of it and do all I can to bring it about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that he will seek to provide a percentage in the next review to try to maintain the <Col N="1490" /> co-ops in that area which are under serious threat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I introduced legislation to ringfence the milk quota pool in disadvantaged areas in order to maintain the maximum number of family farms and the small quota structure in Border counties. Much of the quota was moving eastwards and southwards to larger, more affluent dairy farmers.  I acted within my powers.  However, the matter may be the subject of litigation and appeal.  I am committed to supporting those disadvantaged areas.  I reclassified large areas of the Deputy's constituency as more severely disadvantaged and that will bring direct economic benefit of hundreds of thousands of pounds to those farmers.</P>

      <P>As I said last week we examined the Bill and found a number of positive elements in it.  However, I also said that the Government is at a very advanced stage in the preparation of comprehensive legislation.  In drafting the legislation the Government had available to it the benefit of the security advice of the Garda Síochána and the constitutional advice of the Attorney General.  The Minister for Justice will make known this evening the Government's view of Fianna Fáil's contribution on this subject, which is welcome.</P>

      <P>Thanks to a well placed leak I was informed of the Government's package, which I welcomed, earlier this afternoon.  It is a timely response to the current crime wave.  It is important that all parties co-operate in the fight against crime.  Is it intended to bring forward legislation to increase the length of time gardaí can detain suspects for questioning?  The Minister announced proposals in this regard before the summer.  When might we expect this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government has in preparation legislation dealing with drug trafficking which, <i>inter alia,</i> covers the question of detention and extended periods of detention.  When the legislation is produced the Deputy will see that it is confined to particular categories of suspected offence and does not involve a generalised extension of the power of detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the legislation applied to drug trafficking. The Offences Against the State Act is widely used but I understand from Garda sources that if a firearm is not used the period of detention cannot be extended under that Act.  That appears to be a loophole and perhaps the Government will examine the matter in the proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will not have to wait long to see the Government's proposals on this matter.  Any offence involving the use of a firearm or the threat of the use of a firearm is far more serious than offences which do not do so.  It is entirely justified, as a general principle, to take severe measures in respect of any offence involving the use of a firearm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would agree generally with the Taoiseach, a firearm was not used in the three murders last week, as far as I know.  I am asking the Government to look at the matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach make time available to discuss the measures announced by the Minister for Justice today?  Does he accept that it was inappropriate that the Minister did not come before the House with the measures?  Do the measures include <Col N="1669" /> holding a referendum on bail and will we now see cohesion among the parties on this important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of bail laws is at an advanced stage of consideration by the Government but it is not part of the measures decided on today.  When the Government made those decisions today it was anxious to communicate them to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>It is exactly a week since the presentation of the budget, which is before the House.  Three days later the Minister for Social Welfare set up a task force to consider aspects of the budget regarding security for the elderly.  Why was it deemed necessary to set up such a task force?  Could the Minister for Finance not discuss the matter with the Minister for Social Welfare before the budget and is that the reason the Minister for Social Welfare had to insert an advertisement in the newspapers to seek an examination of this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to co-ordinate action in regartd to protection of the elderly.  While the Government announced some measures in the budget it is entirely appropriate that further measures should be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare, bearing in mind that the majority of elderly people receive the predominant share of their income from the budget of that <Col N="1670" /> Minister who has a general responsibility, which he takes very seriously, for the elderly.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a matter which has very serious implications for democracy.  In reply to a priority question put down by me last Tuesday I was given false and misleading information. I inquired about the system of recruitment of five staff to the Department of Social Welfare and was told there was no advertisement for these posts.  I asked if it was fair and correct that the advertisement appeared only in the Democratic Left newsletter which is free to members and supporters of Democratic Left.  The advertisement states that wage scales will very but they will be related to Civil Service scales <Col N="1671" /> and that persons interested should submit their CV for the personal attention of John Gallagher, Democratic Left, 69 Middle Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday on the Order of Business I proposed an amendment relating to the budget debate.  I asked the Taoiseach if he would allow Ministers to answer questions immediately after their speech in view of the fact that the anticipatory rule for parliamentary questions on the budget rules out a number of questions that will be put down on that matter in the next three weeks.  After some very honeyed noises by the Taoiseach I agreed to withdraw the amendment on the basis, I understood, that he would instruct the Chief Whip to allow latitude in this regard.  Unfortunately, when I raised the matter subsequently at a Whips meeting I came up against a blank wall.  Will the Taoiseach do what he said he would like done, to allow questions be answered by Ministers either during Question Time or immediately following speeches and not pass this matter back, as his official said, for inclusion in a Dáil reform package due to be introduced at some future date? Will the Taoiseach ask Minister De Rossa to put members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the public, the Taoiseach's party and the Labour Party on the mailing list for this document so that they may also apply for some of those jobs?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right. We should not give a date for the publication of a document until we are ready to publish it.  Frequently Members want information on the Government's best estimate of when a document will be completed and from time to time we give such information.  I assure the House that this White Paper, when published, will be comprehensive, worthwhile and a useful document for all Members in terms of providing guidance as to the relevance and complexity of all the issues in foreign policy with which the Tánaiste, the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies deal. <Col N="1676" /> It is important that it should be prepared with the utmost care and attention to detail.  That is exactly what is happening and it will be made available as soon as it is ready.  It is at an advanced stage, but I am not prepared to compound the problem by giving a precise date as to when it will be available because I do not know that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Ministers to hear me before they leave.  They have embraced office with such élan that their ability to return to their junior ministerial offices so quickly at the end of each Order of Business is a sight to behold.</P>
      <P>An interesting aside to what has been happening in Government is its ability to advertise posts with Civil Service status in such an acknowledged job recruitment agency as Democratic Left. That is something we should behold at all times.  The ability of Ministers to walk away smiling and guffawing when caught in the act should not surprise us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening remarks I pointed to the failure of the Government to understand what makes this economy tick and questioned whether the Government's priority is its commitment to reducing unemployment.  It has been the successive failure of this Government one month after another during the past 12 months to keep the unemployment figure below the lenient target it set.  That is the litmus test of any Government. Ministers who were members of the previous administration would be quick to acknowledge that one of the criteria for the success of that Government was its ability to reduce the number on the unemployment register month after month through the policies it pursued not only in the macro-economic sphere, but by timely interventions to ensure a decline in that number.  It was a priority of Government to seek to reduce unemployment. The absence of strategy in <Col N="1678" /> this budget confirms there is not a focused approach to reducing the number unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have seen an attempt by distinct parts of this coalition to put forward a myriad of schemes and modifications of existing ones to play to their constituencies. The notable exception is Fine Gael which has abdicated all responsibility for the economic management of the country.  While the Minister for Finance is not a member of the Fine Gael Party, I would expect some Fine Gael influence in the preparation of the budget and the adoption of Estimates.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence in the budget to suggest that the Fine Gael Party is exerting the level of influence one would expect given its strength in parliament, its supporters and its mandate in terms of the economic management of the country.  That is a matter of disappointment to me because there are elements within that party who acknowledge and understand the workings of an economy based on free enterprise, on the creation of wealth by those risk-takers for whom it is the job of Government to provide the type of risk reward ratios that render investment more likely than unlikely, that render job creation a more imminent than distant aspiration.  It encourages business to seek new markets in an enterprising manner if it feels it has the support of those vested with the responsibility of managing the economy.  I am afraid we have seen the undermining of confidence of those prepared to take risks in our economy because, despite the most lenient spending targets it has set itself, this Government has exceeded them.</P>
    <P>When I last spoke I pointed out that I thought we had at last dealt with that culture of Government of the late 1970s and early 1980s which failed to meet its targets.  Regardless of political differences on the part of successive Governments from 1987 to date, at least it can be said that successive Ministers for Finance could confirm that the Government targets set for a given financial year had been met and, in many cases, <Col N="1679" /> had been bettered whereas this budget heralds a return to the old culture.  By reason of the spending targets this Government has set itself, it is walking away from the inflation plus 2 per cent spending target set in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> That is an indication, not of a good Government but rather one that has forgotten the reason it was formed in the first place which, on its own premise in economic management terms, was to provide spending estimates 2 per cent in excess of inflation.  Those estimates have actually been 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent in excess of inflation.  It decided to walk away from its own target which does not lend to credibility, individually, or collectively, in devising economic proposals for the management of our economy.</P>
    <P>After the painstaking build-up there has been since 1987 &mdash; derided in Opposition by Fine Gael and others, by both Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; over the past few days we see the social partnership subjected to increasing strain as the trade union movement and employers have had an opportunity to examine in detail just what this Government is making available, of ascertaining the minimal extent to which it is prepared to return to workers and their representatives those benefits which have accrued to our economy because of its previous good management.  Respectable members of the trade union movement, people who wield considerable influence within the large unions and the Trade Union Congress itself, state quite clearly that the prospects for a continuation of the social partnership model of this economy is at serious risk.  The reason they are saying that is the feedback they are receiving from their workers.  In the case of those earning up to £22,000 per annum, their maximum benefit in tax take terms is 1 per cent gross.  In the case of those earning in excess of £22,000 per annum, the gross tax change in their favour will be 1.5 per cent which, when one takes into account <Col N="1680" /> reduced mortgage interest and VHI relief reduces that 1.5 per cent advantage to 0.75 per cent.  That is what those workers are getting from this Government at the top of the economic cycle, having inherited an economy never going as well in macro-economic terms, certainly better than has been the case over the past decade.  That is the benefit emanating from a Government which has, as its second and third member in command, those who claim, through the philosophy of the party to which they belong, to work on behalf of working people, who claimed that, once given the opportunity, they would ensure that working people were given their due desserts on the basis of an economy performing as well as ours at present.</P>
    <P>Despite the huge possibilities for major reductions in taxes, paid particularly on the part of the PAYE sector, nothing has been forthcoming with the exception of a mere 1 per cent in gross terms for those earning up to £22,000 per annum and 1.5 per cent gross in the case of those earning in excess of that figure.  That is a major disappointment to the vast majority of workers in this economy.  Certainly it calls into question the commitment of the Government, not only in relation to its spending targets and its non-commitment to its programme of renewal, but also its commitment to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the social partnership arrangement which has been the real glue which has made this economy work, the real model devised since 1987 to overcome our difficulties, and to find common ground in the economic management of our economy and the provision of the type of socially caring policies widely accepted across the broad range of people with an interest in the running of our economy.</P>
    <P>This budget, which comes at the best possible time for any Minister for Finance or any collection of politicians sufficiently lucky to be in Government, wrecks its own economic programme and places a severe strain on the third successive social partnership agreement introduced since 1987.  That is the <Col N="1681" /> measure of this Government and, if people take achievement out of that, there are very limited horizons on the Government front benches.  It is a major political and economic mistake on the part of this Government not to take cognisance of the binding commitments on whoever may be in Government for the duration of those programmes.  The success of our economy has come about through the ability of successive Governments and social partners to work together, to decide on a common agenda, to make the necessary compromises. If there are Members of this House sufficiently naive to believe that, by being in Government, one can dictate without seeking a broad range of agreement within which one can operate we are heading into a very serious position.</P>
    <P>The loss of confidence on the part of taxpayers, the trade union movement and business organisations has led them to realise this week how little has been done to ensure we have a competitive economy.  Ultimately, the prosperity of this country is dependent not on whether a social welfare increase is 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent, on whether there is a make-jobs scheme here or there, certainly not dependent on the immediate editorial line in the newspapers and media generally resulting from a Government Minister making a Budget Statement in this House.  The future prosperity of this economy will be dictated by the preparedness of the political system to work hand in hand with employers and employee representatives to devise policies which are workable, practicable and acceptable to all, driven home by a political impetus and a will to face down sectoral interests having reached those agreements.  That is what is important.</P>
    <P>The problem with this Government, and the three parties that form it, is its unfortunate capacity to settle with its own sectional political constituency, against the national interest in net terms, thus causing the problems now <Col N="1682" /> being witnessed within the political system and in terms of the under-performance of our economy we will see in ensuing years.  The one criticism one can make of this budget is its complacency about the level of our performance.</P>
    <P>Whenever our economy is performing better than usual, when people are doing a relatively good job, of course we must all acknowledge that performance. I suggest that it is happening because we are in Government and the other crowd is not is such simplistic idiocy it does no service to any Member of this House.  At a time of critical economic development we have a Government walking away from the lenient targets it set itself.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say on this budget in relation to farming because there is nothing in it for the farming sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sum of £15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £15 million out of the total spend in that budget is ridiculous. Anyone who reads the projections for the sheep meat industry, agricultural research and the structure of Irish farming for the next ten years will know we cannot be complacent about agriculture.  There is a mistaken belief that all farmers are doing well and we do not have to worry about them.  While 50,000 commercial farmers are in a position to meet the competitive challenges of European agriculture in the years ahead 1,000,000 farmers are not in that position.  There are 50,000 farmers whose viability is threatened.  We have had nothing in this budget that is proinvestment. All the statistics show that while we have large dairying enterprises five times more profitable than any other sector of agriculture, the vast majority of farmers are not doing well because they do not have viable units and an average industrial wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IFA, the ICMSA and lobby groups sought to bring forward investment plans for farming.  We do not now have on-farm investment plans.  We got <Col N="1683" /> rid of the farm improvement programme, and the control of farmyard pollution scheme is finished since June 1995.  Is there any other business other than dairying that would say its most profitable sector will have 2,500 fewer working in it per year?  If any other part of the economy had that prognosis for the next five or ten years there would be a revolution in this House.  Unfortunately there is inherited complacency in Agriculture House with regard to the 50,000 commercial farmers who feel there is nothing they can do.  Rural decline will be an accelerating factor in Irish life unless the Government and those in Agriculture House do something about it.</P>
    <P>On Question Time today we heard the REPS would go some way towards improving the viability of small holdings. However, it is acknowledged that the scheme and other investment schemes are underfunded this year and that is the reason we had to stop them. We are moving in all the wrong directions. The Minister can point to improved exports, and improved productivity but anyone who reads the data behind those broad figures knows there is a serious issue arising for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Fewer farm families will be in business at the end of the year.  That trend has been there a long time.  When we had an opportunity to do something about it we let it pass and the present Minister is as guilty as anyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this budget which seeks to build on the strong foundations established last year.  The strategy outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will sustain economic development and position our <Col N="1684" /> society to face the future with continued optimism and confidence.</P>
      <P>Last year's budget was a success. Ireland's economic performance in 1995 was better than that of any other economy in the European Union or in the OECD.  The results confirm that we have been successful in achieving the objectives set down at this time last year.  Most encouragingly there are clear signs that the rapid economic growth is being translated into significant increases in the numbers of people at work.</P>
      <P>At the same time the Government's social cohesion measures have ensured that those less well off in our society are being cared for.  The Government remains committed to this principal and the latest budget strategy is consistent with this commitment.  In particular, I welcome the new initiatives and improvements proposed to deal with long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>On the political tactics being used by the parties in opposition to try to divide this Government, the budget produced by the Minister for Finance was a Government budget and each Government party stands over all of its provisions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen misinformed the House when he referred to masses of increases in public expenditure when this year we are talking about a nominal increase of 2.5 per cent over the rate of inflation.  This compares, in the period when Deputy Cowen was in Government, with increases of 11.8 per cent in 1994 and 11.9 per cent in 1993.  This year we will have an increase of 4.8 per cent, including the increase in the rate of inflation.  We are endeavouring &mdash; and will succeed &mdash; to keep interest rates and inflation low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer the charges of Deputy Quill's party on income tax and other things we have not done in this budget, I would remind people that the last time Fianna Fáil and Deputy Quill's party was in Government a £40,000 mortgage cost £130 more per month than it does today.  That is the reality of low interest rates instead of high interest rates.  So <Col N="1685" /> far as the ordinary individual on a £40,000 mortgage is concerned, he or she is £130 per month better off today than during the term of the Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Government. We have had enough lectures from those whose records do not show them in a good light.</P>
    <P>The re-organisation of the Defence Forces and in particular the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech about the provision of £13 million for a voluntary early retirement scheme represents major developments in the defence area.  There is widespread agreement on the need to modernise the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  Its basic underlying framework has remained unchanged for decades.  The review of the Defence Forces undertaken by the efficiency audit group, the main thrust of which has been approved by the Government, provides an opportunity to address many issues in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps which require attention.  A number of issues have been the subject of public debate for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>An implementation group has been established to draw up detailed proposals covering the initial three year period of what will ultimately be a plan of approximately ten year's duration.  I expect to receive the group's report very shortly and I will then be in a position to bring it to Government.</P>
    <P>What is now contemplated is a structured set of reforms to modernise the Defence Forces to allow the current organisation to adapt to the necessary changes.  The military authorities are fully engaged in and committed to this process having been involved in its development from the very outset.</P>
    <P>The rising age profile of military personnel has been a concern for some time.  It is one of a number of issues which will be addressed in the course of implementing the programme of reform in the Defence Forces.  The implementation group will deal in its report with the question of a voluntary early retirement scheme as one of the measures <Col N="1686" /> which will address the age profile problem. The terms of the scheme to be introduced will, of course, be additional to the unique superannuation arrangements already in place for members of the Defence Forces.  Until such time as the report is presented to me it would be premature to engage in speculation about the details of the scheme. However, I want to make it abundantly clear that there is no question of compulsory redundancies.</P>
    <P>As an integral part of the process of addressing the age profile problem and the restructuring of the Defence Forces it is my intention to embark on a planned programme of recruitment. This will enable us to build a vibrant organisation that is in a position to take on the many challenges this process of reform will present.  The first step in this recruitment programme will be taken later in the year.  This review should not be seen as a mere cost cutting exercise. The EAG was not asked to review the Defence Forces in order to produce a programme of cut backs and closures. The objective of the Government is to have a properly equipped Defence Forces which are capable of meeting their roles in the most efficient and effective way.  In addition, the Defence Forces of the future must have the capacity and flexibility to adapt to a changing environment. It is also important that the Defence Forces provide a challenging and rewarding career for all personnel in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps and that their management, organisation and operation are in accordance with best practice.</P>
    <P>A key objective in this regard is to release more personnel for operational duties.  I know that this is what the military personnel want.  In the context of developing and modernising the Defence Forces yesterday I announced the placing of a major contract worth approximately £5.5 million, representing the first phase of the replacement of the Army's primary tactical communications system.  The placing of this contract represents a major step in the upgrading and re-equipping of the <Col N="1687" /> Defence Forces with the latest in modern radio communications equipment.</P>
    <P>An important element in the organisation of the Defence Forces is their deployment in the various barracks. There has been a great deal of what I can only describe as alarmist talk in relation to the closure of Army barracks. I have decided and I have made it clear on many occasions in the recent past &mdash; that there will be no barrack closures as part of the initial plan on which we are about to embark.  There will, however, be a study of facilities occupied by the Defence Forces towards the end of the plan.  In the conduct of that study full regard will be taken of the socio-economic importance of local barracks.</P>
    <P>I would wish to stress that during the entire process of reform and reorganisation there has been, and will continue to be, consultation with the various military representative bodies.  The representative bodies have been kept informed of developments.  I have met on a number of occasions with the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association. Furthermore a sub-committee of the conciliation and arbitration system has been established and is dedicated to discussion with the representative bodies on issues surrounding the entire EAG process.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the various elements of the Defence Forces &mdash; Army, Naval Service, Air Corps and Reserve &mdash; for their work at home and abroad.  Irish troops serving overseas have attracted commendation and acclaim for the consistently high standards they have maintained over the years as peacekeepers often in very difficult circumstances. They have a proud record and tradition and they are deserving of our congratulations. It is particularly in the role of peacekeeping that the professionalism of members of the Defence Forces <Col N="1688" /> comes to the fore.  Irish soldiers have built up an enviable international reputation as peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to the marine area. Our inland fisheries are a valuable resources and it is a sector to which we look to create major employment in the coming years.  A sum of £4 million is being allocated specifically to tourism angling this year.  In addition to ongoing policy and structures reviews, we are focusing on the management of our all important salmon and seatrout.  We will ensure that the new approaches and thinking which will emerge from this activity will energise the sector, expand its employment creation opportunities and allow its long-term development to proceed on a sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>I continue to be convinced of the potential of our marine resources and of our capacity to translate this potential into real and sustainable jobs.  The sea fisheries sector is important for the Irish economy not only because it provides more than 15,000 jobs and makes a significant contribution to the balance of payments but also because much of the economic activity and many of the jobs generated are in remote areas.  The fishing industry is an important employment creator and an important means of keeping communities together in these areas.</P>
    <P>The development of the sea fishing industry will proceed apace in 1996. Under the EU Operational Programme for Fisheries some £32 million will be invested in the various segments of the sea fishing industry this year.  The fleet modernisation programme is integral to the success of this industry.  The current investment programmes and the decommissioning scheme are geared to improving the structure and age profile of the fleet.</P>
    <P>We must encourage young people to engage professionally in sea fishing. This year BIM will run training programmes, with 1,547 places covering new entrants and continuing training for those involved in sea fishing, aquaculture and processing.  The fish processing sector which employs more than 2,200 <Col N="1689" /> people will be given priority attention, as will the marketing of fish at home and abroad.  I have approved 95 projects, involving the upgrading and modernisation of premises at various locations, at a total cost of some £15 million.</P>
    <P>Recent media reports have sought to give the impression that Spanish boats will have unlimited access to Irish waters and that we do not have either the legal right to limit them or the capability to detect and prosecute illegal entry or illegal fishing.  This is not the case and I would like to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>The current situation arises from the accession agreement negotiated with Spain and Portugal in 1986 which granted a ten year lead-in period for open access to the Irish Box from 1 January 1996.  However, due to the position which the Government adopted in negotiations in Brussels at the end of 1994 and throughout 1995 further concessions were secured by Ireland to allow a continuing derogation from the principle of open access in the case of the Irish Box.  Under the new arrangements which came into operation on 1 January the total number of Spanish vessels allowed in Irish waters remains limited to 93, the same number of vessels as have been permitted in our waters since 1986.  Of the 93 vessels, 40 named vessels only are permitted to fish inside the Irish Box.  Accordingly there is no overall increase in the number of Spanish vessels permitted to fish in Irish waters from 1 January this year.  In addition, Spanish quotas have not been increased.</P>
    <P>All vessels in Irish waters will be closely monitored and controlled.  The fact that during 1995 the Naval Service boarded 928 vessels and detained 51 vessels for alleged fishing offences demonstrates the strength of our current efforts.  Since 1 January the Naval Service has undertaken 25 boardings and three vessels have been detained.  By way of essential complement to the Naval activities, the Air Corps CASA aircraft have made a big impact in helping to focus the efforts of surface patrols <Col N="1690" /> more effectively.  During 1995, 267 missions were undertaken by the aircraft and 22 missions have been completed so far this year.  Under new procedures a new mandatory entry-exit reporting system will apply to all vessels entering or leaving the Irish Box.  This will greatly increase our ability to tackle illegal fishing in our waters.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to strengthen still further the fisheries surveillance function. During 1995 in preparation for the new arrangements which apply to the Irish Box, I negotiated new regulations at EU level which will strengthen our surveillance effort.  I achieved EU agreement to a fund of £12 million which will be made available during the period 1996 &mdash; 2000 to this country to fund operational needs of the protection service.  In addition, Ireland will receive support for a significant programme of capital investment in fisheries surveillance equipment and this support will be at a higher rate than that available to other member states.</P>
    <P>These new measures will further strengthen our protection services.  I am satisfied that illegal fishing in our waters will be kept to a minimum.  Any vessel arrested fishing illegally knows that we will prosecute and that our penalties are extremely severe.</P>
    <P>In order that we may realise more fully the potential of our sea fisheries, it is essential that the facilities at our fishery harbours continue to be upgraded. To this end the Government will be investing some £3 million in 1996 as part of our continuing efforts to provide a well equipped fishery harbour structure at strategically located landing places around the coast.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to give the highest priority to the important subject of maritime safety.  My objective in this regard is to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced to minimise the risks to human safety on our waters.  In light of recurring tragedies at sea involving fishing vessels, I recently established a high level fishing vessel safety review group to review the safety status of our fishing fleet.  This <Col N="1691" /> group will conduct the most thorough and wideranging examination ever of the industry and I am determined there will be swift and comprehensive action taken on foot of the group's findings, which I look forward to receiving towards the end of May.</P>
    <P>Over £5 million has been provided in 1996 on marine research, an increase of 8 per cent on the 1995 allocation.  This reiterates the Government's strong commitment to marine research and its confidence that the marine resource offers promising potential for development, employment and wealth.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute has since its foundation made steady progress in line with its statutory obligation to undertake, promote, co-ordinate and assist marine research that will promote economic development, create employment and protect the marine resource.</P>
    <P>Total investment in excess of £8 million has been earmarked for marine research under the Fisheries Operational Programme for 1994-99, again further evidence of the Government's strong commitment.  Initiatives proposed include the provision of an enhanced research vessel capability, projects based research into the management and development of sea and inland fisheries and aquaculture, added value projects in the marine and fish processing sector and a national survey of marine resources.</P>
    <P>As regards the shipping sector, I believe the Irish-flagged shipping sector has significant potential for employment creation in certain areas and is under severe competitive pressure to maintain employment in others.  I intend to engage in intensive discussion with the interests within the sector in the next few weeks.  My objective is twofold: first, to ensure that all options are explored which might assist employment in the sector and second, on foot of this in-depth assessment, to secure where considered feasible, changes which will deliver real Irish employment maintenance and growth in the sector.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress was made in <Col N="1692" /> 1995 on the basis of the strategy and objectives adopted by the Government. I am confident the latest budgetary proposals will allow us to further build on this success and to look to the future with renewed confidence.  I am also satisfied that they provide a solid base for the continued development of the marine sector and will enable us to meet the challenges on the defence side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture is the most important indigenous sector in our economy, accounting for 15 per cent of GDP and one fifth of all employment.  It is worth more than any other industrial sector in that 86 per cent of it is made up of Irish raw materials.</P>
      <P>A number of factors in this budget will contribute to the enhanced prosperity of that sector through the guidance of this Government.  First, there has been a demand by our food industry for increased supports by reducing its PRSI contributions.  The reduction in employers' PRSI, from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent, the increase in the threshold for the lower rate of PRSI and the reduction in the rate from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent, will improve the cost competitiveness of our food industry.</P>
      <P>I am especially pleased that the first £50,000 of income earned by small agribusinesses will be taken at the lower corporation profits tax rate.  That is of direct relevance to people.  It will encourage traders to incorporate their businesses and will be a worthwhile long-term step.  The increase in the employees' PRSI tax allowance from £50 to £80 a week is also of significance, as is the widening of the 27 per cent tax band.  The targeting of tax reliefs to the lower paid is the right strategy.  I support the overall Government strategy, which is not to have tax giveaways and put resources into tax cuts at this time but to ensure that from the public finance perspective, the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement is progressively cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> The Opposition has not acknowledged the facts as far as growth in public expenditure is concerned.  When I was Opposition spokesman for finance, public expenditure was growing in real terms by up to 9 per cent a year.  Nominally, it has been in double digits since 1990.  In the period 1990-94, public expenditure increased by a whopping 40 per cent in nominal terms.  However, that outturn has been reined in to under 6 per cent last year.  Payments relating to hepatitis C &mdash; we were criticised for this &mdash; and other items were put into the 1995 year which could, perhaps have been put in for 1996.  That is an indication of the real estimate of the growth in public expenditure and is almost a halving of what occurred in the past in nominal terms.  It has been cut further this year to 4.8 per cent and that will be honoured.  We may even have a current budget surplus this year.  The current budget deficit is forecast at £82 million but considering the way revenue is growing, that will be superseded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern always prides himself on the fact that he was the first Minister for Finance since the 1960s to have a current budget surplus.  However, that was only made possible through the proceeds of £230 million from the tax amnesty.  That was a one off factor and was acknowledged independently as such.  Therefore, there was no real underlying current budget surplus.  This Government had to meet the latent unpaid bills of the beef fines and the hepatitis C and equality payments.  In that regard, there has been a real improvement in the public finances.  We have the lowest Exchequer borrowing requirement, at 2 per cent of GNP, for over 15 years.  It is nonsense to say that this is a tax and spend Government.  Its performance with the public finances will be seen in retrospect to have been a real improvement and in facilitating low interest and inflation rates, the latter of which may decrease to 2.25 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to deal with the question of land mobility, both in enhancing the farm retirement scheme <Col N="1694" /> and lowering the capital acquisitions tax.  However, the main problem is that because of buoyancy in farm incomes land and quota prices have overheated. Therefore, there is restricted access to new entrants.  The tax concessions for leasing land is another way of coming a that problem to ensure that people  their lands.  It is unlike commercial property where tenants hold all the rights after a few years.  This is a way of facilitating young, energetic, well educated and qualified farmers to get access to land.  The tax concessions announced in the budget, including the exemption of the transfer of stock in the year of retirement, the increase in the exemption limit for income from land leasing and the changes in capital acquisitions tax relief at 75 per cent, are significant and important developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>The most important development for farmers is the increase in the VAT refund rate from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent which will be worth £9 million in a full year.  This is a direct cash aid to unregistered farmers who make up the vast majority of farmers.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased, because of competitive pressure from France, Northern Ireland and Britain in the pigs and poultry sectors, that excise duty on non-automotive LPG has been cut by 2p per gallon.  I hope this is part of a process which will see the duty reduced incrementally each year.</P>
    <P>There is a pressing need to eliminate poverty traps.  In our clinics we have all met people with large families who are better off remaining within the social welfare system than taking up a low paid job.  The Government has announced imaginative measures to deal with this.  These include the provision for the retention of the medical card for three years after entering employment where a person has been unemployed for one year or more; more flexible arrangements for the calculation of entitlement to unemployment assistance and the provision for the retention of full rate child dependant allowances &mdash; the single biggest factor <Col N="1695" /> which has prevented people from taking up employment as, unlike the Department of Social Welfare, employers do not pay on the basis of the number of children in a family.  For the first time in 1995 economic growth was translated into job creation with an extra 40,000 jobs being created, but it is no coincidence that these were not taken up by the long-term unemployed, they were taken up by women returning to the workforce, school leavers and returned emigrants.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector had its best year in 1995 when farm incomes exceeded £2 billion, an increase of 6 per cent on the previous year.  Since 1990 farm incomes have increased by about 30 per cent in real terms when lower interest rates and inflation are taken into account.  Gross agricultural output also increased substantially last year, by 4 per cent, notwithstanding quota restrictions and so on.</P>
    <P>Direct payments to farmers are now a vital component of farm income.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the CAP is worth £1.5 billion to Ireland between direct income aids &mdash; headage and premium payments &mdash; and direct market supports.  Everyone in the economy is heavily dependent on it, it is not just a farmer issue.  In the context of enlargement, we have interests to protect in the next GATT Round, in terms of budgetary reform.</P>
    <P>There are particular problems in the beef sector, arising from the cuts in export refunds, the deseasonalisation premium and the general level of disallowances to which I am committed to dealing.</P>
    <P>A special deal was secured for sheep farmers under which it was agreed that an extra £26 million would be paid at the end of December, notwithstanding the fact that sheep meat prices were lower in other countries which received nothing.  This is indicative of the strength of our negotiating position in Brussels in the context of the CAP.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for my Department <Col N="1696" /> amounts to £614 million.  The Government is committed to the development of the agricultural sector and will seek to enhance many schemes, such as the REPS and the early retirement and installation aid schemes which are financed from the FEOGA Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure, through the Charter of Rights, that farmers are offered a speedy, efficient, friendly and customer oriented service by the Department.  In that context, it is my intention to upgrade a number of departmental facilities this year, including the telephone service.  If one telephones any of the 26 district veterinary or livestock offices, one will be put through to a head office, be it in Cavan, Castlebar, Portlaoise or Dublin, for the cost of a local call.  We also look forward to the provision of departmental offices in Castlebar, Enniscorthy, Tipperary and Roscommon and the introduction of longer opening hours, recently agreed with the CPSU.</P>
    <P>Most of the comments from the Opposition benches amount to little more than sour grapes that they threw away Government office.  They are only now coming to grips with the reality that the economy is in safe hands.  This is not a populist budget, but it is certainly an enduring one which will ensure continuity in terms of growth in employment and output and economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious to everyone that the financial strategy outlined in the budget is wrong, reckless and dangerous.  I predict that in years to come we will look back on this budget as the budget which set us in the wrong direction.  The Government had an opportunity to do something solid, but failed to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will also look back on it as the budget that put Democratic Left in the driving seat and in respect of which there was an interesting and exciting competition between Ministers and their advisers to see which of them could leak more information about its various provisions in advance.  Everyone <Col N="1697" /> knew what it contained prior to its announcement in the House.  The photocalls were arranged well in advance to claim credit for various provisions. That was unprecedented.</P>
    <P>Based on my short experience of two party Governments, it must be a horrendous experience in a three party Government getting into the queue for the photocalls in the days prior to the announcement of the budget to ensure the correct journalist is tipped off.  For example, the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce and technology called a press conference and issued a press release in which he referred to the submission he had made to Cabinet.  That was unprecedented. He indicated in public that a figure of £10 million was urgently needed for science and technology, but lo and behold only £4 million was allocated by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  I am around long enough to know that this was only a public relations exercise.  I have engaged in much public relations work during the years, but never tried to up the ante by announcing in public what was contained in a submission to Cabinet.  This is a clear case of the tail wagging the dog.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of tax reform in the budget.  In Opposition the Deputies opposite, in response to the report of the Commission on Taxation, highlighted the need for reform, including reductions, but it seems this is no longer on the Government's agenda.  Reducing the tax burden is no longer an apsiration.</P>
    <P>The budget provisions are beginning to unravel.  It was strongly criticised by SIPTU which indicated that it is not certain there will be another national understanding.  National agreements and social partnerships, which in the past have been reasonable, have been good for the country.  It would be tragic if the trade unions took the view that the Government has reneged on the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> as this would make the negotiation of a new agreement much more difficult.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> In Opposition the Taoiseach informed the House that he did not believe in national understandings as they only upped the ante, provided for increases the private sector could not afford, in general benefited the public sector and should be done away with. To be fair to him, when he became Taoiseach he changed his mind, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>As I hope I will be able to demonstrate, the financial strategy outlined in the budget is reckless.  It is a budget that demonstrates that a very small party is calling the shots.  It has given up totally on tax reform and is already unravelling.  Not only SIPTU but the small business sector have had strong things to say about it.  It is also clear that the budget was full of tokenism and tinkering.  It has a few bob for twins &mdash; if one happens to have twins &mdash; and for alarms; there are a few words about work trials and it throws in £2 per week. Are twins, alarms, work trials and £2 per week for the populace a budget?  It is a public relations exercise, not the real financial and economic strategy which this country desperately needs. Some of these measures considered individually are quite insulting.</P>
    <P>This is a wrong and reckless direction to take.  I listened to the comments made by Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry about public spending. There is one difference when we discuss public expenditure in 1995 &mdash; this Government 12 months ago told this House that it had a spending target and would stick to it but it missed its target dramatically.  It is also a reckless and wrong strategy because the current budget deficit is predicted to be £82 million.  One might think that is small because it was £362 million last year. However, in this budget the Government is planning to borrow £627 million. Last year the Government borrowed £729 million.  I have problems with this, as would any economics student or person who runs a household.</P>
    <P>I doubt that there is an economist or an accountant in the country who believes that when there are large <Col N="1699" /> growth rates and substantial buoyancy in tax revenue one should borrow £700 million on top of that in order to further inflate the economy.  That is why this is a reckless strategy.  Some Government will sit on the Government benches in a couple of years time and have to cut health, education and other services because we are not doing what should be obvious now.  When there are substantial growth rates, high tax revenue and all systems go in the economy, in other words, when we are doing well, one redistributes some of it but one makes sure that one does not run a deficit. If one runs a deficit in times of high growth and high tax yields one does not have the option to do that when, perhaps, it should be done which is during a recession.</P>
    <P>There are signs of recession.  The United States is slowing down and countries in Europe are finding it hard to meet the Maastricht guidelines.  In order to meet them they will have to put a clamp on spending and that will slow the rate of growth in Europe.  Things are acceptable now with between 5 per cent and 7 per cent growth rates but nobody in this country thinks that will last. When it stops, as it will in a few years, and when tax yields slow down as a result we will see Ministers for Finance coming into the House wanting to borrow not £700 million but £2 billion or £3 billion.</P>
    <P>My strongest objection to this budget is its absolute short-sightedness and the highly political nature of its decisions. The growth rate was 7 per cent in 1995 and it is anticipated to be about 5 per cent in 1996.  Tax revenues are climbing &mdash; in 1995 the tax yield was £11.3 billion and it is forecast to be £12 billion this year, which is an increase of £700 million. GNP has increased from £33.6 billion to £36.2 billion, an increase of £2.6 billion.  It is financial treason, lunacy and political recklessness of the highest order when there are growth rates of 7 per cent, £700 million in <Col N="1700" /> additional tax revenue and a GNP growing by £2.6 billion to borrow £627 million instead of keeping the budget balanced as we did the year before last.  No household would follow that reckless financial strategy.  That is what it is and any amateur economist or economics student could tell us that.</P>
    <P>There are two other reasons why the budget is reckless.  The year 1999-2000 will see the dramatic slowing down of EU funding for this country.  EU funds already provide a substantial portion of our current and capital budgets.  Those funds will start to run out in 1999 but there is no provision for that in this budget.  This emphasises why it is reckless and short-sighted.  There is no provision to prepare for European Monetary Union.  We are meeting the Maastricht guidelines of under 3 per cent but that is no big deal.  However, we are not meeting them with regard to the debt; GNP ratio; we are still a substantial distance from that.</P>
    <P>From the macro point of view it is clear that this budget has been put together for political purposes and as a compromise between two or three ideologies.  It has been thrashed out with no sign of its framers having looked a couple of years into the future.  There is no care for the health and education sectors and the public service which will suffer within a few years as a result of this budget.  The opportunity was not taken to produce a solid surplus, reduce taxation and reduce the debt.  That could have been done by the Government simply meeting its own targets on expenditure.</P>
    <P>Much has been made about current spending.  I do not wish to get involved in quibbling over figures but as Deputy McCreevy pointed out in his speech on the budget and as is clear on looking at the statement on the Principal Features of the budget, the figure is not 2 per cent but over 6 per cent.  Current spending announced last January was £11.8 billion.  However, the post budget spending figure in the documentation is <Col N="1701" /> £12.5 billion, an increase of £700 million. That represents 6 per cent, not the 2 per cent quoted by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the strategy is wrong and dangerous.  It is unfair to the working people who have sought tax reductions time and time again.  I never thought I would find myself in agreement with SIPTU &mdash; that would not be my usual stance on economic matters. However, when they say that they were promised tax cuts and received none I must voice my agreement.  It took this House and successive Governments eight to ten years to reduce the tax rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  Every year for eight years we knocked a little off.  It was at 35 per cent for about a quarter of a century and was reduced to 27 per cent.  What happened this year? It stopped; it could not be accommodated. A Government, particularly one comprising left wing personnel, could not organise a reduction in the tax rate. What kind of left wing people are in the Government when they cannot see that reducing ordinary people's income tax is the best possible way to let them breathe and make money for their families?</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 28 January, 1996 devotes a full page to this budget. The article is entitled &ldquo;Small Change in your Purse&rdquo; and is worked out by Ernst and Young.  They give six examples of its effect on families and others.  The report states that a single woman earning £20,000 per annum will be better off by £1.50 per week, a widow aged 65 will be better off by £3 per week, a single woman in other circumstances as set out will be better off by £2 per week and a single person earning £9,500 per annum will be better off by £3.20 per week. Those in the middle classes &mdash; a derogratory term under this Government &mdash; for example, senior civil servants or executives who earn £50,000 per annum, will be worse off by £6 per week.  The same applies to a couple who earn £25,000 each per annum.  I accept that most of them can afford such a reduction, but that is not the point.</P>
    <P>SIPTU is correct in that there have not been tax cuts or tax reform in this <Col N="1702" /> budget.  The money was simply collected and wasted.  The 7 per cent growth rate and the £700 million in income tax revenue were wasted.  Ordinary taxpayers certainly did not benefit and that is obvious from the report of the independent accounting firm in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> who compared the figures for this year and last year.  I challenge anyone to dispute them.</P>
    <P>The budget failed miserably in the area of tax cuts.  I did not expect anything else from Fine Gael or Labour but I expected the Democratic Left to secure real tax cuts for people earning £9,500 per annum, not a tax cut of £1.50 per week.  The clawback in VHI and mortgage interest relief payments will mean they will be worse off.  The reduction from 37 per cent to 32 per cent in mortgage interest relief will take effect in a few weeks' time.  Therefore, the £1.50 tax reduction will be useless. This is the hallmark of the Government. The social welfare increases are not targeted at any section, they are merely spread across the board so that the Minister can say he received a particular percentage for social welfare purposes. The increases are not targeted at the elderly or the needy, rather everyone will get a few bob, but very little in the long run.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to set up a plethora of schemes ranging from tax relief on alarm systems to work trials.  It will be interesting to see how they will work. This budget is the hallmark of double thinking and compromising.  The Government does not have a clear economic strategy.  One could forgive the big give-away if it was evident in people's wages.  It is obvious from the report by Ernst &amp; Young in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> that nobody will be better off as a result of the budget.  Where has all the money gone?</P>
    <P>I welcome the £4 million funding for science and technology.  However, rather than a strategic exercise to develop the science and technology area on foot of the Tierney report, it is propped up as a political handout in a <Col N="1703" /> couple of paragraphs of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Tax reduction following high economic growth is not a fancy right-wing notion.  It affects ordinary people earning £9,000 to £15,000 per annum because they take home more pay, save more money and by buying more Irish goods generate growth in the economy. The notion that tax cuts affect only the rich must be dispelled.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business Deputy Ahern referred to the task force on security for the elderly.  The advertisement in Sunday's newspapers in that regard is a cynical exercise.  It states that the Minister for Social Welfare has decided to set up a task force that will make recommendations to him on how the security needs of pensioners, who are not in a position to avail of the tax relief initiative to install burglar alarms, can be addressed.  In other words, a task force is required to implement a single recommendation that if people cannot avail of tax relief they must get grants.  It is cynical of the Government to pretend that this will help elderly people, it will only add to their sense of insecurity.  It would make some sense if a task force was set up to examine security for the elderly in general or to examine the income of the elderly in a broad context. However, the proposed task force will be given only one term of reference, to decide what to do for the approximately 100,000 people who cannot avail of the tax relief.  Approximately 13,000 can avail of it.  A child would know that if people cannot avail of tax relief they must get a grant and one does not need a task force to give political cover to do that.  It is a simple decision and the Minister could make it himself.  The advertisement specifically refers to pensioners who are not in a position to avail of the tax relief.  The answer is obvious, they will get a grant or nothing.</P>
    <P>What is the task force being set up to do?  It is unfair to pretend to the elderly that there will be a massive overhaul of their security when the only answer the task force can come up with is to give a <Col N="1704" /> grant to those who cannot avail of the tax relief.  If they do not have a taxable income they cannot get tax relief.  The Government should withdraw the advertisement, forget about the task force and decide to pay a small grant, which would not dramatically affect public finances, to people who install burglar alarms and cannot avail of tax relief.  This is the most cynical advertisement I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he proposes to reduce the corporation tax rate from 38 per cent to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income for all companies. The small business task force of which I was chairman for one year produced 109 recommendations, 20 of which have been put into effect.  Many of the other 89 would assist small businesses and the Minister should consider them.  The reduction in corporation tax will apply to all companies, not only to small companies.  If one owns the Allied Irish Bank, the Bank of Ireland or Michael Smurfit's company, one can avail of this tax relief.  The Minister made a similar mistake last year when he handed out a couple of million pounds to the banks.  Rather than targeting the reduction in tax at small companies, particularly small service companies, he gave a 2 per cent tax cut across the board which meant that large companies benefited from a huge tax reduction.  I am sure they welcomed that reduction, but it was neither necessary nor requested.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's good intentions in respect of small companies and compliment him on proposing a figure of £50,000 he should not apply the reduction to all companies.  It should be targeted at small companies, particularly service ones, otherwise they will not be able to provide employment. There are 150,000 small companies in the country.  Of those, over 110,000 are service companies, and about 100,000 of those employ fewer than three people. That £50,000 will be of real assistance to those, which is why I support the idea. However, it was unnecessary and wrong <Col N="1705" /> to extend it to all companies in the State.  It was not sought or demanded. There may be administrative reasons, but it was a missed opportunity to use the additional funds to target small companies rather than spreading the money across the board.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the budget of our State companies.  How can a budget lay out the financial and economic strategy of this State for the next 12 months and not mention the semi-State sector which maintains the high ground of economic policy at the moment?  There is no direction given to our State companies, and no debate allowed in this House.  I have consistently sought information from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications about what is going on in Telecom Éireann. We are told there were nine companies bidding to buy one third of Telecom Éireann.  Now I am told that, systematically over the past year, four of them have fallen away.  We are down to five, and I predict that a few more will fall away before it is too late.  What is going on in the Cabinet regarding the sale of shares in Telecom Éireann?  Is there a problem at Cabinet level on the question of progressing the strategic alliance in Telecom Éireann?  We can get no information.  I have consistently sought documentation from the Government about what is going on in Telecom Éireann.  This Government talks about doing things in the open.  I have asked for a consultant study on the future of Telecom Éireann.  I have asked for a debate in this House on the proposed strategic alliance which is nothing more than a sale of shares.  The phrase &ldquo;strategic alliance&rdquo; is to cover the Democratic Left who, 12 months ago, were opposed to selling shares in State companies. Today, they sit quietly while we sell off one third of the jewel in the crown of State companies.  We have heard not a cheep, not a heckle, across the floor from them regarding the sale of one third of the largest State company in the country.  We can get no consultant's reports and no information from the Government, only negotiations going on <Col N="1706" /> behind closed doors with whoever the Government is talking to, and no public information.</P>
    <P>What about the thousands of subscribers to Telecom Éireann who built up the company over the years?  Are they being given a chance to buy a few shares in Telecom Éireann?  Why should it be Singapore Telecom or some millionaires in Singapore or in the City of London who can buy a part of Telecom Éireann?  Why can Irish pension funds not have a share in it?  Why can Irish workers with their money in Irish pension funds not buy a couple of shares in Telecom Éireann?  It is being sold off privately, quietly, with no discussion, no debate in this House, nothing from the left-wing parties, to the highest bidder internationally, probably at the far end of the world, and no chance for the ordinary Irish investor in this fine company.  Instead, I am told that it is too important to be discussed here, that it is a strategic alliance and that we have to do it this way.  It is disgraceful behaviour, and I will be pursuing the matter again very strongly in the weeks ahead.  What is happening in Telecom Éireann now is a political, economic and financial disgrace and it has to stop.  I will be interested to hear what the Deputies opposite have to say about that when the time comes.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that within two days of the budget speech the Opposition has abandoned this year's budget as the focus of its political attack in favour of the crime issue.  That is as much a commentary on the success of the budget and on the success of the Government's management of the economy as it is of the Opposition's concern about crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has put the spotlight on long-term unemployment.  In doing so, <Col N="1707" /> the Government has gone to the root of poverty, educational disadvantage, the cycle of dependency and the social problems on which crime and drug abuse breed.</P>
    <P>Given the fiscal parameters to which the Government has rightly committed itself, this budget inevitably had to reflect choices.  It simply would not have been possible, with the resources available, to satisfy every expectation in the areas of social welfare improvements and tax reliefs.  Instead of attempting to please everybody, the Government has consciously and courageously decided to address directly this country's most serious social economic and human problem, that of persistent long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>By all the conventional economic measures, Ireland now has a very healthy economy.  Economic growth is real, unprecedently high.  That growth is real, as figures for activity at our seaports which are available to me clearly show.</P>
    <P>Over 90 per cent of the external trade of this country is through our seaports. In 1995 cargo throughput through the major seaports increased by 12.66 per cent on 1994 and passenger throughput increased by 5.4 per cent, confirming the increased activity in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The tangible results of economic growth are also in the unprecedented increase in job creation, low interest rates and low inflation.  Only this week many mortgage holders received notification of a reduction in their mortgage interest and monthly payments.</P>
    <P>Despite the booming economy, however, the problem of long-term unemployment has persisted.  Much of it is concentrated in disadvantaged urban areas, where dependency on State assistance is high, where social problems such as drug abuse are prevalent and where the associated problems of unemployment, poverty and disadvantage tend to repeat themselves from one generation to the next.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the rising economic tide has not lifted all boats.  As a society, we have a choice &mdash; to confine the benefits <Col N="1708" /> of the economic boom to those participating in it and to leave the damaged boats behind to sink, or to go back and repair those boats and ensure that society develops in a cohesive way and that the quality of life for all is improved.</P>
    <P>The argument from Opposition spokespersons and from some commentators that this year's budget should have effectively confined itself to reducing taxes, is the worst kind of &ldquo;shorttermism&rdquo;, because it ignores the biggest economic problem in our society, namely, unemployment.  Nobody likes paying tax.  Everybody wants to pay less, but what use is it to reduce tax to such a level that essential public services can no longer be adequately provided or that social problems are ignored to the extent that they manifest themselves in drugs and crime?  Extra disposable income does little to improve the quality of our lives if it has to be spent on private insurance schemes and private security to shore up collapsing social services and a ruptured fabric of society. For most workers even the most exttreme tax cuts proposed by the Progressive Democrats would hardly be sufficient to buy a decent burglar alarm.</P>
    <P>The Government has continued the process of tax reform by targeting the tax measures at the lower paid.  To listen to Deputy Brennan, one would think that there were no tax measures in this budget.  He appears to have ignored the increase in tax allowances, the widening of the 27 per cent band, the raising of the tax threshold, the taking of 18,000 people out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>In deciding to focus the budget on long-term unemployment the Government has acted responsibly.  Unemployment is bad for the individual out of work because it limits income and demoralises and diminishes personal esteem.  It is bad for the families of the unemployed because it impoverishes them, leaves them dependent on State assistance and establishes role models for the young which suggest that it is possible to make a living without working for it.  Unemployment is bad for <Col N="1709" /> communities, as any examination of areas of concentrated high unemployment will show.  High unemployment is bad for the taxpayer because it costs not just in direct social welfare payments to the unemployed but on a range of other associated forms of State assistance &mdash; supplementary welfare, rent allowances, reduced differential rent, schemes to combat educational disadvantage etc. Long-term unemployment is the root cause of dependency on State assistance, and anyone who is serious about ultimately reducing this area of State expenditure has to root out the cause.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, high levels of unemployment fertilises the ground on which drug abuse and crime generate and grow. Unemployment does not excuse crime and, of itself, does not cause crime.  The vast majority of unemployed people never have and never will do anything criminal.  The children of the vast majority of unemployed people are well reared and will not get into trouble but there is a minority whose idle hands, having failed to find something constructive to do, will end up dabbling in criminal activity.  For example, the young man who drops out of school, has never got a job, goes straight onto the dole, does not know the discipline of work, stays in bed late, idles around part of the day, watches violent videos for another part, is a candidate for crime.  It is far better for him personally, and a far better use of public money, to find a way to put him to work or back into education or training than to leave him and then possibly end up having to find a prison place for him after the damage is done to him, his family and his victim.</P>
    <P>By putting unemployment at the top of the economic agenda, the Government is exercising its responsibility to help build and sustain a stable society. The Government's management of the economy, resulting in increased economic activity, will generate a further 31,000 net new jobs this year.  Although such employment creation is at an alltime high, it is not sufficient to tackle the scale and deep-rooted nature of long-term unemployment.  Special <Col N="1710" /> measures are required and are being provided for in the budget.  The employment subsidies and PRSI changes make it easier and more attractive for employers to take on extra staff.  The targeting of tax and PRSI measures at the lower paid together with the elimination of poverty and unemployment traps will make it more attractive to take a job.  The extension of existing schemes and the introduction of new ones will help to re-introduce to the world of work those who have been unemployed for a long time.</P>
    <P>The exercise of responsibility, however, is not confined to the Government. With the favourable economic climate, and now the special subsidies and PRSI reductions, there is an added responsibility on employers to provide additional jobs.  There is also a responsibility on trade unions to take a more generous view of the opportunities for the community employment scheme and other schemes than has been the case in some areas in the past.  Finally there is a responsibility on the unemployed person to take up a job or training opportunities when presented.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about `the incentive to work.  Clearly, there have been some disincentives to taking up employment. These include low levels of pay compared to the levels of social welfare payments, especially if the unemployed person has a number of dependants, and the loss of secondary benefits such as the medical card.</P>
    <P>This budget seeks to redress these disincentives. Persons who have been unemployed for at least one year will retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment.  Family income supplement is being increased and extended.  The method of calculating entitlement to unemployment assistance is being changed to encourage people to take part-time work.  The back to work allowance scheme is being extended.  Child benefit, between this budget and the last, has been increased by £9 per child.  The tax and PRSI changes have been targeted at the lower paid to open up the gap <Col N="1711" /> between reward for work and social welfare payments.  These improvements, together with the special employment measures, are the first major attempt at eliminating the financial disincentive to taking a job.</P>
    <P>Under the social welfare code, it is a condition for payment of unemployment benefit or assistance that the recipient be available for and seeking work.  Apart from this obligation and apart from the so-called &ldquo;incentive to work&rdquo; issues, there is a responsibility to take a job if it is available.</P>
    <P>Very many people who are at work in our economy are financially only marginally better off &mdash; if at all &mdash; than if they were totally dependent on State beenfits.  Many people willingly take up jobs or opportunities on training and employment schemes, even though on purely financial criteria they end up no better off.  All of these workers are entitled to fair wages or salary.  Their incentive or motivation to work, however, is based not only on the monetary reward but on the sense of personal fulfilment which work gives them and a sense of social responsibility they exercise by contributing to the economy and to society.</P>
    <P>No society can afford the luxury of idleness.  If society is to work, all able citizens must play their part &mdash; by contributing through taxation, by working in the house or in a job or by involvement in neighbourhood or community work.  The concept of social solidarity, which is one of the pillars on which this budget is built, is not a new term for State payments &mdash; it is an idea for a cohesive society where the needs of the weak are provided for and where all members of society play an active part.</P>
    <P>The approach taken by the Government in this budget and the debate which is following it is really concerning the choices which face us about how our society is to be organised in the new information age.  Are we serious about the need for an inclusive society or do we want increasing atomisation which <Col N="1712" /> ultimately leads to the very well off opting out, the very badly off dropping out, and everyone else working in the middle having to cope with the consequences?</P>
    <P>Essentially the question being asked about this budget is where should the gains of good economic performance be applied.  Some Opposition spokespersons want to gratify short-term demands.  By deciding to tackle the most pressing and central issues of unemployment, the Government has made the best choice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan may be right.  The budget will be remembered, not for the reasons he has stated but because it has tackled the most central social, economic and human problem facing the country, which is unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget because I want to be unashamedly parochial and address the problems which confront a beleaguered industry in my native town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First I wish to shed a silent tear for Deputy Hogan.  Last year he was made to walk the plank because of a minor indiscretion for which he was not fully responsible.  When we consider the leaks over the past two months, we can understand the lack of interest which has been evident in this House.  When I first became a Member there was a tremendous buzz of excitement on budget today.  Today it is a non event. People used to queue to implore Deputies for admission to the Visitors Gallery to hear the budget secrets. There were secrets in those days but not any more.  The lack of interest in the budget by the nation was evident by the small attendance in the gallery last week, which was only quarter full.  The usual political activists were not evident in the House, which was taken over by spin doctors.  Deputy Hogan is entitled to feel a little hard done by, given the length and extent of the leaks over the past two months.  There were more leaks than there are from the sunken fleet in Scapa Flow.  Deputy Hogan has <Col N="1713" /> been in the sin bin for some time but I hope this bright young man will take his place again in ministerial office.</P>
    <P>If I were in Government I would be very concerned about the unprecedented leaks of official documents over the past year.  Rumours abound of documents being handed to newspapers in brown paper parcels.  Indeed it is significant that one journalist seems to be the beneficiary of most of these leaks. That is a matter of some disquiet not only for the Government but for every Deputy in this House.  What is the motivation behind these leaks?  Is it financial gain or disaffected feelings of ideology?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to leaks to another Sunday newspaper columnist who purports to be a consultant in the field of crime.  The Minister for Justice should address that problem.  It is of some concern that details affecting the Garda Síochána are leaked to a person and used for the purpose of sensationalism. I refer in particular to a murder in my native town some nine months ago.  A man was strangled and the following week a banner headline appeared under this lady's name to the effect that a serial killer was at large in Dundalk. There was not a vestige of evidence for that story and it aroused my anger, the anger of the gardaí in Dundalk and that of my constituents, particularly elderly people living alone.  That journalists was apparently given an award for journalism but I would give her an award for bum reporting of the year.  She should apologise to the people of Dundalk for that article.</P>
    <P>Last November I tabled a question asking for a press council to be established. It is about time some rein was put on journalistic licence.</P>
    <P>This budget was predictable.  It was as good as could be expected and had my two colleagues on the opposite side of the House been in power they would be saying what I am saying now.  The system formulates budgets and it does not matter what party is in power.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cullen will allow me say that, as a cynic.  I welcome one or two aspects of the budget, in particular the tax relief on businesses which will benefit family owned businesses.  It is extraordinary that many family owned businesses fail to survive the first generation because of our excessive taxes.  Three weeks ago I visited a Utopian paradise, Kuwait, there is no tax of any kind &mdash; perhaps we could all retire there.  It was a huge contrast to come back to this benighted country where we are all bogged down with tax regardless of what party is in Government.  I welcome tax relief on businesses because family businesses are the bulwark of business activity.  They were in operation long before the supermarkets and many of them will remain when the supermarkets are long gone.</P>
      <P>The hypothetical tax bill on the transfer of a business to a son or nephew on the death of a father or uncle, has been more than halved by the increased tax relief.  That is a practical step which is to be welcomed because many old people do not know when to pass on their businesses and leave major problems for the families that succeed them.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of my party to ensure that in the coming year Fine Gael is seen to care for the interests of middle income earners and the selfemployed who have supported us down the years and who perhaps have seen our clothes stolen by the party of my colleague opposite, Deputy Quill.  Fine Gael supporters need reassurance that they will not be submerged in Government by the ideology of the two left wing parties.  I need reassurance that will not happen.</P>

      <P>I am a little disappointed that only meagre mortgage relief was given to middle income workers.  VHI subscribers will get mortgage relief of £80 but when one considers the £100 increase imposed by the VHI during the year, there is no net benefit.  Will the Minister consider opening the door to competition in that area from British companies such as BUPA?  The VHI have a monopoly at the moment.  We denied the <i>Independent</i> the right to come to the aid of the 600 workers in the <i>Irish Press</i> because of monopoly questions, yet we are allowing the VHI a monopoly in this area.  It can do what it likes.  We should invite competition from the UK and avail of its companies' low subscription rates.</P>
      <P>On the social welfare increases, the social welfare budget is approximately £4.4 billion per year and neither I, nor anyone, would begrudge increases to genuine recipients, but some years ago I said that our national emblem should be the fiddle instead of the harp.  I also said we could have a national orchestra of fiddlers in every county and that is undoubtedly true.  Every PAYE and PRSI worker is carrying a few monkeys on his or her back.</P>

      <P>That is a heavy burden. People are not given any incentive to work.  As Deputies, we are all aware of constituents who say they are better off on social welfare and who want to go for the gold bar &mdash; the medical card. That is alarming.  Some time ago the well known financial columnist, Senator Shane Ross, referred to the creation of a social welfare monster.  We have created that monster and the alarm bells are ringing.  My friend and racing colleague, Deputy McCreevy, was pilloried by Deputies on this side of the House some years ago when he warned that the water in the well might run dry.  Deputy McCreevy's honesty is refreshing and rare in politics, yet the politicians who knew he was right homed in on him and <Col N="1716" /> took political advantage of his comments.</P>
      <P>Certain elements of our social welfare system must be thoroughly investigated. If a person is genuinely made redundant and cannot find work he deserves our continued help, but that does not apply to the gangsters who exploit the system by signing on the dole while doing odd jobs.  The going rate for a man on the dole is £40 a day even to do menial tasks in the garden.  That is not bad if you can retain a medical card.</P>
      <P>Some middle aged people on the verge of redundancy are gripped by a new malady and symptoms of illness before they terminate their employment. Their doctor will sign them off as unfit to work.  These people are not content to receive a lump sum but want the State to provide as much as possible for them.  This major scam should be stopped.  People who are genuinely unable to work should be helped but after a thorough medical investigation. The people who are working are carrying a burden of £4.14 billion on their shoulders.</P>
      <P>No other industry in the State has been as maligned as the cigarette industry. In former budgets the old reliables, drink and cigarettes, were hit but due to the power of the drinks industry lobby that industry is getting mighty respite and it is now down to the cigarette industry.  I do not advocate cigarette smoking because of the question mark about its damage to health but I believe in the right to choose.  The cigarette industry is being smothered by taxation. Tobacco products are unique in that the excise duty on them is increased in every budget whereas the duty on products such as beer, wine, spirits and petrol go through lengthy periods without an increase.  This is highly discriminatory against an old, legitimate and valuable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still 800 people employed in this industry in high unemployment black spots such as, inner Dublin, Tallaght and Dundalk.  I acknowledge that the 10p increase this year is modest compared with the 15p increase in the <Col N="1717" /> United Kingdom and, obviously, the industry lobby is getting through to Ministers and civil servants.  While we acknowledge the increase was lower than in the UK, tobacco excise rates have increased by 45 per cent since the 1991 budget, just short of four times the rate of inflation.  No other industry has been subjected to such savage levels of increase and, ultimately, the high retail price is the reason that the illegal sale of cigaretes is so attractive.  Smuggled cigarettes from Eastern Europe are being sold on the streets of every town under the nose of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The 800 employees in the tobacco industry enjoy above average rates of pay and conditions.  In addition, a further 3,500 full-time equivalent jobs are provided as a result of links in the wholesale and retail trade.  These jobs continue to be threatened by excise increases above the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Tax on tobacco products in Ireland is among the highest in the European Union.  This has led to increasing penetration of the Irish market by tobacco products smuggled from lower tax countries. The retail value of this illegal trade is estimated at £20 million annually and represents an annual loss of £15 million to the Exchequer.  If the smuggling issue is to be addressed and Ireland is to remain a viable location for tobacco manufacturing, the rate of increase in excise duties will have to be curtailed in future budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The kindest thing one can say about the budget is that it resembles something else in life &mdash; the build-up was brilliant but the thing itself was a huge let down.  It is puzzling that so little could have led to so much leakage. Come next April the average worker in the Republic will pay income tax of 48p in the pound whereas his or her counterpart in Northern Ireland will pay 24p in the pound.  In the past 70 years we had to contend with political partition and my fear is that unless something dramatic is done quickly about taxation, we will suffer severely from <Col N="1718" /> economic partition in the next 70 years. I say this in Deputy McGahon's hearing.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, in her speech, instead of taking the opportunity to comment on the budget, concentrated almost exclusively on the Progressive Democrats's tax reform proposals published earlier this month. It was flattering that she should have devoted so much time and attention to an analysis of our taxation document. Perhaps she was demonstrating her intelligence because in truth what could she have said in defence of the budget? May I remind her of the record of the Labour Party in Government?  The Labour Party has been in Government for three years during which time there have been four budgets and the yield from income tax rose by more than £700 million, most of this from the PAYE sector.  The national debt rose by almost £4 billion and public spending rose by almost £2.5 billion.  In the past 12 months unemployment rose by 5,000 in spite of a strong and much praised economy.</P>
      <P>Income tax will increase further this year.  By the end of 1996, if the Government lasts that long, the Labour Party will have been party to increasing income tax by £1,000 million and the PAYE sector will foot most of the bill. Having said that, we should not wonder at the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, confining her remarks to a critique of the Progressive Democrats' tax proposals rather than an analysis of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is a calculated insult to PAYE workers.  The Minister for Finance gave a glowing account of our booming economy but it does not appear to be of much benefit to those who live and work here.  We are told in each successive budget that the economy is doing well but there is no money to reduce taxation or introduce reform. The tax burden remains to cripple and bear down on the hard pressed PAYE sector.  There is no real commitment to tax reform.  In fact, there was no reference to it in the Minister's speech. <Col N="1719" /> Income tax will rise by £260 million in 1996 and the bulk of this money will be extracted from the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>When the proposed changes in the budget take effect a single person earning £150 per week will be better off by £1.71 per week.  That would not buy a pint of stout.  Such a person will not go on a binge after this budget.  A married couple with two children and one earner with an income of £15,000 will gain £3 per week or 75p for each member of the family.  A clerical assistant in the Civil Service on £192 per week will gain the princely sum of 87p per week, enough to buy a can of coke and a Mars bar. That is what the PAYE taxpayers received.  How can we say we want to reward work and create an enterprising economy when that is the way we treat workers?</P>
    <P>Workers in modest circumstances continue to be crucified under the tax system.  The Government seems to have turned its back on this sector.  We cannot continue to fleece the PAYE sector. It flies in the face of any concept of social justice to ask a person earning £248 a week to pay 56p out of every pound they earn to the Government in taxation, PRSI and levies.  We cannot do that and pretend to have a social conscience.</P>
    <P>Few taxpayers will be better off as a result of the budget.  The Minister, very cleverly, failed to mention that tax relief on mortgage interest payments and VHI premiums will fall sharply from next April.  This will increase the tax bill of a typical family by £25 per month.  Many taxpayers will be worse off when the measures in the budget are fully implemented.  The budgetary tables show that the total take from income tax is set to rise by £260 million in the current year.  The Minister said 18,000 people will be removed from the tax net.  Who will pay the extra £260 million? The average taxpayer will pay approximately £4 per week extra in taxation as a result of the budget.  So much for tax reform.  If we continue to penalise people for working we should not be <Col N="1720" /> too surprised if we have a huge unemployment problem and in estimating its extent and the success of our job creation efforts we are in danger of indulging in self-delusion.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the live register and the tens of thousands of people on various Government schemes and programmes 350,000 people cannot find a proper job.  This is equal to one in four of the workforce &mdash; a frightening statistic for a country supposed to be experiencing a major economic boom.</P>
    <P>The official labour force survey statistics indicate that 54,000 additional jobs were created between 1992 and 1994. These are the numbers the Government spin-doctors like to throw around, hopeing they will not be questioned by an unsuspecting public.  All the indications are that these figures overstate and distort the true position.  A closer look at the labour force data is revealing.  Some 54,000 jobs were created over the last two year period but the spin-doctors do not point out that 33,000 of those were part-time.  In other words, when you analyse our much vaunted job creation performance you find almost two out of every three jobs generated are part-time ones.  In some of the major supermarket chains up to 95 per cent of the workforce is comprised of part-time staff. They replace a full-time, 40 hour per week worker with three low paid part-time workers.  Because of the crazy way we present our labour market statistics, that counts as the creation of two new jobs.</P>
    <P>Incredibly we only have a detailed breakdown of the employment figures up to April 1994.  We are working with data that is almost two years out of date. How can we hope to address the unemployment problem properly if we do not have up-to-date and accurate information? Preliminary figures published just before Christmas for 12 months to April 1995 show an increase in employment of 49,000 during the previous year. Democratic Left Ministers and spokespersons fell over themselves trying to claim credit for this great performance, oblivious to the fact that they had been <Col N="1721" /> in Government for scarcely 12 weeks of the 12 months in question.</P>
    <P>A detailed breakdown of the figures for April 1995 will not be available for another year.  That is how long we must wait to find out how many of the 45,000 new jobs are part-time positions in supermarkets.  I do not have anything against people working on a part-time basis if that is what suits them but we must adopt an honest and accurate approach to compiling labour market statistics.  Could we not, for example, speak in terms of full-time job equivalents? Would that not be more accurate and give a clearer and more real picture? Politically speaking, in the interests of the three joyful mysteries of openness, transparency and accountability, would it not be better to make the necessary changes to the official data so that a true and accurate picture of overall employment is available to planners, policy makers and the public?</P>
    <P>There is little point in pretending we are creating thousands of jobs if that is not the case.  We are fooling nobody. We certainly are not fooling people in my constituency of Cork North-Central. The issue of part-time working is only part of the problem.  During recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of people on temporary Government schemes.  There has been a sharp increase in the number of people employed in the Civil Service and public service.  The number of programme managers and handlers employed by this Administration is almost large enough to have an impact on the labour force survey.  The more closely you look at the figures the more obvious it becomes that we are creating very few real jobs in the traded sector.  That is a poor return in an economy which is supposed to have grown by more than 20 per cent in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to tackle the jobs problem is reflected in the most recent unemployment figures.  The numbers out of work as measured by the live register have increased by 5,000 since this Administration came to power more than a year ago, yet employers <Col N="1722" /> complain they cannot find people to fill vacancies.  A recent survey by the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland found that 22 per cent of firms questioned had difficulty recruiting unskilled workers.  The association representing retail grocers stated that there are up to 500 vacancies in shops throughout the country.  A spokesman for that association said that young people are now unwilling to take up jobs paying £150 per week.</P>
    <P>It is no use complaining that the jobs on offer are lowly paid.  They are lowly paid because of the crushing burden of personal taxation which the Government continues to levy on those on modest incomes.  A person taking up a £150 per week job in the retail sector would have to pay more than £26.50 of their hard earned income in income tax and PRSI.  What encouragement is that for people to move from the dole to paid employment?  We are in danger in taxing work out of existence.  There is a need to integrate the taxation and social welfare systems.  I understand that a commission or task force is considering this subject &mdash; that seems to be the modern day equivalent of draining the Shannon. Completion of the work of a task force is always imminent but never achieved.  The saying in Cork is that we are always one report away from action.</P>
    <P>We have created a very deep divide in terms of personal taxation on this small island.  A worker in Newry on £300 per week is £16 per week better off in terms of take home pay than a person on the same wages in Dundalk, 12 miles down the road.  While it costs an employer in Newry £1.67 to give an employee an extra £1 per week in take home pay, the cost to an employer in Dundalk is £2.54, almost 50 per cent higher.  The message this sends to employers is clear: if you want to create jobs do so in Northern Ireland, not in the Republic.  Competition from Northern Ireland for jobcreating investment will intensify considerably in the wake of the peace process and the return to normality of the economy there.  How can we hope to <Col N="1723" /> compete with Northern Ireland for jobcreating inward investment?  That is a matter that was blindly ignored in the budget.</P>
    <P>The weakness of sterling makes industry in the Republic increasingly uncompetitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> its counterpart in Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is estimated that up to 60,000 jobs are dependent on exports to the UK.  Those jobs could be at risk if the competitiveness of our industry is allowed to deteriorate further.  The key to restoring and protecting competitiveness is not devaluation, otherwise we would find ourselves devaluing every time the British Prime Minister lost a vote in the House of Commons.  The key to ensuring competitiveness is a reduction in costs for industry.  In particular we must seek to reduce the cost of employing people.  That means substantial cuts in personal taxation and PRSI both for employees and employers.</P>
    <P>High levels of direct and indirect taxation have created an economic partition in this country.  Let us take the case of a person on £300 per week who wants to buy a new car, say, a 1.3 litre hatchback.  If that worker lives in Newry he or she will need about 38 weeks take home pay to buy that car but if the person lives in Dundalk it will take 56 weeks take home pay to buy the same car.  In terms of real net personal income the same vehicle is 50 per cent dearer in the South than in the North.</P>
    <P>To digress from this subject, I spoke with representatives of nurses' unions today about the impending nurses' strike, and their quarrel is not with gross pay but with take home pay.  Nurses are not taking home the amount of money their profession demands and they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is no real commitment to tax reform in the budget.  My party has shown how the basic rate of tax can be cut from 27 to 20 per cent and how the higher rate can be cut from 48 to 40 per cent.  That could be achieved over a five-year period provided public finances are <Col N="1724" /> managed prudently.  A tax reform package need not involve a reduction in Government services.  The key to success is not in cutting public expenditure but in controlling it.  The Labour Party and Democratic Left have dismissed our proposals, but I suppose that is to be expected.  That is politics, but it is disappointing and depressing for the people.</P>
    <P>I have noted that no Fine Gael spokesperson has criticised our tax proposals. Am I to take it there is an implicit agreement from that side of the House to our proposals?  We are constantly told we cannot afford tax reform, as if we could continue to tax work as a luxury.  Real tax reform is possible provided we manage our public finances in a prudent and sensible way.</P>

      <P>The Nobel laureate, Samuel Beckett, in one of his best known works places the character of Vladimir centre stage where he spends his time and his entire theatrical lifetime &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo;.  Fortunately for the character it is a short play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not give me great pleasure to say that the Minister for Justice has become the Vladimir of this Administration.  She has spent the entire of her ministerial lifetime to date in the centre of the political stage waiting for legislation. Unfortunately for the Irish audience her play has been running too long. <Col N="1725" /> After 14 months of political hibernation, no doubt enforced by her colleagues in Democratic Left and the Labour Party, she still shows no sign of legislative life.</P>
    <P>Legislation which was priority last summer remains unpublished on the eve of spring.  For some reason the Minister appears to be forever awaiting a legislative postal order from the parlimentary draftsman's office.  Her performance in office was succinctly encapsulated in the editorial of <i>The Irish Times</i> last Thursday which suggested that since taking office she has done little but stumble from one crisis to another giving the distinct sense of trying to make up answers as she goes along.  The questions posed at the end of that editorial as to whether the Minister is up to it or if the Government cares are being asked by many in this House and elsewhere.  They are being asked by people who care about crime who have watched the Minister and the Government stumble from the Brinks-Allied fiasco through the Castlerea crisis into this winter of unacceptable death.  They are questions which need to be asked and answered because this Government has demonstrated time and again that it does not have a criminal justice policy.</P>
    <P>The public have a right to expect leadership and direction from the Government in the battle against lawlessness. In the hierarchy of obligations a Government has to its sovereign people the protection of human life is a superior obligation and one which must be enforced by a Government in a democratic society.</P>
    <P>Drug related crime has been identified correctly as being responsible for up to 80 per cent of all indictable offences.  In the first six months of 1995 the Garda made 2,835 drug seizures. That represented a 9 per cent increase on the same period in 1994.  Last July the Minister for Justice announced to a great fanfare a legislative and organisational initiative against drug traffickers. The proposed legislative changes were simple and common sense.  We, on this side of the House, <Col N="1726" /> strongly supported the Minister for Justice at that time.  Unfortunately, her colleagues in Democratic Left and the Labour Party were less enthusiastic.  That may explain the inexorable delay we have witnessed since.  The Minister's proposals were to give gardaí, under supervision by the courts, the power to detain suspected drug traffickers for up to seven days; to give Garda chief super-intendents the power to issue search warrants in urgent, drug related cases and to give Customs officials the power to question the persons they had arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking. The measures were announced in a media blitz no doubt orchestrated by the publicly funded army of advisers retained by the Minister and the Government to boost their woeful image.  The message was intended to be clear, &ldquo;look up, Minister Owen and the Government are actually doing something&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have broken their self-imposed embargo on crime prevention legislation and promised the Government will publish a Bill.  That message was a carefully crafted fraud.  The Minister and the Government were doing nothing.  They were posing and preening for the press, basking in the blaze of publicity and all the while the dust on the desks of the Minister and members of Government remained undisturbed.</P>
    <P>The legislative famine continued through the hot summer into the mellow autumn.  Seasons changed but the Minister and the Government did not.  Inac-tivity piled on indifference and this was compounded by indolence.  Fresh autumn turned to frozen winter and the season of ministerial and governmental hibernation continued.</P>

      <P>With spring a matter of hours away the Minister's sole remaining but increasingly reluctant <Col N="1727" /> political ally, the Taoiseach, announced to the House that the legislation would be published within weeks.  Unfortunately, this is the measure of the Government's commitment to combat crime.  The much hyped initiative has resulted in a six months silence.  The measures which were deemed to be needed on extremely urgent matters last July were parked in a political lay-by once the arc lamps were turned off.  The Government is concerned more with appearances than with action.</P>
      <P>When &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; invited the Minister to account for the performance by her and the Government, the Minister for Justice was unavailable.  So much for the promise of openness given by the rainbow Coalition.  Whenever the opportunity of a soft photocall presents itself the Minister and her Government colleagues abandon their desks with enthusiasm and pose with their noses poised above the most recent cache of illicit drugs.  If the Minister and the Government spent more time tackling crime and less seeking spurious publicity, they might have avoided the political fate which everyone in this House knows awaits them.</P>
      <P>Regarding the fight against crime, the Minister and the rainbow Coalition have achieved their ultimate ambition &mdash; they have become transparent and the people of Ireland have seen through them.  The advantage conferred on drug traffickers by the delay in introducing this legislation is lamentable.  The attitude of the Government to the delay is despicable.  This is the Government which promised accountability.  To whom has Minister Owen been made accountable for her six months delay? Why does one standard exist for Ministers and another for public servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the then legal assistant at the Office of the Attorney General was forced to resign because of the delay in dealing with work within his area of responsibility.  Minister Owen and the Government are responsible for the prolonged legislative drought.  The <Col N="1728" /> Government and the Minister are responsible for making promises which could have been kept, but which they chose to neglect.  The Minister, in particular, is responsible for the failure to produce promised and necessary legislation over a protracted period.  Will the Government which promised accountability deliver on the promise?  The answer to that question is a simple no.</P>
    <P>Those who seek to occupy the high moral ground would have themselves judged by different standards from ordinary mortals.  The Minister for Justice and the Government have failed but the usual excuse is not available to them at this time; this time they cannot say they inherited the problem.  The Minister for Justice herself identified the need; she announced the cure; she declared the urgency but she and the Government delivered nothing.</P>
    <P>In July 1995 the Minister announced what she termed the most radical, farreaching and significant steps ever taken in the history of the State to deal with the drugs problem.  She stated that her measures were the result of a painstaking and detailed analysis of the drugs problem.  Critically, in a speech delivered to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family and the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on 12 October last, having recited statistics in respect of drugs seizures, she stated that these were damning statistics calling for action, contending that that was precisely what she was doing.  For once, the Minister correctly identified the urgency of the situation.  She trumpeted that &ldquo;time is of the essence&rdquo; and announced that the necessary legislative change required to bring these provisions into law &ldquo;are receiving priority attention in my Department&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister for Justice and other Ministers in this rainbow Coalition are prone to wearing accountability as a halo.  I want the Minister and her colleagues in Government to apply the requisite standards of accountability <Col N="1729" /> to herself and the Government.  Since she contends that &ldquo;time is of the essence&rdquo; and priority attention is being given to simple legislation, is it acceptable that legislation announced in July last should be allowed to lie dormant for the months of August and September, only to be dusted off in October for a speech and then replaced on the shelf for the months of November, December and January?  If that is the Minister's and Government's idea of priority attention, if that is the best they can muster when &ldquo;time is of the essence&rdquo; is it any wonder that <i>The Irish Times</i> asks: &ldquo;Is the Minister up to it and does the Government care?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility for this failure rests with the Minister for Justice but let it be clearly stated that collective responsibility rests with the Cabinet. One wonders why the Minister for Justice has not been treated to the sanctimonious finger-wagging of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Is there any doubt but that, if a Fianna Fáil Minister was responsible for such an inordinate delay, at this very moment the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs would be filing the fangs of his personal political vampire, Mr. Fergus Finlay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, comprised of three Parts, is neither revolutionary nor complex but is urgent and necessary.  Part I gives legislative effect <Col N="1730" /> to the precise terms of the changes announced by the Minister in July last. Part II provides for the abolition of the cumbersome system of preliminary examination of indictable offences obtaining in the District Court, replacing it &mdash; so far as drug trafficking offences are concerned &mdash; with a fasttrack system guaranteeing a trial within 90 days of arrest.  Part III provides for an updating of the unsatisfactory temporary release scheme.</P>
      <P>In October last the Minister spelled out the exact details of the Bill agreed by the Cabinet in July 1995.  Her precise words are of importance and I shall quote them:</P>
      <P>The report on which my proposals are based also identified certain deficiencies in the law as it stands as regards the powers of the law enforcement agencies to take effective action against drug traffickers.  To overcome these deficiencies, the following measures have been agreed:</P>
      <P>(1)  Certain increases in the powers of detention of gardaí and the courts in relation to persons suspected of drugs trafficking offences.  There has been a great deal of comment about these powers so let me spell out quite clearly what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, will be amended so as to allow the Garda, on the certification of a Chief Superintendent, to detain a person suspected of drug trafficking for a period of 24 hours initially and, if necessary, for a further period of 24 hours.  On request, a judge may permit the extension of the detention period up to a maximum of 72 hours if satisfied that this is necessary and, upon further request, may permit a final extension of the detention period for up to a maximum of a further 48 hours, if satisfied that this is necessary. Furthermore the legislation introducing these measures will be reviewed after 12 months in operation <Col N="1731" /> and the detention provisions will lapse after 12 months unless renewed by motion of both Houses of the Oireachtas</P>
    <P>(2)  Extension of responsibility for the issue of search warrants in drug related cases to a garda, not below the rank of Superintendent,</P>
    <P>(3)  An increase in the powers of Customs officers in relation to the questioning of persons detained on suspicion of importing illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>(4)  The designation of certain Naval officers as &ldquo;enforcement officers&rdquo; for the purpose of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in connection with drug trafficking offences at sea.</P>
    <P>Part I of this Bill gives legislative effect to the Minister's announced intentions and, I stress, represents both Fianna Fáil and the Minister's policy.  Therefore, I make the Minister this offer: if she supports the passage into law of Part I of this Bill, my party will not press for the enactment of Parts II and II which, while excellent in themselves, represent exclusive Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>In the past the Minister has been prepared to accept and support Fianna Fáil sponsored legislation.  For example, before Christmas she supported the Fianna Fáil Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, and Fianna Fáil amendments to the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, which had the effect of bringing the principal sections of the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill into law.  On that occasion the Minister declared it to be a good day for democracy that Members combined their efforts to produce effective legislation.  I suggest that today too can be a good day for democracy and can result in the necessary powers being given to those who lead the fight against drugs.  The Minister can give them that power or, alternatively, deny them it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, governs the administrative conduct of indictable criminal offences.  As I have reiterated on many occasions, as we approach the millennium, the provisions of that Act become more and more outdated. One example above all others serves to highlight the absurdity of its provisions &mdash; the absolute right it gives an accused person to have depositions taken in every criminal case.  This time consuming procedure has outlived any usefulness it might ever have had.  An Act which requires that evidence be transcribed in longhand by a District Court clerk has no place in our criminal justice system.  For example, an accused person, wishing to manipulate the system to his or her advantage, can delay a trial many months by requiring depositions to be taken.  In addition, the plethora of expensive remand hearings, wasteful of taxpayers' money and Garda resources, serves no useful purpose and should be replaced by a system that sends accused persons to the court of trial as speedily as possible where the necessary documents can be served and a trial date fixed.  Speed really ought to be of the essence.</P>
    <P>The present position under which backlogs have resulted in unacceptable delays in having criminal cases heard must cease.  I urge the Minister to proceed as expeditiously as possible with the appointment of new judges under the Court and Court Officers Act and make the necessary provision for new courts and officials to facilitate the conduct of trials.</P>
    <P>Some crimes are so serious it is wholly inappropriate that those convicted of them should be released temporarily save in exceptional cases of humanitarian need.  I contend that drug trafficking falls within that category.  I do not believe any prisoner convicted of a drug trafficking offence should be temporarily released; the provisions of Part III of this Bill would so ensure.</P>
    <P>If the Government wishes to be open <Col N="1733" /> and transparent in relation to this matter it should have no difficulty accepting the provision of this Bill requiring the Minister to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the name of every prisoner released temporarily, together with details of the crime for which he or she was convicted and the length of sentence which has actually been served.  It is a simple, straightforward provision which seeks merely to inform the public of the Minister's activities.  Given the Minister's and her colleagues' fondness for photo opportunities I have no objection if she or any of her colleagues wishes to augment the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> by having a photograph of them shaking hands with each of the thousands of prisoners they release each year, published with the notice.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this Bill the Government has two choices.  It can support the Bill and give the Garda and Customs officials the necessary powers to combat drug traffickers or it can oppose the Bill.  If it takes the latter course the question has to be asked, who would benefit from its opposition? The answer is clear: drug traffickers alone would benefit.  If the Government oppose the Bill it must answer why.  The only possible answer to that question would be that the Minister and the Government wish to be saved from political embarrassment.  My understanding of the position is that the Minister is giving favourable consideration to the Bill. I invite the Minister in the House tonight to say she will accept the Bill. The truth is that if the Bill is not accepted the question posed in <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial, does the Government care, will have been answered loudly and clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the measures which the Minister for Justice announced today, in so far as they meet the sustained, prolonged and severe pressure <Col N="1734" /> brought to bear by the Fianna Fáil Party over a period of 14 months, they are welcome.  There will be general disappointment that all the 278 prison places will not be in place for a period of 18 months.</P>

      <P>Nothing could <Col N="1735" /> illustrate this better than the failure of the Government to bring the promise of the Minister for Justice before the people.  Last March on the public airwaves the Minister for Justice promised the people there would be a referendum on bail to provide that, if a judge was of the opinion on the balance of probability that an individual was likely to commit a crime while on bail, he could refuse bail for that reason alone.  For our part, we brought forward the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill which would have imposed restrictions on those on bail and placed conditions normally attached by judges on a statutory footing. The Minister told us we were only tinkering with the problem.  We then produced the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995.  The Minister for Justice and the Fine Gael Party, presumably against their will if one takes into account the previous pronouncements of the Minister for Justice, voted the Bill down and told the people they would not give them the opportunity of deciding on the matter.  One can only take it that the Tánaiste and the Leader of Democratic Left decided they did not want to put this measure before the people.  However, there was a second more pragmatic reason.  It related to the decision by the Minister for Finance to cancel the proposed prison places which would have been at an advanced stage now.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Misuse of Drugs Bill before the House, was the delay in introducing the seven day detention provision with judicial review the fault of the Minister for Justice alone or was her procrastination encouraged by the Tánaiste and the Leader of Democratic Left?</P>

It is certain, irrespective of what so-called civil libertarian concerns some people may have in respect of hardened criminals, the position cannot be allowed to continue and everybody knows that.  In the last week there has been a number of horrendous murders in communities that stretch right across the country; criminal activity, on a scale that was once unthinkable, has become a grim and frequent reality; cruelty and depravity of a nature, which in the past was unacceptable, have now become commonplace.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, at the urging of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, has taken a step forward today.  Public outrage about which I warned on numerous occasions on behalf of my party demanded that action be taken.  I humbly suggest that, because the Misuse of Drugs Bill is not yet on the Statute Book, because the number of people committing offences while on bail has risen dramatically in recent years, because there are hardened criminals on temporary and early release and because of the inertia of the rainbow Coalition Government over a protracted period, the measures announced today, while welcome in so far as they address some of our concerns, will be seen by many as too little too late.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, for sharing his time with me and congratulate him on the excellent work he has done on the preparation of this Bill.  I can think of no more important legislation to come before this House than this measure which is not only timely but is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have felt for some time that the greatest single threat to society today is that posed by the drugs menace.  So serious is the problem and its potential for the society in which we live that I sometimes feel we are watching the disintegration of western civilisation as we <Col N="1737" /> know it.  Misuse of drugs and their illicit sale and distribution is a creeping cancer in our society for which the only cure is surgery.  The practice of drug taking and the ensuing profit making must be removed with clinical care and efficiency in clean and successful surgical strikes.</P>
    <P>We must facilitate all the appropriate State agencies in carrying out this surgery efficiently so that the fabric of society can survive.  The Bill not only facilitates the Garda to make the necessary incisions but also enables the Customs and Excise officials to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I realise that some of these points will be regarded as an exaggeration or hysterical appraisal of society today. However, anyone who looks at the state of society in the more developed economies and the social problems which invariably follow a major upswing in economic fortunes can be under no illusion that the menace presented to us by the misuse of drugs is one of the greatest we have ever faced.  We only have to look at the extent to which drugs, particularly the new designer drugs, have invaded our towns and villages to realise that ordinary measures will not be enough to combat this scourge.</P>
    <P>All the soundings in my constituency indicate that the public not only approve of but demand a realistic programme of action to combat the menace of drugs.  Unfortunately such a programme has not been forthcoming from the Government and the Minister has once again proven herself incapable of reading the mood of the public, capitalising on the goodwill which exists for strong and decisive action and delivering to the public the kind of protection they not only need but deserve and crave.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Garda are crying out for resources to tackle the unprecedented crime wave it has taken the Minister much too long to extend to the <Col N="1738" /> weakest and most vulnerable sections of the community the kind of protection they are entitled to expect.  All the indications are that when the Garda finally get the go-ahead to mount operations they have been straining and struggling to put in place they achieve results; they have proven on many occasions that when given the resources they can produce the results.  I congratulate them on the breakthrough they have made in dealing with the rural crime wave.</P>
    <P>By its very nature the drugs trade is lucrative and any business which makes people rich the easy way will not be surrendered easily.  This is not just an Irish problem, it does not originate within our jurisdiction and we do not have it within our power to single-handedly work against the threat.  However, we are sovereign nation and when we find evidence of the drugs trade within our jurisdiction we should take all the necessary measures to eliminate it and make those involved amenable to the law.</P>
    <P>In her statement on 19 July last &mdash; as usual this was heralded by a fanfare of self-congratulatory trumpets &mdash; the Minister promised to wage an all out war against the drugs scourge which she described as a threat to the very fabric of our society.  This has been a phoney war, contested by a shadow boxing Minister where the criminals are winners on points all the way; it has been fought on deferred payments and we have yet to see the first shots fired. Obviously the Minister does not believe her press release because if she did she would surely have taken some positive action during the succeeding six months to curb this threat to the very fabric of our society rather than sitting back and hoping that someone will do something about it.  She operates on the Mr. Micawber principle that something will surely turn up.</P>
    <P>This is the most promising Minister for Justice for a long time &mdash; she promises this and that but delivers on nothing.  In an effort to make up for <Col N="1739" /> some of the shortcomings of a Minister who seems to be gripped by political paralysis Fianna Fáil brought forward this measure which proposes to give the Garda the extra powers they need to deal with the godfathers of crime who are making fortunes out of the misery of the most vulnerable in society.  I do not understand the Minister's lethargic attitude when the nation is crying out for positive action and a realistic campaign to fight the drugs menace.  The Garda stand ready to do their part but are hampered by a lack of resources and the need for extra powers to speedily investigate suspected trafficking in and misuse of controlled substances, to enter premises which are suspected of being used for the illicit drugs trade and to detain and question suspects about drug related crime.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sinister about this measure, it contains nothing to which the average citizen could or would object.  Rather we are trying to level the playing pitch so that the criminal does not have all the advantages in our system of justice.  We have built into the Bill the necessary safeguards to ensure that there is no abuse of the extra powers granted to the Garda.  The Bill proposes to give the streets of our towns and cities back to the people, to take fear out of the rural byways and to give back to people their right to an undisturbed night's sleep.  It is as basic as that. The stones on the road know what life is like for ordinary citizens but the Minister seems to have forgotten what it is like, if indeed she ever knew.</P>
    <P>There comes a point in any society when people perceive that a problem has gone on for too long and is not being properly addressed.  That point has been reached and passed in so far as the drugs problem is concerned and the public wants positive and decisive action to deal with it.  This measure is designed to facilitate a hands on approach by the Garda in dealing with <Col N="1740" /> the problem &mdash; they say it is the only effective way to deal with it.  The problem must be tackled on three levels: reducing the supply of drugs reaching the Irish market; reducing the demand for illegal drugs and dealing with the health problems associated with drug dependency.  If we, as legislators, and the Ministers with responsibility for implementing anti-drugs policy do not approach the problem seriously and do not have the will to take effective action then we will condemn countless thousands of people in this and future generations to a life of misery and a living hell.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a talent for identifying problems and promising solutions but she has an even better talent for doing nothing about them.  The Bill is a positive step towards curbing the activities of the drug barons, dealers and victims of those traffickers in death, the users.  It is necessary to condemn unreservedly those who advocate or try to condone the illegal use of drugs.  When newspaper columnists and some chat show hosts give the impression, unwittingly or mistakenly, that it is in order to recommend half an ecstasy tablet instead of a full one they are being irresponsible in the extreme.  People in positions of authority and those who are regarded as role models have a particular responsibility not only to do and recommend what is right but to be seen to do it also.</P>
    <P>There is a body of opinion which suggests that we should legalise the use of cannabis on the grounds that it would take it from the underground market where it now exists.  However, if they ever achieve this they will then proceed to legalise the underground arms trade or murder so that people can admit openly to it without the fear of legal sanction.  That is utter nonsense. Invariably the people who advocate legalising drugs have little knowledge of its effects.  They do not have to go out nightly and face the horrors of another <Col N="1741" /> death from drugs, with all the loneliness, hopelessness and misery which surrounds it.  They do not have to break the news of the death of another young person to distraught parents who cannot understand where they went wrong or how society failed them.  Those grieving parents have no difficulty outlining the measures which need to be taken.  They believe action needs to be taken now, that a minute delayed is another potential tragedy.</P>
    <P>It is indicative of the misinformation in circulation and the irresponsibility of some people's approach to drugs that we are told that the sale and use of cannabis is legal in Holland when this is not and never was the case.  The police in Amsterdam did not enforce the drugs laws for a while which led to the free availability of cannabis in coffee shops. However, the Dutch authorities saw the folly of their ways and are now enforcing the anti-drugs legislation fully.  Contrast the advice of the loony theorists who would have us believe that the so-called mild drugs cause neither medical or social damage with the experience of the Garda who fight the drugs menace at the front line.  The Garda have no difficulty in condemning the use of illicit drugs not just because they are sworn to uphold the law but because they see on a daily basis the human misery caused by the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>Those who traffic in drugs for profit should be shown no mercy and should incur the full rigours of the law.  The dealers must know that what they are selling young people on the streets and in back alleys, pubs, dance halls etc., means possible death or, at best, a life or misery, dependence and insecurity. In any other context these people are outcasts in society.</P>
    <P>The fine legislation will fill very obvious gaps in the armoury of the Garda in their fight against drugs.  Quick action is of the essence if we are to overcome this form of crime.  The Garda must have quick access to buildings, be <Col N="1742" /> able to speedily arrests suspects and immediately confiscate any substance, article or document before important evidence is destroyed.  The drug trade must be eliminated wherever it exists. Fianna Fáil is committed to that principle and we are prepared to discharge our legislative duty to achieve that end. I ask the Minister to accept this reasonable and constuctive measure which will help to improve the social environment in which we live.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to talk only about this Bill and not respond to the many fanciful assertions made by Deputy O'Donoghue. To quote a former leader of his party, I propose to offer the Deputy the charity of my silence.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is, of course, to be commended for the work he has put into the measure before the House tonight; I have commended the Deputy before and no doubt will do so again.</P>
      <P>The Government believes it is important for this House to show a united front in the fight against those who indulge in the deadly trade of drug trafficking.  We should seek as broad a consensus as possible on the measures which need to be taken and avoid futile divisiveness.  It is in that context, I am glad to say that the Government will not oppose the Second Stage of this Bill.  I should make it clear that the Government intends to bring forward its own Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill within the next couple of weeks and that speedily progressing that measure through the House is likely to prove the best way to put effective laws on our Statute Book in this area as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While not opposing Second Stage, it would be wrong of me to pretend that there are not serious concerns that the Bill before the House this evening <Col N="1743" /> would be likely to give rise to constitutional difficulties, fall foul of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and perhaps prove unworkable in practice.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons which has been put forward for taking this Bill this evening is the alleged delay in the Government bringing forward its own legislative proposals in this area.  I do not believe that the general public would thank us for indulging in some unseemly political squabble or egotistical games as to who should take credit for introducing particular legislation, especially in an area as important as this.</P>
    <P>All I propose to say on this matter is that before a Government brings forward legislative proposals it must be satisfied they are comprehensive, effective and likely to withstand challenge in the courts.  Particularly in an area such as the present one, which involves fundamental human rights of the individual, that process can take time.  All of us can get frustrated because of that &mdash; I know I do &mdash; but it is time that has to be taken if we are to ensure as best we can that the law we put on the Statute Book achieves what we want it to achieve and cannot be used by those against whom it is aimed to thwart its purpose.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the introduction of legislation was only one part of the wide ranging anti-drugs package which the Government announced.  Substantial progress has been, and continues to be, made on the other elements of that package.  I will mention just two examples; a Garda national drugs unit has been established and the memorandum of understanding between the Garda and Customs and Excise has been signed by agency heads and endorsed by Ministers recently.</P>
    <P>There is little disagreement in the House on the desirability of the type of <Col N="1744" /> legislative proposals which the Government indicated it would bring forward as part of its anti-drugs package and to a large extent what is at issue in this debate is how best to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the detail of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, I think there is a general point that needs to be made about criminal law reform.  Much is being made by some of a suggestion that since I became Minister for Justice, I have brought forward no measures to reform the criminal law.  That suggestion is misleading.  For example, the Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995, contained a series of measures which will contribute significantly to improving the operation of our criminal justice system. The House will be familiar with what that legislation contained so I will only give one example of the improvements which it has brought about; it has ended the abuses that were possible through persons charged outside Dublin &mdash; Cork in particular &mdash; electing to be tried in Dublin.</P>
    <P>That suggestion about the lack of criminal law reform overlooks too the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act which represented an effective and swift response to a particular difficulty which came to light with existing law which could have adversely affected the interests of victims.  It would be a narrow and technical definition of criminal law reform which excludes measures designed to increase the efficiency of the operation of the criminal justice system and ameliorate the plight of victims.</P>
    <P>One sometimes gets the impression in this House that, as far as some Deputies are concerned, the vast number of criminal law measures which have been enacted over the years somehow evaporate after a period of time and that the Garda no longer have them available to them.  Ther reality, of course, is that there is already on our Statue Books a huge corpus of criminal law which is used day in day out successfully in the <Col N="1745" /> detection and prosecution of offences. For Deputies to pretend otherwise is to ignore reality and to do a great disservice to the legislative work of both present and former Members of this House, including a former Minister for Justice on the backbenches, particularly those who have served as Ministers for Justice including members of the Deputy's party.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, recognises that changing circumstances and developments in relation to the nature of crime means that our criminal law must be kept under constant review so as to identify measures that are necessary to ensure it is sufficient to cope with modern realities.  That is way, since becoming Minister for Justice, I have had a major programme of criminal law reform under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>A new Criminal Law Bill will abolish outmoded distinctions in our criminal law and provide the Garda with a modern statutory code dealing with powers of arrest and entry onto premises.  A Non-Fatal Offence against the Person Bill will replace with modern provisions much of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  A Juvenile Justice Bill will represent the most comprehensive reform in this area since the foundation of the State.  A Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will free up gardaí from spending a lot of time in the courts rather than on the prevention and detection of crime and a Fraud Offences Bill will tackle in a modern, effective and comprehensive way what is often referred to as &ldquo;white-collar&rdquo; crime.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that this is not some sort of &ldquo;wish list&rdquo;.  For example, the Government has already approved the detailed general schemes of the Juvenile Justice and Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bills.  All of the measures which I have mentioned are ones on which a substantial amount of work has been done, but as with the Drug Trafficking Bill we have had to <Col N="1746" /> ensure they will have been properly drafted, will be effective, take fully into account how they will operate in tandem with existing legislation and, of course, meet the necessary constitutional requirements.  I am confident the very substantial amount of effort and time that have been devoted to these measures since I became Minister will bear fruit this year and our criminal justice code will be substantially improved as a result.</P>
    <P>I wish now to return to the detail of the Bill before the House this evening. As I understand it, one of the primary functions of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill is to give effect to a series of legislative proposals which the Government indicated last year it would bring forward in the context of a comprehensive package aimed at dealing with the scourge of drug abuse in the community.  Those legislative measures include increases in the powers of detention by gardaí in relation to persons suspected of drug trafficking offences, the extension of responsibility for the issue of search warrants in drug related cases to a Garda not below the rank of superintendent and an increase in the powers of Customs officers in relation to the questioning of persons detained on suspicion of importing illegal drugs.  In fairness to the Deputy, his Bill has a stab at all three proposals as well as including a couple of other proposals of his own.</P>
    <P>Section 1 purports to provide increased powers of detention for gardaí in relation to offences specified in the First Schedule.  Those specified are sections 15, 17, 19 and 20 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  A strong case can be made that, while the Bill covers some of the main offences at issue, it is not sufficiently comprehensive.  An obvious example is that it does not include a reference to section 21 (1) of the 1977 Act which deals with aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a commission of an offence under the Act.  It is hardly the intention that these should be excluded. <Col N="1747" /> In this context I remind the Deputy that the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides a definition of a &ldquo;drug trafficking offence&rdquo; which would include attempts of the kind I have mentioned and also covers offences of money laundering in relation to the proceeds of drug trafficking, but while it might be a relatively straightforward matter to change the definition to cover the type of serious offences for which the increased powers of detention should be available, there appears to be other fundamental problems with the section.</P>
    <P>The advice available to me is that the courts here would be unlikely to hold as constitutionally sound a provision which purports to allow seven days detention unless appropriate safeguards are included.  I would like the Deputy to explain to the House in his reply how this Bill would be likely to pass that test.</P>
    <P>For example, while he applies some of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, to detention under the Bill he excludes section 4 (5) requiring that a person be charged when there is enough evidence to do so unless that person is suspected of another offence and the member in charge has reasonable grounds for believing that the continuance of the detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence. He also omits applying the various provisions of section 5 of the 1984 Act which deals with access to a solicitor.  I am not aware of any sound basis for excluding those provisions, but to do so would clearly increase the danger that the detention provisions would be unlikely to withstand constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>In that context perhaps the most serious potential flaw in the section is the provision that where applications are made to the court to permit a further period of detention &mdash; after the first 48 hours which would be authorised by a chief superintendent had elapsed &mdash; these would be made <i>ex-parte</i>, in <Col N="1748" /> other words, the suspect would not be brought before the court for the hearing. Leaving aside altogether what our courts may make of that in the light of constitutional requirements, the reality is that there is a large body of jurisprudence built up under the European Convention on Human Rights to the effect that failure to bring a person, the subject of a lengthy period of detention, before a judicial authority is contrary to provisions of the convention.  The advice available to me based on that jurisprudence is that a provision for detention for the kind of periods envisaged in the Bill &mdash; and in the measure which the Government will bring forward &mdash; which did not involve the suspect being brought before the courts would fall foul of the convention.</P>
    <P>There is yet another aspect to section 1 which troubles me and could cause its soundness to be further called into question. While section 1 applies to the offences set out in the First Schedule the court, in deciding whether to authorise a period of detention, is asked to do so only if the judge is satisfied that the offence under investigation is a &ldquo;substantial and serious&rdquo; offence.  On what basis is the court to do this?  What is this concept of a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; offence?  On what grounds is a court to decide that an offence involving, say, the possession of drugs with intent to supply is not a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; offence?  If these questions are capable of being satisfactorily answered, I suggest the answer belongs in the legislation.  As it stands, there is this concept introduced which is placed there without further explanation or guidance.  Either the powers should apply to particular offences or they should not and, if the formula that is being proposed is intended as some sort of safeguard, it will represent nothing of the sort if the courts determine that it is incapable of interpretation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, unlike the 1984 Act, is silent on the circumstances under which someone can be rearrested under it and on <Col N="1749" /> the face of it would allow rearrest for the same offence any number of times without, for example, fresh evidence becoming available or judicial involvement prior to rearrest.</P>
    <P>Taking all these factors together, I believe the House will share my concern that it is likely that section 1 would give rise to constitutional difficulties and fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>There are other practical problems which could render the section unworkable. I mentioned earlier that some provisions of the 1984 Act are applied to detention under section 1 and others are not.  I am not aware of whether these omissions were made as a matter of policy or through an oversight, but it is the case that there are other provisions of the 1984 Act which for clearly practical reasons should apply but for which the present Bill makes no allowance.  For example, section 6 of the 1984 Act allows a garda, where a person is detained to demand his or her name or address, cause that person to be searched and so on and provides for an offence for refusing to give a name.  It is inconceivable that powers of detention should be provided without including such a provision.  Incidentally, the Bill does not make provision either for applying the powers contained in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, to take forensic samples from the detainee.</P>
    <P>A final point which I should make about this section is that the Government Bill proposes to allow the designation of places of detention &mdash; for example, Garda stations where particular facilities are provided &mdash; to deal with the specific situation where a person is suspected of &ldquo;stuffing or swallowing&rdquo; a drug and this is not an issue which is addressed in the Deputy's Bill.</P>
    <P>I have spent some considerable time dealing with section 1 because clearly that is at the very heart of the Bill and, if <Col N="1750" /> it fails, there are fundamental problems with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that section 1 shall cease to have effect unless renewed by motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would face the Oireacthas with a choice of not renewing the section or renewing it forever.  Rather than facing the Oireachtas with this stark choice, it might be more appropriate to provide for periodical renewals of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the issue of a search warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent in particular circumstances. This is broadly in line with what the Government proposes, but it is by no means clear why the ancillary provisions of the search warrant power in section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, are not being applied to such warrants. For example, the ancillary powers in section 26 allow the member of the Garda Síochána named in the warrant to arrest a person for the purposes of searching him or her and keep a person under arrest until such time as the search under the warrant has been carried out.  I would be interested to hear if there is any particular reason it was not considered appropriate in the Bill before the House to provide for those powers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 seeks to provide powers for Customs officers to question a person having first warned that person of certain matters.  It provides for a procedure whereby any questions and answers shall be recorded in writing and read over to the person being questioned at the termination of the interview.  I have to confess that this provision is a bit of a mystery to me.  While it is the case that the Government indicated that it was the intention to provide an increase in the powers of Customs officers in relation to the questioning of persons detained on suspicion of importing illegal drugs, we did not envisage bringing about a situation where the role of the Garda in putting together evidence for use in a prosecution might be supplanted. What we had in mind was the sensible step of allowing Customs <Col N="1751" /> officers to be present at &mdash; and, where appropriate, participate in &mdash; the questioning of persons detained by the Garda.  The Government's Bill will allow for this.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill before the House essentially seeks to abolish preliminary hearings in the case of offences covered in the Second Schedule to the Bill &mdash; which, incidentially, are identical to the offences covered in the First Schedule mentioned earlier.  There is repeated reference in the Bill to the Second Schedule which is exactly the same as the First Schedule.  This reminds me of Beckett's &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo; of which Deputy O'Donoghue is so found and from which he has already quoted.  A critic of that play said that it is a play where nothing happens twice.  The same can be said about the Second Schedule. I think the Deputy realises it is a repeat of the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>While there may be technical problems in the manner in which it is drafted, I propose only to deal with the general policy issue to which this gives rise.  There is a view held strongly by some that preliminary hearings are an anachronism and in this day and age are open to abuse by persons who want to put every procedural obstacle in the way of being brought to justice.  As against that there are those who would argue that there would have to be very strong grounds for doing away with a procedure which ensures that in the early stages of proceedings an opportunity is provided to have a court assess, in effect, whether there is a case which should be brought to trial.</P>
    <P>I accept that we need to look at features of our criminal justice system which go back a long way and may have been designed to protect the legitimate interests of an accused in the circumstances then applying but which may no longer serve a useful purpose.  For example, it can be argued that the wide-spread availability of criminal legal aid and the fact that we have an independent prosecution agency &mdash; in the form of the Director of Public Prosecutions <Col N="1752" />&mdash; deciding on whether the evidence warrants bringing somebody to trial have greatly changed the situation.</P>
    <P>This is a topic for debate in its own right and I will confine myself to making just two points.  I do not believe it would be appropriate to look at the question of the abolition of preliminary hearings solely in the context of the offences covered in this Bill.  The Deputy may well argue in response that his Criminal Procedure Bill proposes its abolition in all cases.  This brings me to my second point which is that this is a matter which I am examining at present in the context of measures which would speed up the trial process and this, in turn, arises in the formulation of proposals in relation to bail.  Incidentally, my examination of the Law Reform Commission report on bail is well advanced with a view to my putting proposals before Government. Before leaving this part of the Bill, I would very much welcome hearing any views which Deputies might have on the question of whether preliminary hearings should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 9 which contains two provisions in relation to temporary release which, it is fair to say, are largely incidental to the main purpose of the legislation.  The key concern in the area of sentence administration must be to ensure that people who should serve their full sentences do so.  That cannot be achieved in reality by bringing forward legislative proposals in relation to temporary release.  What is needed is extra accommodation and the Government has today approved a major programme designed to increase very substantially the amount of accommodation available in our prison system both immediately, which is very important, and in the medium and longer term.</P>
    <P>The first part of section 9 seeks to prohibit the granting of temporary release to persons convicted of offences set out in the Second Schedule except for what are described as grave reasons of a humanitarian nature.  While I appreciate the thinking behind the Deputy's proposal, I would have to reject it for the same reasons I rejected <Col N="1753" /> a similar proposal which he included in the Criminal Justice (Bail) Bill which we debated last year.  Essentially what is being proposed would be too inflexible. The Deputy, for example, would not want to bring about a situtation where the Minister for Justice of the day could not respond effectively to the circumstances where an offender was nearing the end of a sentence for a relatively minor offence and the best advice available was that there was a real prospect that the offender would be able to cure his or her drug problem and stay out of trouble in the future if he or she was granted a period of strictly controlled temporary release to reside in a drug treatment centre in the community.</P>
    <P>The second part of section 9 would require the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of details of all temporary releases.  I doubt if this is exactly what the Deputy intended.  The marginal note refers to the &ldquo;Application of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, to offences specified in the Second Schedule&rdquo; but subsection (2) of section 9 makes no reference to offences specified in the Second Schedule and so would appear to cover all offences.  Incidentally, this approach would appear to be outside the scope of the long title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This provision is very similar to a proposal contained in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994, presented to the House by the Progressive Democrats.  That Bill envisaged the creation of a register of temporary releases.  My predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Justice indicated that she had serious objections to that proposal and said that, even if there were no other objections to the proposal, she would hesitate to commit public finances to so pointless an exercise.  In this regard it may be helpful to refer Deputy O'Donoghue to the Official Report, Vol. 443, Columns 1667 to 1669 of 14 June 1994.</P>
    <P>Normally in dealing with Private Members' Bills I make the point that I have only had a short time to consider them and that in the circumstances my <Col N="1754" /> comments are preliminary in nature. While it is true that the present Bill only became available last Thursday, I did have the considerable advantage in assessing its provisions that work on the Government's proposals in this area were so very far advanced.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Government's Drug Trafficking Bill will be introduced shortly and I can assure the House that it reflects detailed and careful consideration of the issues which have given rise to the difficulties with the Bill before the House this evening. That, of course, is not to say that when it is published I will regard its contents as being written in stone &mdash; though they will be very solidly based &mdash; or that I will ignore the provisions contained in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill or what is said in the debate on it.</P>
    <P>When all is said and done the public interest clearly lies in us bringing forward comprehensive and effective legislative proposals in this area.  In the light of what I have said I am sure the House will recognise the good faith of the Government in this regard in agreeing not to oppose Second Stage and that when the Government's Drug Trafficking Bill is published in the near future we will be in a position very quickly to put strong and effective legislation on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy O'Donoghue for the work he has done.  Perhaps he will recognise that this is the second Bill I have not opposed.  He might also recognise that, unlike the situation that pertained when we were on the Opposition benches, I and the Government are open to taking a more concerted and measured approach to the issues covered in this Bill.  We are prepared to take on board the wisdom and good ideas of other people.  Nobody in the area of crime fighting can say they have a monopoly on the answers; if they do, they are at best naive and at worst irresponsible. I am glad the Government is not opposing Second Stage of this Bill. <Col N="1755" /> I thank the Deputy for his input and I look forward to his reply to some of the points I have made which give rise to serious concern about the terms of his legislation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, on introducing this legislation.  Inherent in his intention in bringing forward this Bill is a clear recognition of the crisis that exists.  He also recognises that if the Government and the Minister are failing in their responsibility, he must take upon himself, on behalf of the people, the duty of taking action on the legislative formulae which will move forward in a meaningful way the process of dealing with criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was sad to hear judges say in recent weeks that they have no place to put prisoners and that they would give them longer sentences in certain circumstances. It has also been sad to hear gardaí say they do not have sufficient powers and to hear everybody, including the Minister, say we do not have sufficient prison places.  Deputy O'Donoghue is suggesting an urgent response to criminal activity which has been at its worst in recent weeks.  The gardaí, judges and customs officers must challenge the criminals, but the serious budget deficits prevent them from doing <Col N="1756" /> so effectively.  This Bill recognises that the gardaí must be able to detain and question people.  It also recognises the urgency of the matter and takes account of the rights of detainees.</P>
    <P>How is it that the Minister's package coincides with the debate on Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill?  Why did she wait until this evening to announce real and meaningful proposals?  The crisis in crime did not come to the fore yesterday or last week.</P>

      <P>There was a different culture then but, unfortunately, the problem has exacerbated significantly.  I do not propose to say that Deputy Owen should be Minister and policeman and that she should be held responsible for every crime committed. However, she is responsible for ensuring that the State and Government confront the crisis in a manner that will reassure people, will protect life and property. People are not satisfied that is the case at present.  The Minister, and everyone who has reached the use of reason, know that fear enveloped the public in recent weeks and, irrespective of whether the incidence of crime increased last week, last year or over a period of years, the crisis must be addressed.  We need proper management and a response that will assure people that the Government is in control and that we have not lost the battle <Col N="1757" /> before commencing the war as will occur if crime continues to increase. Statistics prove that drug abuse forms a major part of the crime problem and the Bill outlines what should be done in response to the influence of such abuse on criminal activity.</P>
      <P>The public constantly ask why gardaí continue to fill out dole forms in Garda stations.  These highly trained, efficient and dedicated members of the force genuinely want to be in the front line doing the job they know best.  Why are they consigned to the day rooms of Garda stations processing forms while criminals roam the country without even seeing a Garda?  Why are they engaged in the collection of fines, repeatedly calling on persons who have failed to pay fines and, in some instances, taking them to prison?  Why are 130 members of the Garda, including nine sergeants, four inspectors, a number of superintendants and a chief, doing mechanical work in the Garda depot when it is widely acknowledged that most of their work could be carried out in private garages?  Why are so many Garda stations required to have a Garda presence when civilian receptionalists could carry out their duties, thus enabling the gardaí to respond to the needs of the public?  Gardaí are still employed in offices as secretaries and typists.  That is not a useful deployment of members of the force.  The Garda is an expensive and important group of persons who must challenge criminals.  If these matters were addressed the Gardaí would be properly deployed and could tackle crime.</P>
      <P>Does the Government care?  Does the Minister care?  I have no doubt she does but has she the necessary clout or influence?</P>

On either side of a road block for a mile one could see a blue flashing light and members of the Garda Síochána in yellow jackets; if one had any intention of committing a crime I doubt if one would have driven up to the road block.  The road block was a reaction instigated by the Minister to represent the Garda Síochána as responding on behalf of the Government in a major crackdown against the criminal by putting unarmed gardaí on roadways throughout parts of the west pretending there was a campaign being mounted against criminal activity and criminal mobility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The national lottery was first suggested to the Government by Cospóir as a sports lottery.  It was intended that the lottery should finance the sector which had become a Cinderella as far as the spending of Exchequer funds was concerned, namely sport.  The 1986 legislation which established the national lottery failed to confine the spending of its proceeds, or at least a decent proportion of them, to sport.  It stated that lottery funds should be divided &ldquo;in such amounts as the Government may determine&rdquo; on various matters, including sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result has been all too predictable. The huge revenue generated by <Col N="1762" /> the national lottery has disappeared into the Exchequer and sport, as a result, has become progressively marginalised. This has allowed successive Governments to avoid painful expenditure cutting decisions.  However, this has been done at the expense of sport and leisure. Accountability and transparency in the expenditure of lottery funding have been conspicuous by their absence. Recent research has shown that lottery funding is distributed over 13 Oireachtas Votes, eight Government Departments, 32 budget subheads, eight health boards, 39 local authorities and 38 vocational education committees. Even the meagre amount left over for sport and leisure has become little more than a device to enable Members, particularly on the Government side, to purchase votes in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>The 1992 allocation of £12.5 million to fund sport represents about 4p for every pound spent by the public on the lotto and scratch cards.  This starkly illustrates how self deluding and myopic policy has become in this crucial area.  It ignores entirely the crucial importance of sport and leisure in modern life and its doubtless increased importance in the world of the future.  It also ignores the socio-economic benefits which flow from proper investment in sport.  For example, the hosting of international events would bring large numbers of tourists to Ireland with consequent positive publicity abroad.  The building of sports facilities can be used to regenerate areas of urban decline; there are several excellent examples of this abroad. Successive Governments have also chosen to turn a blind eye to the fact that the voluntary efforts of many of those involved in sporting organisations thoughout the country have helped to contain crime and vandalism.  All their efforts have elicited from the Government to date is a mean and mealy mouthed response.</P>
    <P>Does the Government propose to establish an independent commission to <Col N="1763" /> distribute lottery funds?  Does it intend to change the 1986 legislation to ensure that sport obtains at least a decent proportion of these funds?  Does it intend to introduce transparency and accountability to this area?  A good place to start would be to publish guidelines, which would be available for public inspection, under which lottery funds are allocated.  In the absence of these reforms the lottery will continue to fail abysmally to have the beneficial effect on Irish life which it was originally designed and intended to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for the generally constructive case he made.  We know the system and how politics are played but behind the case he made there is a serious point which I will address.  Since the establishment of the national lottery demands for lottery funding have consistently outstripped the available resources.  The allocations for the various activities funded from the national lottery are negotiated annually by individual spending Ministers as part of the overall Estimates process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful to explain how lottery spending is decided.  There appears to be some confusion about this.  While the Minister for Finance is responsible for the overall operation of the national lottery, it is the Government that decides, under section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986 how the surplus from the national lottery is to be spent. Such allocations by the Government are usually made in the context of the annual Estimates process.  Responsibility for the disbursement of lottery grants then rests with the relevant spending Minister.  The present system has many strengths in that the allocations are voted on by the Dáil, Ministers are accountable to the Dáil for their decisions and the accounts of each <Col N="1764" /> Department are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General at the end of each financial year.</P>
    <P>Under section five of the National Lottery Act, 1986, the surplus from the national lottery may be used for the following purposes: sport and other recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts, within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951, the health of the community and for such other purposes as the Government may determine.  The following additional beneficiary categories have also been designated: youth, national heritage, welfare, and amenities.</P>
    <P>The allocations for sport are administered by the Minister for Education and amount to approximately £10.6 million out of a total of £88.2 million lottery allocations in 1996.</P>
    <P>These allocations form part of the lottery funding for the general expenses of youth and sports organisations, other expenditure in relation to youth and sports activities and the provision of major sports facilities.  It is also worth noting that approximately one third of moneys from the national lottery surplus is spent in the related areas of youth, sport, recreation and amenities. Approximately £27.5 million of lottery moneys was spent on these areas in 1995 and a total of over £200 million was spent in the period 1987 to 1995.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these areas receive a fair proportion of lottery moneys and would point out that expenditure on sport and related areas could only be increased if expenditure in other desirable areas such as the arts, welfare or the health of the community were cut back.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that a board or boards be established to disburse lottery funds, perhaps along the lines of the British model.  The British arrangements have come into effect comparatively recently and it is too early to reach definite conclusions as to whether they are likely to give general <Col N="1765" /> satisfaction.  Criticism has, however, been made that the process in the UK is slow moving and does not provide for accountability to Parliament, which is an important feature of our system.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has made a valuable contribution to the development of sport and many other activities of importance to the community and I look forward to a continued positive performance from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue.  An innocent engineering student is being tragically victimised by a bureaucratic rules change in 1993 which took no heed of the hardship and educational deprivation is imposed.  This student, whom the Minister knows, did the leaving certificate examination in 1992.  He did not achieve the necessary two Cs, or honours, to qualify for higher education grants.  He sat an entrance exam in UCG for admission to the engineering faculty and was granted a place in an engineering course which commenced in October 1992.</P>
      <P>Because of the financial circumstances at home, he inquired from the higher education grants official of Galway County Council as to what he could do.  He was advised that he could accept the place in the UCG engineering course, commence his studies there and at the same time repeat some subjects in the leaving certificate examinations in 1993.  He was advised that if he obtained the required two Cs he could qualify for higher education grants for the academic year 1993-94.  His father also contacted the Department of Education and received the same advice from the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>In her letter the Minister states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that &ldquo;K&rdquo; intends to repeat <Col N="1766" /> four subjects in his leaving certificate 1993.  If he secures the educational requirements in 1993 he should get in touch with Galway County Council in order that his eligibility for a grant may be examined under the 1993 scheme.</P>
    <P>That is an extract from a letter signed by the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, on 6 May 1993.</P>
    <P>This student passed his first engineering examination and then sat the leaving certificate in the summer of 1993.  He did four subjects achieving excellent results in his leaving certificate, one B and three Cs.  He now had more than required to qualify for higher education grants.  The leaving certificate results were notified to Galway County Council who paid him part of the higher education grant during the academic year 1993-94.  However, he subsequently received word from the Department of Education that the grants were paid in error.  The Department of Education's explanation was that although this student now complied with the terms of the higher education grants scheme as it applied up to 1992, the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, had altered the scheme. The terms of the new scheme precluded an award where the student &ldquo;was not entering an approved course for the first time&rdquo;.  In other words, if the student had not commenced his engineering studies in 1992, he would have qualified for full higher education grants in 1993.</P>
    <P>This young man had made a superhuman effort.  He studied into the early hours of the morning, gave up his free time and his sports pursuits to study for two difficult examinations in 1993 to qualify for these grants so that he could get the university education for which his parents could not afford to pay, bearing in mind that the fees for engineering at University College Galway are £2,300 per annum.  All efforts to get the <Col N="1767" /> Minister to take an initiative in this case has failed so far.  His parents have gone into debt to help him stay on in college. He should now be in his fourth and final year but, because of the Minister's disinterest and his parents' dire financial straits, he has had to abandon his university career and sign on for the dole.</P>
    <P>I find the circumstances in this case quite appalling.  The Minister acted in a callous, hard-hearted fashion.  She is denying every precept of the socialist doctrine she publicly espouses.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and the Minister for Education Deputy Bhreathnach, all professing an interest in the unemployed, the disadvantaged and the poor in our society, stood idly by while this young man's education and future career withered and died because of the ill thought out, careless and callous alteration to the higher education grants scheme introduced by this Minister.</P>
    <P>In raising this matter, I appeal to the Minister and her colleagues in Government to admit they have done this young man a grievious wrong.  A retrospective alteration restoring the provisions of the 1992 scheme would enable this student to complete his studies and would not result in an avalanche of applications.</P>
    <P>Why is it that in the so-called thorough examination of the case in the Department Galway County Council has never been contacted to inquire into the circumstances where this student was advised to commence his university studies in 1992 and to sit the leaving certificate examination in 1993?  Why were the higher education grant payments made in 1993-94 but subsequently withdrawn?</P>
    <P>Shame on any Government which would turn a deaf ear on a case such as <Col N="1768" /> this.  The Minister should act now to ensure justice in this case.</P>

The case has also been the subject of a parliamentary question and a query from the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to this student is that he sat his leaving certificate examination in 1992.  However, the results obtained in that examination did not satisfy the academic attainments requirement of the 1992 higher education grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The student accepted a place in University College Galway in 1992 and simultaneously studied for his leaving certificate which he sat in June 1993.  He secured three honours in this examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Galway County Council inadvertently awarded him a grant and paid him the first instalment of maintenance, £194.  No fees were paid.  Subsequently the student's father contacted Galway County Council with a view to having the fees which he had paid to UCG for the 1992-93 academic year refunded.  When Galway County Council contacted the Department for permission to make this refund, it was informed that a grant should not have been awarded in this student's case as his application should have been assessed under the 1992 higher education grants scheme, the year in which he entered college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following numerous representations, <Col N="1769" /> the replies to which outlined the facts of the case, the student's father appealed the Department's decision to the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman, in his reply of 25 October 1994, upheld the Department's decision.  Since then this case has been the subject of more representations, the replies to which have reiterated the position.  A parliamentary question on this case was also replied to on 4 October 1995.</P>
    <P>With regard to the claim by the Deputy that the student in question had to abandon his successful studies, it is understood by the Department, following discussions with officials in UCG, that while this student is not attending lectures this year, he has in fact registered for the purpose of repeating his third year examinations in industrial engineering.</P>

      <P>The Abbey vocational school was built in 1982 and <Col N="1770" /> since then the numbers of pupils attending it have increased.  A total of 950 pupils now attend the vocational school.  Two new extensions to the school were provided by the Department of Education and in 1994 agreement was reached between Donegal vocational education committee and the Department of Education to provide another extension which would be called phase IV.  This was met with great enthusiasm by the parents, teachers and board of management of the school, of which I am chairperson.  Prior to that the parents had given a commitment that they would provide funding towards the provision of this extension which was urgently needed.  We were told by the Department at that time that it would provide the entire funding for the project and we believed the project would have been completed by now. This project has been toing and froing between Donegal vocational education committee, the design team and the Department of Education but, as yet, we have not received sanction to proceed any further with our programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairperson of the board of management I can confirm we had a difficult meeting recently during which it was decided that the Minister would be contacted about the urgency of this project. It is unfortunate to see the enthusiasm of the people of Donegal town dashed once again.  Phase IV is vital for the educational development of our school.  We will be unable to cope with the increased numbers in the school in future years.  Pupils need room to move. If the Minister of State were in the school at the end of the school day he would see the safety of the children is in jeopardy because of the huge numbers. It is a pity that I should have to come in here and ask him to intervene to have the extension sanctioned.  Some decisions taken in the provision of phase III of the building have turned out to be expensive mistakes, for example, suspended ceilings were requested in phase <Col N="1771" /> III but were not provided.  Now we have to request the paltry sum of £5,000 to provide proper ceilings so that the acoustics allow the teachers to teach. Teachers are finding it so difficult to teach in the extension that they will have to withdraw from the building that was provided at huge expense.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister sanction stages II and III immediately so that we can proceed to contract document stage and seek tenders?  It is very disappointing that we are not able to proceed with the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Coughlan, for sharing her time with me.  I am in total agreement with the case she has made on the urgency of sanctioning stages II and III of phase IV of the Abbey vocational school.</P>
      <P>I, too, am a member of Donegal Vocational Education Committee and can confirm that this issue comes up at every meeting and has the support of all the members.  The Abbey vocational school is the only secondary school in the Donegal town catchment area, which covers a wide area from Inver right up to Laghey and from Donegal to Drimarone out to Barnesmore.  Donegal town is a developing town.  The people's patience is almost exhausted.  I know there was disagreement over the submitted plans but I hope this will be sorted out before long so that the extension can proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Abbey vocational school is the flagship vocational school in the county. It is very well kept.  Deputy Coughlan and I had the opportunity to visit and address the pupils there last year.  It was a very pleasant experience.  It was a joy to see the commitment of the pupils and teachers to the school and its surroundings which are beautifully landscaped. The school is on the left as you approach from the Ballyshannon-Bundoran road and a miniature replica of the old abbey is located in its grounds. <Col N="1772" /> This proposed extension will be the crowning glory of the school.  As a Deputy for the constituency, I urge the Minister of State to get his officials to move immediately on the processing of stages II and III.  We would all like to reach the fourth and fifth tendering stages so that work can commence as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising the matter.  This gives me the opportunity to outline the position of phase IV of Abbey vocational school and assure the House of my commitment to the continuance of architectural planning of the project.</P>
      <P>Initially, I would like to give some brief details of the background to this case.  Abbey vocational school is the only second level school in Donegal town.  The present school was built in three phases, the third phase, as the Deputies are aware, being completed only recently.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the continued increase in enrolments my Department approved additional accommodation, amounting to approximately 970m². This extension is more familiarly known to the Deputies as phase IV and is expected to cost something in the region of £750,000.</P>
      <P>Stages II and III documentation required under my Department's design team procedures was submitted late last summer for formal approval by my Department.  As a result of detailed examination of this submission by my Department's technical staff, it was revealed that there was an apparent breach of the Department's area and cost limits.  Informal discussions and consultations with members of the design team followed seeking full explanations for these excesses and suggestions as to how these could be brought within acceptable limits.  I am very pleased to inform the Deputies that I expect the matter to be satisfactorily resolved and a decision conveyed to County Donegal Vocational Education Committee in the next fortnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister has been busy trying to concoct a reply.  I raised this matter on 14 December 1995, before the Christmas recess when I asked the Taoiseach to confirm &mdash; it was at the time of the creative accounting to deal with hepatitis C &mdash; if the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry had reached a settlement with the CPSU whereby staff would be paid before Christmas in respect of overtime to be done in 1996.  Unfortunately under Standing Orders, the Taoiseach was not obliged to reply on that occasion, apart from the fact that he probably did not know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am raising this issue tonight goes back to that time.  Will the Minister explain why he authorised the payment of £600,000 to workers in the Department in respect of work which had not been done at the time but which he authorised should be done in the future?  It was a grotesque, unprecedented and bizarre decision, almost a return of GUBU with which I am sure the Minister would not like to be associated. The advance payment was an attempt by him to buy himself out of a mess of his own making.  I remind the House that £600,000 represents a 10 per <Col N="1774" /> cent increase in the Department's existing overtime bill of £6 million.  Because of the Minister's pre-Christmas binge, the taxpayer was left with a serious hangover.  The reason the Minister put forward for these extraordinary, bizarre, unprecedented payments was to provide as he said &ldquo;an interim settlement for an industrial dispute in the Department&rdquo;. He was not suggesting that this was the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>This dispute arose from the opening of farm offices in the afternoon.  It is important to point out that the Minister's explanation is that it arose as a result of the need to ensure that payments were made to those who were due payments but he did not seek to explain that the opening of farm offices in the afternoon was a central feature of his famous farmers' charter.  Unfortunately he did not check with the staff to see if this could be implemented.  He made solemn promises to the farmers and the farming organisations, to whom he usually succumbs, without having the resources or the agreement of staff to implement them.  The farm offices were closed in the afternoon by the Minister's predecessor to allow the available staff deal with administrative work &mdash; for example, complete the copious paperwork that attends all aspects of their work and ensure payments were made as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Minister introduced a charter of farmers' rights, a major PR stunt.  It came into operation last September.  The Minister stated the overtime payment was in respect of issues which arose in previous weeks.  This, of course, explains the fact that he did not have staff agreement for opening the offices in the afternoon.  When he sought to impose this decision there were industrial relations difficulties.</P>
    <P>The backlog of work this interim settlement, at a cost of £600,000, is intended to clear was created by the Minister's decision to open farm offices <Col N="1775" /> in the afternoons without making proper staffing arrangements.  It was the unravelling of the farmers' charter.</P>
    <P>As staff in these offices previously carried out administrative work in the afternoons, we now have the extraordinary position that the taxpayer is liable for £600,000 in overtime payments for work previously carried out in ordinary time.  The Minister should confirm that no extra work is being carried out by the staff and that the overtime payment has resulted from his insistence that these offices remain open in the afternoons.</P>
    <P>From where did the money come? Was it from the administrative budget? If so, the Minister's interference has resulted in wasting taxpayers' money. The public has a right to know who in the Department authorised this payment. Was it the Minister acting on his own initiative?  Did every office receive this money?  Was it paid willy-nilly to every member of staff?  This money is an interim payment.  The public has a right to know where this deal will end and what it will cost.  The Minister came clean eventually earlier today and I ask him to do so on this issue and confirm that the problem is of his own making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to clarify the issue.  It is neither as dramatic nor as personalised as Deputy Cowen indicates.  I am happy to lay the facts before the House.  During November and December 1995 the Civil and Public Services Union took industrial action involving the closure of my Department's offices to the public in the afternoons and a ban on overtime in all offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 1,350 staff in the Department in the grades represented by the CPSU, that is, CAs and COs.  In notifying the <Col N="1776" /> Department of industrial action the union said that their members would refuse to co-operate in the afternoon opening of public offices; the offices would be manned only between 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.  They would not co-operate with the proposed information offices as provided in the charter of farmers' rights.  This included participation in training courses.  The most significant element was they would refuse to work overtime.  The union stated the action could be escalated up to and including all out strike action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The earlier sentences are the most significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute caused problems for the Department in processing payments under various premium and headage schemes and also in dealing with EU export refund payments to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Blame the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the work in these areas means that overtime is often a feature of the duties of the staff.  The workers involved are among the lowest paid in the Civil Service, many of them earn less than £10,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department considered it essential that this dispute be settled, a view with which I concurred, in order that the severe cashflow problems faced by food firms particularly in the meat and other sectors depending on export refunds would be addressed through the earliest possible payment of export refunds due and the clearance of bank guarantees amounting to £200 million on which interest was accruing.  As closure of the 27 local departmental offices in the afternoons, as a result of the dispute, disrupted communication between the Department and the farming community in relation to animal movements, queries on premium, headage and agriculture structures schemes, <Col N="1777" /> CFP, REPS and so on, at a time when there was genuine concern to ensure the earliest possible issue of payments, settlement of the dispute was the overriding consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an exceptional measure adopted in very difficult circumstances. It was made in the interests of securing an interim settlement of the dispute to enable the Department catch up on the backlog of work which had arisen in the previous week and to ensure the continued smooth flow in the New Year of vital supports to the farm and agri-industry sectors which, as the Deputy will appreciate, are vital to rural communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for paying the money in advance was not motivated by any budgetary strategy aimed at bringing forward expenditure.  It was intended solely to assist in the settlement of the industrial relations problem and to ensure continuation of the necessary supports to farmers and the agri-industry sector.  Staff are required to work the overtime in full.  This did not create any additional overtime; it was a prepayment of overtime in respect of the backlog of work which arose as a result of the dispute in November-December.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 71 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the scheme had been heavily subscribed and underfunded when I took office.  I succeeded in drawing up a revised scheme to deal with that difficult situation.  I advised the House previously of the procedures which I put in place last September to deal with the balance of the applications.  Under this procedure applications are dealt with on a monthly basis.</P>

    <P>I have set out in the tables which I am circulating details, on a county basis, of the total numbers of applications under <Col N="1492" /> the scheme, together with the approvals and payments made in 1995.</P>
    <P>There were almost 18,500 applications for aid under this scheme.  At the end of December 1995 some 9,000 of these had been fully processed with approval issuing in respect of 8,225.  Of the remaining 9,500 some 4,500 have been advised that they should submit drawings of their farmyard and related buildings along with details of the proposed development.  These applicants have also been advised to submit planning permission or consents where this is appropriate.  The remaining 5,000 applicants will be similarly dealt with by my Department by the spring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the monitoring of the REPS by my Department.  There is a detailed pre-payment check of 5 per <Col N="1494" /> cent of applications selected on a random basis with provision for further discretionary checks.  There is provision for similar post payment checks.  The monitoring of the scheme is reviewed on an ongoing basis and changes are adopted where required.</P>
    <P>Payment under the basic scheme is related to the area farmed up to a maximum of 40 hectares.  An additional payment may be made where one of the supplementary measures is undertaken. Payment is not directly related to the cost of work carried out on the farm.</P>

      <P>The environmental impact assessment procedure in relation to forestry, which is linked to the obligation to obtain planning permission, applies above a threshold level <Col N="1495" /> which is 200 hectares for initial afforestation and 10 hectares for the conversion of broadleaf high forest to conifers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is reviewing the threshold for assessment in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, which is responsible for the relevant legislation. I expect that this review will lead to new thresholds which will be included in the detail of the forest strategy to be published within the next couple of months.  Until the new thresholds are decided on &mdash; it is very difficult to predict either the number of applications likely to be received in any year or their individual sizes &mdash; the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot say what amount of land involving forestry will be subject to environmental impact assessment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 78 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of assistance to the food processing sector, to counteract the effects of the depreciation of sterling against the Irish pound, would, without approval at EU level, be contrary to EU law.  It is clear that in present circumstances such approval would not be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The appropriate response to the currency situation is that firms should improve their competitiveness and intensify and geographically diversify their marketing efforts.  Towards this end considerable financial assistance is provided for the food industry, under the Structural Funds sub-programme for the industry.  This assistance, from EU and national sources, amounts to £283 million and is available for investment in plant and equipment, research and development, marketing and promotion and training.  Because of the need for a special effort in marketing and promotion, I recently announced the transfer of £7.5 million within the sub-programme towards marketing and promotion, subject to the procedures relating to such transfers being complied with.  The competitive position of the food industry will also be improved by the changes in the PRSI system announced in last week's budget and the Government's overall approach to improving the competitiveness of the economy, including the various measures being financed by the Structural Funds under the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>There is a range of State schemes, under the Structural Funds Programme for the Food Industry, upon which they may draw for these purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full details of the action which An Bord Bia is taking to develop both new and existing export markets for meat, as well as other food products, are set out in its Market Development Strategy 1995-99 which was published last June. These include, in particular, two company grant schemes, the aim of which is to enable individual companies to <Col N="1497" /> improve their marketing capability and performance.  In addition, An Bord Bia also provides a full range of information and promotional services.  The market development strategy constitutes its contribution towards the realisation of the estimated targets set for the food industry namely to increase output from £9 billion to £12 billion and exports from £4.3 billion to £7 billion by 1999.</P>
    <P>To enable An Bord Bia intensify its marketing and promotion efforts, I have agreed to provide it with additional funds of £7.5 million, from provisions of the Structural Funds Programme for the Food Industry which were under-utilised because of a delay in approving the programme.  The transfer of these additional funds is subject to agreement under the programme's monitoring committee procedures which I expect to secure shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that the area aid application form is kept as simple as possible and my officials are working with this in mind.  A draft form has already been prepared.  I am arranging for this draft to be put to the farm organisations for their comments very shortly and, as soon as it is finalised after such consultation, I will arrange for a copy to be provided to the Deputy.  In the meantime, however, I can tell him:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that the declaration of sowing page of the 1995 application form is not issuing to arable aid applicants from 1996 on as completion of it is no longer required &mdash; only those applicants who fail to sow what they declare on their applications need notify the area aid <Col N="1498" /> unit of my Department of such failure on or before 15 May each year;</P>
    <P>(b)  that, following the introduction in Ireland of the land parcel identification system required by the relevant EU regulations, the 1996 area aid applications for arable aid will be pre-printed with the new land parcel unique identification numbers which replace the old numbers supplied by farmers on their 1995 or 1994 applications;</P>
    <P>(c)  that farmers will receive maps showing their land parcels, the areas of those parcels and their new identification numbers, records of their 1995 applications, or 1994 applications if they did not apply in 1995 and very useful helpsheets and terms and conditions to help them complete their 1996 area aid application forms accurately.</P>
    <P>Under the relevant EU regulations we are obliged to put the new land parcel identification system in place in 1996 so as to provide every land parcel with a unique identification number as against the non-unique number attributed to each parcel by farmers in previous years area aid applications and to measure accurately the area of each such parcel. This involves a number of form changes by comparison with previous years.  I expect, however, that the efforts of my Department to simplify as far as possible the 1996 area aid application forms in the fullest consultation with the relevant organisations will ensure that problems with 1996 applications are kept to the minimum.</P>

      <P>The fourth review of disadvantaged areas completed in <Col N="1499" /> 1991 was based on a survey of 50 per cent of farmers in each townland which was, at that time, less severely handicapped or which had applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, each townland being examined was assessed by professional officers of my Department to ascertain its stock carrying potential.  A rating of between 0 and 9 was accorded to each townland assessed.  This is known as the land quality index.</P>
      <P>When the disadvantaged areas appeals panel, an independent body set up by my predecessor, began its examination of appeals in respect of reclassification to more severely handicapped status, it operated under a set of guidelines provided by my Department and agreed with the farming organisations. These guidelines included the use of information which was available from the 1991 review in assessing areas for reclassification.  It was felt that since this exercise was an appeal by farmers whose areas had been excluded in 1991, it would be appropriate to use the same data, suitably modulated in the selection process.</P>
      <P>The areas in County Monaghan which were not reclassified as more severely handicapped were those whose income was greater than 60 per cent of national average income, and/or whose land quality was greater than 4, and/or which were not adjacent to the existing more severely handicapped boundary.</P>

      <P>Research into the role of the badger in the transmission of bovine TB indicates that the disease is <Col N="1500" /> endemic in the country's badger population which is estimated to be in the region of 200,000 adult badgers.  In excess of 10 per cent of badgers examined under the research programme have disclosed visible lesions.  It has been established by DNA typing that both badgers and bovines can share the same strain of TB.  Epidemiological investigations have indicated that a significant percentage of serious TB herd breakdowns are associated with disease in the indigenous badger population. The badger removal programme under the east Offaly project has resulted in a significant reduction in bovine disease levels in the area.  The new proposals which I propose to introduce this year include a commitment that there will be a comprehensive research programme aimed at preventing the spread of TB by wildlife.</P>

These imports consist of three types of timber &mdash; sawnwood, panel boards and other industrial wood. The total value of sawnwood imports was £92.3 million; panel board imports £41.1 million and imports of other industrial wood £9.7 million.</P>
      <P>In so far as indigenous timber production is concerned, this amounted to some two million cubic metres in each of the years 1994 and 1995, predominantly from Coillte Teoranta forests. The value of this level of production, when account is taken of its primary processing in both the sawmilling and panel board sectors, is estimated to total £150 million in both years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 228 together.</P>
      <P>The Government made the submission to the EU Commission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas in November 1993.  Due to pressure of work, the Commission Services did not complete its initial examination of the date before the end of 1994.  At a meeting in December 1994 between the Department and the Commission, further information and clarification of some aspects of the submission was sought, and this was provided in April 1995.</P>
      <P>The Commission Services then raised a number of issues which required additional data to be prepared in mid-1995. They also stated that they had a major difficulty with the interpretation of the stocking density criterion which had been given to the appeals panel.  I am pleased that, following a series of difficult negotiations, a resolution of these difficulties is in sight, and I expect the Commission will place an agreed proposal before the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in the very near future.  The Council of Agriculture Ministers will take the final decision after the European Parliament has given its advice.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings with Commissioner Fischler at which I stressed the urgency of a decision in this matter, and he has assured me of his desire to conclude the extension discussions as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the proposed £109.925 <Col N="1507" /> million disallowances is that £5.956 million was paid to the Commission in 1995 as part of the 1991 clearance; a legal settlement of £61,000 was paid in 1995; some £94.799 million is being handled within the 1992 clearance, and the Commission has deferred action on £9.1 million relating to valuation of beef pending the outcome of legal proceedings on an insurance claim.</P>
      <P>The £94.799 million covers the beef public storage inquiry, the beef tendering issue and premia payments.  The FEOGA committee was formally consulted on 24 January on a proposed disallowance of £74.264 million, that is 10 per cent of expenditure in 1990 and 1991 in relation to the Commission's inquiry into beef intervention storage. The committee had already been consulted on proposed disallowances of £18.475 million in respect of beef tendering procedures, 1991 and 1992 and £2.060 million for premia schemes.  A composite proposal is being submitted to the European Commission for consideration on clearance of 1992 accounts.  The proposal includes disallowances in respect of other member states on the same issues.</P>
      <P>I do not accept there were significant departmental breaches of intervention regulations and certainly none which would justify penalties of the magnitude proposed.  I do not believe either that page 524, or, still less, the overall conclusions of the tribunal report provide such a justification.  The proposed disallowances have been and will continue to be vigorously contested on the grounds that they are not soundly supported by the facts and that account has not been taken of the conciliation body's recommendations on the public storage and tendering cases or of the Commission's Belle Group criteria for flat rate disallowances.</P>

While speed of payment is one criterion of performance, accountability to Brussels for the proper disbursement of funds is also critical and the letter and spirit of these complex regulations must be fully respected.</P>
      <P>I fully understand the cash flow benefits that accrue to exporters from speedy payment and can confirm that the processed products area is targeted in a wide ranging computerisation programme for all export refunds at present under way.  This will help to reduce payment time further.  Applicants for export refunds should in their own interest ensure that all documentation submitted in support of claims is complete, accurate and, in general, facilitates the processing work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 229 and 247 together.  I have set out in the table I am circulating, the information requested by the Deputies.  Payments, which are made on foot of approved completed work, are fully up to date.  The bulk of the applications were approved in the latter half of 1995.  In the normal course of events work would now be in progress on these projects.</P>

      <Quest>in relation to an interview on "Morning Ireland" on 5 January 1996, regarding the disposal of meat herds where BSE had been detected, in which a Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry spokesperson said much of it would be exported, if he will make a statement in this matter in view of the fact that this appears to directly contradict a statement on his Department's BSE control measures dated 15 November 1995, which stated that his Department can certify that beef exported from Ireland is derived from animals which have not presented suspected or confirmed signs of BSE and that the animals come from herds in which BSE has not been detected.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 239 and 240 together.  BSE is a notifiable disease and there is an obligation on anyone who possesses a suspect animal to report the fact to the Department without delay. All affected animals are then destroyed and buried <i>in situ</i> and compensation is paid.  The herds are also immediately restricted and voluntary depopulation is offered to herd owners with compensation payable at full market value.  To date all herd owners have agreed to depopulate their herds and compensation has amounted to over £11 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As BSE is a disease of individual animals and not of herds, there is no scientific reason why the meat from the other animals in the herd cannot enter the food chain following full ante and post mortem inspection.  However in order to reassure consumers, I recently announced that representative testing <Col N="1513" /> will be carried out on such animals following slaughter to confirm that BSE is not present.</P>
    <P>Cattle being slaughtered receive full ante and post-mortem inspections to ensure that the meat is fit for human consumption.  Any cattle displaying nervous or other symptoms suggestive of BSE are treated as BSE suspect animals and dealt with accordingly.  Intensive research to date has shown that BSE can be detected only when it reaches the brain; there is no test available yet which can detect the condition at an earlier stage.  Research has also revealed that infectivity in cattle is confined to the brain or spinal cord, neither of which is consumed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The policy of depopulation of herds in which a BSE case occurs was initiated to enable certification to be provided for third country markets that beef comes from herds in which no case of BSE was found.  All markets that require this certification are supplied with meat which has come from herds in which no case of BSE has occurred and has been so certified.  The policy of depopulation is therefore designed to enable market requirements to be met. It is not required on scientific or veterinary grounds as the disease is one of individual animals and not of herds.  For all markets, meat is, of course, subject to ante and post-mortem examination prior to certification and stamping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>In the reform of the CAP introduced in 1993, eligibility for the suckler cow scheme was confined to cows of beef or predominantly beef breeds.  Farmers were, however, allowed a two year transition period to meet this requirement. Therefore, in 1993 and 1994 farmers could be paid suckler cow premium on cows belonging to non-beef breeds such as Friesians up to the total number of suckler cows on which they had been paid premium in 1990 or 1991 and provided those cows had been inseminated by bulls of beef breeds.</P>
      <P>From 1995 the revised eligibility rules applied in full.  Farmers were informed by the Department that only suckler cows of a beef or predominantly beef breed were eligible for suckler cow premium. Where a farmer openly applied in 1995 for suckler cow premium on a Friesian cow, the only penalty applied was that for the animal in question the premium was not paid; full premium was paid on the remaining eligible cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a significant number of 1995 suckler cow applications where an animal declared by the farmer as a Friesian in previous years was shown as a beef breed.  In all these cases the following procedure was followed: (i) an onfarm inspection was arranged to see whether the animal was a Friesian or belonging to a beef breed; (ii) if the animal was found to belong to a beef breed, it was accepted for payment; (iii) if the animal was found to be a Friesian and to have been declared by the same farmer as a Friesian in previous years and there was no possibility of the animal being confused with one of a beef breed, the applicant concerned was ruled out of the scheme for two years as a result of the deliberate false declaration involved.  The EU Commission advised my Department that no lesser <Col N="1515" /> penalty could apply in such a case.  In case of dispute after such an inspection a second inspection by a different officer was arranged; (iv) if the animal was found to be a Friesian and had been declared as such by a previous owner in an earlier year's suckler cow application but where the cattle identity card moving with the animal to the new owner showed it to be of a beef breed, then that animal alone was rejected for payment of the premium with a consequent reduction penalty on the premium payable on the remaining eligible cows.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken a very reasonable line in the situations I have described and my officials have in all cases checked the position on the ground to ensure that no farmer is penalised incorrectly.</P>

    <P>However, in light of developments which have taken, or are likely to take, place, including the GATT and further expansion of the EU, now is the time to begin consideration of the type of policy structure which would best serve the interests of our dairy industry in the longer term.  I have, therefore, invited a small group representative of the various interests in the dairy industry, including, of course, the farming interest, to work with my Department in assessing a range of broad policy options.  This group will begin its work in the near future.  The milk quota <Col N="1516" /> review group, which has been in existence for some years, is consulted on operational aspects of the existing milk quota regime.</P>

Nevertheless, there are aspects of fox hunting which need to be considered from the standpoint of animal welfare and I have therefore arranged for an examination of the issues involved.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 75 together.  The British market remains the single most important market for Irish beef with exports valued at £210 million in 1995. To maintain our share of this valuable market and overcome the adverse publicity brought about by the BSE scare there before Christmas last, I have asked An Bord Bia to launch an intensive marketing and promotional campaign in order to affirm and project the high quality image of Irish beef.  The total cost of the campaign will be £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the European Beef Quality Promotion Scheme, An Bord Bia is to receive £436,000, in respect of measures to be undertaken in 1996 for the marketing and promotion of quality beef.  I am looking at the possibility of seeking additional EU funding to augment this <Col N="1518" /> scheme in order that there can be a coordinated approach towards promoting beef consumption on the UK market as a generic product.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia is also active in Germany where there has been a fall in beef consumption because of BSE related concerns.  Apart from the British and German markets BSE related concerns have not had any impact on consumption.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, Irish beef sold in the United Kingdom has not been branded as such and the bulk of our beef exports to that market are sold either unbranded or under own label brands in supermarket outlets.  There are no reliable figures on the volume of Irish beef sales in British outlets which is branded as having been produced in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the milk quota year has not yet ended it is not possible at this stage to assess the level of the final super levy bill.  Milk deliveries up to the end of December 1995 show an excess of 1.92 per cent or 18 million gallons over our quota.  If this situation should remain at the end of the quota year, 31 March next, the country would face a super levy bill of £25 million.  Therefore, it is important that every effort is made to curtail the level of production between now and the end of the quota year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister over a year ago, one of my top priorities was to improve the quality of services to farmers.  The launch of the Charter of Rights for Farmers last April reflected that priority.  The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services for farmers to be implemented over a two year period.  The payment targets set for 1995 have been largely met or exceeded.  At this stage virtually 100 per cent of headage and premia payments have been made.</P>
      <P>In June last year an extensive advisory service was provided at local marts to help farmers minimise errors in completing application forms.  Local offices are now open for the public all day.  Significant progress was made on improving accommodation facilities in local offices during 1995 and this will continue during 1996 in line with my commitment to providing confidential office consultations for farmers and better accommodation for staff.  I am satisfied that the target date of the end of this year for the upgrading of the local office telephone system will also be met.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to say that the appeals unit promised in the charter is now in operation.  I have invited the farm and agricultural organisations to nominate representatives to the review group which is being established to monitor the implementation of the charter.</P>
      <P>In the light of this progress, I was very disappointed that the charter commitment to having an information desk, or one-stop-shop, in local offices from 1 November 1995 was not met because of industrial relations difficulties with the Civil and Public Service Union.  Comprehensive negotiations have commenced to obtain full acceptance of the charter including the introduction of the one-stop-shops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current levels of New Zealand imports are governed by the GATT negotiated as part of the Uruguay round in 1986 to 1994.  Prior to that agreement imports from New Zealand were not legally limited under GATT but were subject to a specific duty.  Since 1981 the quantities were in practice limited under a voluntary restraint agreement between New Zealand and the EU under which New Zealand accepted a quantity limit in return for a duty concession.  Under the Uruguay round the voluntary restraint discipline was converted into a specific <Col N="1521" /> tariff which applies at, in effect, prohibitive levels above agreed quantities.  It is not realistic at this stage to seek to renegotiate specific aspects of the agreement. However, I have made every effort to ensure that its terms are put into operation in such a way as to minimise its negative impact on Irish sheep producers.  I have helped to ensure that a gentleman's agreement between New Zealand and the European Commission was concluded which underpins New Zealand's commitment not to disrupt or damage the EU lamb market.  I have no reason to believe New Zealand will not comply with the terms of this understanding.</P>
      <P>New Zealand lamb is imported mainly into the United Kingdom and France; in addition there is some concentration on Germany, Belgium and some Nordic countries.  There are no direct imports into Ireland.  Only a very limited quantity of lamb is marketed here and this is transferred from United Kingdom supply centres.</P>
      <P>The income difficulties of Irish sheep producers in 1995 were not attributable, to any appreciable extent, to the New Zealand lamb supply patterns.  The main factors included the decline in lamb consumption in the United Kingdom, a substantial increase in UK exports to France, our main export market, the over-hang of dry hoggets from 1994 and production and currency problems which distorted normal trading patterns on the Continent.  In view of this, it is not possible to quantify the loss to the Irish economy resulting from New Zealand imports.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I succeeded in negotiating a special aid package for Irish sheep producers last month in order to compensate them for the low prices here in the early part of last year.</P>
      <P>I have circulated a tabular statement containing details of the quantity of New Zealand lamb imported into the European Union in the years requested.</P>

      <P>The proposed disallowance is based on the EU Commission's view that the beef intervention tendering system was not properly implemented in Ireland in 1991 and 1992.  The Commission Services take the view that the provision in the relevant EU Regulation which prohibited the submission of several tenders by the same company for the sale of beef into intervention should have been interpreted so as to exclude tenders from companies which were linked commercially to other tenderers.</P>
      <P>My Department is of the view that the manner in which the tendering procedure was operated was fully in accordance with the relevant EU Regulations in force at the time and that in practice there was no loss to EU funds due to its operation in that way.  The Department's view of the legal position on this issue is strengthened by the fact that the Commission felt it necessary to amend these regulations in 1993 to provide for the rejection of tenders from linked companies.  There should be no question of applying this amendment retrospectively. A number of member states applied this provision in a similar manner and are facing disallowances on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> My Department submitted this matter to the EU Conciliation Body which has made its recommendation to the Commission, which will make a final decision on the matter in the near future.  With regard to the impact of any disallowance on public funds, the Government has established a group of senior officials from the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and my Department to examine the possible recovery of any disallowance from the meat trade.  On completion of its work, the group's report will be submitted to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme requires farmers to follow a set of measures aimed at protecting the rural environment. There are 11 basic measures in the scheme dealing with farm practices and six supplementary measures designed to cater for particular environmental issues.  One of these is the degradation of commonage land by overgrazing. In the measure, stock can be removed from the degraded area for a period from 1 November to 30 April and there is also a requirement to limit stock numbers to sustainable levels. REPS provides compensation for farmers complying with these rules.  There is <Col N="1526" /> no other grant scheme to compensate for removal of sheep from degraded areas.</P>
      <P>Supplementary measure 2 in REPS deals with the rejuvenation of degraded or overgrazed land in designated areas and it is mandatory for REPS participants in these areas to comply with the conditions.  To date 57 farmers have been approved for payments under this supplementary measure.  The average and maximum grants paid in respect of this supplementary measure are £1,056 and £1,202 respectively.  Payments are made annually for five years.</P>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, ewe premium and sheep headage payments are available to farmers who meet the conditions of these schemes. These payments are based on animals held, subject to quota rules in the case of ewe premium and up to a maximum of 200 in the case of sheep headage.</P>
      <P>I accept that a problem exists in relation to overgrazing by sheep in some commonage areas.  I am confident, however, that the improved incentives available under REPS in such areas will go a long way towards tackling the problem.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the reported increase in animal deaths in the Askeaton area, if he has satisfied himself that the Environmental Protection Agency interim report has not pinpointed the causes; and if he intends to make further resources available to this investigation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency interim report on the investigations into animal health problems at Askeaton, published on 14 December 1995, outlines the various activities undertaken by the different organisations up to the end of September 1995, the activities to be continued and those yet to be undertaken. <Col N="1527" /> The report makes it clear that of necessity any conclusions drawn must be tentative at this stage given that the remaining aspects of the investigations are ongoing or in some cases had not commenced at the end of September.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the veterinary aspects.  This involves a series of measures to be undertaken to establish the biochemical, haematological, pathological and other status of cattle and requires the retention of some cattle on farms in the area, the removal of some cattle to a State farm and the placement of other cattle from outside the area on the farms.  To ensure the scientific integrity of the investigation, management of the cattle has to be standardised and they will be subject to ongoing and extensive monitoring in different environments.</P>
      <P>This veterinary programme was drawn up by veterinary experts and endorsed by toxicologists from both the UK and the US who confirmed that the success of these studies depends largely on the complete co-operation of the affected farmers.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached with one of the farmers for the lease of his farm while the Department has purchased the other farm for the investigation. Aspects of the investigation have commenced, including the epidemiological survey, the placement of fresh cattle on one of the farms and the removal of cattle from that farm to Abbotstown. The investigation on the other farm will commence shortly when facilities thereon have been adapted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim report makes it clear that the veterinary investigation is essential to seek to establish whether the health problems were caused by other factors such as diseases, nutritional problems such as mineral deficiencies arising from natural characteristics of the soils in the area and farm practices.  These aspects are to be examined in the proposed veterinary studies and the work carried out by Teagasc.  The Environmental Protection Agency report records that the toxicologists have not discounted the <Col N="1528" /> possibility that one or more factors may be working in combination with environmental pollution to produce an adverse effect where either on its own would be non-harmful.  Thus the explanation for the problem could be quite complex and its identification dependent on a full examination of all aspects of the investigation.  This implies that reliable conclusions are unlikely to be possible until all of this work is complete.</P>
    <P>Given all the circumstances and the importance of this investigation, I can assure the House that the necessary resources will be available to ensure that the veterinary investigation and joint research projects proceed on a sound scientific basis and in a fully transparent manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 227 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 Teagasc is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the provision of education services in agriculture and horticulture.  Teagasc will provide about £4.9 million in 1996 to the private agricultural and horticultural colleges, for the provision of these services.  This expenditure mainly relates to staff salaries.</P>
      <P>The provision of a maintenance grant to the colleges is a matter for the Teagasc authority to consider in the context of formulating its overall expenditure on research, training and advisory services for the year.  I hope the authority will be able to make such a provision in 1996.</P>
      <P>The question of staff resources has to be considered in the context of the Government decision on recruitment in the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU has already reacted to the supply-demand situation for cereals on the world market. The standard rates of set-aside, which had been 20 per cent for nonrotational and 15 per cent for rotational set-aside, were reduced to 17 per cent and 12 per cent respectively for the 1995 harvest and to a single rate of 10 per cent for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Short-term measures have been taken to provide additional supplies of cereals <Col N="1530" /> on the EU market and to moderate upward price pressure.  These include the release of large quantities of intervention grain and the curtailment of exports by the introduction of export taxes.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the set-aside rate to 10 per cent is expected to result in additional production of some 9 million tonnes of cereals in the EU in 1996.  Furthermore, average cereal yields in the EU are expected to increase to about 5.6 tonnes per hectare by the year 2000 compared to 4.95 tonnes per hectare in 1995.</P>
    <P>I expect the EU to continue to monitor the situation in the light of developments on the European and world markets and to adjust policy accordingly. In the short to medium-term I would not, however, expect the complete abandonment of set-aside because of fears of a return to the surplus situation of earlier years.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the CAP afforestation grant scheme and forest premium scheme with their highly attractive grant rates has led to a rapid growth in plantings in recent years.  Last year saw the highest level of plantings on record at 29,000 hectares. Of this a record 17,300 hectares was private afforestation and planting by farmers accounted for some 85 per cent of private afforestation.</P>

Under the terms of a Government decision of 29 July 1995, approximately an additional 160 are expected to come here by the end of 1996, bringing the <Col N="1535" /> total number of Bosnian programme refugees in Ireland to almost 700.</P>
    <P>These programme refugees can stay in Ireland for as long as they wish, and the Minister for Justice has agreed that they may apply for naturalisation as Irish citizens after three years' residence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Programme refugees are entitled to seek and enter employment and have the same access to public services as is afforded to Irish citizens.  In recognition of the fact that refugees can have particular problems in accessing public services, or may at times need services geared to their special needs, the refugee agency looks after the reception and integration of programme refugees and is responsible for liaising between refugees and Departments, local authorities and other bodies in ensuring the provision of services to which refugees would be entitled.</P>
    <P>The board of the refugee agency includes representatives of relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>My visit to Cyprus from 9-11 January was part of my preparations for the Irish Presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year.  The development of the Union's relations with Cyprus in the perspective of the opening of EU accession negotiations six months after the ending of the Intergovernmental Conference will be an important issue during our term of office.  As Presidency, we will lead the Union's structured dialogue with Cyprus which has been established to prepare the ground for the accession negotiations.</P>
      <P>The prospect of EU membership has introduced a new dimension to the Cyprus question.  Like our EU partners, we are concerned to ensure that the prospect of accession be seen to benefit both communities on the island and that the accession process is pursued in a way that supports the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to make progress towards a political settlement on the island.  The priority which the Union is giving to the issue is reflected in the appointment at yesterday's General Affairs Council of an EU representative for Cyprus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My visit enabled me to familiarise myself at first hand with the situation on the island and the views and concerns of the Cypriot people.  I had discussions <Col N="1537" /> with President Clerides, Foreign Minister Michaelides, the UN Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative in Cyprus, Mr. Gustave Feissel, and the leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community, including Mr. Denktash.</P>
    <P>In all my discussions, I stressed the importance of using the window of opportunity offered by the prospect of EU membership constructively to facilitate the search for a political solution.  I highlighted the potential of the EU, a community of democratic states based on the principle of union in diversity, as a framework for accommodating different identities.  Membership of the Union could help to resituate the Cyprus question in a broader framework and to reinforce the existing guarantees of the position of the two communities.  I indicated my willingness to assist the search for progress in support of the UN process and the EU pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and to share any aspects of our national experience which might be seen by the parties as relevant or helpful. While not drawing parallels between different situations, I explained the importance we attach from our own experience in relation to Northern Ireland to parity of esteem for each community and the need to reflect this principle in appropriate political structures.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be able to visit the Irish Army contingent serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, and the Garda personnel attached to the UN civil police operation at Pyla.  Except for a brief period in the 1970s, Irish personnel have served continuously with the UN in Cyprus since 1964.  Their contribution to the security and welfare of the people of Cyprus is warmly appreciated on the island.  It was clear from the many tributes paid to their professionalism and impartiality during my visit that they enjoy the full respect and confidence of both communities.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Population Fund provides assistance in the field of population, including family planning and awareness and education programmes, in response to requests from developing countries.</P>
      <P>UNFPA is financed from contributions by Governments and private donors.  Ireland has provided annual contributions to UNFPA of £50,000 in 1993, £100,000 in 1994 and £250,000 in 1995 in support of its valuable work in developing countries.</P>
      <P>UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism in its programmes of assistance throughout the world.  It has categorically stated that it does not support China's one-child policy and is opposed to targets and quotas to enforce such a policy.</P>
      <P>UNFPA also states that it has maintained a constant dialogue with the Chinese authorities about abuses of human rights in its population programme.  It has also formulated special projects specifically designed to point out the practical advantages of a purely voluntary programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that UNFPA has also requested China to review and moderate provincial and local regulations that are not in conformity with international human rights standards and that it is UNFPA policy to take up each report of alleged coercion directly with the Chinese authorities.  Twice in the past six months &mdash; on 13 October 1995 and 17 January 1996 &mdash; my Department has sought assurances from UNFPA that it carefully monitors all of <Col N="1539" /> its projects to ensure full and rigorous adherence to universally accepted standards of human rights.  UNFPA confirmed that this is the case.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued on 10 January 1996, UNFPA expressed its deep concern about recent reports that children have been systematically abused and neglected in state orphanages in China and stated that it is asking the Chinese authorities for clarification of the issues raised.</P>
    <P>I fully share the Deputy's deep concern and the concern of the international community about the reports in respect of Chinese orphanages. However, I am satisfied on the basis of UNFPA's statement and assurances that the reports hold no implications for UNFPA's integrity or the manner in which its projects in China have been conducted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tanáiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The peace agreement for Bosnia and Hercegovina is an agreement between the former belligerent parties and it is, therefore, primarily the responsibility of the parties themselves to implement it.  A wide range of international organisations have a role in assisting with, and monitoring, its implementation.  These include the Office of the High Representative, Carl Bildt, the United Nations, and the international Implementation Force, IFOR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two reports have so far been transmitted to the United Nations Security <Col N="1540" /> Council on the operations of IFOR, the most recent of these having been submitted on 23 January.  On that date, the assessment of the IFOR command was that a spirit of good co-operation was continuing between the parties and the Implementation Force and that substantial progress had been made in meeting the terms of compliance with the Peace agreement.  Overall, the country-wide ceasefire continues to hold firm and the number of breaches of the ceasefire is reducing.  Most importantly, the parties had, by 19 January &mdash; the deadline specified under the agreement &mdash; complied with the requirement to withdraw their forces from the four-kilometre wide zone of separation.  IFOR commanders stated that considerable progress had been made with regard to mine clearance, although, due to the scale of the problem, it had not been possible for this to be completed on schedule.  The necessity of clearing the mines was tragically confirmed by the deaths of a number of British IFOR troops in a mine explosion on Sunday, 28 January.  The assessment was that the parties were also making every effort to ensure that all foreign forces leave the territory of Bosnia and Hercegovina, as required by the agreement.</P>
    <P>However on one issue, there was deliberate non-compliance on all sides. The terms of the agreement had specified that all prisoners should be released on 19 January.  In the event, 217 prisoners were exchanged under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, leaving some 645 still detained.  Intensive negotiations, involving the High Representative, the ICRC and IFOR ensued, with the aim of ensuring the release of those detained, and most of the remaining prisoners were finally freed on 27 January. The ICRC is continuing to work for the release of the remaining detainees.</P>
    <P>With regard to civilian aspects of the implementation of the agreement, the High Representative has been reporting regularly to the EU Council of Foreign Ministers on this issue, most recently on 29 January.  Structures to co-ordinate <Col N="1541" /> the efforts of the many organisations which will be involved in the implementation of the non-military aspects of the agreement, including the joint civilian commission within Bosnia and Herzegovina, are up and running.  Work in relation to ensuring the observance of human rights throughout the country is well under way.  Mechanisms for the channelling of rehabilitation and reconstruction aid are in place, and the most urgent work, concerned with the restoration of basic amenities in many locations, is going ahead.</P>
    <P>Tensions persists over some issues, most notably over the future status of a number of Serb-populated suburbs of Sarajevo which are to be restored to the control of the Bosnian Federation, and the High Representative is working closely with the parties on confidencebuilding measures aimed at creating conditions where the Serb population will feel that they can continue to reside in the Bosnian capital in safety.</P>
    <P>The deployment of the United Nations International Police Task Force (UNIPTF) will be an important contribution to this effort, as well as to the broader effort towards fully implementing the civilian aspects of the agreement.  The Government has made available an Assistant Garda Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald, for the post of Commissioner of the Task Force, and I am pleased to be able to report that Commissioner Fitzgerald travelled to Sarajevo yesterday and has assumed his duties there.</P>
    <P>The implementation of other areas of the agreement, including steps towards the establishment of new constitutional structures by the parties within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the task of assessing the suitability of conditions for elections &mdash; which is being carried out by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), assisted by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM), and negotiations on confidence and security-building measures and arms control measures in the context of regional stabilisation arrangements, are proceeding well at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the lead agency concerned with assistance to refugees and displaced persons.  The UNHCR has prepared a plan for the phased return of these people, in safety and on a voluntary basis.  The parties have accepted this plan, and the various international organisations involved in the implementation of the agreement, including the EU and its member states, stand ready to assist in putting it into operation.</P>
    <P>Croatia is currently providing shelter for more than 400,000 refugees from Bosnia.  The Croatian Government recently closed two camps in the Zagreb area, at Spasko and Zaprudje, which had housed both Bosnian Muslims and Croats displaced from fighting in 1991 in Eastern Slavonia in Croatia.  Those affected have not been expelled from Croatia, and have the opportunity to remain in other refugee camps in eastern Croatia.  The UNHCR have stressed that refugees should not be pressurised to return to Bosnia before conditions are right for them to do so.  It is important that the authorities in Zagreb and in all countries which host refugees continue to be guided by the advice of the UNHCR on this issue.</P>
    <P>The abduction of a number of Bosnian civilians who were exercising their right to free movement was a deplorable act for which elements of the Bosnian Serb armed forces appear to have been responsible.  However, following international condemnation, the captors released a group of 16 civilians on 4 January. There were reports in the ensuing days that a further five civilians continued to be held captive, but the latest information to hand now suggest that those who had been feared abducted have, in fact, been accounted for.</P>
    <P>This incident, along with a number of attacks on IFOR troops, and on civilians, including the bomb attack on a tram on 10 January which killed one man, illustrate the fragility of the agreement, particularly in these early stages. While compliance with the terms of the agreement is largely being achieved, <Col N="1543" /> and while implementation generally appears to be proceeding well, much hard work remains to be done to ensure that the agreement will come to be seen as a framework for lasting peace and stability, and not merely a pause in the conflict.</P>

      <P>The new &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service, available since last March, enables passports to be provided quickly and conveniently through over 500 post offices throughout the country. This localised service is being extended as the number of participating post offices increases.  During the busy summer months of 1995 over half of applicants used &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; and the proportion is expected to increase as the service becomes more widely available.</P>
      <P>The introduction of &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of personal callers to the passport offices in Cork and Dublin.  This has allowed staff to be transferred from counter duties to dealing with postal applications.  Consequently, more than three-quarters of all correct applications received are now being processed within two weeks and, for personal callers with genuinely urgent applications, queuing and delays have been reduced.  Since last September the passport office in Cork is a fully-fledged issuing office for the Munster region.</P>

      <Col N="1545" /> I believe that with &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; the passport offices in Cork and Dublin will be able to ensure a continued high quality of service to the public for the foreseeable future.

      <P>Joint passports, where the name of a spouse was included free of charge, were intended to reduce the cost of passport facilities for married couples who normally travelled together.  It was not intended that the named spouse would use a joint passport to travel alone.</P>
      <P>In line with international practice, the issue of joint passports was discontinued in October 1992.  The validity of those currently in use will expire between now and September 2002.</P>
      <P>Only individual passports are now being issued to people over sixteen years of age.  As a concession, joint passport holders have the option, for a single exchange fee of £15, of replacing their joint passports with two individual passports' valid only for the unexpired period of validity of the joint passports. Second named spouses may, of course, instead apply in their own right for new three- or ten-year passports and pay the fees of £10 or £45.</P>

The Commission has since decided to recommend to the Council and to the European Parliament that a budget be provided to enable assistance to be given to Ireland and also to Portugal.  While it is likely to be six to eight weeks before a final decision is taken on our request for assistance, I am happy that it has received such a quick and positive response to date.

    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> The growth in the national debt in the course of any given year is primarily dictated by the level of the EBR.  However, there are a number of other factors which can also contribute to changes in the stock of debt.  The most important of these are exchange rate movements which affect the IR£ value of foreign denominated debt and discounts or premia arising on bond issues.</P>
    <P>Adverse exchange rate movements, which raises the price of foreign currency debt in domestic currency terms, have occurred in most years.  This impact was very large in 1993 due to the devaluation of the IR£ in January of that year and this added £1379 million to the national debt in 1993.  However, it should be pointed out that in the case of borrowings in low interest currencies, such as the Yen or Deutsche Mark, the lower interest rates would provide an offset.</P>
    <P>Discounts and premia on bond issues have also contributed to the accretion of debt.  These arise from the issue of bonds with interest coupons above or below par value.  Thus, a bond issued at a discount would result in an addition to the national debt greater than the actual amount received for the bond, and <i>vice versa.</i> This arises because the amount included in the national debt is not the market value of the debt but the capital amount payable on redemption, even when the redemption date is a number of years away.  In all instances the return to the investor will be in line with market conditions and so where the bond is issued at a discount the increase in the stock of debt will be offset by lower interest payments.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave him in answer to a very similar question in June of last year.</P>
      <P>The allowance of a Minister of State is currently £18,406.  In addition, each Minister of State is entitled to certain personal staff drawn from within and outside the Civil Service during his or her tenure of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> In the case of the two Ministers of State whose appointments followed the enactment of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1995, the aggregated cost of such staff, excluding the existing Civil Service staff complement, was of the order of £160,000.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasized that both Ministers of State are attached to a number of Departments and this is reflected in the costs of their personal staff.</P>

      <P>Whether or not the VAT content of expenditure in a grant-approved project under the county enterprise boards scheme can be recovered is determined by the VAT status of the recipient of the grant.  Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by VAT registered businesses.</P>
      <P>Registered traders in receipt of grants would be entitled to recover the VAT borne in their business inputs in accordance with the deductibility rules provided in the VAT Act.</P>
      <P>Grant recipients who are unregistered do not charge VAT on the goods and services which they supply but, as a necessary corollary, they cannot recover the VAT on the items which they purchase in the course of their activities. This category would include small businesses which choose not to register because they are below the turnover registration thresholds, £20,000 for services and £40,000 for goods and exempt entities, for example, non-profit making organisations which are not engaged in taxable activities.</P>

      <P>Data on total public sector purchasing or imported goods and services are not available.  It would be extremely difficult to secure such data in view of the wide range of goods and services involved, and the multiplicity of agencies in the public sector.</P>
      <P>Public procurement within the State is largely delegated to local management in each procuring entity.  The Government Supplies Agency does provide a central purchasing operation for some of the purchases of Government Departments and some other public entities, but it handles only a relatively small proportion of overall public sector purchases.  The Government Contracts Committee also provides a centralised service to Government Departments but, generally, it only becomes involved in contracting situations which are exceptional in some way, e.g. where the lowest tender is not being recommended, and would not therefore be in a position to supply comprehensive information on public purchasing of imported goods and services.</P>

The transfer followed a review of funding for voluntary organisations by those Departments which highlighted an overlap between them.  I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to a reply by the Minister for Health to a question regarding voluntary organisations' funding by Deputy Wallace on 7 November 1995 which sets out the criteria for grant allocations by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>In relation to the broader question of national lottery allocations, the Deputy may be interested to know that in the light of recommendations contained in a report prepared for the Committee of Public Accounts on the administration of lottery grants revised guidelines were issued to accounting officers by my Department in October 1994.  The guidelines are intended to ensure a transparent and equitable system, particularly in relation to the more discretionary areas of lottery grants.

      <P>I have been made aware by reports received by my office transmitted through the Department of the Environment from the various local authorities in the south and south east, including Kilkenny County Council, about the extent of the flooding and damages caused as a consequence of the recent bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no specific details of the particular problem at Freshford, County Kilkenny, mentioned by the Deputy I can confirm that the Office of Public Works do not have any responsibility for the Neunna river in this case, which is a tributary of the Nore.  They would only assume such a responsibility on the basis of either a comprehensive arterial drainage scheme for the entire Nore river catchment area, in which Freshford is situated, prepared by them under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, or a certified drainage-flood relief scheme for the alleviation of localised flooding in the Freshford area, prepared by them under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995, which gives them powers to carry out such schemes.  Freshford, County Kilkenny is not included in the eight schemes in the current priority programme of drainage-flood relief schemes being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  This programme comprises schemes for Carlow Town; Cappamore, County Limerick-Newport, County Tipperary; Duleek, County Meath; Dunmanway, County Cork; Gort Town, County Galway; Kilkenny City; Sixmilebridge, County Clare, and Williamstown, County Galway. However, I am aware that there are many other areas throughout the country which suffer periodic flooding and it is proposed to establish a national priority programme of such areas to be considered for flood relief schemes. <Col N="1559" /> Freshford, County Kilkenny, will be considered along with those other areas for inclusion in that priority programme.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between individuals who have income from pensions and from other sources.  The only relevant information available is in respect of recipients of social welfare pensions, of whom some 66,000 are estimated to have taxable incomes.  The number of these individuals who are aged 65 years or over is estimated at 32,000.</P>
      <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is not other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 132 together.  Additional funding of £10 million has been made available in 1996 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This includes £6 million revenue funding of which £3 million is being provided to meet the 1996 cost of additional services which were put in place in 1995 which included over 240 residential/respite places.  The remaining £3 million revenue funding provided in 1996 will facilitate the provision of an additional 66 residential/respite places and 265 day care places as well as Home Support Services.  In addition, £4 million in capital funding is being provided of which £2 million will be used to support general service developments and £2 million to develop and improve the quality of training facilities for persons with a mental handicap under the European Regional Development Fund assisted programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest statistics available indicate that there were 915 persons with a mental handicap accommodated in public psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1994.  This compares with 2,170 persons in 1981.  My Department, in conjunction with the health boards, has been <Col N="1563" /> engaged in an ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings.  This programme will continue during 1996 with the emphasis on the provision of appropriate infrastructures to support the transfer programme.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £44.58 million invested in the services in the period 1990-1995 has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.  I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting residential care.  However, I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those awaiting services. The Government is committed under both the health strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available.  Comprehensive data will become available over the coming months from the national mental handicap database which will enable my Department to differentiate between current and future need.  It is my intention, on completion of this validation process, to initiate a review of the implementation of both policy documents <i>Needs and Abilities</i> and <i>Services to Persons with Austism</i> with a view to preparing an overall medium term development plan for the services.</P>

    <P>The statistics on deaths from meningitis and meningococcal infection for the period 1985 to 1994 have been compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  In relation to 1995 and 1996, the health boards have indicated that there were 28 deaths in 1995 and three deaths so far this year.</P>
    <P>Cases or suspected cases of bacterial meningitis (including meningococcal septicaemia), and cases of acute viral <Col N="1565" /> meningitis are required to be notified by medical practitioners under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981-1988. The increase in the number of cases reported since 1985 may indicate that notifications were incomplete in the past.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to recent press reports regarding the results of a study published in the Irish Medical Journal on the reporting of meningococcal disease and haemophilus influenzae meningitis.  The study covered the years 1987 to 1991 and confirmed significant under-reporting. However, the study also acknowledged an improvement in the notification rate during 1991.  The system of notification has been considerably improved.  A comprehensive system for monitoring the incidence of bacterial meningitis and meningococcal infection is in operation.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of cases reported in recent years is almost certainly composed of two elements &mdash; an actual increase in the community and more efficient reporting.  The actual increase is a reflection of the unpredictable nature of this disease which can increase, sometimes significantly so without apparent reason.  The greater propensity to report brings with it the possibility of over-reporting of cases &mdash; cases are reported as bacterial meningitis but following thorough hospital investigation, another diagnosis is made, usually viral meningitis.  An expert group is being established to examine ways to further strengthen the diagnostic, surveillance and preventive aspects of our approach to this disease.  The position regarding the National Disease Surveillance Unit is that the Department is at present examining models for the establishment of the unit.  This will link in with the joint North/South Institute of Public Health which is being established in 1996 and which will analyse the incidence of communicable diseases on the island as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report of the expert group on the BTSB was published in April last.  The report of the consultancy project carried out by Bain and Company at the BTSB was published in May last.  The recommendations of the report group on the organisation and management of the BTSB were complemented by the recommendations made in the Bain report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objective of the board and the central direction of the recommendations in the two reports is the development of the BTSB as the national centre of excellence in transfusion medicine and laboratory science in line with best international practice.  The achievement <Col N="1567" /> of this objective and the making available of blood and blood components to the highest standards of safety and efficacy is being pursued with diligence by the board.  While the complete implementation of all the recommendations contained in both reports will take time, significant progress has already been made by the board over the last nine months.  Strategically, the board is redefining its role, function and contribution to the development of health care services on the lines recommended in the two reports.</P>
    <P>The report identified the management of the BTSB as the major priority requiring urgent and significant attention. In that regard the Government in April 1995 approved of the appointments of Mr. Liam Dunbar, Chief Executive Officer of St James's Hospital as Chief Executive Officer of the BTSB and Professor Shaun McCann, Professor of Haematology and head of bone marrow transplantation at St James's Hospital as the medical director of the BTSB.  The implementation of the recommendations of both reports as they apply to the BTSB is being led by the chief executive officer and the medical director in close association with the board and its chairman.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a chief executive officer as the sole executive head of the organisation addresses the most important management recommendation in the reports.  The chief executive officer leads the organisation and in association with the medical director and senior managers has addressed many of the other critical management problems identified.   Significant progress has been made in defining authority, improving reporting relationships, facilitating the input of staff into the decision making process and in improving communications with the entire organisation. To support further progress in these areas the following sub-committees have been reconstituted: medical committee; scientific committee; and finance committee.  The participation of the chief executive officer in the medical <Col N="1568" /> and finance committees has ensured effective decision making at executive level and that the board is fully informed of emerging policy and procedural changes.  A clearer focus is in place concerning the business and cost efficiency aspects of the board. Improvements have also been realised particularly in contract negotiations and the supplies function.</P>
    <P>The medical director, as well as co-ordinating the consultant medical resources of the board, provides expert clinical advice to the board and to the organisation encompassing all clinical matters relevant to the operation of a transfusion centre and such clinical matters as referred to in both reports.  An ongoing review of all aspects of the organisation's procedures and processes including donor and patient care, blood collections, laboratory processing and testing has been established and the following developments have taken place: the revision and introduction of guidelines for donor selection; negotiating formal arrangements with a major hospital for microbiological and virology support for the organisation; introduction of revised standard operating procedures for blood collection, processing and storage; introduction of new technology to improve temperature monitoring of all aspects of blood and blood component storage; introduction of bar coding of blood and blood components to log such products from collection to despatch; appointment of the medical consultants to sessional commitments at major hospitals; clinical roles and sub-speciality interests of the consultant medical staff are being agreed; the interface between medical consultants and the various functions of the BTSB has been redefined and will be further substantially improved when sub-speciality interests are finalised; the appointment of additional specialist consultants with particular interest in transfusion medicine is currently being pursued; the interface between hospital medical and laboratory staff and similar staff at the BTSB is improving and seminars are being organised in various <Col N="1569" /> aspects of transfusion medicine and two successful seminars have already taken place; the board is establishing a research and development fund, and proposals for research projects have been sought from professional interests and an inter-disciplinary group has been established to review the proposals; and, the board is represented on EU Export Committees on blood and blood products and is actively seeking participation on other relevant committees of the EU.</P>
    <P>The development of the utilisation, capabilities and capacity of the IT function at the BTSB is a common theme in many of the recommendations in the Bain report.  The implementation of these recommendations particularly in relation to management analysis, donor care services, collections efficiency and blood inventory and the achievement of efficiencies in financial management and control will rely heavily on effective and workable IT solutions.  In association with my Department, the BTSB has recently completed the first phase of a review of its IT requirements.  The second phase which is now under way will document the existing system, complete a requirements specification of the information needs of the organisation and put in place an internal IT department. My Department has made available considerable financial support to these initiatives which involve external consultants who have considerable expertise in the development of IT systems in a health care environment.</P>
    <P>The Bain consultants provided detailed advice to the Chairman and chief executive officer as part of the development by the board of its plasma products strategy and the sourcing of plasma products.  This advice has contributed significantly to the successful completion of the board's negotiations with a contract fractionator and the achievement of considerable cost savings. Effective working relationships have also been established with the Irish Medicines Board which will assist the board in devising a strategy to achieve self-sufficiency in plasma products.  The <Col N="1570" /> Irish Medicines Board through regular inspections is enabling the BTSB to achieve its objective of retaining good manufacturing practice status.</P>
    <P>My Department has been discussing with the BTSB the board's accommodation needs.  A joint Department/ BTSB project team is being established to carry out the necessary option appraisal and complete the preparation of a planning brief to meet the board's future accommodation requirements.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on the BTSB also made a number of recommendations in relation to the licensing of medicinal products, including blood products as follows; the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB) should become the licensing authority for all medical products for human consumption; the board and management of the NDAB should be strengthened so that it can discharge its functions in relation to medicinal products with sufficient speed and efficiency; a formal system for monitoring and enforcing licences issued for medicinal products, including blood products, should be introduced; the arrangements for importing and supplying medicinal products on a named patient basis should be placed on a formal footing and the circumstances in which products may be issued on that basis should be clearly specified.  The Government, by means of the Irish Medicine Board Act, 1995, has replaced the NDAB with a new Irish Medicines Board which is to be the licensing authority for all medicinal products.  The membership of the board has a management rather than technical orientation, and is supported by two advisory committees for human and veterinary medicines to provide the necessary technical input.  A new chief executive is in place, and the organisation is being restructured in line with the recommendations of a major management consultancy exercise on its systems, staffing and operational procedures.</P>
    <P>In addition to its licensing function, the board has been given the responsibility for monitoring all aspects of the <Col N="1571" /> law relating to the manufacture and distribution of medicines.  It has also been given a specific responsibility under section 4 of the Act, for the inspection of the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of human blood, blood components, blood products and plasma derivatives with a view to ensuring their safety and quality.  As regards the arrangements for importing and supplying medicinal products on a named patient basis, regulations are at present being prepared to place the named patients systems on a formal basis.  It is hoped to finalise this work in the near future.</P>

    <P>The December 1995 figures are at present being collated by my Department and I will write to the Deputy with the information requested as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>In June 1993, when the first waiting list initiative commenced, the total in-patient waiting list for all specialities was 40,130.  By 30 September 1995 this figure had been reduced to 27,004.  Since it commenced the initiative has reduced the overall in-patient waiting list figure by 13,126 or almost 33 per cent and waiting times have improved considerably. The Government has made an additional £7 million available in 1996 to allow work in reducing excessive waiting times to continue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick-East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 128 together.  In cases of alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of children by any person, the primary role of health boards is the protection, welfare and support of the child victim as provided for under the Child Care Act, 1991.  In relation to health board hospitals, health boards also have statutory powers under the Health Act, 1970 to deal with staff against whom allegations of misconduct or unfitness to hold office are made.</P>
      <P>As sexual abuse is a criminal offence, the statutory power for dealing with allegations against perpetrators rests with the Garda Síochána.  Procedures for dealing with the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda were launched last year.  My Department is currently carrying out a review of the arrangements in place to protect vulnerable clients and patients of the health services from abuse, not only arrangements in hospitals but in all other sectors of the service.  Discussions have taken place with the main employers in the health services on the adequacy of existing arrangements and the need for further safeguards.  Further discussions are planned with the professional bodies and staff associations.  The aim of the review is to ensure that, as far as possible, abuse is prevented in the health and social services but that if it does occur, it is brought to light quickly, that the matter is fully addressed in accordance with agreed Protocols and that all necessary steps are taken to prevent a recurrence of the abuse.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board was established in 1991 in accordance with the provisions of Statutory Instrument No. 19 of 1991 in accordance with powers conferred on the Minister for Health by section 3 to 6 of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the National Cancer Registry Board is to collect and classify <Col N="1579" /> information on all cancer cases which occur in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry began full registration of cancer incidence and mortality in Ireland in January 1994. This data is currently being compiled and marks an important beginning for the availability of comprehensive and reliable data on patterns of cancer incidence, treatment and outcome in this country.  The Cancer Registry's first national report will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>In analysing cancer data for Ireland comparisons are made with data available from other countries, including England and Wales.  However, there are at present no plans to initiate a specific comparative cancer registry study between Ireland and areas on the west coast of Britain.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand the person in question was placed on the Mater Hospital waiting list on 29 March 1995. The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgement of the consultant concerned and is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.  The patient's practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the number of people on the waiting list for cardiac surgery and I am anxious to reduce the waiting period for those people at present on the list.  I have asked my Department to formulate proposals for <Col N="1580" /> the provision of additional cardiac surgery activity in the public hospital system. I am fully committed to the provision of additional capacity including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public system over the next two to three years.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.  I have, therefore, asked my Department to see whether any health care organisation can provide cardiac surgery at prices which are reasonable and affordable on a once-off basis.  Negotiations are being finalised on the purchase of additional once-off procedures in 1996.</P>
    <P>The major objective is to increase the permanent capacity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector and in the meantime to provide additional procedures quickly to ease the problems of those waiting cardiac operations.  I am hopeful that the short-term approach together with the long-term planning initiative will ensure that waiting times for cardiac surgery are reduced significantly and I look forward to co-operation from everybody involved to bring this about as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>These waiting times clearly demonstrate the benefits which have accrued from the waiting list funding provided in recent years.  In 1996 a further £7 million has been committed and this will have an impact on the length of time people spend on waiting lists.

      <P>A considerable amount of the preliminary design work for a scheme to extend navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra, County Cavan, has already been completed.  Tenders for the necessary environmental impact assessment, EIA, of the scheme were invited in 1994 but, because of non-availability of funds, the assessment did not proceed.  I have, however, provided funds for the EIA in the current year and I expect tenders will be reinvited within the next four to six weeks.  It is impossible to say at this stage when detailed design of the scheme will commence as that will depend both on the outcome of the EIA and on the availability of funds to enable design consultants to be engaged.</P>

      <P>The construction of a tunnel from the M1 Airport Motorway to Dublin Port was recommended in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative; the estimated cost, excluding VAT, of a dual-carriageway tunnel was given as £104.2 million.

As I informed the Deputy in reply to his parliamentary question of Tuesday last, 23 January, the transport service to this school involves a double trip arrangement. In order to ensure a cost-effective service, pupils are often required to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings. The standard of service available here is considered reasonable and adequate in the context of the general operation of the scheme.  In addition, &ldquo;a first in to school, first home&rdquo; service is being operated.  I do not propose to alter these arrangements.</P>
      <P>Supervision of pupils waiting for the school bus is a matter for the board of management as the body charged with the direct government of the school.

The system installed has subsequently proven to be inadequate for the school's requirements. My Department's professional advisers are currently investigating the feasibility of connecting to a county council well some distance from the school and a report in the matter is expected very shortly.  It is not possible at this time to state the nature of works, their cost or when they will commence, but every effort is being made to resolve this situation as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if she will accede to the case which has been put to her by parents of children attending a school (details supplied) in County Kildare for a concessionary teacher to be appointed from September 1996, in view of the fact that the school authorities have detailed the serious difficulties with which these parents have to contend and in view of the fact that the application for such a post was originally made over three years ago.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme and for the provision of a concessionary teaching post which is normally associated with this scheme.  The concessionary teaching posts previously associated with the granting of disadvantaged status, are not currently available for allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed report by the Combat Poverty Agency on current approaches to the identification and support of pupils in disadvantaged areas, is currently being considered in my Department. This report will provide a valuable input into the development of future approaches to the identification and <Col N="1601" /> support of pupils suffering educational disadvantage.  The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of any further expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>During the past three years, an investment of over £10 million has been made in the provision of a major extension and additional capital resources for Limerick regional technical college.  The 1996 capital provision for the college includes for the completion of phases 1 and 2 and for the planning of further new phases comprising lecture theatre, hall, canteen and student facilities.  When planning has reached a more advanced stage and when final budgets have been established consideration will be given to setting aside the necessary funding for the project.  A commencement date for the construction of the project will also be established at that stage.</P>

      <P>There are 57 second-level fee-charging schools in the State. The table attached gives the following information: name of each school; enrolment of each school by gender during 1994-95; confirmation if school applied for assistance under the grant scheme for school books for needy pupils and the amount paid during 1995-96; confirmation if school provides the transition year option and the additional amounts paid for this purpose during 1994-95.</P>
      <P>The information requested regarding the management authority and trustees is not readily available in the Department and will be supplied to the Deputy as soon as possible.  The Department does not compile statistics in relation to fees charged by fee-charging schools.</P>
      <P>Generally, fee-charging second-level schools are not eligible to receive the <i>per capita</i> grant in respect of their students, the grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers or the various other grants for current expenditure to which schools in the free education scheme are entitled.</P>
      <P>A small number of schools of the Protestant tradition are eligible for all grants payable to schools and pupils in the free education scheme with the exception of the <i>per capita</i> grant.  A block grant is paid to the secondary education committee for distribution among needier Protestant children to enable them to attend a Protestant school.</P>

      <P>On 29 November last, I advised the House that my decision not to proceed with the construction of a post-primary school for the Knocklyon area was based on a comprehensive study carried out by Dr. Michael Bannon of the Service Industries Research Centre, based in UCD.</P>
      <P>I further indicated that I asked that the position be re-examined in the light of the very latest data available.  Dr. Bannon has now reassessed the position, taking account of current enrolment trends, school accommodation, both existing and planned, and housing developments in the general area.  He concluded that developments in the interim do not affect his original recommendation that a new post-primary school to serve the Knocklyon area is not required.</P>
      <P>Based on this independent advice, I wish to reiterate my earlier decision not to provide such a school and I have asked my officials to report to me on the future use of the Department's site at Scholarstown Road.</P>

      <P>The role of the teachers' centres is dealt with in the White Paper, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, which sets out Government policy in the area of education.  One of the decisions contained in the White Paper is that teachers' centres will henceforth be called education centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision reflects the substantial development of such centres which has already taken place and the further development which is provided for under the ESF aided human resources <Col N="1618" /> operational programme.  As stated in the White Paper, the centres will provide a focus for development programmes for teachers, parents and boards of management.  Following the establishment of the education boards, the centres will come under their authority.</P>
    <P>There are regular meetings between officials of my Department and centre representatives at which a wide range of issues are discussed, including the development of the centres.  These discussions will focus, in due course, on the detail of the new structural arrangements set out in the White Paper and on any other issues related to the development of the centres.</P>

      <P>In 1994, County Kilkenny Vocational Education Commitee sought the provision of a replacement school building for Graiguenamanagh vocational school.  My Department considered that, having regard to the low enrolment in the school and the unlikelihood of any significant increase in the foreseeable future, a replacement school building could not be justified.</P>
      <P>The provision of adequate temporary accommodation requested by the vocational education committee was, however, approved and is at planning stage.  Last month the vocational education committee requested the provision of four additional temporary rooms and this request is under consideration by my Department at present.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education does not have precise data on the overall number of personal computers in second-level schools.</P>
      <P>However, based on a recent survey of a sample of second-level schools, it is estimated that the great majority of students have access to personal computers. Under the Department's school administration scheme qualifying second-level schools have been provided with a computer for school administration purposes.</P>
      <P>In addition, computers are provided to schools in a number of other ways: schools may purchase computers out of their own resources; new schools and schools being extended are provided with equipment which includes multi-media computers; through special initiatives for enhancing access and use of computers with multi-media.</P>
      <P>The special initiatives include the introduction of new programmes like the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme.</P>
      <P>Access to information technology and other new technologies is a central component of this programme which is currently being provided in 126 second-level schools.  To facilitate student access to equipment, including multi-media computers, the Department provides schools offering this programme with a capital grant for the purchase of equipment.  In-career development for teachers of the leaving certificate vocational programme includes specific provision for enhancement of skills in the use of the facilities including multi-media. It is envisaged that by 1999 all schools will have access to this programme.</P>

      <P>The information in so far as it is available is set out on the attached table.  The income is generated by way of a fee of £110 payable on each individual application for a special exemption, or a club special event.  The fee of £110 comprises a court stamp duty of £20 and excise duty of £90, which is collected by the courts on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The fee of £110 is payable when the application for a special exemption or club special event is lodged in the court office.  However, the application can be withdrawn at any stage.  If the application is withdrawn the applicant will be entitled to a refund of the £110.  In addition to applications for special exemptions and club special events, court stamp duty/excise duty is payable on applications for occasional licences, annual dance licences, temporary dance licences, club extensions etc.  Court stamp duty is also payable on a myriad of court documents such as civil bills, civil processes, affidavits.  Again if the application is withdrawn or the documents not served, the applicant is entitled to a refund of the stamp duty/excise duty paid.  While global figures are available for the total refunds of court fees/excise duty for each year it is not possible to identify what proportion of the total refunds refer to applications for special exemptions or club special events.</P>
      <P>For this reason the amounts given cannot be taken as the exact revenue from all special exemptions/special club events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are my views on the submission made by the Scheme Workers Alliance.  CE participants are treated in the same way as all other PAYE tax payers in so far as income tax is concerned.  In reality, however, few participants actually pay income tax as most do not earn enough in a single tax year to do so.</P>
      <P>CE participants are granted payment increases in line with social welfare allowances.  In addition they retain secondary social welfare benefits and are also allowed take up part time employment without any reduction in their CE allowance.  These benefits are of considerable benefit to CE participants and form part of their overall remuneration package.</P>
      <P>From April 1996 CE participants will be insured at class A PRSI.  This will considerably increase the range of social welfare benefits for which they are insured.  As from April CE will consist of two distinct options, (a) part-time integration option and (b) part-time job option.  It is intended that 30,000 and 10,000 places will be provided on the integration and job options respectively and that participants on the job option will in future have access to the relevant worker protection legislation applying to part time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development modules for CE participants which include <i>inter alia</i> personal-employment skills, technical skills relating to project work and support for own time development are currently being phased in for projects involving eleven or more participants.  In addition FÁS have been asked to bring forward proposals for quality improvement which will build on the current training arrangements for CE and which will <Col N="1642" /> ensure that quality work experience related to labour market needs is provided to participants by sponsors. Under the terms of the new part-time job option, participants will have an annual contract of employment renew-able for up to three years.  In addition up to 10 per cent of those engaged on the part-time integration option can be re-engaged for a second year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together. Card Technology Ireland commenced operations in May 1995 in the production of plastic cards, games cards and promotional cards.  The project had a target of 120 new jobs in the first year of production, rising to double that at full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project was evaluated by IDA Ireland in accordance with normal criteria and was considered to be a worthwhile investment.  However, it later <Col N="1643" /> transpired that while key potential customers had indicated that significant sales would be forthcoming when interviewed prior to the project approval, actual sales were much slower to materialise. In addition as the project progressed, certain financial constraints emerged in the company, which further hindered sales build-up.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with IDA Ireland in mid 1995, the company decided to appoint a consultant to seek a new investor for the project.  It was the promoter's view that a new investor would strengthen the company's operation and assist in the generation of sales.  The consultant's search for an investor extended throughout Ireland and indeed worldwide, and was assisted by the overseas IDA office network. However, despite concerted efforts involving contact with approximately 100 companies, no investor-strategic partner had emerged by December 1995.  The company then decided to appoint a receiver.  The receiver placed advertisements in major publications which resulted in approximately 100 inquiries and 22 visits to the plant but to date have not proved successful.</P>
    <P>In line with the grant agreement the company has been requested by the IDA to repay the capital and employment elements of the grants paid to-date. I have been assured by IDA Ireland that they are continuing to actively market the factory to suitable security printing companies.  However, if a suitable company is not identified, then they will market the factory for other potential industries.</P>

      <P>Under An Bord Bia Act, 1994, responsibility for food promotion and marketing is vested in An Bord Bia.  It is my understanding that although the board does not operate any specific incentive schemes for restaurant proprietors, its 1996 programmes involve a number of specific dimensions in relation to food promotion in the restaurant sector.  Foremost among these is a recipe competition with the Restaurant Association of Ireland as part of the international food event, Horizons 96.  Other activities include sponsorship of Euro-Toques and of four Egon Ronay awards.  In addition the on-going services of the board's food advisory centre are available to restaurants and caterers.</P>

      <P>On 24 January I <Col N="1645" /> signed an Order implementing regulations for the transport of cattle by sea from Ireland on cattleships.  The Order, which takes effect on 1 February, is entitled &ldquo;Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Order, 1996&rdquo; and it complements and augments the welfare provisions already included in the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals During Transport) Order, 1995 which came into effect last May and made provisions for the transport of animals by road, rail and air.</P>
      <P>The new Order will provide for: prohibition of the carrying of cattle on ships which have not been approved for that purpose; procedures and detailed specifications for approving ships including the documentation and back-up information to be provided; inspection of ships to determine suitability; revocation, suspension of approvals in cases of non-compliance; conditions in relation to unfavourable weather; the submission of voyage plans; loading and care of livestock on board by suitably qualified persons; stocking density levels; arrangements to ensure the proper supply and storage of sufficient fodder and water; and reports to be submitted after each journey.</P>
      <P>Ships will be assessed on a continuing basis by reference to the detailed criteria in the Order.  The approval procedure will involve detailed inspections of ships by independent marine consultants nominated by my Department and the Department of the Marine to assist both Departments in assessing the overall suitability of ships for transporting animals.  In this regard, the final decisions on suitability will continue to rest with my Department's veterinary inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the new Order are designed to ensure that cattle being exported to Third Countries are loaded and transported on ships without undue risk or suffering and that they will receive proper care and attention during sea journeys.</P>

      <Quest>his policy in relation to the slaughtering of animals; his views on whether slaughtering is more advantageous to the industry; if improved slaughter grant would be beneficial to Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the higher employment and added value derived from the export of beef, it is important that the majority of cattle produced in Ireland should be slaughtered and processed in the country in order to provide maximum benefit to the national economy.  For that reason, it is important to ensure that EU supports, including export refunds, do not provide any disincentive which would militate against the achievement of that aim.</P>
      <P>With regard to the slaughter premium, the position is that this premium is payable only in Ireland and on a very small number of steers in Germany and Denmark.  While an improved premium would be beneficial to the Irish beef industry it would be extremely difficult to persuade the Commission or other member states to accept such a proposal in view of the fact that the premium is largely confined to Ireland and, at its present level, has been effective in greatly helping to overcome the impact of seasonality for the Irish slaughtering sector.</P>

      <P>The position is that beef traded as Irish beef is of Irish origin.  There are special conditions agreed by the European Union governing the export of beef from the United Kingdom.  Some beef is imported from the United Kingdom for processing in this country.  However, such imports must be accompanied by a health certificate which states that it meets the special conditions and that it is fit for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The vast bulk of products produced from this beef are re-exported to the United Kingdom.  These products are not labelled as Irish beef.  However, they bear a health mark which indicates the country from which the product was consigned and that it has been produced in accordance with the relevant EU legislation.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he is taking to prevent imports of United Kingdom cattle, both legal imports of cattle under six months old and alleged illegal smuggling of cattle from Northern Ireland; and his views on whether these cattle are a risk to our national herd in view of the fact that they cannot be checked for BSE as a result of the fact that there is no testing procedure available for live animals.</Quest>

      <P>It is a criminal offence to import cattle in contravention of the rules laid down at EU level regarding the export of cattle from the United Kingdom to other member states.  Further national measures restricting legal imports from the United Kingdom would be invalid under EU law.  Various measures are taken by my Department, including <Col N="1648" /> checks at meat plants, to ensure that illegal imports do not take place.  I should point out, however, that as BSE has not been shown to be a transmissible disease, cattle in this country are not at risk in relation to BSE from imported cattle.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the some 200 special grants of milk quota, first made to new entrants or young farmers in 1990 out of the EC 1 per cent or &ldquo;Nallet&rdquo; reserve pursuant to Article 3b of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 857/84. The eligibility criteria which applied to those allocations included the applicant's age, educational qualifications and his or her possession of an agricultural holding and herd.  A further fundamental determining factor was that for eligibility the applicant must at the time have been operating a separate dairying enterprise.  These criteria have also been applied to purchases of quota by new <Col N="1649" /> entrants under the milk quota restructuring schemes.</P>
      <P>For this reason the circumstances of the applicant's parents were not taken into consideration, and as a result the details sought by the Deputy are not available.</P>

      <P>The statistical data which the Deputy requested is set out in the following tabular statements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the beef and live cattle sector, the commission considered that taking account of the GATT ceiling of 1,119 million tonnes on subsidised exports from the EU in the 1995-96 GATT year, the level of export licence applications in the first half of the year was excessive and the cuts in export refunds were made in an effort to achieve a more orderly flow of applications. These cuts have only had a limited impact on cattle prices to date because our beef exporters have been operating from licences which were prefixed at the higher refund rates.  This position should not immediately change as these higher rates prefixations are in adequate supply to cover normal exports until the end of February.  An increase in refunds &mdash; or equivalent action &mdash; is urgently required in order to prevent cattle prices from falling when these prefixations are used up and I will continue to press our case on this with the commission until it is achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 254, 259 and 263 together.</P>
      <P>The Council of Energy ministers on 20 December 1995 discussed a range of issues, the most important of which was the draft directive on the internal market in electricity.</P>
      <P>Following extensive discussions since 1992, characterised by opposing views on the key aspect of third party access, much progress has been made on the draft electricity directive.</P>
      <P>Consensus has been reached on the following points: member states may impose public service obligations relating to security, including security of supply, regularity, quality and price of supplies and to environmental protection. New generation must be allocated either by an authorisation or tendering system and even if tendering is chosen autoproducers and IPPs must be entitled to authorisation.  Authorisation can only be refused for objective criteria. Fifteen per cent of the market may be reserved for indigenous fuels. Integrated electricity companies must keep separate accounts for generation, transmission and distribution activities and must not discriminate, cross subsidise or distort competition.  Eligible customers above a certain threshold of consumption yet to be decided may contract directly with independent generators. Generators may serve their customers via direct lines.</P>
      <P>Discussion is continuing on the arrangements for access to the system: the question of member states choosing negotiated or regulated third party access or single buyer systems.  The threshold for eligible customers has yet to be settled.  Pressure also exists to allow distributors to be eligible customers or to allow a percentage of their customers to be eligible customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Energy Council on 20 December 1995, I accepted the concept of eligible customers and I opposed the recognition of electricity distribution companies as eligible customers and the continuing progressive opening up of <Col N="1655" /> the electricity market without review.  I strongly took the view that by their nature public service obligations result in additional costs and the directive must explicitly acknowledge the right to recover these costs from all consumers. I stressed that Ireland is particularly concerned to recover the public service costs which are generation related &mdash; the costs of national security of supply. All consumers must be able to share in the benefits of the internal market but the costs must be fairly shared also.</P>
    <P>The EU proposals have always recognised that transmission and distribution networks will continue to be monopolies. This will allow us to continue the long standing policy of uniform charges throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Multipoint microwave distribution systems was introduced a number of years ago to provide high quality, reliable multichannel television services to those parts of the country where licensed cable television is not available.  It is appropriate therefore that people in the north west should have access to it, just as in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the specific nature, of the problems regarding MMDS to which the Deputy's question refers.  I am aware that there has been some objection to the proposed erection of an MMDS transmitter on a Telecom Éireann mast in County Donegal.  Erection of such transmitters is a normal and relatively routine part of providing a licensed MMDS service and any arrangements as to the sharing of mast <Col N="1656" /> facilities are a matter for the two companies involved.  There may also be some concern in the area relating to planning permission for the mast, but I have no function in relation to this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy would care to make a more specific inquiry in this matter, relating to my area of responsibility, I would be happy to respond to it.</P>

      <Col N="1657" /> The position is that since the establishment of the single market on 1 January 1993, all member state airlines are free to operate on any international route within the European economic area, without Government control, provided slots are available at airports.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>

    <P>ESB has operated a help policy for many years which is designed to facilitate domestic customers in financial difficulties to come to grips with paying their electricity bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> The first reminder letter to the customer draws his or her intention to this policy and invites him or her to contact ESB as soon as possible should they wish to make an arrangement to clear their bill in instalments.  Where such an arrangement is maintained by the customer, no further action is needed.  This is what happens in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>In some instances where a customer does not respond to a first or subsequent reminder letter, then a collector will call to his or her premises.  Withdrawal of supply to customers in financial difficulties is always the last resort and only occurs when every possible step has been taken to make an arrangement.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Economic Infrastructure was approved by the European Commission on 29 July 1994 and it was officially launched and published on 30 September 1994.  Arising from the delay in finalising the programme, some re-profiling in the timing of expenditure under the programme was necessary.</P>
      <P>Outturns of expenditure for 1995 under the various measures of the operational programme remain to be finalised.  However, implementation of the operational programme is proceeding satisfactorily.  The bulk of the expenditure under the programme will be incurred during 1997-1999 inclusive.</P>

      <P>The cutaway bogs measure of the Operational Programme for Economic Infrastructure 1994-99 provides for desk studies into the regeneration of certain of Bord na Móna's cutaway peatlands and for the development of pilot studies to test the conclusions of the studies.</P>
      <P>The pilot studies, which will be undertaken over a five year period, will result in the creation of 1,000 acres of new wetlands and the development of an additional 500 acres to form wildlife habitats through a process of natural regeneration.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the measure will be approximately £2.2 million of which 50 per cent will be grant-aided by the EU. Formal approval was received from the EU in July, 1995.</P>
      <P>Bord Na Móna, who are managing the project, have advised that the network of participants has now been put together and the various activities have commenced i.e. the information studies and some preliminary work on the onsite development of the new wetlands.</P>
      <P>The successful completion of this measure should eliminate any gaps in our current knowledge regarding the principles underpinning the planning and development of amenity and wildlife areas and will form the basis for future development of Bord na Móna's cutaway peatlands.</P>

      <P>Not all of the ten commercial state companies under my Department's aegis have social obligations.  To that extent not all of these companies have to bear social costs.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation, Bord Gáis Eireann, Aer Rianta, Bord na Móna and the Irish Aviation Authority all operate on a purely commercial basis and have no social mandate.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus Group also operates on a purely commercial basis but under the Essential Air Services Programme (EASP), approved by the Government, it is currently providing air services from Dublin to both Galway and Kerry regional airports.  The Exchequer refunds the company approximately £900,000 per annum for operating this service.</P>

    <P>In the case of Coras Iompair Eireann, the company receives a substantial Exchequer subvention each year in support of the provision of socially necessary, but commercially unviable, public transport services.

    <P>This year's subvention will amount to approximately £100 million.  The board has not yet decided on how this will be broken down.  However, as I have made clear on a number of occasions recently, it is my intention to replace this subvention arrangement with a system of public service contracts, commencing in the 1997 financial year.  This new system will improve transparency and accountability and will help to ensure optimum value for money in respect of State financial support to public transport.</P>
    <P>In the context of the ESB cost and competitiveness review (CCR), it has been accepted that ESB, like many electricity utilities in other countries, has to bear extra costs at a result of national energy policy.  These costs, which are recognised in the draft EU Electricity Directive, are more generally referred to as &ldquo;Public Service Obligations&rdquo; (PSOs).  It has been accepted in the CCR that PSOs are within the remit of Government as policymaker and that the identification and quantification of such obligations are necessary in a future competitive electricity market. Accordingly, appropriate mechanisms to address these PSOs will be provided for in new legislation.  The proposed regulatory authority for the electricity industry will oversee the quantification of future PSO costs and will ensure that they are recovered in a fair manner from all electricity consumers connected to the network.  However, at present, no precise independent estimate is available of the magnitude of such obligations.</P>
    <P>My Department has not, as yet, identified or quantified the cost of the social services provided by both Telecom Éireann and An Post.  However, with regard to Telecom Éireann, the planned <Col N="1663" /> establishment of an independent regulatory authority for the telecommunications sector later this year means that work to this end is currently being undertaken.  This exercise will involve the proper identification of the universal service obligation in Ireland and the manner in which all telecommunications operators and service providers should contribute to its cost.  The gradual liberalisation of the postal sector as envisaged in a recent draft EU directive on &ldquo;Common Rules for the Development of Community Postal Services and the Improvement of Quality of Service&rdquo; will necessitate a similar exercise in the future in relation to the postal services.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of my reply I assume that the Deputy is referring to public inquiries and investigations conducted under section 7 of the Regulation of Railways Act, 1871.  All of the substantive recommendations made following public inquiries or investigations under the Act have been implemented to the satisfaction of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of rail operations is of course a matter for the board and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann who have extensive procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of railway services at all times.  Iarnród Éireann has in the last four years embarked on an ongoing safety programme to enhance existing procedures.  Safety on the railway will also benefit from a <Col N="1664" /> complementary quality programme which the company is promoting to improve efficiency and effectiveness of its operations.</P>
    <P>CIE have assured me that safety is the prime consideration in the operation of the railway and I am satisfied that the company's current safety standards and procedures are designed to achieve that priority objective.</P>
