      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3, together.</P>
      <P>I met the Chancellor of Austria, Dr. Franz Vranitzky on Monday 20 May. The meeting was a most useful one in the context of preparations for Ireland's presidency of the EU.  Our discussions were wide-ranging covering, in particular, the possible agenda for the Florence European Council, the Irish presidency of the European Union, likely developments at the Intergovernmental Conference, the security situation in Europe, including the situation in former Yugoslavia, and the future direction of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting helped to highlight the broad similarity of the position of both Austria and Ireland in regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and, in <Col N="3" /> particular, to the future evolution of the EU's common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>I had a short meeting with Mr. Carlos Ferrer, President of the Economic and Social Committee of the EU on Tuesday 21 May.  Mr. Ferrer appraised me of the work of the ESC and its hopes for the Intergovernmental Conference.  I assured Mr. Ferrer that Ireland fully appreciates the value of the ESC's contribution to the European Union and that it would give the committee's proposals in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference the fullest consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss Austria's participation in economic and monetary union with its Chancellor? Was the Austrian Chancellor concerned that the Italians may not join, a matter of grave concern in that region at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both questions is in the affirmative; we did discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss the Western European Union with the Chancellor?  Would it be correct to say that both the Chancellor and Taoiseach were in agreement that the Western European Union should remain a separate entity within the European Union after the Intergovernmental Conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes, we discussed the Western European Union. We discussed the future connection of the Western European Union and the European Union in general terms, but more specifically we discussed our agreement on the development of the Western European Union to allow observer members, like Ireland and Austria, to participate in the Petersberg Tasks, various peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks it is envisaged the Western European Union might fulfil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a wide identity of views on many topics.  There are subjects on which the Austrians have more expertise and interest and which we discussed, such as the positions in Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia.  We have a fairly strong identity of views on institutional arrangements for foreign policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> in particular the granting of a planning and analysis capacity to the union as a means of support for the effective pursuit of a common foreign and security policy by the union as it is considered there is a deficiency in that regard in the current arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss Slovenia's application for membership of the union as one of the first potential countries to be included in an enlarged union and, if so, does Ireland support its application?  When this matter is discussed during our Presidency of the European Union would we be prepared to reject the property and territorial issues put forward by the Italians which have created great difficulties for Slovenia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than taking sides between a member state of the union, Italy, and a potential applicant state, Slovenia, Ireland's role would be better served by seeking to have these matters resolved by agreement rather than, as the Deputy suggested, taking sides against Italy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an outstanding problem regarding Slovenia's application concerning Italian property rights in Slovenia which predate the break up of the former Yugoslavia.  To date various efforts have been made to resolve them without success.  The best approach is to seek a negotiated agreement. The Tánaiste had a recent meeting with the Slovene Foreign Minister on the matter and the Irish Presidency will do all that is necessary and appropriate to assist in resolving these difficulties to ensure there will not be any obstacle of that nature in the way of consideration of a possible Slovene application for membership of the union.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had very useful meetings last week with the SDLP and the Alliance Party.</P>
      <P>Our discussions focused on the all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June.  I outlined the Government's approach and in particular conveyed our determination that the negotiations should, in a full and comprehensive fashion, address all the relevant issues. We will continue to work intensively to this end in the lead up to 10 June.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that, given the elections taking place in Northern Ireland this week, it would not be helpful for me to give further details either about the meetings or the consultations currently taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply on the meetings.  Given the week that is in it, I accept it may be difficult for him to give too much information and we did not get much from the four questions.  I wish the Taoiseach to comment on one matter.  Following last week's meeting between the Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the latter said in a press conference that if he gave the impression that Sinn Féin would be able to continue in the talks <Col N="7" /> process when decommissioning was raised, he did so unintentionally, it would not be permissible and that party would be excluded from the talks, which would proceed without it.  From what was said previously, I understand that is not the Irish Government's view.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if, in the event of Sinn Féin engaging with the IRA to bring about a new ceasefire, like the ceasefire of August 1994 and signing up to the Mitchell principles, when the issue of decommissioning is debated that Sinn Féin will not be excluded from the talks if there is not decommissioning? As I understand it, the Mitchell principles do not relate to decommissioning. The Mitchell report states that the parties should consider partial decommissioning during the talks process, but that is not what Sir Patrick Mayhew said last week.  Will the Taoiseach clarify this issue and the Irish Government's position on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government's position is that we want the issue of decommissioning to be addressed in accordance with the Mitchell report. Paragraph 34 of the report states that the parties should consider an approach under which some decommissioning would take place during the process of all-party negotiations rather than before or after the negotiations.  I emphasise the words, &ldquo;that the parties should consider&rdquo;. A question of consideration is at issue here, nothing more or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that clarification.  It is important in the present circumstances that the issue of decommissioning is a consideration and not a <i>de facto</i> decommissioning of arms although, if possible, we would all like that to happen tomorrow.  However, that has not been the Irish position in negotiations with Sir Patrick Mayhew. Will the Taoiseach indicate if that is one of the issues creating a difficulty in the ongoing disagreements with the British Government?  Has Senator Mitchell's involvement in the talks process been <Col N="8" /> clarified?  Will the position of the Irish Government be the same as some of the parties I asked about in discussions today?  Perhaps Senator Mitchell should be involved in the decommissioning strand and not in other strands?  What is the Irish Government's position on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the matters mentioned in the Deputy's supplementary are among those currently being discussed between the Irish and British Governments at official level and today between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State.  It is important to make the point that we have reached a large measure of agreement on a wide range of issues with the British Government in the lead up to these talks in terms of setting the date for the talks and on the ground rules for them.  While issues yet to be agreed remain and we wish to ensure that as much as possible is agreed before the talks commence, it is not inappropriate to draw attention to the fact that a great deal of issues have been agreed between us.  That gives grounds for some degree of optimism that remaining problems will be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the elections are on this week and that, therefore, we need to be careful. However, the Anglo-Irish Conference is going ahead, although it would have been better to have postponed it if the Governments cannot reach agreement because that could have a negative effect.  In the light of what the Taoiseach has just said, is he drawing a distinction between consideration of decommissioning on the one hand, and action on decommissioning on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated the Irish Government's position as clearly as it could possibly be stated.  We want to address the decommissioning issue in accordance with the Mitchell report.  I drew attention to paragraph 34 of that report which says, in regard to what is <Col N="9" /> loosely described as parallel decommissioning, that &ldquo;the parties should consider an approach under which some decommissioning would take place during the process of all-party negotiations rather than before or after as the parties now urge&rdquo;.  I emphasised again, in response to Deputy Ahern, the words &ldquo;the parties should consider&rdquo;.  The parties only get together to consider anything when the talks start and the word used is &ldquo;consider&rdquo;.  That is self-explanatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to press the Taoiseach on this point because it is not clear to me.  Is the Taoiseach saying that if the parties merely consider the decommissioning issue, as far as the Irish Government is concerned it would be happy with that, or is he saying that the parties must consider actually decommissioning?  Is that what the Irish Government is looking for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should return at all times to the actual content of the Mitchell report rather than seeking to import our own private meanings into it as, perhaps, the Deputy might wish me to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking the Taoiseach what he thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the parties are asked to do is to consider an approach under which decommissioning would take place during the process of all-party negotiations.  The Irish Government's preferences as to the decommissioning of arms are well known.  I have stated on many occasions that in terms of our preferences we see no place for illegal arms in the political equation, and never have.  What is at stake is not the view of the Irish Government as to the ideal situation or what we would like to attain.  What is at stake is the basis on which the discussions are taking place.  I have already said in response to Deputy Ahern that the basis upon which we consider the talks to be taking place is paragraph 34 <Col N="10" /> of the Mitchell report which I have quoted.  The Deputy is well aware of my views and the views of the Government on the decommissioning issue generally. That is not what is at stake here.  What is at stake is the ground rules laid down in the Mitchell report which we believe are the appropriate ground rules for the talks.  I have answered the Deputy's question and there should be no lack of clarity in her mind on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding, the Taoiseach's view in relation to decommissioning is shared on this side of the House, but the reality is as laid out in the very carefully drafted report of former Senator Mitchell.  In regard to the role of Senator Mitchell in the talks, what is the preferred option of the Government, again accepting the sensitivity of the election in the North?  Is it the preferred option of the Government that Senator Mitchell should have a major role to play?  Would that role relate exclusively to the question of decommissioning, or would it be as chairman of the Strand II phase?  What would be the Government's preferred option?  Would the Taoiseach confirm that it is the Government's wish that Senator Mitchell should play a major role, as he obviously has a unique knowledge of the whole situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best I can do to answer the Deputy's question is to reiterate my answer to the same question from Deputy Ahern last week when I said that the question of personnel in the various roles to be fulfilled, the structure of their responsibilities etc., has yet to be settled between the two Governments, and when it is settled it will be announced jointly by both Governments.  All discussions about how individuals might be involved should be conducted jointly by the two Governments, not individually by one Government.  I went on to say that I strongly believe Senator George Mitchell has an unrivalled capacity to make a valuable contribution in this <Col N="11" /> area.  I elaborated somewhat on that point.  That basically is the position now. I have the highest admiration for Senator Mitchell and his capacity, but it is a matter for the two Governments to reach a settlement or agreement on this matter.  It is important to make the point that we would not appreciate it if the British Government were to make a statement of its position on a matter of this nature without our agreement.  The same applies in reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Taoiseach's meeting with the SDLP leader he said he was close to agreement with the British Prime Minister on the procedure for decommissioning.  Is that still the case? Is the Taoiseach willing to meet the British Prime Minister if today's Anglo-Irish conference does not succeed in clearing the procedures for decommissioning and other issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand by what I said after the meeting with the SDLP.  I said, in the context of the overall record we have had in terms of reaching agreement on various issues with the British Government &mdash; including issues which many might have thought it would be impossible for the Irish and British Governments to reach agreement upon &mdash; that we did, admittedly after some difficult negotiations, reach the relevant agreements.  Given the issues upon which we have already reached agreement, the remaining issues are ones upon which we can, and I hope will, reach agreement.  As I also said in my remarks after the meeting with the SDLP, the purpose of the all-party talks is also to reach agreements between all of the parties and, although it would be desirable that the Irish and British Governments would have identical views on everything before the talks start, it may well be that there will be some issues on which we, as parties, will still have views that need to be accommodated and can be accommodated during the talks process or simultaneously with it.  As far as possible we <Col N="12" /> will seek the maximum degree of agreement between the Governments before 10 June.  As far as my role in reaching agreement is concerned, I am obviously keeping in almost hourly contact with the progress of discussions on this matter at official level and between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State.  I have had to date several conversations with the British Prime Minister at various points and stand ready to have further conversations either by telephone or face-to-face as and when necessary.  As the Deputy is well aware it is possible for the Prime Minister and me to meet at comparatively short notice if that is needed.</P>

      <P>If the all-party talks start with everybody participating on 10 June, which is the wish of everybody in this House, will the Taoiseach be in support of a resumption of the meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would.  There is considerable work which is at an advanced stage at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which it would be desirable that we should complete.  I have already indicated in my speech in Finglas that, at least as far as the Government and my own party are concerned, I would favour a resumption of the meetings to complete that work if an IRA ceasefire takes place and Sinn Féin can thereby take part.</P>

One of the more successful innovations of recent times is the county enterprise boards.  The activities of the Kerry County Enterprise Board have been extremely successful.  From their establishment in late 1993 to the end of 1995, Kerry County Enterprise Board approved 196 projects worth £1.5 million in grants, of which £650,000 was drawn down by the end of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Drury Communications Ltd. were appointed in February of this year to assist in developing and implementing the overall communications strategy for the strategic management initiative (SMI) both internally and externally. Their appointment was the result of a competitive tendering process, in accordance with Government tendering procedures, which began in November 1995.</P>
      <P>In all, submissions from eight Public Relations companies were evaluated. After consideration, the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries under the SMI concluded that Drury Communications Ltd. offered the best range of skills for this project at the most appropriate price.</P>
      <P>The cost of the consultancy over a 12-month period from February 1996 to the end-January 1997 is £83,600 plus VAT. This was approved by the Government contracts committee in February.</P>
      <P>One of the central objectives of Delivering Better Government is the provision of an excellent service to the public.  To achieve this, changes will need to be made to the overall approach of the Civil Service to the management of performance and to processes and procedures.  Expertise in this complex area is required.</P>
      <P>Tenders will be sought in the near future from appropriate consultancy firms to assist with this essential element of the strategic management initiative and to develop best practice.  Government contract procedures will be fully complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State is trying to provide better Government but this administration is certainly providing bigger Government.  We read recently that the Government is spending £15 million a year on consultancies in addition to the expenditure of £10 million on programme managers, a total of £25 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> Does the Minister of State agree that this is grossly excessive and is an unnecessary burden on taxpayers at a time when the Government has an unprecedented number of advisers, programme managers and Ministers of State?  If we are to have more efficient Government and deliver better Government we need fewer consultants, programme managers and advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  I do not agree with the subliminal message in the Deputy's question.  Money must be spent extremely carefully and we have a responsibility to the taxpayers to ensure that we get best value for money.  To ensure best value for money for the paymasters of the public sector in future decades, we have a duty &mdash; and there is broad party agreement on the thrust of this &mdash; to ensure that we have best possible service in the Civil Service.  Given the state of the economy and the need for the public sector to serve competitive Ireland into the next millennium, I do not apologise at all for the Government employing consultants where the expertise is not available to aid in change in the public sector.</P>

This is exactly what we are doing in this case.  We are getting extremely good value for money.  We did not employ the highest tender but the company which provided the services and the experience at the best possible price. We are extremely satisfied with the work done to date.  I look forward to employing further consultants if this proves necessary to ensure that the taxpaying public gets value for money from public expenditure in the years to come. This may be the last chance to get this right and it is only by working together that we will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The CCR agreement is a milestone event, crucial not only for the future of the ESB but of critical national significance for the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  Implementation has commenced with 95 per cent of staff who accepted the CCR.  The ESB is continuing to work on a partnership basis with the group of unions to see how the situation with the remaining 5 per cent of staff might be resolved.</P>
      <P>The CCR is costly but it is self-financing and according to the ESB has a pay back period of just over four years. From the year 2000 on wards, the annual gross savings are projected by the ESB at approximately £85 million but some of this will be offset by ongoing annual costs of about £27 million leaving the annual net savings under the CCR at about £58 million per annum.  When I secured Government agreement for a substantial contribution by the State to this unique joint approach, it was conditional on an agreed level of annual savings.</P>
      <P>In requesting the board to implement the CCR right away, I have made clear that the full ongoing annual savings of £58 million must be achieved even though one category has opted out as of now from the benefits of the CCR.  The ESB has assured me of its commitment to seeing that these savings are achieved in full.  This is the responsibility of ESB management and I have every confidence in their ability to deliver on it. The price increase to take effect in 1997 will be conditional on satisfactory implementation of the CCR.</P>

      <P>Costs arise in two ways. There is a voluntary service scheme for those who elect to leave the ESB and there are ongoing payroll costs for those remaining in the company.  In respect of the voluntary service costs, the ESB has estimated that the total cost of this package will be £210 million in present money terms.  In accordance with accounting standards, almost all of this will be provided for in the 1995 accounts.  This figure is made up of £102 million in payments to the superannuation fund in respect of pension liabilities and £108 million for payments to individuals who leave.  These costs work out at approximately £100,000 per person leaving the ESB under the CCR.</P>

      <Col N="22" /> The other costs, concerning primarily the reward package for those remaining in the ESB are made up, in the main, of a 2 per cent reduction in pension contributions by staff, payment of the 6 per cent outstanding category award to about half of ESB employees and lump sum payments to individuals.  These come to an average of £20 million per annum in the first three years and approximately £16.5 million per year thereafter.  These ongoing costs will be accounted for annually in the profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the CCR's costs will be incurred between 1996 and 1999.  Over this period the total cost projected by the ESB amounts to £260 million.  Savings over the same period amount to £250 million.  Thereafter there will be ongoing costs of approximately £27 million against projected savings of £85 million, leaving net annual savings of £58 million per year.  I have been advised by the ESB that the CCR will pay for itself within four and a half years and that thereafter the situation will be positive every year for the ESB.  After seven years the costs will total £350 million but savings will amount to £500 million. According to the ESB, after ten years total costs will come to £435 million but savings over the same period will be £760 million.  The CCR is cost effective and will pay for itself.  It makes good sense to implement it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 226 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's position on the sale of up to 35 per cent of the equity of Telecom Éireann is a strategic alliance with one of the two parties in the process remains unchanged.  It is open to bidders to specify the percentage they wish to purchase and the price and other terms they wish to offer in their <Col N="26" /> final bids.  My Department and the process advisers are continually in contact with, and available to, bidders to assist them in structuring proposals that best suit the interests of bidders, shareholders and the company.</P>
    <P>It is the case that initial bids did not match the Government's expectations. It would be a surprise if they did.  They did, however, form a basis for further discussion in the second phase to improve and strengthen the bids.</P>
    <P>In the second phase there have been extensive discussions with both bidders and a thorough disclosure and due diligence process is being gone through to enable bidders to prepare their final offers.  It is normal for bidders to seek changes in the Government's position and secure an advantage.  Based on experience in other similar processes, changes up to the last minute can be expected in the composition of consortia and content of their proposals. My position must remain flexible within the overall terms of the Government mandate.  It is open to both bidders to fine tune their offers in terms of consortium membership, strategic content, terms of sale and contractual elements to best position themselves to succeed.</P>
    <P>On the question of any company re-entering the process, reports to this effect are entirely speculative.  Any bidder who withdrew from the process prior to the submission of first round bids can re-enter the process, but only as a member of a consortium led by one or other of the two second round bidders. The possibility of submitting separate proposals does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister asked his advisers on this project, Morgan Stanley, to assist one of the bidders to bring British Telecom back into the deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm and reassure the House that the figure mentioned in the media, £300 million, as being the maximum price <Col N="27" /> offered by the two consortia is not acceptable to him on behalf of the nation?  He said in a Sunday interview that the two bids &ldquo;do not match our evaluation of the value of the company&rdquo;. May I take it, therefore, he will not sell it at the give-away knockdown price of £300 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>What I stated was &mdash; I did not specify any amount, the figure mentioned by the Deputy is his own &mdash; that the initial bids did not match the evaluation of the value placed on the company by my Department and the Government.  We did not expect them to.  They were preliminary bids.  We have entered into detailed negotiations and discussions.  I am satisfied that when we reach a conclusion we will be in a position to put to Government a strong proposition in respect of the successful bidder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have argued long and hard over this issue and, probably, disagree fundamentally on it, but I am seriously concerned about what is happening. The Minister is planning to sell one-third of Telecom Eireann either to Teledanmark, the Danish telecommunications company, or a consortium of Swedish and Dutch investors.  We have lost eight bidders and are now down to two.  I gather that both bids are around £300 million although, by any independent assessment, the company is worth about £600 million.  Is this still the right course of action?  Will the Minister call it off at this stage?  I have not had time to check this out, but it is my information that these companies are owned by financial institutions.  The Minister, therefore, is planning to sell one-third of Telecom Éireann to a Dutch and Swedish bank for a knockdown price.  We should debate this matter because what is going on behind closed doors is quite scandalous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Col N="28" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Deputy say we are prepared to sell the company at a knockdown price when we have not reached conclusions?  The negotiations we have entered in a positive and constructive manner are ongoing.  I am pleased we have two strong bidders anxious to align themselves with Telecom Éireann.  This is not, simply, about an equity injection, it is also about placing Telecom Éireann in a position where it will have access to a broad range of modern telecommunications services.  It needs access to the best technology available to sustain it into the future and, above all, ensure that we will have a competitive national telecommunications network.  The best way to do this is by forming a strategic alliance.  I am satisfied we are on target to achieve this objective and look forward to bringing a decision to Government before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister who is about to make a decision on this issue before it is too late.  We have had many rows across the floor, but this is a serious and major mistake.  The Minister said this is not, simply, about money, but about technology.  I do not believe Denmark, Sweden or Holland can offer Telecom Éireann any technology which it does not already have. This is not about bringing technology or access to international markets because Telecom has all that.  The Minister says it is not about money.  It seems we have discovered this is the wrong direction, yet we are sticking with it.</P>
      <P>Ten people started the bidding but it is now down to two.  It looks like this company will end up one third owned, indirectly, by financial institutions; one in Holland and one in Sweden.  I am amazed the left wing parties in Government agreed to sell part of Telecom Éireann to foreign banks, effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister considered that there is about £200 million of Irish pension funds in foreign telecommunications? Irish workers have that amount of money in foreign telecommunications companies outside this State.  Has the <Col N="29" /> Minister considered allowing them to put some of this pension fund money through the Stock Exchange, for example, in one third of Telecom Éireann?  Why is the notice &ldquo;No Irish need apply&rdquo; put up when it comes to shares in Telecom Éireann?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 31 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The revised draft electricity directive circulated by the Commission in February, 1994 provided for a relatively modest degree of liberalisation of the single electricity market.  However, since 1994, and particularly with the advent of the three new member states, there has been a considerable shift of opinion among member states in favour of a much greater degree of liberalisation of the market.  The compromised proposal by the Italian Presidency discussed at the May 1996 Energy Council reflects this shift.  However, a number of member states consider that it does not move sufficiently quickly towards liberalisation whereas only one or two favour a more gradual approach.  The precise extent of market opening provided for in the directive will emerge from negotiations at the extraordinary Energy Council of 19-20 June.</P>
      <P>At the June Council I will put the Irish position that while we favour a planned approach, the Government has acknowledged there has to be market freedom for large electricity consumers to purchase their electricity from whomever they wish.  This will introduce competition for the ESB in this segment of the market for the first time.  I will also be very clear that electricity is a vital industry and we should make changes in a planned and prudent manner.  While further liberalisation is inevitable, we should review the outcome of a first phase before deciding to move on to the next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the May Council I made it clear to my European colleagues that the critical issue for Ireland was a clear commitment to the principle of public service obligations. Agreement has now been reached on this issue.  This deals effectively with my primary concern to prevent cherry picking of the larger more lucrative customers and to ensure that the interests of the smaller consumer are fully protected.  I have also <Col N="33" /> obtained the necessary provisions to ensure that we can continue to generate electricity from indigenous peat thus assuring the future of Bord na Móna and of more than 2,000 jobs in the midlands.</P>
    <P>The draft directive will inevitably have a significant impact on the ESB.  If implemented as the text currently stands, the directive would mean a substantial immediate degree of liberalisation of the Irish market with a progressive widening of the number of customers who will be eligible to contract directly with independent power producers.  My Department estimates that 25 per cent of the ESB's market would immediately be open to competition if the proposal becomes law.</P>
    <P>This will represent a significant opportunity for customers and present a challenge for the ESB.  I expect the introduction of significant levels of competition will bring considerable downward pressure on electricity prices.  I am confident that the ESB is taking the necessary steps to prepare for the challenges that competition will bring.  I see no reason the ESB should not prosper in a new open more liberalised market.  I stress, however, that this makes the full implementation of the CCR now more urgent than ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of the Irish market did the Minister envisage would be opened up to competition under the EU Directive when he devised and agreed to the ESB's proposals for the cost and competitiveness review?  In view of the size of the market that will now be opened up to outside generators of electricity to sell electricity to our large consumers, does the Minister consider that the cost and competitiveness review might prove insufficient to ensure that the ESB will be capable of meeting the level of competition it will now have to face?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to anticipate the outcome of the last Energy Council <Col N="34" /> meeting under the Presidency of the Italians. There is a huge difference between the stance taken by the majority of countries and that taken, for instance, by the Italians, the French and ourselves.  I have already said we envisage a 25 per cent opening, but I cannot say that it can be held at that.  There is a huge lobby within the European Union at the moment to liberalise the market to an even greater extent. Obviously, we have put forward the Irish position in a vociferous and forceful way.  We have a very small system and there are peculiarities which are unique to it.  We have put that view forward.</P>
      <P>In respect of implementing this change when it arises, as recently as late last week I had a meeting with the chairman and chief executive of the ESB.  We have gone through the proposals in detail and have discussed the likely outcome. Arising from those discussions I am quite confident the management of the ESB has the necessary professionalism and skill to ensure that the CCR will put the company in a position to be able to take on whatever degree of competition comes in.  As of now, it is envisaged that will be anything between 25 and 40 per cent.  The Irish position is that it should be gradual and that we should approach it in a prudent fashion. In the negotiations we will attempt to limit it, as near as possible, to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that when the cost and competitiveness review was originally published it was intended to achieve a reduction of 3,000 in the numbers employed in the ESB and savings of £100 million.  None of these target figures was achieved.  The figure for job savings is estimated now at 2,000 and the saving in annual costs is approximately £60 million.  My question has not been answered.  When the cost and competitiveness review was being drawn up, what percentage of the electricity market was it envisaged would be opened up to competition?  Obviously, from what the Minister has said, 1994 <Col N="35" /> brought about a change in the percentage of the market liable to be opened up to competition.  Prior to 1994 the expectation at departmental and ESB level must have been much lower than the current minimum estimate of 25 per cent; it could be as high as 40 per cent. What percentage of the market was expected to be opened up at the time the cost and competitiveness review was being decided upon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The CCR was not formulated at the time of the opening up of the electricity market.  As the Deputy is aware, we engaged in the CCR&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;arising from the independent consultant's report which established that the cost base of the company was running in the region of £100 million per annum in excess of what it should be.  Following prolonged discussions, agreement was reached on the CCR which reduces the cost base by £58 million per annum.  When the CCR is fully implemented, the company will be in a position to compete in a competitive environment, which liberalisation of the market will inevitably mean for the ESB.  I am satisfied the ESB is fully aware that it is crucial for the company to implement the CCR in full, ensure there is downward pressure on an ongoing basis on its cost base and reduce its overheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the ESB will not resort to increasing electricity prices to domestic consumers to compensate for its lack of competitiveness because of its failure to achieve the original targets in the cost and competitiveness review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only can I give that assurance but I have already raised this matter with the company and it has <Col N="36" /> been made clear that under no circumstance will consumers in Ireland be asked to pay for inefficiencies or deficiencies in the company.  The overrun on cost base cannot be allowed to be passed on to householders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may wish to qualify the answer he has just given because I understand the CCR documentation, which the Minister stood over, contains the phrase &ldquo;necessary rebalancing in prices will take place&rdquo;.  Does that mean that if the market opens up and competition is introduced, price increases will transfer from large industry to the ordinary consumer? An evening newspaper yesterday carried the story that we are facing an increase in prices of approximately one-third in the next few years.  Perhaps the Minister might rethink the answer he gave to Deputy Molloy based on his commitment to the CCR process of rebalancing the charges.  I understand that to mean that the rebalancing will be away from large industry in the competitive area to the consumer because the Minister will have to get the money from somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the CCR package that has been brought forward and agreed is cost effective.  It will pay for itself over a four and a half year period and will thereafter result in significant savings to the cost base of the company.  I have given a categoric assurance that a situation will not be allowed to develop whereby the CCR plan will be funded by consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to tariffs, we have already agreed a modest price increase over the next three years which contains an element of rebalancing.  We have already seen the first measures in respect of rebalancing.  It is inevitable that there will be rebalancing in years to come but I cannot anticipate its extent or when it will occur.</P>

    <Col N="37" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his honesty in admitting that rebalancing has only begun, by way of the 2 per cent or 3 per cent on present prices, and it seems that process will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a huge difference between that and 13 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the Government acknowledges that large consumers will be able to buy electricity from whom they wish.  How does he square the circle?  If large consumers can buy from whom they wish, and presuming they buy cheaper imported electricity, if the Minister does not allow any further redundancies in the ESB on a massive scale, it is logical that the ordinary householder will face dramatically increased electricity bills in the next four or five years.  There is no other answer to this problem.  Bills may increase by one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not.  That is speculation.  We are currently restructuring the electricity industry in Ireland. We are allowing for competition and that inevitably reduces prices for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The restructuring was based on a 13 per cent share of the open market but the Minister has admitted the current figure is 25 per cent and that it could rise to 40 per cent.  Will the Minister agree that, having been out-manoeuvred in the EU discussions, he is now placing the ESB in a dilemma? The only effect of, say, a 33 per cent stake on the German market, for instance, would be in relation to heavy industry, but if the market were to open on that basis in Ireland every major industrial and commercial company would be affected by this process.  The inevitability is that we will have to increase prices dramatically to the commercial, industrial and domestic consumer.</P>

    <Col N="38" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been out-manoeuvred; we have been outnumbered at EU level.  There is a major force within the EU seeking liberalisation of the electricity market.  That force is being led by Germany which is seeking a 100 per cent opening up of the market, supported strongly by the Scandinavian countries which are anxious to ensure that the maximum percentage possible is available to open competition. We have clearly stated the Irish position.  That position has developed as a result of an in-depth evaluation of our own system.  We have put that position very forcefully and we will engage in further discussions to finalise this matter at the Energy Council meeting under the Italian Presidency.  I cannot speculate on the outcome of those discussions but there are many pro-liberalisation forces involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the CCR proposals an arrangement was entered into whereby the ESB group of unions accepted the proposals in the CCR and the Minister would sanction phases 2 and 3 of the Poolbeg gas-powered station.  Has the ESB been told it can proceed with the building of the additional phases of Poolbeg?  Has that decision been conveyed formally to the ESB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The CCR involved a tripartite procedure to which the Government made a contribution.  Part of that contribution was a commitment that if the company and its workforce accept the rationalisation, its programme and the necessary structuring, the Government would agree to allow Poolbeg II and III to proceed.  As recently as last week I had discussions with the management of the company in that respect.  I await further documentation from them. As soon as I am satisfied in respect of the information I have sought we will give them permission to proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this in effect was shutting out competition, that the electricity demand will <Col N="39" /> be well met from the increase in generating capacity which has been approved for Poolbeg, that it diminishes the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for building new power stations and that he has sought to pre-empt and delay the opportunities for large companies to benefit from the terms of this directive when it comes fully into effect?</P>
      <P>Is it intended to continue with the ESB as the owner and regulator of the electricity industry?  Are there proposals to ensure that the regulation of the electricity industry is at arm's length from the ESB and the Department and that there is fair competition for anybody who sees an opportunity to come in and build a generating station and import electricity through the North when the interconnector with Scotland is achieved?</P>

      <P>The Irish Energy Centre operates two grant schemes &mdash; the energy audit grant scheme and the energy efficiency investment support scheme.</P>
      <P>The grant-aid consists of European Regional Development Fund moneys made available under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme 1994-1999.  The matching finance is private sector expenditure leveraged out by these grant schemes.</P>
      <P>The total amounts allocated for these schemes under the operational programme is £4 million for the energy audit grant scheme and £9,125,000 for the energy efficiency investment support scheme.</P>
      <P>The energy audit grant scheme was launched in September 1994.  Under this scheme the Irish Energy Centre provides grants of up to 40 per cent, subject to a maximum of £5,000, to energy users in the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors towards the cost of hiring consultants to conduct energy audits and advise on the steps to be taken to improve energy efficiency.  Under the energy audit grant scheme, a total of £304,825 has been sanctioned to date for 178 organisations.  Of this, £173,000 has been paid to 85 organisations.  The amount sanctioned is projected to result in total investment of £760,000.</P>
      <P>The energy efficiency investment support scheme was launched in December 1994, and provides grant assistance to energy users in the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors for investment in energy efficiency technologies. Grants of up to 40 per cent of the cost of the measures are available subject to a maximum of £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme covers the selective implementation of the recommendations of energy audits and provides grant support for investment in targeted energy efficient technologies.  Support for targeted technologies is provided by <Col N="41" /> way of competitive calls for proposals. To date calls for proposals in respect of the following have been issued: building energy management systems for hotels and hospitals; variable speed drives; modular boilers; systems for heat recovery from liquid process streams; combined heat and power; monitoring and targeting systems; good practice in boiler houses.</P>
    <P>Under the energy efficiency investment support scheme, £2,809,153 has been sanctioned for 92 organisations.  Of this, £99,000 has been paid to ten companies. The amount sanctioned is projected to result in total investment of £10 million under the energy efficiency investment support scheme.</P>

These two schemes are a major part of the energy saving programme that we have identified through the Irish Energy Centre.

Surely there is duplication and a lack of co-ordination between the two.</P>

      <P>Although the nuclear industry in the UK is a matter of more obvious concern to the Irish public in view of its proximity and history of incidents, the safety of nuclear power reactors in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union remains the major cause of great environmental concern worldwide.  Recent knowledge about the unsafe nature of 15 Soviet-built Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors still operating in Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania have led to calls for those reactors to be closed down permanently. I support calls for such decisive action.</P>
      <P>Western energy experts have agreed on the measures needed to prevent further accidents at the Chernobyl-type reactors, but this cannot be done effectively without massive international finance. Following the recent nuclear summit of the group of seven highly industrialised countries held in Moscow, I am hopeful that international initiatives will provide a solution for the elimination of these sources of potential further disaster.  First and foremost, the complete closure of Chernobyl is urgent and during our EU Presidency we will progress those measures in the interests of worldwide safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the west's assistance programmes for the reform of the energy <Col N="45" /> sectors of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, Ireland will continue to insist on the highest levels of nuclear safety and radiation protection in the nuclear sector.  Proven efforts to enhance safety and security in the nuclear field must be a precondition of accession to the European Union for countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  During our EU Presidency I will actively pursue these matters.  I expect that Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Nuclear Safety Convention by the end of June and I will be urging all states to accede to the Convention as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will continue to press for the closure and dismantling of all unsafe reactors in Central and Eastern Europe and will seek the necessary financial assistance to make this possible.  Investment in non-nuclear projects, alternative energy, demand side management and energy efficiency should be investigated fully as a replacement for nuclear capacity in a region that has for far too long been dependent on atomic energy.  While I would urge all countries not to choose nuclear power as an energy source we must insist that if they do so, the highest standards are applied in order to protect public health and the environment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister's brief include consideration of nuclear submarines which pose a potential risk in the long-term?  Some people consider they are the greatest threat of an accident in the former Soviet Union.  What is the estimated cost of bringing Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union up to a certain safety standard? The Minister has not mentioned the source of the finance required.  Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the leaked report in one of the Sunday newspapers regarding the dump off Dounreay in Scotland?  Has he raised it with the British Government?  What is his reaction to the suggestion that this dump will be opened up and part of its contents put in the proposed dump at Sellafield?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand submarines are included in the review of all the unsafe installations undertaken by the G7.  I understand the cost of dealing with Chernobyl reactor 4 would cost $10 billion.  That money will have to come from the countries who have the money, i.e. the rich countries.  There are no sources to provide it within the countries who have the problem.  It behoves the industrialised western countries, the rich nations, to provide the funding to eliminate this danger, which is a threat to the whole world.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the media reports about the nuclear waste dump off Dounreay on the north-east coast of Scotland and I am having them investigated urgently with the Scottish authorities. I have also obtained a copy of independent reports on the potential health effects and possible source of radioactivity found at Dounreay undertaken by two UK agencies, the radioactive waste management advisory committee and the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment. The report addresses the possible health implications and putative sources of radioactive particles which have been found in the vicinity of Dounreay nuclear establishment.  According to these reports on investigations into new possible sources of contamination of the Dounreay foreshore, the radioactive waste management advisory committee takes the view that although a single source cannot be unambiguously defined their opinion is that the most likely source for radioactive particles found at Dounreay foreshore is surface contamination, adjacent to the top of the intermediate level waste disposal shaft.  It stresses that other sources cannot be ruled out at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment and the radioactive waste management advisory committee agree that the intermediate level waste disposal shaft at Dounreay is an unacceptable model for the disposal of radioactive waste and recommend that the UK Atomic Energy Agency operating at Dounreay <Col N="47" /> should take steps over a relatively short timescale to propose a solution and a timetable for the treatment of the waste in accordance with modern standards. The radioactive waste management advisory committee was advised that the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Agency would be undertaking a review of options for the waste shaft.  The media reports suggest that a decision has been made to remove existing nuclear waste at Dounreay.  However, I have not yet established the definitive position from the UK authorities.  When I have done so, I will consider what appropriate action is necessary.</P>

      <P>For the past number of years there has been a large influx to this country of children who have been affected by the incident at Chernobyl. Many organisations assist in bringing those children here.  Having spent a number of weeks here, they return in a better state of health.  Will the Minister make some suggestion at EU level in regard to providing proper financial assistance for the many organisations, not only on this island but throughout the EU, who assist in this work?  It is well recognised that the health of children from Belarus and from in and around Chernobyl is much improved as a result of travelling to countries where the air is much better.</P>

Will he accept that unless the Irish Government places due emphasis, particularly during the Presidency, on the NIREX plans and the general ageing nuclear industry close to this island in Britain, other member states will be reluctant to voice concerns?

      <P>The issue of Sellafield and THORP will continue to be a top priority with the Irish Government.  Our position on that matter is clear and we will make it an important part of the agenda for the EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the inception of the political and economic changes in central and east European countries and the former Soviet Union, the European Union has initiated activities to help them upgrade their nuclear reactors and improve their safety culture in all sectors of civilian use of nuclear energy.  The main efforts of the European Union have been made via programmes such as PHARE, Poland-Hungry aid for the restructuring of the economy, and TACIS, technical assistance to the commonwealth of independent states and Georgia. However, a number of other activities are carried out in support of the assistance programme to cover specific issues with a view to long-term co-operation. In many countries of the CEEC-CIS nuclear power stations provide an essential source of electricity and, however unsafe a plant may appear to <Col N="49" /> western eyes or experts, immediate closure may not be a practical option.  In such circumstances, the EU has concentrated on providing technical help and advice to increase awareness of design weaknesses and to improve contingency planning, while not losing sight of the final objective, to close down as soon as possible the more dangerous reactors. The EU initiatives have produced a number of results.  Attitudes are changing at Government level with CEEC-CIS authorities accepting that an independent nuclear safety regulatory authority is an essential element of an effective safety culture.  On site projects have provided EU experts semi-permanently on hand to train local staff which result in a much greater understanding of design flaws and other vital safety issues.  The transfer of knowledge and expertise between the EU and specialised organisations in the CEEC-CIS has led to a new spirit of co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the $10 billion will be furnished to make Chernobyl reasonably safe?  Also, is he satisfied with the openness, transparency and accountability of the information given by the British authorities when asked about accidents or issues connected with its nuclear industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say if the $10 billion will be provided, but the matter will have my full support.  It is essential that richer western nations provide the money to make these nuclear stations safe for the entire world.  We cannot delay any longer.  Chernobyl has been allowed fester half-capped with a piece of concrete for ten years and is leaking dangerously.  A new covering of steel and concrete is essential to seal off reactor four, following which the other 15 reactors in the Ukraine and the former Soviet Union, which are as dangerous as Chernobyl, must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get information from the British authorities on the basis of a relatively old agreement with which I am not satisfied.  I had discussions recently with <Col N="50" /> the British Ambassador on this matter. At present we are told about incidents which involve a release of radioactivity into the atmosphere or sea.  I am not satisfied that is all we should know.  We should be told about all accidents, even if they do not involve a spillage and I have requested that this be done.</P>

      <Quest>if he can assure the public that electricity generated by nuclear power will not be used in Ireland; and if he has informed the British authorities that this is the Irish position and that an electricity interconnector will not be constructed until nuclear power ceases to be used for electricity generating purposes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10879/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy that nuclear power should not be used for the production of electricity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is likely that a common position on the draft Electricity Directive will be reached at an Energy Council in June, before the end of the Italian Presidency. Under the draft Directive, Ireland will retain the right to determine the fuel used in any generating station which is established here.  This empowers the Government to refuse approval for the use of nuclear fuel in any Irish power station.  It remains firm Government policy that the ESB may not purchase nuclear generated electricity at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions for third party access to networks in the draft Directive, large customers will be entitled, if the necessary interconnection capacity exists, to contract directly with generators abroad for electricity.  However, access to nuclear generated electricity is not possible at present as Ireland is not connected to Scotland, England or Wales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are plans, but no final decision for an interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland which, at least in <Col N="51" /> theory, would open the option for large Irish consumers to make contracts with nuclear generators in the UK or mainland Europe.  It is Government policy not to allow nuclear generated electricity into Ireland and we will continue to seek to ensure that the Directive allows us to refuse access to our market for nuclear generated electricity.</P>
    <P>In view of the clear Government policy and very strong Irish public opinion against nuclear power it is extremely unlikely that any large company would contract directly with nuclear power stations.</P>
    <P>With regard to interconnection directly with the UK, studies have shown that while interconnection is technically feasible, such a project would not be economically viable.  In any event, the UK Government is kept well aware of Ireland's strong opposition to nuclear power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reply in so far as I understand him to say that we will not import nuclear generated electricity.  Does that mean an interconnector will not be built or, in the event of one being built, will an arrangement be made whereby electricity will be selectively taken from one generator and not from another?  Is that what the Minister of State is technically arguing or will electricity from the UK not be imported?  From a technical point of view, how can he guarantee that nuclear electricity will not be imported?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy knows more about the matter than I, but I am not aware of any contract in the matter as yet.  There is no possibility of an interconnector being set up between the Irish Republic and the mainland of Britain.  Studies demonstrate that would not be economically feasible because of the size of our power requirement.  In theory, it is possible for a person in the Republic, given the interconnection between Northern Ireland and here and the plans for an interconnection between Northern Ireland and Scotland, to import nuclear powered electricity. There is, however, no practical possibility of that happening now because no interconnector exists.  If such circumstances were to arise it would not be possible to import nuclear radioactive material; it is only electricity that would be imported.  Given the weight of public opinion and Government and Opposition policy on this issue, the pressure on any large purchaser would be such that they would give up their right under the theoretical directive clause to import nuclear powered electricity.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  On proposed legislation, will the Taoiseach say which of the Government's legislative plans will improve the competitiveness of the country?  I am sure he and the Minister for Finance were gravely upset to see that Ireland has been ranked 22nd in the latest world competitiveness list, a fall of six places over the past 18 months.  As a former Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach will be aware that people who invest here in the gilt and <Col N="206" /> bonds markets in the long-term do so on the basis of our ranking on the world competitive list.

Obviously, work has not yet commenced on the drafting of the legislation but I can assure the House the Government and Minister for Justice are giving high priority to the reform of our courts system, which structure effectively has not changed since the 1920s. By the prompt manner in which she brought this matter to a decision point in addition to the prompt way in which she established the Denham Committee, the Minister for Justice is to be <Col N="209" /> complimented on the work she is doing in this area.

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann annuls the regulations made under section 3 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, because (1) they constitute a serious discrimination against the psychiatrically ill as other patients are not singled out for such a limit; (2) the regulations give <Col N="215" /> effect to a reduction of insurance cover for psychiatric patients from 180 days to 100 days a year; and (3) the regulations fail to reflect the actual cost to subscribers of out-patient services.</P>
    <P>It is most unusual for motions to be moved in this House to seek the annualment of regulations.  However, Fianna Fáil felt obliged to move this motion because of the serious implications of the regulations proposed by the Minister for Health.  We moved the motion in accordance with section 3 (3) of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 which makes provision for the Dáil or Seanad to annual regulations within 21 days of the regulations being laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has acknowledged the serious nature of this motion by granting Government time for its debate.  I thank him for that and I appeal to Members on his side of the House to give this debate full consideration. Acceptance of this motion does not mean that the health insurance system will collapse overnight.  It will only mean that the unsatisfactory regulations will be renegotiated and improved.</P>
    <P>While there are many reasons for bringing forward this motion, Fianna Fáil's overriding reason is that the regulations represent a discrimination against people with psychiatric illnesses. Every health policy document brought forward by Government over the past 40 years has had, as a fundamental principle, the integration of the psychiatric and general medical services.  The Department of Health has stated this principle in many reports on psychiatric care.  However, these regulations turn back the clock.  They single out psychiatric patients for a 45 per cent cut in the in-patient day care they can avail of. People with general medical disorders are not subject to such a limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making a distinction between psychiatric disorders and general medical disorders.  Does he not acknowledge that a recurring depressive <Col N="216" /> illness is just as biological or medical as diabetes?  Yet the Minister believes they require different insurance cover.  Does he believe that somehow those suffering from psychiatric illnesses are at fault for being ill?  It is bad enough that insurance companies discriminate against people with psychiatric illnesses but it is the Minister for Health and the Government that is enacting this discrimination.</P>
    <P>What is the view of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on these regulations?  While he is bringing forward equal status legislation his colleague, the Minister for Health, is enacting discrimination.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, enormous effort has been put into bringing mental illness into the main body of illnesses. Even the United States has now moved to the position of treating psychiatric illnesses on an equal footing with other illnesses. These regulations will set us back a step and are regrettable, especially at a time when depression is the most common illness in the world.</P>
    <P>The regulations set us on a slippery slope in relation to cover for illnesses. Not long ago, psychiatric patients were entitled to one year's cover.  Then this was reduced to 180 days.  The result of these regulations will be to cut that 180 days to 100 days or to reduce cover by 45 per cent.  While the Minister will no doubt argue that all he has introduced are minimum standards and that Fianna Fáil is exaggerating in saying the 100-day limit will become the norm, everybody in this House and outside it knows that insurance companies will provide only what they must.  The level of cover will be reduced to 100 days before we know it.</P>
    <P>Most purchasers of health insurance will not be looking carefully at the psychiatric provisions of health insurance policies.  They hope they will never need them.  This will not be the point on which competition in the health insurance market turns. However, those who will need them will quickly find that only 100 days cover will be offered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> I understand the Minister is already considering amendments to the regulations to provide an additional 20 day-patient days in respect of psychiatric treatment and care.  Is the Minister already regretting these changes proposed in the regulations?  If he is considering changing them even before they are enacted, that shows some element of concern on his part.  If the additional 20 days materialise, the Minister will have to further amend these regulations once this is concluded.  I welcome any improvement but any continuing difference between psychiatric and general insurance cover represents discrimination and means the regulations will still be flawed.  As he plans to amend these regulations, and that the matter will again have to come before the House, why not postpone it until after a full examination of the consequences? When the Minister spoke about these regulations in the past he implied the European Commission was calling the tune and forcing him to accept these regulations.  Many have been left with the impression that in Brussels the Minister negotiated the number of days cover from 40 to 100.  I heard that the Minister accepted congratulations on such a fine negotiating job and on showing the EU his muscle. It is my information that the only body with whom the Minister negotiated was his own Department.  The Minister has misrepresented the role of the European Commission in this regulations débâcle.  The commission's only role was to adjudicate on whether the Government had the right to introduce regulations under certain directives.  The EU did not comment on the detail of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Why was the 40 days figure put forward? Was the Minister keeping it low so that he would claim later to have raised it, or had he misjudged the reaction to the 40-day proposals and had to start again?  It is important that Members of this House object to this 100-day limit; eventually the Minister may see the folly of his proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health did not work with the groups representing patients in regard to these regulations.  The level of consultation was very poor to start, but improved. However, the groups remain dissatisfied with the regulations.  Aware, the group working to fight depression, has written to all Deputies in this House pointing out that the enactment of these regulations will mean that Ireland is the only country in the European Union which specifically discriminates against psychiatric patients in respect of health insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by the Minister's party of a letter written by Dr. Anthony Clare, the medical director of St. Patrick's Hospital, about the regulations. However, Members have quoted very selectively from that letter. In paragraph three of the letter, Dr. Clare writes:</P>
    <P>The representatives of both St. Patrick's and St. John of God's Hospitals regret that the minimum cover guaranteed under the regulations is not the 180 days as provided for by the VHI and we have expressed our views to the Minister. We regret the introduction of a disparity between the cover provided for physical as against psychiatric disorders.</P>
    <P>There is another area in relation to these regulations where the Minister has been economical with the truth.  This is in relation to the impact of the regulations. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, suggested in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me on 18 April last that 92 per cent of psychiatric discharges from private hospitals occurred within three months.  He used this statistic to try to imply, first, that he knows how many patients will be affected by this reduction in the level of in-patient care and, second, that the vast bulk of discharges will be within the 100 day limit. However, if one examines the statistics carefully, one finds that the figures apply only to perhaps the first time in a particular year that a patient might have <Col N="219" /> been in a psychiatric hospital.  The statistic does not take account of patients who have more than one admission per year.  Therefore, the Minister does not know how many patients will be affected by these cuts.  It is not 8 per cent.  Given the nature of psychiatric illness, it is probably much higher.  For the Minister to use a statistic in this fashion in answer to a parliamentary question was misleading in the extreme.</P>
    <P>The change in the level of minimum cover will put pressure on doctors and other professionals working in the psychiatric services in relation to discharges. Doctors may feel under pressure to discharge the patient quickly given the new limits.  This practice, regrettably, already exists in physical health care.  In psychiatric care, we have already seen one court case over this matter of discharges.  A few months ago, the North-Western Health Board was prosecuted by a family who felt their father had been discharged prematurely from a public psychiatric hospital.  The man suffered from depression and committed suicide a number of days after being discharged.  I am concerned that under these new regulations, pressure will come on these providing private health care to discharge people from hospital.  Doctors could find themselves in a very difficult position if they feel that their clinical judgment could end in a court case.  I would be worried that this is a first step on the road to precertification, that is where a doctor must get permission before a patient is admitted to hospital.  I would like the Minister to give a specific assurance in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>As well as the legal implications, there could also be serious repercussions for the public psychiatric services with these regulations.  If a patient is at his or her 100 day limit or near to it, and a doctor in a private facility deems they require further care, the person may be referred to public psychiatric care.  No provision has been made by the Department of Health to cater for the overflow of patients into the <Col N="220" /> public health care service in the likely event of the development of such a scenario.</P>
    <P>Those likely to be disadvantaged by these regulations include patients who suffer from episodes of manic depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, psychiatric disorders which are associated with physical disease and psychiatric disorders associated with ageing, for example Alzheimer's disease, conditions which usually require long-term care.  If these regulations are enacted, professionals treating patients will not just be under pressure to make discharges, they could also be expected to deliver short-term treatments.</P>
    <P>There is another area where Fianna Fáil has major concern about the health insurance regulations.  This relates to the provisions for out-patient benefits in the regulations which go against what good insurance should be about.  The regulations as they stand put the subscriber to health insurance at risk, not the insurer.  The provisions for outpatients are anti-consumer and should not be enshrined in law.  The out-patient regulations are in conflict with the discussion paper prepared by the Department of Health in 1994 on the Health Insurance Regulatory Framework which recommended that the regulations should reflect the actual cost of procedures. Why was there such a shift between the discussion paper and the draft regulations?  What changed the Department's position?  Was it the fact that a new Minister arrived in the Department at the end of 1994?  There are many areas where the regulations fall down.  For example, in the out-patient provisions, a person can claim only for costs over £150 and under £650 in relation to services specified.  For families, the thresholds are over £300 and under £1,300.  These figures seem fine, but on closer examination one discovers that for each procedure, patients can only claim small amounts of the actual cost, in most cases, only half the cost of the procedure.  This is allowed in the regulations which the Minister is trying to enact.  This means, effectively, that <Col N="221" /> one would have to undergo a huge number of procedures before being eligible even to claim.  Even when a claim is allowed, the amount that can be recouped is pathetic.  Here is an example.  A woman who had a sports injury to her elbow visited a general practitioner twice, a consultant once and then had to go for ten sessions of physiotherapy. The cost of the GP was £30 for the two visits; the VHI allowed £10 per visit to the GP &mdash; this is better than the regulations which do not allow anything for GPs.  The VHI allowed only £30 of the consultant's bill of £50 and only a small amount for each visit to the physio-therapist &mdash; of physiotherapist's the bill of £239, only £120 was allowed by the VHI.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where treatment is on an out-patient basis.  These include some breast cancer cases, some hepatitis cases, control of high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, rehabilitation after strokes, heart attacks, etc.  The mechanisms proposed in these regulations for out-patient costs ignore the actual cost of the procedures to the subscriber.  The annual cost of out-patient care is, therefore, wrongly calculated on fictitious or national costs of items of care.  This is not what good insurance should be about.  In general insurance, the purpose is to provide protection against unexpected costs.  Subscribers to health insurance expect at least that statutory regulations safeguard this principle for them.  The regulations now proposed do not constitute an insurance arrangement formulated in the interests of the subscribing public. They leave the subscriber with an open-ended liability at the level of each service and at the level of the annual total. There is no direct relationship with risk experienced by the subscriber.  As proposed in the regulations, the insurer is fully protected from risk and the subscriber is fully exposed.  This is surely an inversion of the principle of insurance.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements should be considered for these regulations.  On the psychiatric side, the Minister should <Col N="222" /> work with Aware to see how the 180-day provisions can be reinstated.  The Minister should consider not making any distinction between psychiatric and other illnesses and should just refer to health care.  He should also consider the Aware proposal that all patients be given a certain level of financial indemnity per annum by health insurers, and whether this is expended on medical or psychiatric illnesses need not arise as a discriminatory issue.  The out-patient provisions must be completely over-hauled. The regulations must reflect actual expenditure.  The minimum threshold for benefit to kick in must be calculated on the basis of actual costs.  The maximum amount for benefit needs to be seriously lifted.  The cost provided for in the regulations should be index-linked and should rise by a percentage each year to reflect actual health costs.</P>
    <P>One of my constant concerns about the health area is that the consumer rarely features in the formulation of regulations or in discussions about how services are delivered.  Consumers are not directly represented on health boards.  Consumers were never consulted on the formulation of these health insurance regulations.  Will the Minister bear the consumer in mind when drawing up regulations and making provision for disputes about health care policies?  Will he clarify if the insurance ombudsperson will have a role in relation to these regulations and how health insurance contracts operate? It would be a major step forward if the consumer was given priority in health matters.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister has absented himself once again when a sensitive issue of health is being discussed in this Chamber.  I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, a member of the Labour Party has been sent in as he was during the hepatitis-C and Blood Transfusion Service Board debate to comment on behalf of the Department. That raises its own suspicions.</P>

      <P>The regulations the Minister has formulated offer those who are psychiatrically ill a better deal than is available in many other EU countries but it is still discriminatory. It is worthwhile considering whether a patient may at some time take a case to test whether the Irish Government is behaving in accordance with the Irish Constitution in discriminating against psychiatric as opposed to medical illness.</P>

      <P>I listened intently to the case put by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and agreed with everything she said.</P>
      <P>I welcome the entry to the Irish market of a second health insurer because among other things it provides competition. In normal circumstances competition is welcome.  It is said that competition is a healthy thing but ironically the introduction of the regulations to put competition in place has not been healthy for psychiatric patients.  That is the reason for today's debate.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister for Health, who is not present, has already substantially improved the level of cover from 40 days to 100 days since the regulations were first mentioned in the other House, but simply put, that is not enough.  The question of discrimination which is the key point at issue in this debate and the bone of contention still remains to be addressed.  I request the Minister of State to talk to the Minister for Health and ensure that the 180 days cover for psychiatric patients be reinstated and that psychiatric patients in this country be treated in the same way as patients suffering from any other illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a truly backward step in every sense of the word to seek at this point in our development of public health policy to discriminate in this fashion between psychiatric patients and patients suffering from every other illness. I would have thought that was the <Col N="224" /> mentality of the 19th century, such approach is inexplicable at the tail end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>In fairness, I accept that in negotiating the regulations with the EU Commission the Minister did seek to protect our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  All of these aspects of health care are fundamentally important to all of us.  I accept and commend the Minister for seeking to protect that system and maintain it in a newly emerging situation.</P>
    <P>The discrimination is totally unacceptable.  Is it not ironic at a time when another Minister is seeking to put in place equal status legislation, the purpose of which is to guarantee equal treatment in the provision of goods and services, and has promised to bring that into this House &mdash; though we do not know when &mdash; that another Minister is seeking to enshrine in law regulations that would have the opposite effect and would fly in the face of equality?  This raises the question of whether there is coherence or cohesion on matters between Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>I have a grave fear that if the Minister fails to reverse the decision that is under examination today, we will emerge with a two-tier health system.  In the formulation of public health policy the Government has striven might and main to move away from a two-tier health system. We have sought to put in place a system that would give integration to patients of all kinds, whatever the nature of their illness and not try to create divisions between patients with psychiatric illness and those with other types of illness.  It seems as if that trend will be reversed if these regulations are to be adopted and I see that as a major backward step, psychologically and morally as well as every other way. Inevitably, if these regulations are adopted many psychiatric patients who opt for private care and take out insurance provision for it, will be forced on to the public health service.  Will that be a good thing?  The public health service is already overloaded and there are waiting lists for all of the most essential <Col N="225" /> and basic services.  Is it in the overall interests of health policy to adopt regulations that would inevitably force hitherto private patients and patients who have the potential to continue to be private patients onto the public health service?  If that is to be the result, we will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>It might not be a bad time to have a broader discussion on how we deal with psychiatric patients generally.  When institutional care was dismantled in other countries and there was a prospect of putting a network of community care provisions in place in the community, it was never made to happen on the scale on which it ought to have happened. Some 20 years ago I saw people who had been discharged from institutions sleeping in the public parks and subways of New York because there was no proper alternative system of community care for them.  That is the way some cultures and societies treat their mentally ill.  I hope we will not go down that road but I have grave fears that we will.  We have not put in place a proper network of community care for people who had been in institutions 20 or even ten years ago.  We must guard against exacerbating that problem.</P>
    <P>We must be careful not to adopt regulations which will have the effect of pushing psychiatrically ill people who would otherwise be insured and given private care, back into the public health service.  This may well be the result.  The people we are talking about are among the most vulnerable in our society.  They have the most brittle health, are sometimes greatly at risk and have a poor quality of life.  Many of these patients and their families have contacted many politicians.  The families have been disturbed, distressed and fearful at the prospect of this legislation being passed.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty in trying, on the one hand, to protect our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover and, on the other, to regulate the activities of health insurance companies.  I understand this is a difficult challenge and task.  However, it is possible to do both <Col N="226" /> without discriminating against any specific group of vulnerable people in our community, such as psychiatric patients. I appeal to the Minister of State to speak to the Minister for Health about this issue and to seek to amend the regulation and put in place equality of cover for psychiatric and other patients. We should not introduce into our health system the kind of discrimination which would inevitably ensue if the regulation is adopted.</P>

      <P>I was touched by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's concern for my welfare.  The Minister for Health was available last week to debate this issue but, because of the adjournment of the House, this opportunity was lost.  He is unavoidably absent today on official business.</P>
      <P>The health insurance regulations constitute a new and significant protection for the general public.  The motion before the House is a far-reaching one and it is therefore crucial to understand the broad context within which we come to be considering the regulation of the business of health insurance here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country's regulatory structure for health insurance was devised in the context of the measures adopted by the European Union to create a Single Market in insurance through its Third Non-Life Insurance Directive.  The central thrust and purpose of the directive is to bring about a free and competitive market. While it contains certain provisions particular to private health insurance, it is not a health services directive but relates to non-life insurance services generally.  We must take a realistic approach to its implementation in terms of measures to admit competition to our <Col N="227" /> market.  It was not, therefore, open to the Minister, in devising such extensive and complex regulations, to take the exclusively domestic view of the measures which the proposers of the motion have taken.</P>
    <P>The regulations were signed by the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 March.  In that context, the decision announced on 22 April by the major international health insurer, BUPA, to enter the market is seen as vital and positive development. Since publication of the regulations, the Department of Health has had inquiries from, or discussion with, other insurance undertakings interested in exploring opportunities in the Irish private health insurance business. Therefore, the prospect exists of further undertakings deciding to make available services in our market on the basis set down in the regulations.  Annulling the regulations would mean creating uncertainty both for insurers already committed to the market as well as those who may be considering entering it.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances the directive allows for the adoption and maintenance of specific legal provisions by a member state which protect the common good.  Through the efforts of the Minister and his officials, the EU Commission has accepted, in principle, this country's entitlement to regulate the private health insurance market.  This involved considerable effort and persuasion and took place against the background of foreign insurance interests representing a contrary view to the Commission.  However, the Commission will wish to see competition emerging in the market here and a genuinely competitive environment created in Ireland. It is critical that the regulations we are discussing today do not present a serious obstacle to trade.  It is important, therefore, to understand that there is a very fundamental international business dimension to our private health insurance framework and that any belief that we can do exactly as we please, once the Commission accepted our <Col N="228" /> entitlement to regulate the market, is absolutely misguided and dangerous.</P>
    <P>Our system of private health insurance which is now almost 40 years in operation, was installed by the then Minister for Health, Mr. T.F. O'Higgins. His initiative and vision is to be commended as it led to the creation of a system which has served the Irish people so well for decades and which has gone from strength to strength in terms of the high percentage of the population covered against the unforeseen costs of serious injury or illness. That legacy is greatly valued and the Government will ensure it is properly safeguarded and developed.</P>
    <P>The regulations include a statutorily guaranteed minimum level of cover in respect of a variety of hospital and consultant in-patient, day-patient and out-patient services.  Overall, the regulatory framework provides a high degree of protection to the members of the public in the context of the opening up of our private health insurance market to competition. One of the problems which consumers can face is the small print of their insurance contracts where they are not fully aware of what cover or exclusions apply.  The minimum benefit regulations require, on a statutory basis, insurers to sell a core level of services as a minimum.  This will be of great benefit to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The motion claims, <i>inter alia,</i> that the regulatory framework constitutes serious discrimination against the psychiatrically ill and gives effect to a reduction in insurance cover for psychiatric patients from 180 days to 100 days a year.  In view of this, it is instructive to look at what the market has provided up to recently as a statutory entitlement to privately insured persons suffering from milk illnesses.  The answer is nothing; the market was not obliged in the past to provide for such cover on a statutory basis.  Until the regulations were brought into being, insured persons were entirely reliant on the customary practices of the VHI as the country's sole provider of private health insurance to the general public in a <Col N="229" /> restricted market.  No reduction in VHI cover for psychiatric in-patient treatment can be made without the agreement of the Minister under section 2 of the VHI (Amendment) Act, 1996, and he wishes the House to know that, unless there are clear and compelling reasons to do so, he will not agree to any such reduction.</P>
    <P>Other insurers in the market provide indemnity cover within specific work-employee groups.  I refer to the schemes operated by the ESB, prison officers and the Garda who, between them, have about 80,000 lives covered.  Under these schemes varying insurance practices in relation to psychiatric benefit already exist and involve periods of indemnity below a minimum of 100 days in a year.</P>
    <P>It is the general practice of major British insurers to limit and-or extensively qualify their exposure to liability for psychiatric in-patient benefit under their respective policies.  Psychiatric benefit is not a common feature of UK health insurance and most insurers there do not cover it as part of their &ldquo;budget&rdquo; policies, the type of cover nearest to minimum benefit.  Where insurers provide cover of this kind they heavily qualify it by measures such as specific pre-authorisation of hospital admissions, length of stay and exclusion of chronic disorders.</P>
    <P>The period of 100 days provided for in respect of the guaranteed minimum level of indemnity under the regulations is not only reasonable, but substantial in the context of our market being opened up to competition.  In addition, the Minister has given a commitment that the regulations will provide for a minimum entitlement to 20 day-patient days' services in respect of psychiatric treatment and care.  Officials of the Department of Health have already begun the consultative process in this regard.  The Minister was pleased to be able to respond positively to the concerns expressed by interested parties in the extensive consultations held prior to signing the regulations. He met the authorities of the country's two major private psychiatric <Col N="230" /> hospitals prior to finalising the regulations and was pleased to obtain their acceptance of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The 100 days minimum covers the vast majority of admissions in psychiatric hospitals.  The Health Research Board's 1994 report on the activities of Irish psychiatric hospitals and units provides statistical information on discharges and lengths of stay in private psychiatric hospitals.  Of a total of 4,209 discharges in that year, 3,871, or 92 per cent, occurred within three months.  The major private psychiatric hospitals, which are the service providers, have agreed that the measures contained in the regulations represent a significant protection for the general public in the context of a competitive private market. In addition, there will be the minimum cover for day-patient services which I have already mentioned.  Where circumstances arise in which an insured person requires treatment in excess of 100 days, later to be increased to 120 days, in a year and the insurance contract does not cater for this, it is open to him or her to avail of care in public psychiatric hospitals and public community-based facilities.  Accordingly, persons who use up their insurance cover will have access to psychiatric care in the same manner as the majority of the population.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health is not aware of any other case, internationally, where providers of private health insurance contract to make available cover for a period of 100 days psychiatric in-patient services without pre-certification and in an environment in which the entire population is eligible for treatment under the public psychiatric service.  While the laws of some American states require that insurance companies provide, or offer, minimum mental health benefits, as far as the Department of Health is aware, in-patient hospital coverage range from 60 days per year to a more typical 30 days per year.  Furthermore, the American system is firmly rooted in the delivery of services through managed care which does not allow unqualified access to services which is provided for under our <Col N="231" /> system.  Given the totally new context within which our private health insurance market is obliged to operate under our responsibilities as a member of the European Union it is considered that the safeguards enshrined in our regulations relating to a generally applicable minimum period of entitlement to indemnity against the cost of psychiatric illness do not constitute discrimination.</P>
    <P>The concerns raised about the original proposals regarding the minimum period for treatment relating to alcohol, drug and other substance abuse have been met in the regulations.  The original proposal has been enhanced from 40 days in a lifetime to 91 days in any continuous period of five years.</P>
    <P>It is also contended in the motion that the regulations fail to reflect the cost of out-patient services to subscribers.  This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the regulations.  The regulations concerned are those relating to minimum benefits.  They are concerned with core hospital and consultant services for which all insurers must cater, up to, at least the level of indemnity specified, in any policies they wish to sell in our market.</P>
    <P>The regulations relate out-patient services to hospital and consultant activities which are appropriate to the package of measures involved.  These are not intended to prescribe every health service offered to the public by an insurance company.  Any attempt to do this under regulation would constitute a completely disproportionate restriction on the freedom of insurers entering the market in terms of their scope for policy design.  The information available to the Department of Health is that budget plans, the plans that most closely resemble the minimum benefit provisions, offered by some overseas insurers exclude out-patient consultations and treatment; others cover out-patient costs only where they are linked to a course of in-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide for excesses and maximum payments to operate in <Col N="232" /> respect of a specified range of out-patient services.  It is a matter for individual insurers to determine under their policy conditions whether these will relate to actual or eligible expenditure.  The advantages of specific packages, as against the equivalent products of competitors, will no doubt be promoted by insurers as part of their normal commercial interaction and allow the discerning purchaser of cover to decide which company's policies offer the best deal.  To suggest that we should go beyond the existing minimum provisions is to seek to limit, by use of legal compulsion, the flexibility of insurers to negotiate arrangements with providers.  Once again, it is important to bear in mind that the rates specified in the regulations are a &ldquo;base line&rdquo; below which an insurer is prohibited from operating.  It should also be appreciated that rates can be changed over time, but only in the context of constituting an appropriate minimum benefit.  The regulations are not a vehicle to strike rates of payment for practitioners which should be negotiated between them and the insurers as part of the normal operation of the market.  The interests of purchasers of health insurance will not be served by statutory minimum provisions that are inflationary.</P>
    <P>The regulations do not put &ldquo;a 100 day limit&rdquo; on benefit for psychiatric in-patient services.  On the contrary, they provide, for the first time, a statutory guarantee to a period of not less than 100 days' minimum indemnity cover. They do not give effect to a reduction of insurance cover for psychiatric patients from 180 to 100 days.  They are appropriate as regards the provisions relating to core hospital out-patient services specified and do not constitute an inordinate and unsustainable interference in the free operation of the market.  They apply equally to all purchasers of private health insurance in terms of the risk exposure which all insurers must bear, as a minimum, under the policies they sell here and they are not discriminatory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> The Minister is aware that the principle of inter-generational solidarity which underpins community rating may not sit easily with some interests who see advantage in other narrowly focused arrangements being made.  He wishes to make it clear that any move which would threaten or undermine the core value of community rating will be met decisively either by use of existing laws and regulations or, if necessary, under new legislation.  Community rating has served the people too well over a long time to allow any interference with it to be tolerated.</P>
    <P>For the reasons stated, the motion is mistaken in its contentions and should be rejected on the grounds that the health insurance regulations meet our obligation to provide for competition; safeguard our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover; and constitute a significant protection to the general public in an open competitive market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on moving the motion to annual these regulations. I congratulate her and Deputy Quill on their contributions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is a reasonable man and his speech was couched in reasonable language.  He said &ldquo;the regulations do not put a 100 day limit on benefit for psychiatric in-patient services&rdquo;. That is correct but having regard to a free, open and competitive market, the reality is that those insurance companies which the Minister is now introducing measures to regulate, will only prescribe the statutory minimum requirement of 100 days.  They do not provide such psychiatric cover in most other European countries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent announcement by BUPA and I am sure others will follow. When new entrants launch their products on the Irish market there is no question but that they will commence with 180 day psychiatric cover as does the VHI under our law.  The VHI has given commendable medical and psychiatric cover to the public for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> This is the first attempt to introduce second class insurance cover which will be available to the public once the people with whom the Minister is negotiating come into the Irish market and start selling their products.  That will immediately force the VHI, which is already under severe financial pressure, to bring in comparative competing products.  Who will suffer but the public?</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statistics on the number of people admitted to and discharged from psychiatric hospitals, 92 per cent of admissions are discharged within three months, that is either within 90 or 93 days which is very near the threshold.  At least 8 per cent of people admitted are hospitalised for more than three months.  That 8 per cent could be affected in future by having to resort to their own private resources or, alternatively, by having to be transferred to public psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>Of the 4,209 discharged that year, were 3,871, or 92 per cent, discharged within three months?  Is the Minister taking into account that in the treatment of psychiatric conditions people are called back for in-patient treatment whereas when a person is discharged after a medical ailment, invariably, one is not called back?  The very nature of the treatment of psychiatric illness involves one going into hospital, staying there for a certain period, being discharged home for therapeutic purposes and coming back for further in-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should check the figure of 92 per cent.  It may not show us the full picture.  Given the cumulative number of days people have to spend in private psychiatric hospitals, those statistics are misleading.  The treatment of these illnesses can take many years.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I am aware of one family that suffered the untimely death of a parent.  The family comprised young children who might not have appreciated the implications at that time for their health.  Many years later, however, it was found that the cause of death was a chemical imbalance which <Col N="235" /> results in depressive psychiatric-type conditions requiring prolonged treatment.</P>

      <P>Táimid go deas, táimid go h-an dheas agus tá mé ag tréaslú leat as an ocáid stairiúil seo a thabhairt dúinn.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and the Minister of State said the first sensible things about these regulations that I have heard for a long time.  That included much of what was in the correspondence that I, like other Members of the House, received from people who are very concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago it was seriously proposed to us that whatever the Minister introduced in these regulations would become not only the minimum <Col N="236" /> but also the maximum.  That is patently absurd.  Opposition Members spoke about a free and open market for health insurance but they should realise what a market is.  If insurers find there is a market for a health insurance product that provides more cover than the statutory minimum, provided now for the first time, they will offer it.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite know perfectly well, as I do, that has always been the case for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which produced plans to meet the needs of different segments and different pockets in the market.  That will continue to be the case.  Other insurers who come in here under the regulations providing for competition will also do that.  For anybody to pretend that the provisions for a minimum in these regulations will, effectively, become the maximum is unfounded, absurd and does not deserve air time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State clearly pointed out that if these types of regulations were not made, there would be a danger of inferior health insurance products being offered.  I am delighted to hear, incidentally, that the Minister for Health sees no reason he should agree to any reduction in the level of cover provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I hope that will continue to be the case.  It is a sensible stand to take.  It would be anti-competitive to require everybody else to provide that level of cover statutorily.  The statutory minima inserted into these regulations will meet the vast majority of cases.  If health insurers find a market for a greater level of cover, we can be sure they will introduce products aimed at those segments of the market.</P>
    <P>I am glad that as a result of his discussions over the summer, the Minister for Health reached agreement with the two major psychiatric hospitals on what is now being provided.  To those who are worried by this we should say loudly and clearly that the Minister, using to the full his powers under the framework of European Union competition legislation, has set out to make sure that the baseline being offered by any insurer <Col N="237" /> who comes into the market is a reasonable one.  The Minister is also using his powers of persuasion to ensure that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board continues to offer cover at current levels which have shown their worth for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment our spokesperson on Health, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for calling for the annulment of these regulations which contain an element of discrimination. We treat all our citizens equally but in this instance psychiatric patients are not receiving equal treatment.</P>
      <P>Initially the Minister's regulations provided for 40 days psychiatric cover, that was extended to 100 days and he then introduced the outpatient care service. That clearly demonstrates that the Minister is not happy with the regulations or, perhaps, it is the case that people outside his Department are informing him that all is not well with them.  It is important, therefore, to re-examine the regulations, to see if they can be modified and improved.  I have no doubt that following this debate the Minister will be in a position to do that.</P>
      <P>We are advised the Minister was forced by the EU to opt for the 100 days provision but I understand the EU did not demand any specific regulations; it merely wanted to ensure there was competition here in regard to health insurance.  This suggestion came from the Department because there was not any requirement on the Minister to introduce the 100 days cover regulation.</P>
      <P>Psychiatric illness is different from other health complaints.  We all know it may take longer for patients to recover from a psychiatric illness.  Such patients often have a recurrence of problems in the same year as has been referred to by some speakers.  It is important, therefore, to have the 180 days provision as a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister commented on the two psychiatric hospitals in Dublin &mdash; St. John of God's and St. Patrick's &mdash; and said they were satisfied with the 100 days provision.  If the Minister reads <Col N="238" /> carefully what they said he would see they are not entirely happy with the provision. They were forced to compromise with the Minister.  The organisation Aware, which provides counselling for people who are depressed, has stated it is not happy with the 100 days regulation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is different from other countries. The regulations in some European jurisdictions provide only 40 or 50 days' cover.  Ireland is special and cares for its people in a different way, particularly those who are suffering from a psychiatric illness.  We have a good standard of medical care and have often led Europe in that regard.  We should set the standard also in regard to psychiatric treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned other health insurance providers such as those granting cover to the Garda, the ESB staff and others.  It must be remembered, however, that before a person is recruited into the Garda or employed by the ESB, one's physical and mental health record is scrutinised.  The argument made by the Minister in this regard does not stand up because he is referring to a select group.  When we talk about care for psychiatric patients we mean the total population; we are not being selective in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on tabling this motion to annual these regulations. Deputy Dukes made great play of the fact that Government time was provided for the debate on this motion but I suggest the Government should go the whole way and accept the motion.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to discrimination in regard to these regulations. There is discrimination in regard to psychiatric patients in that general medical patients are covered for 180 days while patients suffering from a psychiatric disorder will be covered only for 100 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the voluntary groups working with psychiatric patients such as Aware, which is doing excellent work with people suffering from depression, <Col N="239" /> have drawn attention to the fact that Ireland differs from other member states in insurance cover for psychiatric patients.  The Minister stated that 92 per cent of patients are discharged within three months of being admitted to hospital.  If that is so and patients are not readmitted in the same year, there should not be a major cost implication in covering the remaining 8 per cent of patients hospitalised for periods longer than three months.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to EU regulations on a free insurance market.  In this case, however, the EU gave the Irish authorities the right to regulate their own insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, said that uncertainty will be created if these regulations are annulled, but uncertainty exists because psychiatric patients are being treated differently from general medical patients.  The Minister has already changed his mind on the regulations and that causes further uncertainty.  If psychiatric patients were treated in a similar manner to general medical patients the uncertainty that exists would be removed.</P>
    <P>The VHI has served people well.  I do not understand the reason the Irish Hospital Consultants Association constantly demand competition.  The VHI, an efficient organisation, has served this country well for the past 40 years.  It must be remembered that the market in Ireland is small &mdash; 1.2 million people &mdash; compared to other European countries, and if one takes account of the cost of maintenance, which cannot change to any major degree, the cost of medical fees, which is unlikely to change, and the cost of administration, which is low by international standards, the VHI has done an excellent job.</P>
    <P>The VHI should introduce schemes to suit our people; we should not be led by what happens in other countries.  The VHI should be concerned with what the people need.  I accept it should not operate schemes that do not pay their <Col N="240" /> way, such as the one it operated before I became Minister for Health under which a sick person could pay £120 to the VHI and draw £336 per year for the remainder of his or her life.  I do not expect the VHI to operate such schemes but it should provide cover not only for psychiatric patients but for the elderly in long-stay institutions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the points raised by my colleagues, Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn, Moffatt and Hughes.  The Government should go all the way on this occasion, annual these regulations and bring in new regulations which will eliminate the discrimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed by our spokesperson to which the Minister in reply said there would be a great uncertainty if these regulations were not passed.  That of course is the usual bullying approach of a Minister. There need not be uncertainty.  Regulations could be introduced tomorrow to provide for 180 days, there would not be a difficulty in doing that.  The regulations are very easy to draw up; it is only a question of replacing &ldquo;100&rdquo; with &ldquo;180&rdquo;.  In any event the Minister knows that any uncertainty can be dealt with instantly.  It is misleading the public in general to say there would be great uncertainty because there would not.  It can be dealt with in the House and the Minister can deal with it in regulations very swiftly.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that some 92 per cent of psychiatric in-patients are discharged within a three month period. Again, as was pointed out to the Minister, this does not include or take account of people who have more than one admission per year.  It would appear that the statistics offered are slightly misleading.  It is important that the figures used in an instance like this are accurate, clear and fair because what is being done, for whatever reason, introduces inequity and inequality between psychiatric and general patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years we have struggled very hard to bring about an equality of treatment between psychiatric and general <Col N="241" /> patients, even to the extent of having treatment in our major new general hospitals for psychiatric patients.  All the work over the years has been directed at normalising the treatment provided for psychiatric patients and equating it with that provided for general patients in our hospitals.  This has been a successful programme.  Indeed, a great deal of work, in which Deputy O'Hanlon participated, has been done in developing our community based services.  None of this will stop.</P>
    <P>We should continue the current development of services, but in doing that we should not introduce discrimination against any group, particularly people who suffer from psychiatric disabilities. It is reprehensible and I think I heard somebody say they would be concerned about the constitutionality of treating people differently.  It could be subject to challenge.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to the Minister by Aware, our spokesperson and others that there are other ways to provide indeminity.  Aware states that one simple method is that health insurance providers should be required to give a certain level of financial indeminity per annum and whether this is expended on medical or psychiatric illness needs not arise as a discriminatory issue.  This is something which has been mentioned by constituents and people who are involved in providing the services.  We ask the Minister to take what they are saying seriously, even if he is not interested in what we are saying, and provide equitable treatment for psychiatric patients in line with that provided for patients in general.</P>
    <P>The decision as to whether a person is ill and whether the nature of the illness is psychiatric or general is a medical one.  No one will fool anybody.  It is either real or it is not and, if it is real, people should be treated equitably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this motion.  I am a former member of a health board.  It was always acknowledged that the psychiatric services were the poor relation of the <Col N="242" /> health services.  Naturally, acute services in general hospitals had to get priority. Then we developed the community care services which we have been promoting for many years, and rightly so.  We closed all the large psychiatric institutions and this was welcomed by the community.  Of course, it put additional strain on the community.</P>
      <P>The regulations put in place by the Minister will cause much concern. Aware, an organisation which is helping to defeat depression, outlined its case in a letter to us.  Even at this late hour it makes a strong appeal regarding the regulations and states that it is the only body opposing them.  It does so simply because of their discriminatory nature.</P>
      <P>Aware acknowledges that the Minister has done a good job in setting out a minimum level of in-patient hospital care of 100 days which health insurance companies have to provide for psychiatric patients.  The letter continues.</P>
      <P>But when he gives 180 days for medical disorders which have the same biological basis as recurring depression and manic depression one cannot but conclude that the regulations are clearly discriminatory. Aware believes that the Minister needs to explore how he can provide a similar level of in-patient hospital cover without it being discriminatory. One simple method is that health insurance providers should be required to give a certain level of financial indemnity per annum and whether this is expended on medical or psychiatric illnesses need not arise as a discriminatory issue.  Such a form of indeminity is available in certain EU countries.</P>
      <P>Aware goes on to list a number of concerns and states that the regulations discriminate against the psychiatrically ill in offering them a minimum cover of 100 days in-patient care in contrast to the 180 days for all other illnesses.  The proposed reduction in the duration of in-patient care offered to psychiatric patients is a 45 per cent cut in that which is currently provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> The letter further states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health does not know how many patients will be affected by this reduction in the level of in-patient care.  In his written response to Mrs. Maire Geoghegan-Quinn on the 18th of April, he stated that in 1994, 92 per cent of discharges from private psychiatric hospitals occurred within three months. However, these figures are based on the duration of stay per admission, rather than, as it should be, the number of in-patient days per patient per year.  In other words, patients who have more than one admission per year will be significantly affected by these cuts and the Minister's statement does not take account of this... The reduction in the level of care for psychiatric patients represents another disruption of continuity of medical and nursing care, the very basis of a good psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say that no provisions have been made by the Department of Health for the overflow of patients into the public psychiatric service if these regulations are implemented.  The cost of maintaining a patient in a private psychiatric hospital is significantly less than the cost in the public psychiatric service.  Psychiatric patients are discriminated throughout Europe by insurance companies and Ireland should take a lead in ending this discrimination.  Aware also state: &ldquo;To the best of our knowledge, the Regulations of the Health Insurance Act are the only pieces of legislation throughout the European Union which specifically discriminate against psychiatric patients in respect of health insurance cover.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The case is being clearly made by the people who are closed to the problem. We have an obligation as Oireachtas Members.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the motion tabled by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn because we are doing a disservice to psychiatric patients in the community.  They are being integrated into the community more than <Col N="244" /> ever before and we welcome that.  These regulations will militate against these patients and are a source of concern to them and their families.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in complimenting our spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who tabled this motion, which deals with those suffering from psychiatric illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion because of the serious implications of the regulations, proposed by the Minister for Health, for those suffering from psychiatric illness. Our main reason for opposing the regulations is that they patently discriminate against people who suffer from psychiatric illnesses.  Every health policy document introduced by governments down through the years have had as a fundamental principle the integration of the psychiatric and general medical services. These regulations are contrary to all those attempts by governments over the years to do so.  They are singling our psychiatric patients for different treatment from other patients.  People who suffer from general medical disorders are not subject to such a limit.  The Minister and the Government are making a distinction between psychiatric disorders and general disorders.  Will the Minister acknowledge that a recurring depressive illness is just like any other illness?  If he accepts that it is as important, he should allow cover for that type of illness.  By doing what he has proposed to do, does the Minister blame people confined to psychiatric hospitals for being ill?  It is a reprehensible decision by the Minister and the Government that they are blaming those unfortunate people who suffer psychiatric illness.  The disease is the problem, not the individuals.  It is reprehensible that the Minister is holding those people responsible and making them pay for such an illness when it does not apply to people suffering from other illnesses.  In the past the Irish have been noted as a caring people but this <Col N="245" /> decision will change that view.  I am disappointed the Government has introduced this change.</P>
    <P>The discrimination which will arise will affect psychiatrically ill patients who cannot work in the same way as the rest of us.  They will be allowed cover for only 100 days as against 180 days for people with other illnesses.  As well as imposing financial difficulties this reduction will result in extra pressures for individuals suffering from depressive illnesses.  In many cases, every problem looms large and the financial pressures will not help their recovery.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this most discriminatory and backwards step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the motion.  This proposal by the Minister is an example of hypocrisy by the Government. On the one hand, we heard of anti-discrimination legislation being introduced by one Minister and on the other the Minister for Health is discriminating against a section of society who, through no fault of their own, are affected by an illness and are to be punished because they suffer from it.  It discriminates against the psychiatrically ill in offering them a minimum cover of 100 days in-patient's care in contrast to 180 days for all other illnesses.  Anybody who knows anything about psychiatric care will be aware of how vulnerable that section of society is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was born in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane. My father worked in the hospital nursing the psychiatrically ill.  I know very well the care and attention that the nursing and the medical professions provide for the psychiatrically ill.  A person who suffers from a psychiatric illness needs care and attention and by the nature of the illness does not need the distress of worrying about payments for this treatment.  The Minister is imposing further stress on unfortunate people who suffer from stress of the mind, psychiatric illness.  The reduction in the duration of the in-patient care offered to psychiatric patients is a 45 per cent cut on that currently provided.  What other section of society is being asked <Col N="246" /> to bear a 45 per cent reduction?  This is discrimination to ensure that the foreign insurance companies will have a greater welcome here against the interests of the VHI.  How many patients will be affected by this reduction in the level of in-patient care?</P>
    <P>In his written response to my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on 18 April, the Minister stated that in 1994, 92 per cent of discharges from private psychiatric hospitals occurred within three months.  Like most statistics these figures are based on the duration of stay per admission.  They do not give the full picture.  The number of in-patient days per patient per year is what we should consider.  In other words, patients with more than one admission per year will be significantly affected by these health cuts, but the Minister failed to take that into account.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing the worst ever health cuts, yet we constantly hear about large sums of money being spent on our health services.  We are very fortunate to have such caring people administering the services, particularly the emergency services, but they are struggling to meet demands.  A man who was recently admitted to a hospital with chest pains spent three days laying on a trolley because a bed was not available. He was then sent for tests and had heart surgery but, unfortunately, suffered a stroke.  There are thousands of such cases due to health cuts.  As these regulations will punish a most vulnerable section of our community, will the Minister reconsider the matter, even at this late stage?  I do not believe members of the Labour Party or Democratic Left, from whom we hear a great deal on other issues, want to vote for these cuts. If they do, it will be remembered by the public and the families of a most vulnerable section of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of our spokesperson on health on this matter because the regulations will have serious implications for many people. They are in stark contrast to what the health authorities are doing for sick <Col N="247" /> people.  In recent years great emphasis has been placed on ensuring that people with a psychiatric illness get the best possible treatment, but these regulations will discriminate against them.  I recently met a person in business who had to spend a considerable amount of time in hospital during 1995 receiving treatment for depression and a psychiatric disorder.  He told me he would not have been able to meet the costs involved if these regulations were in place.</P>
      <P>In recent times psychiatric hospitals have been placing patients in hostels and other accommodation.  I recall when the psychiatric hospital in Monaghan had 850 patients, but it currently has approximately 100, many of whom will be sent to hostels or other places of geriatric care.  Some people are getting adequate treatment in psychiatric clinics which means they do not have to be institutionalised.  Many of those who are under great pressure in business are covered by VHI, but they could be adversely affected by these regulations. Therefore, the Minister of State should re-examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach must have had second thoughts about the matter when he allowed time for the debate.  A previous call for such a debate was rejected.  The Minister should not exacerabate the problems of those who are seriously ill by implementing these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on tabling this motion to annual these regulations. They may not affect many people but they have left those whom they will affect, and their families, very bitter. Deputy Burke placed great emphasis on the word &ldquo;stress&rdquo; which is associated with psychiatric illness.  These regulations will place additional stress on people who are unable to cope with any further stress.  They will distinguish between psychiatric and other illnesses and imply that a psychiatrically ill person is different and that the illness is partly the person's own fault.  That <Col N="248" /> message is upsetting for the people concernd and their families.  Even if the Minister decided to increase the number of days to, say, 130, it would still be discriminatory. Anything less than equal treatment would distinguish between psychiatric and other illnesses and it is unacceptable to label people in that manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn stated that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is responsible for bringing equality into all walks of life, but these regulations will have the opposite effect. They will introduce discrimination into medical care.  This is an extraordinary decision, particularly when one considers that this and the previous Government tried to bring equality into all aspects of life.  There is a huge reduction in the number of days for which cover will be provided, from 180 to 100.  Even if the period was increased by 20 or 30 days, we would still discriminate against the people involved.  The rules and regulations must be changed so that people are covered equally for all illnesses.</P>
      <P>In the case of the warrant that was discussed here last week, we blamed the British authorities, and in this case the attitude of the Government is to blame the EU.  Whenever there is dirty work to be done it is a case of who we can blame.  That is the trend promoted by various Ministers.  Deputy Dukes spoke about the market.  We have always taken pride in the fact that we are a sympathetic, caring society.  It is unacceptable when dealing with people who are ill that we talk purely in economic terms such as &ldquo;the free market&rdquo;, in callous, uncaring terms as if we were talking about the stock market.  In this case we are dealing with people who live in very stressful conditions and we are frightening them by giving them the wrong message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations must be reconsidered with a view to bringing forward a different scheme.  To increase the period of time by ten or 20 days will not solve the problem.  The Minister may say that 92 per cent of these people will get out of <Col N="249" /> hospital within three months, but some of them may have to go back into hospital a number of times during the year.  While we would appreciate an extension of the period by ten to 20 days, it would not solve the problem.  It would be perceived as discrimination and give a negative message to those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the efforts of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in bringing this matter to our attention.  It is an extremely important matter relating to psychiatric patients.  We believe we are a caring society, particularly in relation to those who suffer from mental disorders.  It is extraordinary that a differentiation is made between what we call general health and psychiatric problems. I am sure the Minister will agree it is extraordinary that he is on his own on that side of the House, that nobody from the Government benches came in to speak on this debate.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, speak this morning about placing a ban on Shell products. Considering what he and his party represent, I wonder where Deputy Lynch and Deputy Eric Byrne are.  They are the people who tell us they are concerned about those who need help and support, but they are not here.  Much concern has been expressed by members of the Minister's party about people with this type of illness, but not one of them came in here to speak on a most important issue of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a very caring person and his Ministry would like to ensure equity in the health service.  He is concerned about delivering an efficient, effective service to ensure people's health is looked after in the best possible manner.  Despite all the regulations that have been put in place, the documents that have issued from the Department of Health and the recommendations on the integration of services &mdash; in three or four documents it has been indicated that there should be no difference between a general physical disorder and a mental disorder &mdash; the <Col N="250" /> Minister is bringing in a measure that is discriminatory.  That is inconceivable and insensitive.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Minister and Minister of State have paid little heed to the recommendations of people working in the health service.  A short time ago the people we are dealing with were covered by insurance for one year.  It was then proposed that the period be reduced to 40 days.  The Minister states that that proposal was put forward by the European Commission and that he succeeded in retaining cover for 100 days.  However, he has simply magnified the difference between people with physical disorders and the mentally ill.  I would have thought the day had gone when such a differentiation existed and that we cared enough to ensure that a similar insurance service is provided for everyone.  The Minister should bear in mind that the people involved may have to return to hospital a number of times for treatment.  Under this system there will be an increase in the number of suicides because of the lack of care for people who deserve better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this matter. Originally this side of the House asked for a two hour debate, and that was granted last week, but for some reason the Government decided this week to curtail the time allowed.  Despite repeated requests by me to the Government Chief Whip, one of which was made no later than this morning, the extension to two hours was refused. Then the Taoiseach, in a very petulant way, agreed to the two hours.  I wonder if anyone is in charge over there.  It is ironic that the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, has not come into the House for this debate and that there have been only two Government speakers. The Government probably thought there would not be sufficient speakers to keep the debate going for two hours but my door was almost knocked down by Fianna Fáil Deputies who wished to contribute.  It is obvious that if more <Col N="251" /> time had been provided it would have been availed of.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that the Minister pitched the level of cover at 40 days so that he could claim to have done a good job if he raised it to a credible level.  One of the reasons we put down the motion is that we believe it is discriminatory to distinguish between different categories in terms of medical cover.  Some members of the Government claim to represent the underprivileged in society, people living on the bread line.  However, these are the very people against whom the regulations will discriminate.  I call on Deputies on the other side of the House to think again before they go through the lobbies.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister are pandering to big business.  I recently heard a radio interview with a woman who represents one of the health insurance groups which hopes to compete against the VHI.  I smelled a rat when I heard her say her company would be able to enter the Irish market now that the regulations had been passed.  This seemed to suggest her company and other medical insurance companies had made representations to the Minister and his Department about the level of insurance in this very costly area.  The Government is, in effect, looking after the insurers rather than the down trodden in society.  By voting against our motion the Government will vote in favour of big business and against the unfortunate patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McDaid.  I support the points made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. It was ironic to hear the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, say today that he agreed with the Fianna Fáil position on the embargo on Shell when he does not agree with our position on the health insurance regulations.  These regulations discriminate against people with a psychiatric illness.  In his letter Dr. Anthony Clare <Col N="252" /> states there is a distinction between the cover provided for physical as against psychiatric disorders.  I hope even at this late stage the Minister will agree to look again at the regulations.</P>
      <P>I have received many representations on this matter.  People who attend the alcoholism unit in St. Bridget's Psychiatric Hospital in Ballinasloe are very concerned about these regulations and their effect on them.  This unit has been under threat ever since the document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; was published by a previous Government. People are concerned about its future and I hope the Minister will provide funding for it.  At a recent meeting of the Western Health Board I was told there are fewer than 500 patients in St. Bridget's Psychiatric Hospital in Ballinasloe. It is important that better facilities are provided in this hospital.  The many patients housed in the accommodation adjacent to Ballinasloe also need to be reassured that the regulations will not discriminate against them.  These people have been discriminated against in the past and I am afraid the regulations will further discriminate against them.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted from European regulations and said some medical insurers in Europe do not provide psychiatric cover.  This raises questions about the new insurance companies which propose to set up here.  It is important that these companies provide cover for patients with a psychiatric illness. I have not been given this assurance in the House and I ask the Minister and the Government to ensure that the new companies which set up here provide this cover.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate but regret that I do not have more time to deal with these matters in greater detail.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his time with me.  There is a perception that the VHI discourages treatment anywhere other than in hospital beds and has helped to create a new culture, the Blackrock Clinic culture.  The regulations governing VHI payments <Col N="253" /> have led to many patients occupying hospital beds rather than availing of outpatient services.  Many cases could have been dealt with adequately without taking up space in hospitals and incurring extra expense for health boards.  The VHI and the health services generally could save a great deal of money if they encouraged more people to avail of outpatient services rather than taking up hospital beds.  If out-patient services included diagnostic services such as X-rays, physiotherapy and various consultants services, patients could be adequately treated without having to take up beds.</P>
      <P>I have worked long enough in hospitals to realise that the health services could be used more effectively by encouraging people to prevent disease rather than waiting until they become emergency cases.  The VHI could be said to be culpable in this regard by virtue of its rules.  It is alarming that more suicides are occuring when long-term treatment could help prevent these tragedies.  Limiting cover for these patients is the height of irresponsibility. In addition, child victims of sexual abuse, who take a very long time to recover, many of whom are institutionalised in hospitals, have been excluded from these VHI regulations.  This issue has been discussed in this House on many occasions, has been the subject monthly if not weekly of &ldquo;drip, drip&rdquo; affair in the media and must be catered for by the Voluntary Health Insurance under the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to this debate.  One issue which has arisen several times in this debate is the fact that, while one arm of Government proposes legislation to end discrimination over a whole range of areas &mdash; and has been busily lecturing the rest of us in this House with professional bodies, groups and organisations outside it, urging the abolition of discriminatory practices &mdash; the other conservative wing of Government introduces blatant discrimination in relation to health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> The performance of successive Governments and Ministers for Health in relation to psychiatric care led to psychiatric patients being isolated, locked away indefinitely in large, grey, forbidding buildings, their families, relatives and friends not encouraged to visit them and, for the most part, very heavily sedated by medical staff so that they could control large numbers in very large institutions.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments and Ministers for Health have ensured that the psychiatric wing of medicine was incorporated into general medical practice so that we now have very modern, open, airy, bright units attached to most, general and acute hospitals nationwide.  In addition, the community is encouraged to become involved in out-patient care and in small psychiatric units of care in rural and urban areas throughout the country.  Families are very much involved in the treatment and care of psychiatric patients and spouses and children are encouraged to visit them while receiving in-patient care.</P>
    <P>The traditional view of psychiatric illness has changed dramatically, from one in which only people with schizophrenia, or more acute symptoms of psychiatric illness, are hospitalised or isolated as the general public now has a much greater understanding of people with anorexia nervosa or those about whom Deputy McDaid spoke, victims of sexual abuse and their abusers.  Alzheimer's disease has become more prevalent not only in our ageing population but in the 40s age group.</P>
    <P>In the 21 years I have been a Member I have never received more correspondence from members of the public on any one single issue than on this one.  I have received correspondence from patients worried and stressed, fearing that their insurance cover is under threat &mdash; which it is &mdash; and from their spouses, families, sons, daughters and physicians, all equally concerned that their level of health care has been reduced by 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>Circumstances may well arise sooner rather than later in which a patient or <Col N="255" /> his or her physician may decide to take a test case to the courts to ascertain whether this element of discrimination, being introduced by a Government which trumpets loudly that it is anti-discrimination, withstands legal scrutiny.</P>
    <P>It is rather rich of the Minister of State at the Department of Health to read into the record that, of course, when the insurance for private health care expires, these patients can be transferred to the public psychiatric services.  Has the Minister any idea of what is happening in public psychiatric health care services nationwide?  They cannot cope with the pressure exerted on them by public patients.  Therefore, <Col N="256" /> how can the Minister expect people involved in private health care to be pushed over, exerting further pressure on an already over-pressurised public health care system?  Private health care has an important, significant role to play, hand in glove, with public health care but is under attack by the Government and Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Above, all, this is the introduction of an element of discrimination in the area of health care by a rainbow coalition Government that I, Members of this House and the public thought had been abolished forever by successive Ministers for Health.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to support the annualling of these regulations.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann declares its commitment to maintaining history and geography as core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum in second level schools and calls on the Government to amend the White Paper on Education entitled, Charting our Future, to include history and geography as core subjects in the junior certificate curriculum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this motion to send a clear signal to the general public that Dáil Éireann is totally committed to maintaining history and geography as core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum, and calls on the Minister for Education to give effect to this by amending the White Paper on Education to include history and geography as core subjects on that curriculum. There is a clear need for this to be done, given what has happened since the publication of the White Paper.  The Minister for Education has attempted to evade this issue in the past number of months and to confuse the public on what exactly happened regarding history and geography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate arose because of the content of the White Paper relating to the junior certificate curriculum.  The Green Paper, <i>Education for a Changing World,</i> particularly the section dealing with the junior certificate curriculum, contrasts with the White Paper in its treatment of history and geography.  The Green Paper clearly states in its preamble that the primary objective of the junior cycle is that students should complete a broad and balanced course of study in a variety of subjects relevant to their personal development, the world of work and the enjoyment of their leisure and recreation, and also that broadly based <Col N="259" /> programmes must be made available for all the students at levels appropriate to their abilities.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the authors of the Green Paper took on board the advice of the NCCA that the programme for all students should include the following as core subjects: Irish, English, mathematics, history and geography or environmental and social studies, which combines elements of history, geography, social and political education and science or a technological subject. Clearly, history and geography were to be core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum, and the authors of the Green Paper had received position papers from the NCCA advising such a course of action.  It is extraordinary that in a recent speech on this subject the Minister still talked about receiving advice from the NCCA, despite the fact that she received such advice on two occasions, and on both occasions the NCCA recommended that history and geography should remain as core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum.</P>
    <P>The situation changed dramatically in the White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Educational Future</i>, which was published over a year ago.  It states that the objective of the junior certificate programme is to provide breadth and balance and a curriculum that is both relevant and appropriate to the aptitudes and abilities of all students.  What is striking about the White Paper's treatment of the junior certificate curriculum is its failure to mention history and geography in any context.  Clearly, the status of history and geography is substantially and significantly reduced in the White Paper.  This is significantly different treatment from that given in the Green Paper.  More significantly, the White Paper states that the curricular framework as outlined will apply to all second level schools and to all students in the junior cycle.  This is an important point because in all her replies to parliamentary questions on this issue to date the Minister has been at pains to make <Col N="260" /> the point that history and geography are compulsory only in secondary schools but are not compulsory in vocational and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is a policy document which has been endorsed by the Government.  Decisions have been made on the policy framework for the development of the curriculum at junior cycle and applies to all second level schools irrespective of their title.  The White Paper develops this point when it states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of certification the following specific requirements will be necessary.  The Programme for all students at junior cycle will include a core of Irish, English, mathematics, science or a technological subject, and at least three further subjects from a wide range of full courses and short courses.  All students should have access to the study of a modern European language and to have a recognised full course in at least one creative or performing art form.</P>
    <P>History or geography is not mentioned in this paragraph nor anywhere in the entire section of the White Paper dealing with the junior certificate curriculum. The White Paper further states that each school will be expected to provide students with experience in the following areas: language and literature; mathematical studies; science and technology; civic, social and political education; arts education; religious education; guidance counselling and pastoral care; physical education; health education (including personal and social development), relationships and sexuality education.  Neither history nor geography is mentioned.  It is important to emphasise that point.  The Minister is trying to give the impression that there is no reason to worry, that the status of history and geography was not changed, but neither history nor geography is mentioned in the section of the White Paper dealing with the junior certificate curriculum.  That is what rang alarm bells among history and geography <Col N="261" /> teachers and gave rise to the campaign that has been ongoing for some time.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that in the White Paper the Minister for Education clearly attempted to eliminate history and geography from the core curriculum and significantly reduce its status on the curriculum.  How otherwise can she explain the omission of any reference to history and geography in that section of the White Paper?  Surely the intent was clear, and the Minister should be honest about it.  There has been too much evasion and dishonesty in the Minister's approach to this issue. Of late, she has attempted to row back and reverse the policy decision, but the White Paper clearly signalled a change.</P>
    <P>When I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter on 20 February 1996 the Minister acknowledged that the White Paper did not specifically mention history or geography within the group of subjects in the core curriculum but offered the opinion that the vast majority of schools would be likely to continue to offer these subjects.  In reply to that question the Minister pointed out that 740 out of a total of 772 second level schools currently offer history and geography at junior certificate level. Why then did the Minister omit them from the White Paper?  Clearly she had signalled a change of approach and indicated that history and geography would no longer remain as core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum.  That is why our motion is so important.</P>
    <P>We should be clear about the status of the White Paper.  It represents a policy decision by the Government.  In relation to its treatment of history and geography, that decision needs to be reversed and the White Paper amended. That is why I have tabled the motion in the language I have, calling for the amendment of the White Paper and to include history and geography as core subjects in the junior certificate curriculum. A clear Government decision should be taken.  It should be open and transparent, without clever ambiguities, fudging or an attempt to confuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> It is clear from the White Paper that other subjects are given considerable prominence which are not currently core subjects.  Did the Minister, for example, envisage replacing history and geography with political education, with the creative arts, or an extra modern language?  We need more openness in terms of what the Minister intended to achieve via the White Paper in relation to the junior certificate curriculum.  It is regrettable there has been no fundamental debate in this House on curriculum issues apart from the debate on the White Paper.  Fianna Fáil believes that history and geography are extremely important broad based subjects that for very valid reasons should form part of the core curriculum.</P>
    <P>History is a broadly based subject.  It is extremely important for any society to know about its past and to preserve its cultural and linguistic heritage.  It is more important for countries such as Ireland where the preservation of cultural identity is very important given that to a certain degree we have lost our linguistic identity.  History has formed an important part of our cultural heritage. Young people need to know about their past.  We need to learn from the mistakes and achievements of the past, but, more important in my opinion as a former history teacher, history opens up many other opportunities for young people.  It is an interdisciplinary subject. Through history many young people have learned for the first time about the wonders of the world of literature, art, drama and so on.</P>
    <P>Many young students first learn of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper or Michelangelo's Mona Lisa, the Sistine Chapel and the wonders of the Renaissance through the junior certificate history class.  Studying history at junior certificate level broadens the horizons of many young people and facilitates their study of other countries, cultures and developments throughout the ages.  History leads to a greater understanding of different communities.  Many students first learn about famous writers, the <Col N="263" /> great achievements in science and economics in the history class.  Industrial and agricultural development and so on is embraced by history.  History embraces the totality of the life experience of human kind and in that sense it is particularly appropriate for a foundation course and for facilitating the broadly based development of a young person, the fundamental objective of the junior certificate programme as outlined in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Very often the methodology for teaching history can contain an interdisciplinary approach.  History is not simply taught only in lecture-style context. Many students have discovered their local town, city or communities through the study of local history, through simply walking around the local areas and discovering local monuments, the history of streets and the folklore of a given area.  The study of local history develops tremendous civic pride and awareness and a practical patriotism, which is so important to the development of society.  In short, history is a broad based subject which embraces many different disciplines and opens up many opportunities for young people in terms of further study and interests.</P>
    <P>Geography likewise is an extremely crucial subject at a critical formative level in a student's education.  Professor William Smith, a Professor of Geography at UCC summed up the outstanding qualities of geography in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday, 27 May in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Geography is a long-established subject which is concerned with the complex relationships between societies and their environments.  Young students find in geography a discipline which explores the nature of lived environments, in their own localities, regionally, nationally and at European and the global levels.  It is by definition a down-to-earth subject concerned with key human concerns of the late 20th century such as landscape appreciation and environmental <Col N="264" /> management, economic, social and the regional development, Ireland's place in a changing Europe, Third World issues and the consequences of the globalisation of economies for all our lives.  It is also a subject that familiarise young students with the political geography of international relations and conflicts.</P>
    <P>Another interesting letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday pointed out that TDs perhaps found geography a very useful subject when it came to discovering the nooks and crannies of townlands and polling districts.  Professor Smith further points out that geography in particular will assist young Irish people to acquire a keen awareness of their national and European heritage and identity coupled with a global awareness and respect and care for the environment.  One has only to look at the bibliography at the end of geography books to see the broad range of subjects and disciplines that are embraced by the subject of geography. Geography communicates to students ways of seeing and understanding the world which transcends the different divisions between the natural and human sciences.</P>
    <P>Through geography, students learn to use maps, diagrams and photographs as a means of presenting and interpreting information about places.  There is much practical work involved in geography. Many social skills are required for field work projects and so on.  Modern technology applications also form a key part of present geographical study.  Computer applications are well developed. Professor Smith is correct when he says he finds it astonishing that the Minister for Education has seen fit to go against the recommendations of the NCCA and many educational bodies in seeking to marginalise geography and history at the junior cycle.</P>
    <P>The ASTI in its recent publication clearly reaffirmed its commitment to the retention of history and geography as core subjects on the curriculum.  The ASTI representatives at the course committee of the NCCA made their views <Col N="265" /> quite clearly known on the previous occasions that the NCCA addressed this subject.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that the Geographical Society of Ireland has made a very comprehensive submission to the Minister for Education on the value of geography in the junior certificate curriculum. This society represents a broad based constituency, which includes professional geographers, teachers and the general public, including many professional planners whose training is in geography.  At its recent annual general meeting grave reservations were expressed on the treatment of geography and history in the White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> Its submission cited the United States of America as an important example of a society which is recognised as having an unacceptably high level of geographical illiteracy as a result of the diminished status given to geography in the school curriculum for several decades.</P>
    <P>US educators are now having to devote substantial resources to remedy the situation.  They argue validity that it would be very unfortunate if Ireland were to devalue geography at a time when educators elsewhere are allocating major resources to re-establish the subject within their school curriculum.  The society in its letter to the Minister requested to discuss its concerns.  I hope the Minister would in addition to discussing the issue with the NCCA meet the History Teachers Association and the various representatives of the subject of geography.  That is true democracy and it is important that their concerns are heard by the Minister and not by a programme manager.</P>
    <P>The History Teachers Association has been engaged in a very effective campaign on this issue.  I met with the history association as far back as last February. It was the association which initially developed the debate on the campaign and great credit is due to it on its success in forcing the Minister to gradually reverse her earlier policy decision.  However, it is extremely important that the Minister be quite <Col N="266" /> specific in her commitment in the House this evening.  Clearly she must indicate that she will amend the White Paper on Education to include history and geography.  The White Paper states on page 48:</P>
    <P>The programme for all students at junior cycle will include a core of Irish, English, Mathematics...</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to include &ldquo;History, Geography, Science Technology...&rdquo;. We want to have it clearly stated that history and geography are included in that section of the White Paper.  There is a need to do this because there is widespread concern about the bona fides of the Minister in this regard.  The Minister issued a statement last weekend to the Irish Committee for Historical Sciences in which some progression from earlier statements was made.  I suspect that the fact that we tabled this Private Members' motion last Friday was a fillip to the Minister, an incentive to her to accelerate the row back and the reversal of policy she has been engaged in for some time.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Minister's Government colleagues have been urging her to pursue such a course of action.  I read the statement that was presented last week to the Committee for Historical Sciences and noted the degree of ambivalance and ambiguity in it.  While it represents some progression, it needs to be tied down more specifically. In her statement the Minister attempted to reassure her audience that she has not changed the status of history and geography as core subjects in the junior cycle.  The point is, however, that the White Paper certainly creates a new framework which essentially reduces significantly the status of these subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that she recently requested the NCCA to respond as a matter of priority to the debate on the broad issue of the junior certificate curriculum.  The NCCA has made a number of recommendations to this and previous Ministers, in all cases recommending history and geography <Col N="267" /> as core parts of the curriculum.  The Minister said that once the NCCA has completed its report, it is her intention to make a series of recommendations to her Government colleagues on the junior cycle core curriculum, including her commitment to the retention of the study of history and geography in that curriculum.  What does this statement mean?  Does it mean that history and geography retain the status they currently enjoy in second level schools in terms of their time-table, space and so forth?  Are we talking about short courses or modules which will be fitted into a broader curriculum?  Will the Minister become more flexible about the core curriculum, make a broad statement about what it involves and include a whole range of subjects with the result that history and geography will have a lower status than they currently enjoy?  I have spoken to many history and geography teachers since the Minister's statement last weekend and they are extremely concerned about this point.  They are anxious that the current status of history and geography in the curriculum be retained as they are.  We do not want any clever manipulation of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is incredible to hear the Minister say she will advise her Government colleagues on the junior cycle core curriculum. What is the actual status of the White Paper?  This was meant to be the definitive policy decision of the Government with regard to the development of education.  I know it was rushed through the Cabinet and it is obvious that the Minister's colleagues did not read it.  I would guess that there was no discussion by the Cabinet on the status of history and geography in the core curriculum. The White Paper was rushed through because the Minister had difficulties with the teachers' unions at that time.  There were political reasons the members of the Cabinet nodded their heads in approval of the White Paper. The Minister for Finance stated he was not going to provide extra resources for <Col N="268" /> it so it did not really matter.  The Minister is going to advise her colleagues on the junior certificate curriculum a year after the Governments definitive policy statement was published.  This makes no sense and calls into question the procedural propriety of what the Minister is doing in terms of the White Paper. The Green Paper was a discussion document, the White Paper was the policy document clearly outlining the Government policy on a wide range of issues, including the junior cycle curriculum.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to this issue has created considerable anger throughout the country.  People from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just history and geography, have complained about the Minister's treatment of these subjects. In every walk of life people have expressed anger at any intention by any Minister to eliminate history and geography as core subjects on the curriculum. Many people who would not be academically inclined have seen the value of history and geography in their own lives and are very much opposed to the policy views of the Minister as outlined in the White Paper.  Teachers of history and geography have felt affronted and devalued by the Minister's approach.</P>
    <P>In many respects career choices are changing because of the Minister's announcement.  Young history and geography teachers are unsure as to their future, given the cloud hanging over their subject because of the Minister's comments.  Parents have contacted me and asked of it would be advisable for their young sons or daughters to pursue history and geography in universities because of the contents of the White Paper.  Considerable anger, doubt and confusion have been created by the Minister.  The entire issue has been handled in a most incompetent manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted, following an effective campaign by all concerned, to reverse the situation.  We welcome this.  No doubt some of her Government colleagues had been privately assuring the various interests that her views were not shared by them. <Col N="269" /> Some have apparently expressed horror at the Minister's intentions.  Clearly her statement last weekend is a response to the promptings from her colleagues in Government, both from her own party and the other two parties which form part of the Government.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil felt it was necessary to introduce this motion to ensure that a debate takes place on this issue and that the public interest and anger generated by it finds reflection in a constructive discussion in the House.  Often the House stands accused of being somewhat irrelevant to developments outside and for not articulating accurately or effectively the views of the general public.  Clearly it is important that these issues be discussed here, that the views of the general public find articulation here and that decisions follow from this debate which reflect the opinions of the vast majority of the Irish people.  It is clear to me, following representations I have received from colleagues in the House, the general public and teachers of history and geography at second and third levels, that there is widespread opposition to the treatment of history and geography in the White Paper and to the Minister's intentions in this regard.  There is widespread agreement that history and geography should remain as core subjects in the junior certificate curriculum.  This is why we moved this motion.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's statement last weekend, we expect the Government to support the motion and facilitate its passage through the House.  Dáil Éireann would then send a clear signal to the people that history and geography are essential to the development of a broadly based education for our young people.  Accordingly, I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>It appears that we will need to have a debate on education every week because of the frequency with which problems concerning education arise.  The Minister has no vision as to the needs of our young people for the next millennium.  There has been a litany of <i>faux pas</i>&mdash; exam papers have fallen off the backs of lorries and circulars are issued which drive teachers mad, insult them and suggest some of them do not even spend 15 hours each week on extra-curricular activities. There has been complete inaction on many issues.</P>
      <P>We are now discussing an issue which has fundamentally rocked education. There is a serious and sinister reason for this issue not being covered in the White Paper and the Labour Party is accountable for this.  The amendment states that the Minister welcomes the commitment to maintain the status of history and geography as core curriculum subjects in the junior cycle. However, these are not mentioned in the document.  Therefore, the amendment is disingenuous and incorrect and I ask the Minister to withdraw it and accept our motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do we study history?  People are their history.  The obvious tried and tested arguments spring to mind &mdash; the need to foster a sense of belonging, our roots and our national identity.  In a culture which is becoming increasingly multinational, where borders between countries are becoming less rigid and where the EU centres of power are rapidly becoming the decision making fora, <Col N="271" /> for this nation the preserving of history is preserving its sense of national identity and this is ever more important.  The idea that one can be Irish and European, the fact that one's culture can be important and yet inclusive and the ideal of racial tolerance, are all part of the rationale of a balanced history curriculum. For the student of the 1990s history is a must.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper the Minister referred to the skills she believes young people should acquire &mdash; competence in literacy, numeracy and spoken language and various experiences in artistic, intellectual, scientific, physical and practical activity.  All these are encompassed in the study of history and geography which young people should continue to be taught.</P>
    <P>In history young people are taught how to extrapolate the relevant &mdash; perhaps the Minister should go back and repeat the course &mdash; and examine change.  In geography they learn how to use maps, diagrams and photographs acquiring vital, practical and social skills, for example, through fieldwork. These are probably the less obvious skills which we do not normally think about, but they are ones we believe our young people should acquire.  To remove history and geography from the curriculum for the sake of the technological subjects is wrong.  One can be very good at woodwork and history; they are not incompatible.  Skills acquired can be used throughout one's life and make one more flexible.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made &mdash; and it has much credence &mdash; that the teaching of history perpetuates a polarised society.  We, in Ireland, are often quoted as typical examples of fuelling the republican and Unionist divide.  This is nonsense.  It is essential that a true record of the past is presented.  If the facts are not taught in a structured way, people may never learn them.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister who <Col N="272" /> is introducing a relationships and sexuality programme to change the behind the bicycle-shed attitudes to relationships and sexuality is at the same time suggesting that history does not need to be taught, as if somehow it will be transmitted in the playground or through the short courses and modules.  That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>In an ever changing society, unfortunately, many of our young people are taught through the medium of television. This is a manipulative medium of communication.  If young people do not acquire the skills to know the difference between fact and fiction, by not learning, say, geography and history in particular, their attitudes will be manipulated by television and, because they do not have the facts, they will not be able to decipher truth and reality.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, there has been an upsurge of interest in our history with many expressing a desire to go back to our roots.  In terms of dress and music, people are trying to recreate the 1960s and earlier.  Some are spending astronomical sums refurbishing old buildings. All this is part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>Our language and history are what makes us different and unique.  If young people are not made aware of our history, how will they be able to appreciate differences?  At a time when money is being spent developing historical sites and there is enormous interest in our heritage and culture, it is unbelievable that it is being suggested that history in particular should not be a core subject. To sacrifice history and geography at the altar of technology is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister clarified the matter because pressure was exerted by other members of the Cabinet who knew that this was the wrong path to take.  The Labour Party in particular is making an attempt at social engineering.  It is introducing programmes which are not wanted by the people.  Because it does not like what is being taught, it seeks to change it.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Minister's proposals in regard to the teaching of the history of the 1850s, the 1960s and the 1970s, she should stop blaming the NCCA for her inaction.  She does not have a notion about what is happening.  I am glad we are having this debate and that history and geography teachers stood up for themselves and were able to persuade the Minister to change her mind.  I commend them for this because if they had failed, their posts would no longer exist.</P>
      <P>We are trying to amalgamate the French ideology of secularism and the German ideology of technology &mdash; during the debate on the Estimates the Minister said she did not agree with this &mdash; with elements of the American and British systems to create a new Irish system. The Irish system is fine.  What the Minister needs &mdash; she has more resources at her disposal than any of her predecessors &mdash; is a vision.  She has demoralised and lost the confidence of teachers, parents and pupils.  That is what is wrong in education.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Martin.  The Minister has deliberately tried to transfer responsibility for the decision to the NCCA.  It recommended that history and geography should be retained as core subjects.  That was also recommended in the Green Paper.  The Minister said that she was asking the NCCA for its advice; since it was she who changed it, she should accept full responsibility for reversing the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should develop the ideas of young people to give them a start in life.  That is, perhaps, the most important thing the State has to do.  To take from them the standards of history, geography, Irish, English and mathematics is both wrong and disingenuous.  We have to grapple <Col N="274" /> with many problems.  We have to consider the position of those who are unable to manage when they enter second level as well as the questions of early intervention programmes and support services to ensure young people are able to complete senior cycle, but we should not lower standards by removing two of the most important subjects, history and geography, from the core curriculum.</P>
    <P>As a subject, Irish is being lost despite the resources and efforts being made to save it.  We have been grappling with that problem for years.  I do not want to see young people leaving school without proper skills in history and geography. It would be a shame if scouts could not read a map or do orienteering.  We should not preclude them, even at the age of 15 or 16, from choosing the option of architecture or town planning, yet they are not able to make such choices. History and geography do not push students into narrow sectors but allow them to develop.  Those subjects are fundamental to the school system.  Full clarification in the form of an amendment to the White Paper is required from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the commitment in the White Paper to promote and develop in pupils a knowledge and appreciation of their social and cultural heritage and environment through the study of history and geography at junior certificate level, and in particular, welcomes the Minister's commitment to maintain the status of history and geography as core curriculum subjects in the junior cycle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the recent debate on the place of <Col N="275" /> history and geography in the junior cycle curriculum of second level education. The debate is part of a much wider discussion on what should constitute the core curriculum in all schools and began at the national education convention over three years ago.</P>
    <P>I have listened closely, and very much welcome the interest and the depth of sentiment expressed.  I now seek to clearly state my own position regarding the place of history and geography in the junior cycle curriculum.  I emphasise that the status of history and geography will not change.  They will remain part of the junior cycle core curriculum.  We cannot abolish history.</P>
    <P>The combined subject of history and geography is compulsory for junior certificate pupils in secondary schools.  It is an optional subject for pupils in vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  In fact, 740 out of a total of 772 second level schools offer history and geography, or the kindred subject of environmental and social studies, at junior certificate level.  This represents a total of almost 96 per cent of second level schools and probably an even greater proportion of pupils.</P>
    <P>At leaving certificate level neither history nor geography are core compulsory subjects.  However, both subjects are among the ten most popular subjects taken by candidates in the leaving certificate examinations according to the 1994 statistics.  Geography is the sixth most popular subject at 40 per cent while history is the ninth at 28 per cent. The overall order of popularity has not changed since 1991.  In fact, the popularity of both history and geography has slightly increased since then.</P>
    <P>In addressing the very important issue of the place of history in the junior cycle curriculum, I now set out clearly the White Paper's recommendations on the junior cycle.  The White Paper states that all students should have attained by <Col N="276" /> the end of the junior cycle: &ldquo;a knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>So, we are rewriting it.  It is not in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This constitutes a statement that students should have a basic knowledge of history and geography, as a knowledge and appreciation of the social, cultural and physical heritage and environment does, of course, mean a knowledge and understanding of history and geography.</P>
      <P>The White Paper also states: &ldquo;the programme for all students at junior cycle will include a core of Irish, English, mathematics, a science or a technological subject and at least three further subjects from a wide range of full and short courses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, some believe this to mean that history and geography are excluded from the core curriculum. Nothing could be further from the truth. Both statements in the White Paper must be read together.  In other words, provision must be made in the three further subjects for enabling pupils to secure a &ldquo;knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I said, the combined subject of history and geography is compulsory in the junior certificate cycle in secondary schools but is optional in vocational, community and comprehensive schools. History and geography is an important subject whether compulsory or not.  Parents, students, teachers and I, are fully aware of its importance.  In practice this means that the study of history and geography is accepted to be crucial for a young educated person in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last weekend, I addressed a one day conference of the Irish committee for historical sciences in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, where I once again <Col N="277" /> took the opportunity to reassure delegates that history will remain a compulsory subject in the junior cycle in those schools where it has always been compulsory in the past.  I stated I believed it would be wrong to change the present situation in the face of such obvious commitment to learning history and I will not do so.</P>
    <P>I also remarked that the debate about history has provided a focus and a direction to two vital areas of policy: the role of history, in our lives and human development, as well as in our education system; and the size and shape of the core curriculum to equip young people fully for the demands of the next century.</P>
    <P>The argument that has been made in favour of history is a good one; that in Ireland, of all countries, we need an understanding of the forces in the past that have shaped us today.  As we are all aware, those who have no understanding of history are condemened to repeat its mistakes.  Looking forward, a society that appreciates and knows its past, is, I believe, in a better position to build for the future.</P>
    <P>We need to preserve and even develop further an understanding of where we came from and what formed us.  Our self-confidence as a nation, and our capacity to solve the problems we face, can only be enhanced by such an understanding.  As well as national history we have the history of our families, of our community, of our heroes and heroines.  In Irish we refer to this as mórtas cine, mórtas ceantair, mórtas tíre.</P>
    <P>Local history has long been a subject of interest to children as young as primary age.  I record the debt of gratitude we owe to successive generations of primary school teachers who have taken a keen interest in the areas surrounding their schools and left us with such wonderful memorials of their time.  An example that springs immediately to mind is the heritage centre in Corofin, <Col N="278" /> County Clare, where a major data base of emigrants to Australia was collected by the local primary teacher.</P>
    <P>The last thing any Minister for Education would wish to do is to discriminate against history and geography.  I join geography deliberately to this debate because the arguments for the presence of geography in the curriculum are equally compelling.  A study of geography enriches the understanding of the environment &mdash; local, national, and global.  It deepens our understanding of issues such as sustainable development and the development of the third world.  It strengthens our European identity &mdash; an aspect of Irish life to which we all appreciate we have contributed so much in Europe's development. As we take on the Presidency of the European Union for the second half of this year we must remember that we are also celebrating the European Year of Lifelong Learning.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of lifelong learning is based on the need for citizens of the future to be judged not by the particular amount of knowledge they have at any specific time but rather by their ability to search out and acquire knowledge, to weigh evidence, to store and retrieve information and to use this information in an integrated fashion to further the human ability to adapt and develop.</P>
    <P>I can think of no other subjects which lend themselves as well as history and geography to developing the human potential to think things through, to adopt creative solutions to problems and to develop the skills of acquiring knowledge and its use.  Far from wanting to reduce the emphasis on history or geography it is my desire to increase its relevance and to continually monitor progress and develop in pupils that self-knowledge and discipline which is required to develop a critical mind.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a linked issue which is the content of the compulsory curriculum for junior cycle.  I welcome the interest expressed by teachers, students <Col N="279" /> and parents on the necessary shape and size of the core curriculum for the compulsory years of education.  We as a people have very strong views on what we want our students taught.  We are unique among Europeans for the breadth of our curriculum, the interest we show in people of our own and other countries and in local events.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I do not wish in any way to diminish history and geography, but neither do I want to add a further imposition on the 39 per cent of schools which at present are not compelled to study history and geography but the majority of which do it of their own free will.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the overloading of the curriculum and the stresses which studying many subjects with many different teachers can cause to younger pupils.  Earlier today I asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to advise me as a matter of urgency on how best to meet the competing demands of a very wide variety of subjects.</P>

      <P>The NCCA is representative of all the education partners, school management, teachers, parents, the business world and teacher educaton institutes.  It has been instrumental in bringing forward proposals for a new and exciting junior cycle curriculum which has now been in operation since 1989.  This curriculum has provided opportunities for pupils of differing levels of ability to gain pleasure and satisfaction from their studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCCA deserves great credit for the foresight in producing syllabuses which lend themselves to diverse models of learning and assessment within schools.  The public examinations at the end of the junior cycle succeed in <Col N="280" /> reflecting, through the assessment process, many of the best features of the curriculum itself.</P>
    <P>There is now a world of difference even between the way in which subjects like history and geography were examined when we went to school and the current approach.  The problems the NCCA will address is how the many subjects on the curriculum competing for our students' time are to be met.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the curriculum will be broad and balanced and that it fosters an understanding among pupils of the various areas of experience which are now required for the modern world and the world of work.</P>
    <P>All authorities are agreed that, by the end of the junior cycle, pupils must be brought to the highest level possible in oral and written language, literacy and mastery of basic mathematical ability. These may be classed as basic survival skills.  In addition pupils must have an awareness and appreciation of the visual arts, music and physical education.  They also need to have a knowledge of their heritage and environment.  It is in this area that history and geography play a key role.</P>
    <P>The Government has also given a commitment in the White Paper that pupils will have opportunities to study modern continental languages, science and the new technologies.  There is also the requirement that the new areas of study, civic, social and political education and relationships and sexuality education, are included.  How will it be possible to incorporate the range of other subjects which are optional in an already busy curriculum?</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes that in addition to history and geography, all students should achieve competence in literacy, numeracy and spoken language skills which will allow them to participate as young adults in society; experience in various areas of activity-artistic, intellectual, scientific, physical and practical; formative experience in moral, <Col N="281" /> religious and spiritual education; knowledge and supportive guidance in matters of personal health, sexual awareness and relationships; competence and understnading in practical skills, including computer literacy and information technology and an understanding and appreciation of the central concepts of citizenship.  These are all demanding objectives and Deputies will be aware as parents, as concerned citizens and as public representatives of the difficulty in translating all these objectives into reality.  They are all enormously worthwhile; they are about educating the whole person.  One of the problems we have is that traditionally each subject has been seen as a separate entity, competing with other subjects for more time and a stronger place in the curriculum.</P>
    <P>The conventional manner of training second level teachers here presupposed that they are expert to a high degree in a narrow range of subjects.  Naturally all teachers are anxious that their own specialist subject receives special attention. It is a constant problem for principals to reconcile the demands of the competing subjects in a timetable which is increasingly overloaded.  We need to consider the possibility of integrating the acquisition of knowledge and of introducing more interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary work in our schools, even at junior cycle level.</P>
    <P>Today I posed some questions when I addressed the NCCA: should the same set of subjects be compulsory for all students in all schools secondary, community, vocational and comprehensive? Should students of varying abilities be required to take the same set of compulsory subjects?  Should compulsory subjects consist of a variety of full courses, short courses and modules?</P>

      <P>What kind of flexibility can we leave to schools?  I have asked the NCCA today to study this problem, to advise me on its considered response and to address the other key questions that have arisen during this debate.</P>

      <P>It is opportune to discuss and consult on the wider debate of the junior cycle curriculum which has been generated by the history debate.  In making its recommendations, I have told the council that the study of history and geography is part of the core junior cycle curriculum.</P>
      <P>I realise I am asking it to undertake a challenging assignment, and I relay on its advice to provide a broad and balanced curriculum, without any way displacing history or geography.</P>
      <P>A new programme in civic, social and political education is being introduced in 328 schools from September 1996 for examination in 1999 and in all schools from September 1997.  This replaces civics which was hitherto unexamined and was compulsory only in secondary schools.  CSPE, taken alongside history and geography, will give an even greater emphasis to the acquisition of knowledge and an appreciation of our social and cultural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further example of the importance attached to the place of history and geography in the curriculum is shown through the European studies programme. One aspect of the project involves five common units of study taken by young people aged between 12 and 15 years in Ireland, Northern <Col N="283" /> Ireland and England.  These units are: The Normans, Water, Plantation in the 17th century, Attitudes to Conflict (1914-21) and Migration.  These units, which meet the curricular requirements in all three jurisdictions, examine issues in history and geography in a way that moves the focus from the local to the national and international.</P>
    <P>The European studies programme, which also has two other components in a modern language programme and a more focused European awareness programme, has been widely recognised throughout the EU as a coherent, flexible and well organised initiative offering innovative approaches to many aspects of the European dimension in education.  It involves communication by students through E-mail, the Internet, surface mail and student exchange in 321 schools in 17 European countries. This is likely to increase to 400 next year with 100 schools from Ireland and 85 schools from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the White Paper it is planned to actively promote the further expansion of the European studies programme through its expansion to primary schools and encouraging and assisting the participation of more schools from disadvantaged areas.  It is clear that, if our young people are to develop and value a sense of themselves as young Europeans, they will require a through understanding and appreciation of their own proud national heritage and homeland.  The closer integration of Europe in the 21st century will be possible only through a rich diversity of heritage in the nations of Europe out of which has come &mdash; through long centuries &mdash; a growing sense of what is shared and common. This enrichment is to be found in history and geography and through the exciting European studies programme.</P>
    <P>We are being guided by the White Paper commitment, which spells out curricular aims and principles.  It states <Col N="284" /> that the introduction of the junior certificate programme in 1989, provided, a single, unified programme for students. The programme is based on the following curricular principles: breadth and balance, quality, continuity and progression, and coherence.  The junior cycle curriculum has a wider perspective than the mere choice and range of subjects. The curricular framework at junior cycle is intended to provide a wide context for the various subjects on offer.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting in Galway, I addressed principals and managers of secondary schools on this theme, and asked them to offer their wisdom as we in education move forward in providing all students with an opportunity to study a balanced and relevant curriculum.  The passion, the concern and the intensity of the debate generated in recent weeks, demonstrate an increasing awareness and interest among the public in what we want our students to be taught.  As Minister for Education, it is my responsibility to seek to meet the public's concerns, and ensure that our students receive a balanced and relevant education during compulsory years of junior cycle.</P>
    <P>We have to seek a consensus about the role of the arts, science, technology, language and computer literacy.  We have to examine the range of other areas that are critically important &mdash; some of them growing day by day in importance.  We need to do this so that we can give our young people all round confidence for a changing world.  We have to do that against the background of increasing stresses on young people. In other words, we cannot solve these problems by just overloading an already busy curriculum.  The needs of our young people are changing and we, as a community, must develop a set of priorities that meet the education needs of a young people as they face into the next millennium just four years away.</P>
    <P>Once the NCCA has completed its report it is my intention to make a series <Col N="285" /> of recommendations to my Government colleagues on the junior cycle core curriculum, including my commitment to the retention of the study of history and geography in the junior certificate core curriculum.  Whatever short-term difficulties we may encounter from time to time, the debate on education and education issues which has extended over the past three years is a healthy sign of our democracy.</P>
    <P>During my years there has been an unprecedented process of consultation between my Department and the partners in education.</P>

We in Ireland, of all countries, need an understanding of our heritage and of that past which has shaped and influenced our development through the ages.</P>

Caithfimid féachaint ar an gceist, cén fáth go mbeadh sé i gceist stair a bhaint den churriculum.  An bhfuil ábhar níos tábhachtaí le cur in a h-áit?  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil.  An bhfuil eachtraí i gcúrsaí staire na tíre gur mhaith linn a cheilt ar ár scoláirí?  Ní ceart go mbeadh.  Nach mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr an fhírinne a insint dóibh agus cabhrú leo ceacht a fhoghlaim don am atá romhainn ó rudaí a tharla leis na cianta.  Nó an bhfuil imní ar dhaoine go bhfuil eachtraí i stair na <Col N="287" /> tíre nach n-oireann dá ndearcadh féin ar Éire na nóchadaí?  An gcuireann an stair isteach ar phlean mór éigin don tír san aois nua?  Creideann cuid de mhúin teoirí staire na tíre a labhair liom gurb é sin atá i gceist.  Tá sé in am stop a chur leis an bpleidhcíocht sin.</P>
    <P>Pléadh rún ar na h-ábhair seo ag Comhdháil na Meánmhúinteoirí um Cháisc i mbliana.  Ba léir go raibh suim ann ag múinteoirí seachas iad siúd a bhfuil na hábhair seo á múineadh acu. Mhúineas féin an dá ábhar i measc a lán ábhar eile mar mhúinteoir bunscoile ar feadh fiche bliain.  Chuir an méid suime a bhí ag páistí i stair ach go háirithe ionadh an domhain orm.  Theastaigh uathu a fháil amach cad a thárla in a ndúiche féin síos tríd na céadta.  Bhí an t-ádh linn a bheith in ar gcómhnaí sa Bhoireann, áit a bhfuil iarsmaí na gcéadta agus na mílte bliana d'aois.  Tá sé deacair do pháistí óga idirdhealú a dhéanamh idir eachtraí a tharla céad bliain ó shin agus eachtraí a tharla míle bliain ó shin agus meascann siad le chéile iad go minic.</P>
    <P>Ní bheinn buartha faoi sin, áfach. Fuair siad amach ón stair gur mhair daoine beo ar an oileán seo ar feadh na mílte bliana, go bhfuair siad bia agus deoch ó na páirceanna céanna, gur aistrigh siad ó bheith ag fiach go dtí an fheirmeoireacht agus ar aghaidh go dtí an lá atá inniu ann.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go raibh an iomarca béime ar chathanna mór agus ar chogaidh de gach sort nuair a bhíomar ar scoil &mdash; agus liostaí de dhátaí agus de dhaoine mór-le-rá i gcúrsaí polaitíochta.  Bhí sé deacair, agus chun an fhírinne a rá, ní raibh sé ró-shuimiúil.  Tháinig athrú ar sin nuair a leathnaíodh an t-ábhar timpeall fiche bliana ó shin.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire tagairt don Ionad Staire agus Iarsmalann i mo pharóiste féin i gCorra Fine i gContae an Chláir. Bhí sé de bhuntáiste agam go raibh an fear a bhunaigh é, Iognáid Ó Cléirigh, ina mhúinteoir bunscoile agam.  Ar <Col N="288" /> dheis Dé go raibh a anam.  Ba shár mhúinteoir é i ngach ábhar ach bhí sé go hiontach mar scéalaí mar ba é sin an sórt múinteoir staire a bhí ann.  Chuir sé béim ar a bparóiste féin do na daltaí i bhfad roimh a chomh-mhúinteoirí agus roimh an Roinn Oideachais.  Cuireadh cúrsaí cultúrtha agus ealaíona san áir eamh.  Pléadh dul chun cinn i gcúrsaí feirmeoireachta agus eacnamaíochta. Thug sé eolas do na daltaí faoi an saol a bhí ann fadó ach níos tábhachtai fós cabhraíodh leo saol an lae inniu a chur i gcomhthéacs intuigthe.</P>
    <P>Tá obair an-shuimiúil á dhéanamh ag fochoiste na staire den NCCA agus chuir na baill moltaí chun cinn tamall ó shin.  Mhol siad, mar shampla, gur chóir leanúnachas a bheith ann ón gcúrsa sóisearach go dtí an cúrsa sinsearach.  Tá sé deacair a thuiscint conas a fhéadfaí sin a dhéanamh muna mbíonn na hábhair á staidéar don chúrsa sóisearach féin.</P>
    <P>Chuir mé suim sa mhéid a bhí le rá ag an Aire faoi na cúrsaí sa churriculum sna hábhair seo.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an cheist á phlé ag an NCCA agus, níos tábhachtaí, go mbeidh sí ag éisteacht leo.  Tá ionadh ar mhúinteoirí agus ar Chumann na Meanmhúinteoirí nár mhol an NCCA i 1993 gur cheart stair agus tíreolas a bheith mar bhun-ábhair sa churriculum sóisearach.  Tá imní ar scoláirí sna h-ollscoileanna a bhfuil na hábhair seo á staidéar acu nach mbeidh postanna le fáil acu ag múineadh na n-ábhar seo.</P>
    <P>Bhí alt an-suimiúil san <i>Irish Independent</i> inniu faoi thábhacht na tíreolaíochta ó léachtóir i gColáste na hOllscoile i mBaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé béim ar an ngá atá ann tuiscint leathan ar chúrsaí an domhain uile a thabhairt do dhaltaí agus tá sé imníoch faoin athrú atá á phleanáil.  An é polasaí an Pháipéir Bháin na hábhair seo a chur ar ceal?  Má tá an polasaí sin ann is ceart deireadh a chur leis.

      <P>It is obvious from the Minister's speech that the White Paper caused total confusion.  A White Paper should be intelligible to ordinary human beings.  I am still not clear on the Minister's definition of a core curriculum subject.  Throughout her speech she seems to contradict herself as to whether history and geography will be core curriculum subjects or subjects that will be available in all second level schools.  According to the White Paper the programme for all students at junior cycle will include core subjects of Irish, English, mathematics, a science or technological subject, and at least three further subjects from a wide range of full and short courses.  I cannot understand how anybody can say history and geography are specifically core subjects from that statement.  We are told we are meant to read that statement in conjunction with another statement that a knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment is also meant to be garnered in second level schools.  I fail to understand, how that specifically provides that history and geography are core subjects.  If the Minister meant them to be core subjects in second level schools why did she not say so and we would all understand it and there would be no confusion.</P>

      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister talked about not further imposing on schools &mdash; that is the 39 per cent of schools that do not have to provide history and geography although she rightly pointed out that <Col N="290" /> many do.  It is about time the Minister realised that under Department of Education regulations there is not a choice of free education within travelling distance for some people except the local vocational school.  Some of these schools, despite parent wishes, do not provide history and geography even as optional subjects.  In my community more than half the parents pay for grinds in history and geography because the school refused to provide those subjects. I would have thought the Minister would have made it compulsory for all schools providing second level education to provide the subjects as a choice, even in the vocational schools, and particularly where they are the only free schools in the area.  The Minister who has lectured for so long on &ldquo;parents say&rdquo; and &ldquo;pupils desires&rdquo; in education is not willing to require the schools to provide this basic service.</P>
      <P>The Minister lectured me here one day about not understanding the educational problems of Dublin.  This surprised me since I was educated in her constituency.  I certainly understand the educational problems of rural Ireland and the decisions being taken and implemented to perpetuate discrimination against young people growing up in rural areas where they do not have the same choice as others in education. They are now being told the Minister is unwilling, even if there is parent demand, to provide the core subjects which most children want in a secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will address the whole question of a basic curriculum.  Those of us who value education for education sake have a deep understanding of the difference between learning and technical knowledge. When I attended university I began a computer course.  At that time we were taught how to punch cards, a technical skill that is definitely irrelevant in 1996.  I also did the basic subjects of mathematics, physics and chemistry. Even though I do not use in my everyday life the basic knowledge I acquired the basic skills of how to learn stand to me in good stead.  When we talk <Col N="291" /> about core curriculum subjects we must decide what we are trying to do in our schools and whether we are trying to turn out technological robots or provide young children with Newman-type education in its broadest sense.  Our education system should focus on providing pupils with a basic knowledge of their roots, languages and mathematics.  It should also focus on basic native skills in metalwork and woodwork rather than high technology skills that will change with time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to raise on the Adjournment a matter which deeply concerns many parents in the area served by the Woodland national school in Letterkenny. The Department will have recently received two separate applications from Fr. Brian Quinn, the manager of the school.  The first relates to the appointment of an assistant teacher from September 1996 in view of the increased intake of pupils because of the rapidly increasing population in that developing suburban area and the second relates to the appointment of a full-time remedial teacher, where up to 40 pupils are in need of such a teacher.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that a teacher already on the staff was appointed two years ago as a remedial teacher for five schools, including Woodland, but time allows her to teach only English readings; she does not have time to teach basic mathematics.  It is appalling that those children are denied that basic education. A recent reply from the Minister on this subject stated that she could not provide additional remedical teachers at this time.  I understand she is constrained by the Minister for Finance as far as resources are concerned, but she should double her efforts in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> The second application is currently more pressing because it affects the ability of the school to place many children on its roll next September.  Unless an additional teacher is sanctioned for li = "2" fli = "2"September, the proposed intake of 52 junior infants will have to be reduced to one maximum class of approximately 33.  Furthermore, this would mean a possible intake of 85 junior infants in September 1997 which would exceed two maximum class sizes.</P>
    <P>It is now rather late in the day to tell up to 20 sets of parents that the school cannot accept their children in September. I am informed that the board of management does not intend to accept responsibility for this matter and proposes to tell the parents that if a teacher is not sanctioned they will have to event their anger on the Department of Education. I am sure the Minister, as parent, will understand the desperate disappointment in all those homes where plans are already afoot to send young children to school for the first time in the autumn.  She will also understand that for many of those children the entire education process will be delayed by a year because it would be virtually impossible to place them elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The people of the Woodland area have made heroic efforts in recent years to provide the extra school accommodation required because of the increasing population.  They deserve more than to have their children refused entry to school purely because of an inadequate number of teachers.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure this does not arise.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  Therefore, the majority of pupils with remedial needs would be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1995, an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.  Of the 3,203 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.</P>
    <P>I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted help to children in urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  These children too are worthy of our concern and support. Members will be only too familiar with the difficulties faced by many of our children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the life long problems which can result from failure to address the special educational needs of these children.</P>
    <P>Under my recent initiative I am targeting significant resources in both staff and funding at selected schools in urban and rural areas which suffer from serious educational disadvantage.  I have commissioned the Education Research Centre to invite applications for participation in this new initiative and I expect that the target schools will be contacted very shortly in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my record in developing the remedial teaching service since my appointment as Minister for Education provides concrete evidence of my commitment to the children in question.  Since my appointment I have approved the allocation of an additional 241 remedial teachers to the service at primary level.  I am also satisfied that, within the overall resources available to me, I have succeeded in bringing about significant improvement across the entire range of special needs services.  The school referred to by the Deputy currently shares the service of a remedial teacher with four other primary schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> Of the 178 ordinary national schools in County Donegal, 106 now have the services of a remedial teacher on a fulltime or shared basis.  This includes nine schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that approximately 78 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Donegal currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>At this stage 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when I took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.  It is a matter of regret that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, I do not have unlimited resources.  As Minister for Education I have to consider demands for improved services across a wide range of special needs and unfortunately, I am not always in a position to meet all these demands.  I have to decide priorities and try to allocate available resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year I have adopted a particular focus on the special needs of children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources at this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage in education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that conditions at Kilrush community school have so frustrated the staff, students and parents that the TUI finds it necessary to take strike action tomorrow.  The immediate cause of the strike is the failure to appoint a permanent teacher in the woodwork and technical graphics area.  The decision is set against a number of years of frustration because the school is located on three separate campuses, causing great difficulty for <Col N="295" /> teachers and students.  Seven permanent appointments have been lost from the school and one teacher has been made ex-quota, but not one permanent appointment has been made.</P>
      <P>The practical subjects of woodwork, technical graphics and construction studies in particular have taken a severe blow.  Where previously in the vocational school there were two permanent teachers in this area, at present there is no permanent teacher of these subjects.  The present leaving certificate students have had four different teachers of woodwork, construction studies and technical graphics.  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the present woodwork teacher will be available in September.  Parents have expressed their disappointment at the range of practical subjects available.  For four years the school staff and everybody associated with it have lobbied for a permanent appointment.  They have also lobbied, unsuccessfully, to have a building constructed.</P>
      <P>To underline the difficulties that exist I wish to refer to a study by the West Clare Community Development Resource Centre on young people and educational disadvantage in Kilrush.  It found that given the well documented tendency for patterns of educational disadvantage to reproduce within families, it is clear that the children of people who are unemployed have a significantly higher than average risk of educational disadvantage.  It is also clear that the educational role modelling these young people receive within the home is much more likely to encourage practical skill training in areas such as woodwork, metalwork and art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kilrush community school has a wider catchment than the area surveyed. Nevertheless, the west Clare Youthreach programme, local primary schools and Kilrush community school identified very clear family patterns of educational disadvantage and early school <Col N="296" /> leaving.  All these bodies are very concerned about the problem but none has been able to access sufficient resources to deal with it effectively.  They propose a range of preventive measures, central to which is recognition of the importance of encouraging and enabling young people to remain at school.  This task is particularly important in the context of subjects such as woodwork, metalwork, domestic science and art which enable the development of practical skills.</P>
    <P>In a survey of parents of Youthreach trainees, every parent expressed regret at the closure of the vocational school, particularly on the grounds that it narrowed the range of practical subjects available to their children.  I call on the Minister to make a permanent appointment in this area.  I understand that a 90 per cent quota restriction applies. Apparently the number of permanent teachers relative to entire staffing in the school is 89.31 per cent.  The Minister may point out, which from her perspective is reasonable, that to make a permanent appointment would raise the quota to over 90 per cent.  Nevertheless, in the circumstances pertaining in Kilrush and particularly in view of the frustration suffered as a result of having to operate in three centres, I urge the Minister to allow a permanent appointment with immediate effect to enable the teachers to deliver a good service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify the situation in relation to the threatened strike in Kilrush community school.  The Teacher's Union of Ireland submitted official notice of strike action at Kilrush community school to both the board of management of the school and my Department in a letter dated 22 May 1996.  According to the TUI the reason for the proposed strike, which is scheduled to take place tomorrow, is the refusal by my Department to allow the appointment of a permanent teacher of woodwork and technical graphics in the <Col N="297" /> school.  At present this post is filled by a temporary teacher.</P>
      <P>To clarify the situation, I wish to advise the House of the position in relation to the approved teacher allocations and teacher appointments in second level schools.  In this sector, the approved number of teaching posts is determined by reference to the school's enrolments and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratio.  It is then open to the authorities of the individual schools to submit an appeal for an increased allocation on the basis of projected increases in enrolment or in respect of identified curricular needs.  My Department considers each appeal on its merits, decides on the final approved allocation for the school year in question and notifies the school authorities accordingly.</P>
      <P>In the case of Kilrush community school, my Department has approved additional allocations for the past number of years over and above those warranted by the pupil-teacher ratio.  Having received its allocation of teachers, their appointment is, in the first instance, a matter for the authorities of the school.  In the case of community schools all appointments are subject to the approval of my Department.  My Department has for many years operated a ceiling on the proportion of posts in community schools which may be filled in a permanent capacity.  Up to 90 per cent of the allocation warranted by the pupil-teacher ratio and approved ex-quota posts may be filled on a permanent basis.  The balance of the approved teacher allocation may be filled by part-time and-or temporary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for limiting the number of permanent teachers in a community school.  First, it allows school authorities an acceptable level of flexibility to enable them to cope with a range of curricular demands within the approved teacher allocation for the school.  Second, in the absence of <Col N="298" /> a redeployment scheme in the community-comprehensive school sector the limit of 90 per cent permanency helps to prevent surplus posts arising as a result of declining enrolments.</P>
    <P>The present position in the case of Kilrush community school is that its teacher allocation based on the current pupil-teacher ratio is approximately 33.5 teachers.  In addition, my Department has allocated this school a further four posts over and above that justified by strict reference to the current pupil-teacher ratio.  These four additional posts were allocated on the basis of identified curricular needs within the school.  My Department is at present in consultation with the school authorities in relation to its final allocation for the 1996-97 school year.  Were the school to now increase the number of posts filled in a permanent capacity this would result in its exceeding the 90 per cent limit which applies in this sector.</P>
    <P>In this context, the general question of increasing the level of permanency in the community-comprehensive and vocational sectors has been the subject of discussions between my Department, the teacher unions and management in accordance with the provisions in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It is appropriate that any adjustment to the present ceiling on the level of pernmanency should be dealt with within the framework of those discussions rather than at the level of the individual school.  In the event of an increase in the approved level of permanency being agreed, the revised limit will be applied to all community schools including Kilrush.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Teachers' Union of Ireland has decided on strike action in this case.  My Department has indicated that it is available to discuss the staffing situation in Kilrush with union representatives. As is evidenced by the final allocations which were approved for the school over recent years, my <Col N="299" /> Department has demonstrated a willingness and capacity to meet the identified curricular needs of the school.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. I raise it in the context of the very serious problems which have arisen in the beef sector as a result of the BSE scare which has led to severe downward pressure on the prices paid for beef cattle and a consequent backward pressure on the prices paid to dairy farmers for stores and calves.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the problems which have arisen in regard to the area aid application forms.  In many cases minor clerical errors can lead to the loss of thousands of pounds for farmers by way of grant aid under various headings.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should systematically examine applications with minor and not so minor unintentional errors to see how best the difficulties can be dealt with.  It is intolerable that farmers facing a crisis as a result of the BSE problem should be deprived of thousands of pounds because of an error in the completion of an area aid application form.  In many cases this funding can mean the difference between survival or going to the wall.</P>
      <P>If the problem can be solved by discussing the matter with the EU Commission, then the Minister should avail of the opportunity to do so.  It is clear that these errors will impact on beef farmers.  The Minister should seriously consider this issue and systematically examine all applications in which there are errors to see how best the problem can be tackled.</P>

      <Col N="300" /> I fully acknowledge that beef producers have gone through a very difficult period since the beginning of this year as a result of the various reductions in export refunds last autumn and, more recently, the BSE crisis following the announcement by the British Minister for Health on 20 March in the House of Commons of the possible link between BSE and CJD.  The difficulties being experienced by our producers are evidenced by the substantial fall in cattle prices since the beginning of the year, which has resulted in income losses for many producers.  The Minister's objectives throughout the difficulties have been, first, to ensure that the market was adequately supported through the introduction of emergency intervention measures and, second, to secure compensation for the income losses arising from the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable commentator would acknowledge that the Minister has been very successful in achieving these objectives. The Commission introduced emergency intervention measures immediately after the onset of the BSE crisis.  These arrangements have worked very well to date and have succeeded in disposing of most of the backlog of cattle which had built up on farms in the immediate aftermath of the announcement in the House of Commons.  In any event, I am satisfied that the emergency intervention measures prevented a complete collapse in the market, not just in Ireland but across Europe.</P>
    <P>It was always evident that the emergency intervention measures on their own would not be sufficient to support cattle prices at reasonable levels.  For this reason it has been agreed that compensation will be paid to beef producers who suffered income losses because of the BSE crisis.  The original Commission suggestions provided for increases in the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium at a cost of £540 million to the European Union.  I understand that the compensation proposal, which is expected to be finalised by the Commission tomorrow, is likely to provide <Col N="301" /> for greater flexibility to member states to use some of the compensation for specific measures targeted at those producers worst affected by the crisis.</P>
    <P>The proposal will, of course, then be subject to negotiation in the Council of Ministers and will also require the opinion of the European Parliament. The Minister will seek to ensure that the final decision in the Council is framed in a way that best suits Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>On the question of area aid applications, the EU allows correction by member states of &ldquo;obvious errors&rdquo; in such applications.  One category of such errors is defined as purely clerical and containing no risk of fraud and includes boxes not filled in or information lacking, incorrect statistical or bank codes, mathematical errors, figures reversed &mdash; for example plot 169 instead of plot 196 &mdash; and incorrect plot numbers on applications which can be corrected by reference to accompanying maps.  These errors can be corrected without notification from the applicant.</P>
    <P>A second category of such errors is defined as less obvious than those I have mentioned and can be corrected only where the farmer notifies the error to the member state before he or she is made aware that an on-farm inspection is to be carried out on his or her holding. Confusion between acres and hectares is cited by the European Commission as one of the errors that falls into this category.</P>
    <P>My Department uses the &ldquo;obvious errors&rdquo; provision to correct such errors. For example, if the area of a land parcel is shown on a map accompanying an area aid application as 23.7 hectares but is shown on the application as 27.3 hectares, my Department amends the area on the application to 23.7 hectares without penalising the applicant for that mistake. Likewise, if a map accompanying an application shows a land parcel which is omitted inadvertently from the <Col N="302" /> application by the farmer, my Department can add that parcel to the application as long as the accompanying map makes it plain that the omission was an obvious error on the part of the farmer.</P>
    <P>In addition to the flexibility given to my Department by the EU provision on &ldquo;obvious errors&rdquo;, there is also provision in the relevant EU regulations for not penalising area aid applicants in respect of errors made by them on foot of &ldquo;information recognised by the competent authority&rdquo;.  If, for example, the contractor employed by my Department to digitise maps submitted by farmers between 1993 and 1995 digitises some of those maps incorrectly through the contractor's misreading of those maps rather than through errors made in them by the farmers and issues maps with contractor errors in them, then this paragraph of the EU regulations means my Department should not and will not penalise applicants for any mistakes on their 1996 area aid applications or accompanying maps that may arise from such contractor errors.  Equally, if a Land Registry or Ordnance Survey map used by a farmer as the basis for his or her area aid application has an incorrect area for a particular land parcel shown thereon, then that farmer will not be penalised if he or she makes an error based on that incorrect area.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that there is flexibility for dealing with obvious errors and with errors made on the basis of incorrect officially recognised information in relation to farmers' area aid applications.  However, my Department has to be very careful to ensure that this flexibility, which is so useful in dealing with many cases, is not abused in categories of errors that do not fall into those I have outlined.  The difficult situation in the beef sector cannot be used by my Department to extend that flexibility to other errors. However, I assure Deputy Kirk that the flexibility we now have will be applied <Col N="303" /> to the maximum extent possible to all 1996 area aid applications.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Milk Quota Super Levy Liability.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this matter of extreme importance to a number of farmers I represent in the Clare constituency, some 500 of whom face a crisis in regard to the milk super levy.  A combination of factors has caused this problem.  First, last year was one of the best ever for production, second, there was a severe shortage of temporary leasing and, third, there were difficulties regarding flexi-milk.</P>
      <P>Some farmers face fines of between £1,000 and £6,000; one who contacted me last week was faced with a fine of £11,000.  This is causing great distress and anxiety not only to farmers but their families, hitting them at the most expensive time of the year.  We must remember that farmers must pay for feed and, if in financial difficulty, they cannot pay a silage contractor, in addition, a farmer must pay for fertiliser and if he is in financial difficulties he will not be able to pay his hardware shop bills.</P>
      <P>This difficulty with regard to the milk levy will exacerbate nervousness on the part of banks, affecting not only farmers' spending capacity but it will have a negative, knock-on effect on the overall local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These fines could put some dairy farmers in Clare out of business and may well drive some engaged in farming in the west from the land altogether. These fines amount to £0.5 million in west Clare alone, an already vulnerable area economically and, out of the £4 million super levy fines owed nationally, £1 million is due from County Clare. Many of those with a small milk quota are young farmers with a green certificate just embarking on farming who, like many others, will have small quotas <Col N="304" /> and insufficient funds to buy or lease extra quotas.</P>
    <P>What action must be taken in present circumstances?  The Minister will have to examine the overall position in the short-term while simultaneously devising a long-term strategy.  In the short-term, does the Minister envisage any role for the co-operatives in addressing these fines?  How does he envisage a farmer being able to pay these fines? With regard to the long-term, a separate agency must be established to ensure that the Clare quota remains within the county and that leasing methods are examined urgently.</P>
    <P>We must also receive answers to certain questions.  Is it viable to purchase a quota?  If someone wants to get out of dairying and wishes to sell his quota, will it have an asset value?  Will a milk quota have an asset value after the year 2000?  If a farmer does not have X number of cows after the year 2000, will it be possible to obtain a quota and, if not, will compensation be forthcoming and, if so, what form will it take?</P>
    <P>The Minister must address the short-term problem facing so many of my constituents which is causing them and their families great heartache.  Decisions need to be taken in an open manner.  I hope the Minister will avail of the opportunity to examine the long-term problems of milk quotas and be up front with Members as regards proposed solutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy de Valera for raising this matter on the Adjournment and compliment her on her in-depth knowledge of the milk quota system, especially as operated in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the exact extent of the national super levy liability for the 1995-96 milk quota year is not yet finally established, there is little doubt that excess deliveries are in the region of 11 million gallons resulting in a levy bill of almost £15 million. The extent of this levy, in the main, <Col N="305" /> is a reflection of two factors in particular, namely, the excellent summer for milk production in 1995-96 and the buoyant milk price.  Of course it should be noted that the high milk price within the EU is a direct function of the milk quota system in the first place.  Unlimited supply of milk in a very short time would result in prices that are considerably below the level enjoyed by producers today.</P>
    <P>The levy liability will, of course, be spread over producers who exceeded their quota throughout the country and in the majority of co-operatives dairies. Many producers who face a penalty for 1995-96 may do so for the first time since the introduction of the milk quota system in 1984.  Others will have incurred a larger penalty than in any of the previous milk quota years in which a super levy liability was incurred.  The extent of this year's bill is put in context when we compare the likely outcome to Ireland's super levy history to date.  The total amount of super levy previously paid by Ireland, since 1984, was approximately £27 million.</P>
    <P>However, I must point out that the operation of the milk quota system in Ireland has always been very heavily biased in favour of smaller producers. As I have already said, the fact that many of these are situated in the west, north and north-east, means that these sensitive areas have benefited to the greatest extent from this policy.</P>
    <P>Apart from various special reserve allocations which have been distributed over the years, the rules governing ongoing schemes such as temporary leasing, restructuring and the allocation of unused reference quantities &mdash; flexi-milk &mdash; ensure that smaller scale producers have first priority access to all quota becoming available for redistribution.</P>
    <P>As a further encouragement to smaller producers, particularly those in sensitive areas, to expand their enterprise, two major new measures <Col N="306" /> were introduced into the restructuring scheme in late 1994, namely, a subsidy towards the cost of purchasing additional quota by smaller scale producers and a restriction whereby quota surrendered from disadvantaged areas would be retained in those areas.</P>
    <P>These measures have proved extremely successful in ensuring surrendered quota has been retained in these areas.  They have also helped smaller scale producers to increase their production capacity.  Under the 1994 and the 1995 subsidised restructuring schemes, my Department has paid, or is in the process of paying, subsidy on foot of over 7,500 applications.  The most recent level of subsidy under this scheme was 75 pence per gallon.</P>
    <P>The introduction of quota ring fencing into our national milk quota regulations in 1995 has also further helped to achieve the stated objective of retaining viable family farms in the disadvantaged areas by ensuring that quota cannot be transferred from these areas by way of land and quota transactions.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach was most influential in ensuring that decision as was Father Harry Bohan, whom I am sure the Deputy knows will.</P>
    <P>While these measures are implemented with a view to improving the position of the smaller producers, they must, be realistically seen in their proper context &mdash; mechanisms for a biased operation of a quota system in favour of a certain category of producers. Notwithstanding these schemes, it should be emphasised, that the management of quota at farm level is the sole responsibility of each individual producer.  Producers are regularly advised of this and of the national quota situation in monthly ministerial and departmental statements and encouraged to keep in close contact with their co-operatives and their advisers on how best to plan and manage their own quotas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> Returning to the liability for levy, I must stress that the actual amount of the liability for each individual co-op dairy will not be finalised for a number of weeks yet.  Further flexi-milk will be available following the distribution of national flexi-milk.  This allocation will obviously result in a <Col N="308" /> reduction in the liability of individual farmers, in particular, smaller scale producers who remain the priority beneficiaries under the milk quota regime as operated in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 May 1996.</P>

It has been raised previously in the House in the context of the recent French nuclear testing in the Muroroa Atoll.  The European Commission has already decided that Article 34 did not apply to French nuclear testing in Polynesia.</P>
      <P>While I am deeply concerned about the safety of the British nuclear industry, I am unaware of any activities being undertaken in Britain which would fall within the terms of Article 34.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment of Article 34 must be assessed by reference to a general review and update of the health and safety provisions of Euratom.  I consider these provisions to be relatively weak, and therefore greater emphasis needs to be placed on the health, safety and environmental aspects in the Treaty. This issue has been raised by Ireland in the context of preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference which is <Col N="60" /> considering amendments to the Treaties of the Union.</P>
    <P>However, as I have stated on a number of occasions, any amendment to the Euratom Treaty would require the unanimous agreement of all member states.  This unanimity would be difficult to achieve given the opposition of certain member states to any review of Euratom and the lack of enthusiasm for revision by others.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the obvious instituational and substantive difficulties facing us in seeking to have the Eurotom Treaty amended, the Government is considering how to address the desirability of enhancing the health and safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty in the context of our EU Presidency and in the light of the further enlargement of the EU.</P>
    <P>In relation to the United Kingdom nuclear operators, this Government has used, and continues to use, every opportunity at all appropriate international fora, in particular at the European Union level, at the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international fora, as well as direct representations to the United Kingdom Government, to highlight its concerns about the serious threat posed by the UK's nuclear industry, in particular the Sellafield plant, and about the level of safety in the UK's nuclear industry generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union has adopted the objective of stabilising CO2 emissions in the Union as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> Ireland's National CO2 abatement strategy was formulated in 1993 with the objective of limiting the increase in CO2 emissions to 20 per cent over 1990 levels by 2000.  This strategy was designed around targets and measures which will accommodate necessary economic growth in addition to contributing to the stabilisation of community CO2 emissions. Measures in the areas of transport and energy policy will contribute to the realisation of these objectives.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 includes provision for substantial EU assisted investments in the mainline railway network and public transport services in the greater Dublin area.  Total investment in the mainline rail work will amount to £275 million in the period.</P>
    <P>An investment of £295 million will enable substantial progress to be made on implementation of the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI) including the introduction of a light rail network and quality bus corridors.  Implementation of the DTI strategy will result in a significant shift from private to public transport and produce positive environmental effects with a marked reduction in COS and other pollutants.</P>
    <P>Energy efficiency has been highlighted as a means of reducing CO2 and other harmful emissions.  In this regard I refer to the work of the Irish Energy Centre which is a joint initiative of my Department and Fobairt.  The centre was established in 1994 and its budget for the period 1994 to 1999 is £21 million. The centre operates two grant schemes, the energy audit grant scheme and the energy efficiency investment support scheme which provides funds for energy auditing and investment activities.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have placed a high priority on the promotion of renewable energy.  The first alternative energy requirement, known as AER 1, resulted in the offering of 34 contracts to independent producers of electricity from alternative energy sources which <Col N="62" /> amount to a total additional electrical capacity of 111 MW.</P>
    <P>Technologies supported were wind energy, hydro energy, land fill gas, energy from waste and combined heat and power.  The results represent a total investment in alternative energy in the order of £70 million.</P>
    <P>In December 1995, I launched a competition for the construction and operation of a biomass fuelled power plant of up to 30MW electrical capacity.  This initiative will be grant supported up to £7.5 million, to be funded from the European Regional Development Fund. The plant must be operational by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>On 26 April last, I made a statement on long-term renewable energy policy and copies of my strategy document are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The strategy sets targets of 100MW for the installation of additional electricity from renewable energy sources by 1999, which will be supported by up to £7.5 million European Regional Development Fund funding, and the installation of further renewable electricity capacity of 390 MW by 2010.  This initiative and the other measures already outlined by me will contribute to the realisation of Ireland's CO2 emission targets.</P>
    <P>For each MW of renewable energy installed, CO2 emissions are reduced by an average of 1,000 tonnes per annum. Therefore, my initiatives could reduce CO2 by 250,000 tonnes per annum by the year 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.  Having said that I would point out that since the establishment of the single market on 1 January 1993, all European Economic Area (EEA) airlines are free to operate on any international route within the EEA without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  The question of whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
      <P>In relation to access from the US I should point out that under existing policy on transatlantic services enshrined in the bilateral agreement, there are no restrictions whatsoever on US airlines operating services, either scheduled or charter, from any point in the US to Shannon.</P>
      <P>In addition US airlines may operate any number of direct non-stop charter services from any point in the US to Knock Airport.  Similarly Irish airlines can operate an unlimited number of charter services to Shannon and Knock from any US point and unlimited scheduled services to Shannon from four US points i.e. New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore if an Irish or US airline wishes to operate services to/from Dublin then an equivalent US service must be operated to/from Shannon.  This policy has clear benefits for the West of Ireland in that it ensures that any growth in US-Ireland air services will lead to growth in services to Shannon. Of course, again, the question of <Col N="65" /> whether any airline inaugurates a particular service is purely a commercial decision for that airline.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, I recently announced the Government's approval for a scheme of Exchequer grants for the six regional airports &mdash; Donegal, Sligo, Knock, Galway, Kerry and Waterford.  The scheme of grants will total £2.35 million over the four years to 1999.</P>
    <P>The regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.  The Exchequer grants scheme should not be seen by the regional airports as an indication that local community support is no longer needed for the survival and success of these airports.  It is crucial that the airport companies continue to develop sources of local financial support.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department in 1993 introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.</P>
    <P>So far operating contracts have been awarded for Kerry/Dublin and Galway/Dublin routes.  Tenders for the Donegal/Dublin and Sligo/Dublin routes are at present being processed by my Department in consultation with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Choice of destination within Ireland is clearly a matter of personal preference for the individual traveller.  Any questions relating to broader efforts being undertaken to address any perceived imbalance in regional distribution of tourism growth are more properly addressed to my colleague, <Col N="66" /> Deputy Enda Kenny, Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of EU funding for nuclear fusion research being reduced and redirected towards renewable energy and conservation.</P>
      <P>My Department promotes research in the areas of energy conservation and renewables with the assistance of the EU Joule energy research programme. Joule has a budget of 435MECU for the period of 1994 to 1998.  The commission issue a competitive call for tender under this programme every two years.  In 1995, and as a result of the 1994 call, 13 projects with an Irish involvement were offered support, resulting in a total financial benefit to Ireland of over £1 million.</P>
      <P>The Nuclear Fusion Research Programme has been allocated 840MECU by the EU under the Fourth Framework Programme for the period 1994 to 1998. Spending is currently running at approximately 200MECU per year. Fusion research has a long time frame and expenditure on it is not likely to impact on energy supplies for some decades, if ever.  In October 1995, at the request of Ireland and the Netherlands, the EU Research Council initiated an external assessment of the fusion research programme, in order to evaluate progress to date, before deciding on future strategy.  This assessment which is ongoing at present will include a comparison with other types of energy generation, including renewables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> I will seek to ensure that the immediate and real benefits to be gained from research into renewables will be fully recognised in the assessment of the fusion programme and would hope that this would lead to an increased emphasis on renewables research in the future.</P>

      <P>The function of the committee is to secure accessibility improvements to all modes of public transport which can be implemented within the resources available to transport providers and other relevant bodies.  The committee pursues its objectives primarily through liaison with transport operators and other organisations directly involved in the supply of public transport services, including the companies within the CIE Group, who are represented on the committee and participate fully in its work.  The nature of the work of the committee means that it does not issue formal reports or make formal recommendations to me.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from my replies to previous questions that the committee has met with considerable success.  For example, a high degree of accessibility has already been achieved on the railway system and a firm basis has been established for further accessibility improvement to trains and stations.  The CIE bus companies are committed to obtaining the most accessible and user-friendly vehicles available, on a cost-effective basis.  Their urban fleet replacement programmes are proceeding by reference to the recommended specifications of the UK disabled persons' transport advisory committee.  Bus Éireann's Expressway fleet now includes more than 190 coaches whose front section may be lowered to facilitate boarding and all new additions to the fleet will have this facility.</P>
      <P>Both bus companies are monitoring technical and operational developments as regards wheelchair accessable low-floor buses with a view to identifying cost-effective and operationally-proven vehicles of this type which would be suitable for their overall requirements.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under long-standing agreed arrangements, my Department is notified of incidents of a radiological nature as soon as the UK <Col N="72" /> authorities themselves are informed by the nuclear operators.  On receipt of the notification, this Department immediately seeks the views of the RPII on the radiological and health implications for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Where individual notifications require clarification or other follow-up action, this takes place between Irish and UK officials promptly.</P>
      <P>The number of incidents of a radiological nature reported formally to my Department from 1990 to 1995 are as follows: 1990, 11 incidents; 1991, six incidents; 1992, eight incidents; 1993, 17 incidents; 1994, 15 incidents; 1995, 16 incidents.  The Deputy may also wish to know that to date in 1996, my Department has been notified of four incidents.</P>
      <P>Generally, the notification arrangements have been working satisfactorily since 1986 although I would like to see the scope of formally notified incidents extended to include incidents not involving a release of radioactivity.</P>
      <P>On-site incidents that compromise worker safety are reported to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) of the Health and Safety Executive.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications does not receive formal notification of such incidents. However, there are arrangements in place such that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are notified by the NII of these incidents who in turn pass this information onto me.  The Health and Safety Executive in the UK also publish a general statement about incidents on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>All nuclear incidents are unacceptable to the Irish Government, and I am continuously monitoring the frequency and totality of UK incidents with a view to highlighting the need for significant safety improvements.</P>

      <P>The adoption of digital technology for the transmission of Irish television services in so far as it relates to broadcasting policy and the development of community television rests with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. My primary function in the matter relates to the planning and use of the radio frequency spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the Deputy, however, that the introduction of digital technology, particularly for terrestrially based systems, for the transmission of television services is at the initial stages of development world-wide.  Many issues relating to the technical standards and the planning and implementation for this technology are still under discussion at the international bodies which develop common positions on these <Col N="74" /> matters.  My officials are closely monitoring the situation as it develops at these fora and the application of the technology in Ireland will have due regard to the conclusions reached.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions between the two Departments concerned are necessary to determine the best strategy for the introduction of broadcast services using digital technology once the technical and planning issues are settled.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>County strategy groups have been established under the Operational Programme for Local Development to ensure co-ordination of the local development initiatives, including Leader.  The groups have been established in all counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it is appropriate that the elected public representatives should be included in the membership of county strategy groups.  As I indicated in reply to questions on 12 December 1995, this required the agreement of the European Commission and of the Monitoring Committee of the Operational Programme. Following consideration of the views of the monitoring committee, I am pleased to say that I am proceeding to increase the membership of county <Col N="75" /> strategy groups to include local authority members.  The Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has written to the Cathaoirleach of each county council and county borough council inviting the council to nominate three representatives to the relevant strategy group.  The nominations should provide a balanced approach to linking the various local development initiatives to the work of the council.</P>
    <P>Any change in the composition of the partnership boards, as with the composition of the county strategy groups, would require the agreement of the European Commission and of the Monitoring Committee of the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme.  It is not proposed that elected public representatives would form part of the Partnership boards, at this stage. County strategy groups will give local authority members a key role in the evolution of the local development initiatives generally.  However, all issues regarding the links between local government and local development initiatives are being considered by the devolution commission which is expected to submit its interim report to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>Vacancies for 3,400 temporary part-time census enumerators were advertised by the Central Statistics Office in the national and provincial press in November 1995. Posters advertising the vacancies were <Col N="76" /> also displayed in FÁS offices countrywide and in Department of Social Welfare local employment offices to encourage suitable persons on the live register to apply.  Application forms were issued and returned through FÁS.  Some 8,200 candidates were assessed by means of open competitive interview.  The interviews were conducted by temporary census field supervisors employed by the Central Statistics Office at various centres throughout the country. Appointments were subsequently offered by census management on an order of merit basis as determined by the interview boards, taking locational factors into account, with preference given to persons not in paid employment.</P>

      <P>The Government are very concerned at the deplorable human rights situation which has obtained in Burma since the assumption of power by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in 1988, and have pursued the matter both within the European Union and at the United Nations.  On 27 May 1996 I issued a statement expressing the Government's concern at the most recent round of detentions by Burma's military regime in advance of the Congress of the National League for Democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments in Burma are followed very closely within the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU and action taken accordingly.  Since 1988, the EU has suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burma, including the discontinuation or limitation of aid through UN Agencies.  A policy of international isolation has been applied strictly, blocking even World Bank, <Col N="79" /> International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank Funds for projects or programmes in or loans to Burma.</P>
    <P>In December 1995, on the occasion of the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok, to which SLORC leaders had been invited, the European Union issued a statement which, while welcoming the release of opposition leader and Nobel Prize Laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, urged SLORC to start a true and meaningful dialogue with the opposition.</P>
    <P>At United Nations' level Ireland has taken an active role in cosponsoring resolutions on the human rights situation in Burma, both at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR).  On 24 April 1996, the UNCHR adopted a resolution, cosponsored by Ireland, which deplored the continuing serious violations of human rights in Burma and the fact that many political leaders, including leaders and elected representatives of the National League for Democracy are being deprived of their freedom and their fundamental rights. The resolution also called on the Government of Burma to take all necessary measures to establish a democratic State in full accordance with the will of the people, as expressed in the democratic elections held in 1990.  At the UNCHR, the EU urged the SLORC to release immediately and unconditionally all detained political leaders and political prisoners and reiterated their call for dialogue with all Burma's political and ethnic groups and the establishment of multi-party democracy.</P>
    <P>Ireland, during its forthcoming EU Presidency, will seek to advance the process of democratisation and respect for human rights in Burma, and, to this end, will consider the development of a progressive critical dialogue with that country.</P>

      <P>A number of Irish groups wish the census form to include &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; as a separate ethnic or racial category. I understand their desire to ensure that the size and importance of the large Irish population be fully recognised. However, some Irish people in Britain prefer to be treated, for census purposes, no differently than other EU nationals resident there.</P>
      <P>The Embassy in Lonodon has ongoing contracts with Irish community groups in Britain about this and other issues and will keep the matter under review in consultation with them.  The overriding consideration has to be the interest of the Irish community as a whole.</P>

      <P>The recent announcement by the British Home Secretary that evidence of contamination has been found at the forensics explosives laboratory, Fort Halstead, Kent, raises the possiblity that convictions of a number of prisoners on explosives charges in Britain since 1989 may be affected.  As I stated in my recent reply, the possibility that any person might be convicted on the basis of doubtful evidence is a cause for grave concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> In that reply I stated my intention of raising this matter at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting on 22 May 1996.</P>
    <P>I confirm that I expressed our concern about the implications of these revelations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during this conference meeting.  I understand from these discussions that the Caddy Inquiry established to investigate the matter is expected to report within the next few months and that the legal representatives of those who may be effected are to be contacted by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>I will continue to urge the British authorities to ensure that the Caddy Inquiry and any necessary referrals to the Court of Appeal will proceed in an expeditious manner.</P>

However, they will make arrangements for an official to call to the person concerned to establish whether repayment or remission of tax in respect of the car would be possible under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, or whether any other provision may be of help in the circumstances.  I will communicate the results of their examination to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the event that the person concerned does not qualify for a repayment or remission of the tax, then vehicle registration tax will be payable at the rate of 23.2 per cent of the open market value selling price of the said vehicle at the time of registration in the State. Because of the nature of the tax I regret to say that there is no provision whereby it can be paid by instalments.</P>
      <P>The precise amount of tax, if payable, can only be assessed when the vehicle is inspected at the time of registration. However, the figure of £1,300 quoted in the details supplied is a reasonable approximation of the tax that might be due.</P>

      <Quest>the changes, if any, that were made in the Finance Act, 1996, in relation to tax relief for certain resort areas; and the effects, if any, these changes will have on the existing scheme that was introduced in July 1995.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 of this year's Finance Act amends the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts in respect of the self-catering aspect of the scheme. The action taken in this year's Finance act was necessary in order to close a loophole which was being exploited and to counter essentially contrived schemes of holiday cottages and apartments at maximum cost to the Exchequer.  These measures therefore prevent the self-catering holiday accommodation sector becoming a tax shelter and the object of over-investment to the detriment of other types of investment in seaside resort areas.</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the 1996 Finance Act amends only one aspect of the legislation dealing with the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts, namely, the self-catering area.  This amendment will not, for instance, affect hotels, guesthouses/B &amp; B establishments, holiday camps, leisure and sports facilities and all the other facilities which are eligible for relief under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, section 30 of the 1996 Finance Act restricts capital allowances for holiday cottages, apartments and other self-catering holiday accommodation in resort areas in two ways.  First, it provides that the double rent allowance and capital allowances cannot both apply in the case of holiday cottages, apartments and other self-catering accommodation. Second, the section restricts the manner <Col N="91" /> in which capital allowances for registered apartments and other self-catering accommodation can be set-off.  From 5 April 1996, capital allowances in such cases can only be offset against an individual's rental income, including rental income from other sources.  Likewise, where a trade is carried on, capital allowances can only be set against the income of the trade.  This is already the position with regard to registered holiday cottages where capital allowances have been ringfenced since 1992.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to point out to the Deputy that section 30 makes provision for very generous transitional arrangements to apply where certain conditions are met.  The restrictions imposed by section 30 will not apply where there is evidence that steps have been taken before 5 April 1996 in relation to the planning or development of holiday cottages, apartments or other self-catering accommodation.</P>
    <P>First, the section will not apply if, in relation to a holiday cottage etc., the following has taken place, before 5 April 1996:&mdash; (a) a contract for acquisition or construction was concluded, or; (b) a planning application was received by a planning authority, or; (c) a particular opinion was issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Second, the section will also not apply where, before 5 April 1996, land was acquired or a contract for the acquisition of land was concluded for the construction of a holiday cottage etc. However, this is conditional on a person being able to demonstrate that plans had been prepared and that discussions had taken place with a planning authority between budget day 1995 and 5 April 1996 and that a planning authority can give an affidavit to this effect.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the changes to the seaside resort scheme as enacted in this year's Finance Act are necessary and that ample provisions have been made to allow for projects which are only at an early stage of development.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The new registration/diploma programme in nursing leads to registration with An Bord Altranais and a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute. It complies with the rules and syllabus <Col N="98" /> of An Bord Altranais and relevant EU directives.  The programme continues to be delivered in the schools of nursing. Students on the traditional programme are part of the rostered workforce and are paid a salary while students on the new programme are supernumerary to service needs and receive a maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The registration diploma programme is commencing in the Cork Voluntary Hospitals School of Nursing this autumn and that school took in its last traditional student intake last month.  It is not envisaged that the integration of the new students in the autumn will present any difficulties for the school.</P>
      <P>Students who successfully complete the registration/diploma programme will be eligible to undertake one further academic year of study, at their own expense, leading to the award of a degree.  This is an optional year and is not a requirement for registration or employment.</P>
      <P>The one academic year degree programmes which are currently being developed will be open to existing nurses and those student nurses still following the traditional programme on the basis of short access courses and minimum post-registration experience. The possession of a diploma in nursing will not be a requirement for admission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the waiting list initiative the Government has allocated a total of £38 million in recent years to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialties where waiting times are considered excessive.</P>
      <P>The particular needs of children have been recognised under the initiative. Special emphasis was placed on providing funding to ensure a reduction in waiting lists where waiting times for children were in excess of six months. Procedures such as tonsils/adenoids, grommets, plastic surgery including cleft palates, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, general surgery, and urology were targeted as needing particular attention.</P>
      <P>When the initiative commenced in June 1993 the total number of adults waiting over 12 months and children waiting over six months was 14,624.  By 31 December 1995 this figure had been reduced to 10,841.  This represents a reduction of 3,783 or almost 26 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the provision of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> £7 million is being provided this year towards reducing the numbers on waiting lists for hospital treatment.  The detailed allocation of the resources to be provided this year has yet to be finalised.  However, as in previous years, particular account will be taken of the needs of children.  Resources will continue to be allocated to those areas where the waiting times for surgery are excessively long.  Discussions with health agencies to identify those areas <Col N="100" /> where the additional resources available this year can be employed to maximum effect are almost complete and I expect to be able to notify allocations under the 1996 waiting list initiative to health agencies shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Neither asthma nor arthritis is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981. Accordingly, there are no statistics available in the Department regarding the number of people with either of these conditions.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme covers the following 15 specified illnesses: mental handicap; mental illness, for persons under 16 only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from any of these illnesses are entitled to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme having regard to the support which is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as asthma or arthritis.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc., due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility <Col N="102" /> for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Supporting dependent elderly people at home is a major objective of health policy.  As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent elderly people in their own homes.  In recent years my Department has encouraged health boards to provide support services for the elderly and their carers whether by services in the home such as home help or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home.</P>
      <P>I am also very supportive of the effort made by the Carers' Association in raising the profile of those within the community who care for people with disabilities, dependent elderly people and those with severe illnesses.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the respite care grants scheme was transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Welfare in 1995.  Last year, £500,000 was allocated to the health boards for the scheme and I understand that the Carers' Association benefited nationally to the tune of £32,500.  In 1996 £500,000 has again been allocated to the health boards for respite care and interested organisations are eligible to apply for funding from their local health board.</P>

    <P> *Proposals for additional physical disability services in 1996 are currently under consideration in my Department. </P>
    <P>In addition to the new respite services which will come on stream in County Meath in 1996, persons with autism from County Meath will also be able to avail of additional respite services for this group which will become available during 1996 in County Louth.  When fully operational this will add a further £64,000 to the figure of £128,000 mentioned above.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that all emergency respite needs of persons with a mental handicap in County Meath can be catered for at present.  Planned respite breaks which were provided on a limited basis in 1995 will be greatly enhanced by the additional facilities coming on stream in 1996.  As the facilities available to the board for respite services in County Meath have to date been very limited, it has not operated a waiting list for respite care for this group.  Information now coming on stream from the mental handicap database will enable the board to identify these needs in a more precise manner.</P>
    <P>The board does not currently operate a waiting list for people with a physical disability awaiting respite care as it does not have specific respite services available to this group.  While use is currently made of generic facilities, specialised residential/respite services will be coming on stream in 1996.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> In matters concerning the provision of information to patients, general practitioners are guided by the Medical Council's <i>Guide to Ethical Conduct and Fitness to Practice</i> which states as follows:</P>
      <P>Doctors may be requested by the patient or the patient's solicitor to provide medical reports on the patient whom they have treated.  A doctor has a moral professional responsibility to supply this report when so requested by his or her patient or the solicitor acting as the patient's agent.</P>

    <P>In relation to personal information <Col N="107" /> stored on computer, the Data Protection Act, 1988, makes provision for the supply, to an individual, of information held by a data controller e.g. a general practitioner.  The provisions of the Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations, 1989, allow for restrictions to the supply of information in certain circumstances i.e. where it might cause harm to the physical or mental health of the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £900,000 has been allocated in 1996 to my Department to fund the scheme of <Col N="108" /> grants to voluntary organisations engaged in the provision of marriage guidance and marriage counselling services, and in the provision of counselling services to children whose parents have separated.  There is no separate allocation for children's counselling.  As in previous years, payments under the scheme will be made in three instalments to those organisations which meet the criteria governing the scheme.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance under the scheme in 1996 were received from 73 organisations.  Twenty-five of these organisations are seeking grants, <i>inter alia,</i> for providing child counselling services. The names of the latter organisations, which include Marriage Counselling Service Limited, are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following a preliminary examination of the completed application forms furnished to my Department, payment of a first instalment of the 1996 grant to counselling organisations was made recently to 68 organisations.  The two further instalments will be paid in August and November 1996 respectively. A final determination on the distribution of the grant in 1996, however, must await a more detailed scrutiny of the forms and the furnishing by the respective organisations of any clarification or additional information required by my Department.  For obvious reasons a decision on the total grant payable to any one organisation cannot be made in isolation from a decision on the total grant payable in respect of all other applicant organisations.</P>
      <P>The first instalment payments that have been made to date in 1996 include a payment made to Marriage Counselling Service Limited.  The amount it received on this occasion, which contains an element of grant for its Teen Between counselling service, is greater than the amount paid as a first instalment in 1995.</P>

      <P>In 1994 I provisionally earmarked a sum of £2 <Col N="110" /> million from the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 for the restoration of the Boyne Navigation.</P>
      <P>However, a preliminary report prepared by the Waterways Service has now estimated the cost of restoring the navigation at approximately £24 million.

      <P>The Waterways Service is considering whether a viable scheme to restore part of the navigation within the available resources can be devised.  I will make no decision regarding the possible reallocation of the funds until that examination has been completed and I will also have regard to the recommendations of the Boyne Valley integrated development plan which, I understand, will be available in the near future.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, RTE reports that it uses a number of satellites to deliver radio services to Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. Recently RTE launched a comprehensive text and audio service on the Internet which is available to an estimated 80 million users worldwide.</P>
      <P>RTE recognises that there are parts of the world where telecommunications infrastructures are not sufficiently developed to allow listeners to avail of such services.  Since November 1995, RTE has leased time from an international broadcaster to transmit the &ldquo;News at Six Thirty&rdquo; via shortwave twice a day to various parts of the world. It also facilitated the live transmission via shortwave of the 1995 All-Ireland hurling and football finals.  RTE reports that it is now evaluating the response to these transmissions and it will consider an increase in the number of hours transmitted via shortwave in the light of that response and if additional time can be negotiated with international broadcasters who operate shortwave transmitters.</P>

      <P>Irish policy on CO 2 abatement, including CO 2 emissions from transport, has been set out in the report <i>Ireland &mdash; Climate Change</i> (PL 9884, June 1993) and in the communication under the UN Framework Convention <Col N="116" /> on Climate Change (October 1994). Copies of both publications are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The current overall abatement objective is to limit Irish CO 2 emissions in the year 2000 to an increase of 20 per cent on the 1990 level.  Latest emissions data demonstrate this target to be attainable, with 1994 CO 2 emissions showing an increase of 6.8 per cent on 1990.</P>
      <P>Irish CO 2 emissions from transport are projected to increase by some 24 per cent between 1990 and the year 2000. National policy recognises transport as a significant source of CO 2 emissions and that measures in this area will play a key role in containing overall emissions. Important measures in this context include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;implementation of the Dublin Transportation Initative,</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvement of public transport infrastructure,</P>
      <P>&mdash;extension of vehicle testing requirements, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;support by Ireland for EU measures to reduce CO 2 emissions from vehicles. </P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Transport, 25 per cent of total investment will be directed at the improvement of public transport infrastructure. Particular emphasis is being placed on the improvement of public transport in the greater Dublin area as the largest urban centre and the area offering the greatest potential for alternatives to road-based transport.  As compared with a do minimum approach, implementation of the DTI recommended strategy is projected to secure a 5 per cent reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2001 and an 11 per cent reduction by 2011.  The forthcoming national sustainable development strategy will address sustainable transport in the context of providing a framework of objectives and policies for achieving sustainability in Ireland.</P>

They have been reminded, in guidance notes on the Roads Act, 1993, and in the non-national road grants memoranda issued by my Department, that while the safety of road users should be of paramount importance, they should also be aware of their responsibility in relation to the environment and the preservation of amenities when carrying out such works. In particular, they are advised that roadside trimming, including hedge cutting, should be carried out during the winter months when there is least risk to the ecological environment.  Authorities have been further advised that periods coinciding with nest building, rearing of young, etc., should be avoided and that the timing of trimming work, and the manner of its execution, should seek to minimise possible damage to plants and wild flowers in hedgerows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 132 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>Section 42 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, gives a local planning authority power, as a reserved function, to declare an area to be an area of special amenity when it appears to it that the area satisfies the criteria listed in the section.  A special amenity area order can only come into operation when confirmed by the Minister for the Environment under Section 43.  While section 42 (1A) enables the Minister, if he considers it necessary, to direct a planning authority to make such an order, I believe that it should be left to the relevant planning authority, unless exceptional circumstances apply, to decide whether consideration should be given to the making of an order in any particular case.</P>
      <P>Article 10 (1) (b) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 specifies those classes of development, otherwise exempted under the Regulations, which are not exempted development in an area to which a special amenity area order relates.</P>
      <P>Two special amenity area orders have been confirmed under section 43, viz:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Dublin County Council (Lucan Bridge to Palmerstown) special amenity area order, relating to an area of 345 hectares in County Dublin, confirmed on 8 March 1990;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the north Bull Island special amenity area order, relating to an area of 323 hectares in Dublin city, confirmed on 23 March 1995. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> In both cases, the reasons for the making of the order were the outstanding natural beauty of the areas in question, their special recreational value and the need for nature conservation in those areas.</P>
    <P>Special amenity area orders are only one of a number of options, in addition to normal planning control, for the protection or conservation of a particular area.  I understand my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, has proposals to put natural heritage areas on a statutory footing and that work is in progress also on the preparation of measures to transpose into national law Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna.</P>

      <P>My Department requires student primary teachers to attend a summer course in the Gaeltacht as an integral part of their training.</P>
      <P>The Department also supports the work of the summer courses by giving capitation grants to Irish colleges and by inspecting the courses.  In 1995 a total of £530,399 was paid in grants in respect of 23,873 students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria at present governing the consideration of applications for recognition as multi-denominational schools are set out in the following appendix.</P>
      <P>The recently established commission on school accommodation needs is due to review the criteria for the recognition of new primary schools, including multi-denominational schools, as part of its remit.</P>
      <P>Appendix</P>
      <P>Criteria for the consideration of applications for recognition as Multi-Denominational Schools</P>
      <P> 1.  That there is a need for a separate school to meet the demand for multi-denominational education in the district in question.  Account must therefore be taken of any existing facilities for such education in the general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> 2.  That prospective publis will be available in sufficient numbers to establish and maintain a viable school.  In the normal course, it would be expected that the school would, when fully developed, be sufficiently large to sustain a staff of Principal and eight assistants, so that each standard would have an individual teacher.</P>
    <P>3.  That the school will be managed and conducted in accordance with the Rules for National Schools.  The Board of Management will be appointed and constituted in accordance with the booklet &ldquo;Boards of Management of National Schools &mdash; Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The rules allow for the recognition of a body of persons as Patron.  Such a body must be incorporated as a limited Company under the Companies Act for this purpose.</P>
    <P>4.  That the promoters of the school demonstrate that the schools will be multi-denominational in aspect and provide a policy document on the religious education programme proposed for the school.</P>
    <P>5.  That the promoters of the school provide suitable temporary premises for the school, until such time as a permanent school building can be provided. </P>
    <P>Schools are initially accorded provisional recognition.  The onus of providing accommodation during this period rests with the promoters; grant-aid is given towards the cost of renting temporary accommodation until a permanent building can be provided.  Permanent recognition may be granted after the school has been operating satisfactorily for a number of years and is showing clear signs of growth.  At that stage, the question of permanent accommodation may also be considered in the light of available capital resources.</P>

      <P>Where such children cannot be accommodated on the normal network of school transport, my Department may allow the payment of a medical grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.</P>
      <P>The grant, which is paid at the end of each school year, is based on maximum attendance, and the amount payable is based on the distance from the child's home to the school or the pick-up point, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I have secured substantial improvements in the level of these grants which took effect from the start of the current school year, and I am satisfied that these increased grants will go a long way towards alleviating the difficulties experienced by the parents involved.</P>

      <Quest>if she will include a school (details supplied) in Limerick in the new staffing ratio of 15 pupils per class from infants to second class; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that it is designated as educationally disadvantaged but is due to lose a teacher in September 1996 in view of the current staffing levels which will result in dual classes.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a post will be suppressed at the school in question at the end of the current school year.  This is because the enrolment at the school has declined to 225 pupils in September 1995 from 254 pupils in September 1994.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, for the 1996-97 school year, the authorised staffing for this school is a principal and seven assistants. Additionally, the school has the services of a concessionary post, on account of its disadvantaged status, as well as the services of remedial and home school liaison teachers.</P>
      <P>I recently announced an important new initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage in targeted areas of particular need.</P>
      <P>For urban schools, a targeted programme of supports will be made available to twenty-five selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.  One of these supports will be a new maximum of 15 pupils in junior classes.</P>
      <P>For rural schools, a special initiative will focus on schools with fewer than five teachers, and particularly on schools in rural areas serving dispersed populations.  Supports will be made available to twenty-five clusters of schools in this category, each cluster having a combined enrolment of some 300 to 350 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to approach schools in the target groups and areas and invite their participation in this new initiative. I would expect that the schools in question will be contacted in the near future. It is thus too early to say whether the school referred to by the Deputy will be selected to benefit from the new initiative.</P>

The other two families are ineligible for free transport on distance grounds, but may avail of concessionary fare-paying transport.  This concession is also subject to no extra State cost being incurred by way of extending or altering the route of the existing service.</P>
      <P>The service operating to the school in question passes within a reasonable distance of all the children's homes.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the scheme.  To reroute the service would involve extra mileage and cost.  In the circumstances, my Department is not in a position to alter the route of the service as requested.</P>

      <P>On 21 May 1996 I obtained Government approval to publish the First Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission &mdash; Management and Financing of the Courts.  The report is now available for sale from the Government Publications Sales Office.  The work of the Hon. Mrs. Justice Denham and her colleagues in the working group in producing such a far-reaching report is to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I also obtained Government approval for acceptance in principle of the primary recommendation of the report that an independent and permanent body should be established to manage a unified courts system.  This body would be known as &ldquo;the Courts Service&rdquo; and would be set up by statute as an agency of the State.  The report recommends that the new service be managed on a day to day basis by a chief executive officer of departmental Secretary rank and that it should have a board chaired by the Chief Justice and consisting of members of the Judiciary and representatives of those using or otherwise involved in the courts, and the chief executive.</P>
    <P>I believe that such an agency would centralise the financial and management administration of the courts in a unified system capable of meeting the demands of modern day litigation.  As a result of the Government decision, the working group is being asked to submit further reports to me on how the establishment of &ldquo;the Courts Service&rdquo; can be progressed. The working group will also be continuing its work in accordance with its terms of reference to review the day to day operation of the courts and I look forward to receiving further reports in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government has undertaken in its Programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to carry out a fundamental reform of the courts system and to establish a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy. The first report of the working group and the Government decision of 21 May are very significant steps in the reform of the courts system.  Another important development has been the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  Under that Act, 15 additional judges will be appointed this year.  The Act also introduced administrative and procedural reforms to simplify and speed up the processing of cases through the courts and enhance the overall efficiency of the courts system. <Col N="149" /> I am committed to using the resources available to me to provide a modern, efficient and effective courts system which will provide a speedy, accessible and just service.</P>

      <P>The former prison staff housing at Cowley Place, North Circular Road, Dublin <Col N="151" /> beside Mountjoy Prison is no longer in use and considered to be beyond economic repair or refurbishment.</P>
      <P>The site at Cowley Place, which includes the former staff housing, is earmarked for a new purpose-built women's prison.  With the approval of the Government, work in connection with the provision of the new women's prison has recommenced and design work for the proposed new facility is being advanced.  It is proposed to initiate the appropriate planning process for this development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, in the near future.  Steps have been taken to make these houses secure and safe pending clearance of the site.</P>

As indicated in that statement and in the course of my answers to questions which followed, I was informed on the morning of 13 April, by an official of my Department who was being apprised of developments in the court by the Garda authorities, that there was a problem in the court that morning with the warrant. I then asked the official who had phoned me about these developments to ask the Secretary of my Department to seek a full report on the matter from the Garda Síochána.

      <P>The long-standing backlog in publication of prison reports to which the Deputy refers is a situation which I inherited on taking office 18 months ago.  Due to the lack of efficient information technology in our prisons there is a serious backlog in this work.  However, I am in a position to inform the House that the report in respect of the year 1993 has now been complied and will be published shortly. <Col N="153" /> Compilation of the statistics in respect of 1994 and 1995 is in progress.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, I decided that, in parallel with the work of updating our prison office technology, the written elements of the annual reports, which include an outline of the main developments in the prison service and the reports of the visiting committees, which are also made available separately, and the various prison services should in future be compiled and published separately. The statistical tables would then be published as soon as possible afterwards. I plan to have these interim reports, for 1994 and 1995, ready for publication later this year.</P>
      <P>The analysis of statistical information is a vital tool in aiding research into the prison system and an investigation is currently in progress into ways in which the use of information technology would allow the availability of such information to be improved.</P>

    <P>I have already made it clear in the Dáil that the initial Garda report which they provided to me on 9 May said that the reason the extradition proceedings failed in this instance was because the warrant which was produced in court was not the original warrant but that a review of the steps taken in dealing with this matter had, to date, failed to establish the reason the original warrant was not available to the court.</P>

Unemployment benefit and assistance are also payable in respect of any three days' unemployment in any period of six consecutive days, with Sundays being excluded.</P>
      <P>While people whose normal working week would include Sundays are not entitled to disability benefit or to unemployment assistance or benefit in respect of that day, they would be entitled to payment for any other days in a six day period on which they are incapable of work or unemployed, even if those days would not normally be part of their working week.  Consequently, people are not likely to be adversely affected in practice by the fact that disability benefit, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance are not payable in respect of Sundays.</P>
      <P>This issue is among the matters which the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare has considered.  The report of the group is expected shortly and I will consider any proposals it may make to me on the matter.</P>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the summer students' jobs scheme is to provide income support for the less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and are unable to obtain summer work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Taking account of the upward trend in the number of students participating in the scheme since its inception, priority this year is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students, who have no other means of support, to take part within the allocation for the 1996 scheme which is £10.2 million.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the scheme this year is to provide places for students who are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.  Students who still have a legal right to claim unemployment assistance during the summer (such as students who have completed their courses) are not deprived of income support and therefore are not eligible for the scheme.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned will complete a course of studies at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, in June she is entitled to claim unemployment assistance if she cannot find work during the summer period.  For the reasons already stated, she is not, therefore, eligible to participate in the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for deserted wife's benefit in January 1996.  A decision on her entitlement has not yet been made.</P>
      <P>The delay in this case results from the need to obtain additional evidence relating to the circumstances of the break-up of her marriage.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will favourably consider extending the national fuel scheme for a further period in view of the inclement weather we have experienced since the scheme ended in mid April 1996.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10963/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks each year.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Last year I increased the income limit for the national fuel scheme by £5 per week.  In this year's budget I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which will take effect from October 1996.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum contributory pension rate or savings/investments of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance.  The scheme is a fixed scheme; it is not temperature related.  As a result there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably cold. However, as the scheme extends over six months of the year, this is likely to be the exception rather than the rule.  Of course there will also be times when the allowance will be paid even though temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
      <P>In addition to the allowance available under the national fuel scheme, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  Under that scheme a person who has exceptional heating costs, for example, due to ill health or infirmity, may qualify for a heating supplement. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the local community welfare officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any extension to the duration of the national fuel scheme would have cost <Col N="164" /> implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  It is estimated that to extend the scheme for one month would cost £7 million.  In the five year period from 1989 to 1994 expenditure on the national fuel scheme increased by almost 54 per cent.  This year a sum of £44.5 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider adjusting the Irish element of pensions to compensate for the loss of the purchase value of British pension in view of the fact that sterling has decreased substantially in exchange rate with the punt and the serious implications this has for persons in this country, such as old age contributory pensioners and survivor pensioners, whose pensions are partly made up of British Social Welfare Pensions and Irish non-contributory pensions and in view of the fact that the change in the comparative value of the exchange rates has continued now for a considerable period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Exchange rates can fluctuate frequently.  In view of this and the fact that a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to reassess entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension each time currency exchange rates move.  A realistic approach for resolving this problem has therefore been adopted. When calculating means based upon EU pensions, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism which is used within the EU in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in value of sterling may be entitled to an old age (non-contributory) pension provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week. Such a pensioner who is already in receipt of an Irish old age (non-contributory) pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment by the Department at any time.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions, who, for instance, may be waiting for their old age (non-contributory) pension application to be processed, or who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he may wish to give me the details so that it can be investigated to ensure that the claimant is in receipt of his/her full entitlements.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for his second year payment under the REP scheme.  However, under revised monitoring and control procedures implemented by my Department recently, compliance checks are required to ensure that farmers have completed the specific works outlined during the first year of the plan before second year payments can be made.</P>
      <P>These checks commenced recently and it is expected that second year payments will be made at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of the concerns currently being expressed by deer farmers.  The position is that the possibility of introducing a scheme of compensatory headage payments for deer is under consideration in the context of the overall review of the disadvantaged areas headage payments schemes.  Any such scheme, together with any other adjustments to the current arrangements, would have to be capable of being financed within the overall funding available for the disadvantaged areas schemes.  As no decision has yet been taken on the matter nationally, the European Commission has not been approached so far.</P>

      <P>Measure 5 under the rural environment protection scheme provides for the maintenance of farm and field boundaries.  The objective of this measure is, <i>inter alia,</i> to manage hedgerows in the interests of stock <Col N="175" /> control, wildlife and the scenic appearance of the rural countryside.</P>
      <P>The Department's agri-environmental specifications set out the practices necessary to achieve this objective. Farmers, under REPS, are required to implement an agri-environmental plan drawn up by an approved REPS planning agency.  Such plans must specify the works to be undertaken by the participant farmer in all obligatory areas.  In so far as measure 5 is concerned the plan must set out the annual work programme to be undertaken to manage hedgerows and the upkeep of stonewalls. This work must be undertaken in a phased manner which minimise wildlife disturbance.  Deciduous trees are an essential component of wildlife habitats and, as such, should not be trimmed in the context of hedgerow maintenance.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the relevant measure under REPS, properly applied, will ensure that hedge trimming works will not destroy native deciduous trees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222, 223, 224, 225 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>As a matter of course, my Department copies draft newspaper advertisements containing details of proposals to issue and renew prospecting licences to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Arising from this action the National Parks and Wildlife Service wrote to the exploration companies which are the subject of these questions on 14 March 1996 and indicated the location of proposed National Heritage Areas within the licence areas.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service also outlined their concerns in relation to conservation of the flora and fauna in the area.  The licensees, in response, confirmed their awareness of the interest of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the area and indicated that all work in the area within the next two years would be confined to exploration and not involve development or construction.  The licensees undertook to revert to the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the event of any possibility of significant surface work being required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the decision is made to award a prospecting licence, the technical staff of the exploration and mining division of my Department, after consultation with the National Monuments Service, ascertain the existence and location of national monuments in the licence area to ensure that the attention of the licence holder is drawn to them.  In addition, licensees are advised to contact the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for approval to have exploration work undertaken on or adjacent to sites and monuments indicated on the sites and monuments <Col N="178" /> record constraint maps which are available for examination at county libraries and the appropriate local planning authority. Access to national nature reserves is not permitted without the permission of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>All prospecting licences issued or renewed are advertised in print media circulating within the licence area.  No Government Departments, other than the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, are consulted as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>Minerals exploration should not cause any environmental damage if it is carried out in accordance with the terms of the prospecting licence issued and in compliance with the guidelines for good environmental practice in minerals exploration, which are issued to each licensee by my Department.  In the circumstances, I do not think it necessary to consult other Departments as a matter of course.  Given that there should be no adverse environmental impact from minerals exploration, I fail to see how it can impact, adversely or otherwise, on the tourism industry or on the quality of the overall environment.</P>
    <P>In the event that a commercial deposit is discovered, the licence holder will require planning permission from the local authority and a licence from the Environment Protection Agency.  It is the conditions which attach to these permissions, if granted, which will deal with the effects of any mine development on issues such as tourism, fisheries and the environment.  It would be impossible to foretell the nature of any possible impact or the extent to which it might be mitigated (or indeed desirable to mitigate it) without knowledge of the type of mineralisation, the grading, proposed method of extraction and other features.  These issues are clarified after examination of the development proposals and the carrying out of an environmental impact study.</P>
    <P>In the case of both a licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and an application for planning permission, an environmental <Col N="179" /> impact assessment must be carried out which involves wide consultation by the developer at the scoping stage and subsequent consultation by each permitting authority with a broad range of statutory consultees, including my Department.</P>
    <P>Only when planning permission has been granted and a licence issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, will I issue a State mining lease or licence. The standard terms of a modern State mining facility require full rehabilitation of the site when mining is completed.</P>
    <P>I consult with Departments where there is a shared interest or responsibility involved and an example of this would be in discussing and agreeing with the Department of Finance the financial terms of a State mining facility.</P>
    <P>Each proposal for an exploration licence or State mining licence is considered on its merits and in accordance with the very strict environmental standards which exist in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rockall Trough includes some 200,000 square kilometers of the Continental shelf area west of Ireland extending about 100 to 650 kilometres from the cost.  In May, 1995 I enclosed the area for applications for licensing options and exploration licences and on 15 March this year I announced a licensing round over the trough.  The south-west portion of the trough, which is very far from shore, in deep water and is unlikely to be of interest to the industry at this time, was <Col N="180" /> not included in the round and remains closed for licensing.  The round covers an area of almost 150,000 square kilometres and has been designated a frontier area.  The closing date for the round is 26 March 1997.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to acquire seismic and other data over the entire area to properly assess its hydrocarbon potential. Closure of the area and the announcement of the round provided that opportunity and indeed has already generated substantial activity over the area.</P>
      <P>A technical evaluation of the Rockall Trough is currently being prepared by the petroleum affairs division of my Department in conjunction with Robertson Research International Limited. This work, due to be completed in early June 1996, will be based on all geophysical and geological data currently available from the area and will be the first comprehensive assessment of its petroleum potential.  It will be sold to petroleum exploration companies and will provide them with good basis for initial decisions on whether to consider the area in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as a result of the promotional efforts of my Department, several contractors have plans this year for new data acquisition over the area of the round.  Such data would provide a substantial, modern dataset and would enable the acreage being made available in the round to be graded.  An aeromagnetic survey and two seismic surveys have already been carried out this year; two exploration surveys are currently under way and four more seismic surveys are planned for the area.  A seabed geological survey is proposed and it is possible that a satellite seep survey will also be conducted.  Elsewhere off the north-west coast, in the Slyne and Erris Troughs, there are six exploration licences and one licensing option in place.  Active exploration programmes are being carried out under these authorisations including an exploration well currently being drilled by Enterprise Oil plc in block 27/5 in the Slyne Trough. Enterprise will drill a second well in block 18/20 in the Slyne Trough later <Col N="181" /> this summer following on from their first well.  They also propose to acquire further seismic data.  The success of Enterprise's drilling programme will only be determined when the wells are completed.</P>
    <P>A high number of authorisations are in place and I expect that further licences will be issued in the future, particularly under the Rockall round.  I am confident that exploration activities, will continue, at least at current levels, for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>The Government's decision to introduce a strictly time limited scheme of <Col N="184" /> Exchequer funding to assist the six privately owned regional airports in marketing their products stemmed from a review of policy relating to these airports which was carried out by my Department in recent months.  The need for this review was prompted by financial difficulties at most of these airports arising from insufficient traffic to ensure their commercial viability.</P>
      <P>The review confirmed the perception of the tourism and industrial promotion agencies that the regional airports form an important part of the transport infrastructure of the regions, serving to enhance the range of access options for potential visitors and as an inducement for the attraction and development of industry in the regions.  In this way, these airports help to spread economic development into the regions.</P>
      <P>The amounts of marketing assistance for the individual airports were arrived at in the light of their current and projected financial performance, and traffic results for the years 1996-1999.  Details of the assistance, which will total £2.35 million for the six airports over the years 1996-1999, are as follows: Donegal, £300,000; Galway, £160,000; Kerry, £1,200,000; Knock, £250,000; Sligo, £280,000; Waterford, £160,000.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to an on-site incident that occurred on 4 May 1996 at the Calder Hall power station in connection with reactor number Two's annual maintenance shutdown programme.  I have been informed that instrumentation detected a fault in equipment while the reactor was being prepared for a return to power.  Following tests the reactor was permitted to return to power.  This particular equipment failure was below scale on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the reactor's return to power it was discovered that one connection <Col N="186" /> on the reactor pile cap was not properly sealed.  All the safety precautions worked and the reactor was shut down and depressurised.  After repairs were made the reactor was returned to power.</P>
    <P>Based on the information received, the RPII advised me that the incident had no radiological or health implications for Ireland and there was no release of radioactivity into the environment. The incident was formally rated as a level one on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES), i.e., an anomaly.  I do not consider that it is necessary to seek further information from the UK about this incident.</P>
    <P>While the incident in itself was of no radiological or environmental significance to Ireland, I am always concerned about the continuing problem of operational incidents in the UK's nuclear industry, particularly Sellafield.  My concerns have recently been conveyed to the UK authorities on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Government decision referred to in the Deputy's question states quite specifically that price competitiveness and performance benchmarks should be established as part of the corporate planning process of each State enterprise that has a dominant or monopoly position in the Irish market.  The decision does not state that such benchmarks should be included in the annual reports of the State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the companies under my Department's aegis have <Col N="187" /> given the matter of bench-marking the attention and priority that it deserves within the corporate planning process. The corporate plans of the State companies are not normally published, mainly because of the commercial sensitivity of much of the information in such plans.</P>

I am advised that it is Iarnród Éireann's policy to provide a dedicated space for mobility impaired people on all Intercity trains.  To this end, alterations have been made to all of these trains to provide at least one space for wheelchair-bound customers, located in the dining car and marked by a sticker on the window of the carriage.  Furthermore, all new Intercity rolling stock will have special facilities for the mobility impaired, including toilets suitable for use by people with disabilities, which will compare with the facilities currently available on cross-Border trains and on the railcars used on the Kildare line.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a similar question as recently as 23 April last, and on previous occasions, the Government will continue to encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy.  This approach is consistent with the document on Irish aviation policy published in February 1994, and with the company's restructuring programme.</P>
      <P>The way forward is for Aer Lingus to align itself with major international players in the aviation sector.  This is an integral part of the way in which development takes place in the industry and Aer Lingus has been quite active in the forging of such alliances in recent times.  The worldwide partnership agreement with Delta Airlines was the most significant to date.</P>
      <P>The Aer Lingus group chief executive has recently stated publicly that these commercial initiatives pose no threat to jobs in Aer Lingus.  He added that, on the contrary, by allowing Aer Lingus to grow its business, strategic alliances will actually improve employment prospects in the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the new agreement between Aer Lingus and Delta Airlines on the Ireland-New York scheduled services. In this regard I would refer the Deputy to my response to his parliamentary question on 14 May a copy of which follows. I would emphasise that strategy in relation to Aer Lingus transatlantic services is primarily a matter for Aer <Col N="190" /> Lingus having regard to their commercial mandate.</P>
      <P>I have gone on record before to indicate that the Government has encouraged and will continue to encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy, where they are judged to be in the best interests of the airline and the economic development of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The recent agreement between Aer Lingus and Delta whereby Aer Lingus have joined Delta Airline's worldwide partners programme is not an equity based agreement.  It is more in the nature of a co-operative marketing arrangement and is in line with the Aer Lingus transatlantic strategy which seeks to ensure a strong year round service for business and leisure passengers on a commercially viable basis.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the agreement are:</P>
      <P>&mdash; Delta will block book seats on the daily Aer Lingus Dublin-New York and Shannon-New York services in both directions.</P>
      <P>&mdash; These flights will operate as code-sharing flights i.e. each flight will be shown separately as a Delta and an Aer Lingus flight on reservations systems.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Delta will code-share from beyond points in the US which they serve i.e. 246 cities.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Joint co-operation on frequent flyer-Tab programmes.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Further discussions to share certain services e.g. handling, maintenance etc. are ongoing. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the issue of code-sharing between Irish and US carriers on Ireland-US services is not specifically addressed by the Ireland-US bilateral Air Services Agreement, the Delta-Aer Lingus arrangement has been approved by both the Irish and US <Col N="191" /> authorities on the basis of comity and reciprocity.  I believe that the nature of the agreement is consistent with the aims of the bilateral Air Transport Agreement and with Irish aviation policy generally.  The new agreement will have benefits for both airlines and consumers.  From an Aer Lingus perspective the agreement will serve to underpin the year round viability of its transatlantic services in the coming years, will give access to Delta's US-wide network and marketing infrastructure and offer further potential financial benefits through sharing of services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the detail of such an alliance between specific air carriers is commercially sensitive by its nature and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such detail.  In approving this type of alliance, my main consideration relates to the broad strategic and regulatory issues.  It is neither necessary or appropriate for me or my Department to involve ourselves in the detailed working arrangements between the two airlines.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, a tender competition for the provision of an air taxi service for the transport of Ministers during Ireland's presidency of the EU was held by the Department of Defence.  Following a detailed evaluation on financial and technical grounds of the seven tenders received, the contract for the provision of the service was awarded to Hunting Aviation Ltd., London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not a condition of the tender <Col N="192" /> specification that the provider of the air taxi service should be the owner or operator of the aircraft to be used in providing the service.  In submitting its tender document, Hunting Aviation Ltd. provided full details of the crew and aircraft they propose to use in providing the air taxi service.  These details were referred to the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Crops who regarded the crew and aircraft as capable of meeting the requirements of the specification.  The crew and aircraft are being provided to Hunting Aviation Ltd. by Heathrow Jet Charter Limited and Aravco Limited of London.  This is not the first time that an air taxi service has been used.  In 1994 such a service was used for a period of two months during which the Gulfstream IV aircraft was undergoing maintenance.  Following a tender competition, the service was provided by Hunting Aviation Ltd. using aircraft supplied by Heathrow Jet Charter Ltd and Aravco Ltd.  The service provided by Hunting Aviation Ltd. during the period was satisfactory.</P>
