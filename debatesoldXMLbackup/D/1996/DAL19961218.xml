      <P>The Privilege and Compellability of Witnesses Bill was raised on two occasions last week, first with the Minister for Finance and then with the Taoiseach, who gave an undertaking that the amendments to the Bill would be furnished prior to Christmas.  Will the amendments be available to Members?  The Minister will appreciate that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will meet today to make arrangements to set up the Buchanan sub-committee to deal with the Price Waterhouse report. It is vital that the Privilege and Compellability of Witnesses Bill is passed to allow those coming before the sub-committee to have privilege and the sub-committee to compel people to attend. Will the Minister guarantee that the amendments will be tabled before the Christmas recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in his summation. The position, which is subject to confirmation after the Order of Business, is that I am not aware that the amendments are ready.  If I recall correctly, the Taoiseach gave an undertaking that he would try to ensure they were published before Christmas.  I am not aware if they are ready and I will inform the Deputy immediately after the Order of Business.  However, it is the Government's intention to try to have this matter resolved and enacted as quickly as possible, which is the desire of all parties in the House.  I do not wish to mislead the Deputy.  I will find out the precise position and contact him immediately after the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is not for me or any Government Minister to determine when a committee will sit.  We can attempt to use our influence but the matter is ultimately left exclusively to the committee to decide.  We desire that this legislation be enacted as quickly as possible. As soon as the amendments are available, we will circulate them but I am not in a position to say the amendments have come back from the parliamentary draftsman.</P>

      <P>We do and this committee has been bogged down as a result of the Government not putting down amendments.  I put down 11 amendments on this Bill within a fortnight of its publication.  We are waiting for those to be dealt with.  We on this side of the House wish the Privilege and Compellability of Witnesses Bill to come <Col N="364" /> into law before this committee's deliberations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive does not control the timetable of any committee under the rules and procedures of committees.  This concerns every party in the House and it is a matter of procedural fact.  The committee in question, when it received the Bill for Committee Stage, decided, as it is entitled to do, to undertake a substantial review of the context in which the legislation was framed.  That substantial review, as the Opposition will know, took a lot of time and the Government was not able to come forward with responses to proposed amendments because we did not receive them until late in the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is Christmas we will not argue about that.  However, when the Government accepts a Private Members' Bill, in this case in the names of my colleagues Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Eoin Ryan, the Minister should be gracious enough not to argue how legally flawed it is.</P>

      <P>I would not like to mislead the Leader of the Opposition.  I am informed that the Ministers whose Departments have responsibility in the area covered by the Bill will not vote against it.  However, they will accept some but not all its provisions and will incorporate them in Government legislation.  I do not want to give the impression on behalf of the Government that, by not voting against the Bill, it was accepting it in its entirety.</P>

      <P>Will the Government, when it has considered and finalised the leaders' allowances today, publish the details in the interests of openness and taking the press out of its misery? The figures have been given to the leaders of the Opposition on a confidential basis but they should be published.</P>
      <P>Secondly, will the Government introduce legislation to provide for the mandatory reporting of child sex abuse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first item, the Bill, when finally cleared by Government today, will be circulated to all Deputies.  A confidential provisional copy has been made available and all details will be made available to everyone.  The Bill, which I will introduce, will be debated in the House.  I will be prepared to answer any question from any quarter.  If anyone in the media wishes to pose a question through the facilities of this Chamber, I will be more than happy in the interests of democracy to answer.  I am told that the Deputy's second question was answered yesterday.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take the opportunity to make it known to the public that the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) Bill, 1996, is not a smash and grab raid as was inferred this morning?  The impression was given that we were going to pass the Bill tonight and people were going to turn up with guns to collect their money on Friday.  I am glad the Minister has taken the opportunity of correcting that and I hope other Members will contribute likewise to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in relation to Members' allowances amounting to approximately £500,000 were included in the estimates last year.  If the media checked their files they would see that they have already reported extensively on that matter.</P>

      <P>The Book of Estimates is being debated in the House tomorrow and the public service agreement was concluded last week.  Will the Minister tell the House if the post-budget ceiling of £13,014 million remains or is there a new figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A new Secretary General has been appointed by the United Nations.  I have no doubt that the Government has congratulated Kofi Annan.  The United Nations is so important to world peace that this House should also send him a note of good wishes.  We should also send a note of thanks to Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the work he has done on behalf of humanity.  This note should not only be from the Government but from this Parliament because the people have great respect for the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has an honourable tradition of its <Col N="368" /> NGOs working abroad.  There was a horrendous murder of six Red Cross workers in Grozny yesterday. Luckily, two Irish aid workers escaped but we should communicate the House's sympathy to the Red Cross internationally and nationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I accept both of Deputy Burke's proposals. Through the appropriate channels we will convey our congratulations to the new Secretary General of the United Nations.  Coming from a country like Ireland, which has supported the work of the United Nations since membership in the mid-1950s, such congratulations will be well received. We will also send a note of encouragement and support to the Red Cross.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 52 of A Government of Renewal, the rainbow's birth certificate, headed &ldquo;Cabinet Confidentiality&rdquo;, states: &ldquo;The relaxation of absolute confidentiality in all circumstances will be put to the people by way of a referendum at the earliest possible opportunity&rdquo;. That was written two years ago.  What is the Government doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has explained this on a number of occasions but I will try to do so again for the benefit of the Deputy.  It was and is the intention of the Government to do precisely what is set out in the programme for renewal.  The legal advice, which we shared with this House, stated that this was complex and that it was not possible for the Government to include it in the bail referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach repeatedly promised us that we would have the Equal Status Bill before the end of this session.  When can we expect to see this Bill?  According to the Minister, the Employment Equality Bill is stalled due to consultations with the Attorney General.  When will that Bill return to the House?  Most Deputies have received a circular which shows that the income of the charitable lotteries has reduced from £10 million to £4.5 million.  Under section 33 (2) of the National Lottery Act, 1996, will the Minister raise the ceiling for those lotteries while the main Bill is being considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the third matter is going to committee in a number of weeks and <Col N="369" /> can be addressed there.  Any member of the committee can propose an amendment suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill is virtually complete and will come before Government very shortly.  The question as to when it is published is a matter for the Cabinet to decide.  Legal consideration is still being given to the amendment which will be brought in by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning the Minister for Education published a new Universities Bill to replace the Bill drafted in August.  The number of amendments I received constitute in essence a new Bill.  Committee Stage is due tomorrow at 11 a.m.  We hope there will be no attempt to guillotine the legislation and that we will be given adequate time to go through these amendments, given the poor drafting of the previous Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    <P>Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1996,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 13th day of December, 1996.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The draft order the House is being asked to approve is part of arrangements for the restructuring of the board of Telecom Éireann following the conclusion of a strategic alliance between Telecom and the KPN-Telia consortium.</P>
    <P>The draft order is to be made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment under section 23 of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, as amended.  Under section 4(4) of that Act, a draft of an order proposed to be made under section 23 must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>The legislation enabling the strategic alliance and the associated board restructuring is the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, which was recently enacted by the Oireachtas.  Deputies will recall these issues were extensively debated by the House during consideration of the Bill.  I propose to briefly review the purpose of the strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann and then outline the purpose of this order and its place in the context of the strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications have an increasingly important role to play in modern society, not only for economic reasons but also for social, personal and leisure time purposes.  Telecommunications are becoming more and more important as a driver of economic growth and job creation.  To maintain and further improve Ireland's economic competitiveness and job creation potential, Ireland must have a top quality telecommunications sector.  The Government's objective is to achieve a telecommunications sector which is in the top quartile of OECD indicators of price competitiveness, quality and availability, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications sector is undergoing a revolution.  Developments in technology, rising customer demand, globalisation of business, liberalisation of the sector and competition are all contributing to this revolution.  Telecommunications companies which do not adapt to this rapidly changing situation will not survive.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann, like all other telecommunications companies, is subject to this changing environment.  It is essential that Telecom Éireann be equipped with the capacity to survive and succeed in this new environment. This is not just to protect Telecom Éireann; it is because a successful Telecom Éireann will play a major part in the achievement of our objective of bringing about a top quality telecommunications sector for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has made considerable progress <Col N="375" /> in adapting to the new circumstances by, for example, improving its financial structure and reducing prices.  However, further progress must be achieved if it is to become a successful company in the new competitive marketplace.  To accelerate the further development of Telecom Éireann the Government and the company agreed it should form a strategic alliance with a major telecommunications operator.  Furthermore, it was agreed that the best way to secure a successful long-term strategic alliance would be to enable the partner to take an equity stake in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Government and Telecom Éireann sought a partner which would have the necessary commercial and technological experience as well as the capabilities and commitment to support the company in growing and developing its business. The Government approved a mandate for negotiation of a strategic alliance in July 1995 and following an open and competitive selection process, the Government in July of this year approved the signature of an alliance agreement with KPN-Telia. A key element of the deal is that 85 separate strategic initiatives have been agreed between Telecom Éireann and the consortium.  These provide a comprehensive strategic support programme involving technical support, expert and managerial assistance, software and system improvements across all business categories.</P>
    <P>When the strategic alliance agreement is concluded, the process of accelerating the transformation of Telecom Éireann can begin with the assistance of the strategic partner.  The success of the alliance will depend on co-operation among all interests involved in the company: the Government, as the main shareholder; the strategic partner; the company management; and, not least, the employees.</P>
    <P>The employees, in particular, will be in the front line in bringing about improvements in the company's operations.  It is important that they have a voice in the further development of the company.  Up to now the worker participation Acts have provided for the participation of employees in decision-making processes of the company through representation at board level. The arrangements which have been agreed and which I will more fully describe later, provide for the continuation of this arrangement, although in a slightly altered form.</P>
    <P>However, a further opportunity is made available by the strategic alliance for employees to participate in the fortunes of the company.  The Telecommunication (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 enables the company to issue, and the Minister to transfer shares in the company for the purpose of employee shareholding schemes.  The Government's intention is that the terms under which the shares will be issued will be to encourage active participation by employees as shareholders in the company and that the scheme should facilitate the continued improvement of the company's customer service, quality and commercial <Col N="376" /> success.  Proposals from unions for an employee shareholding scheme have been received and these are being examined prior to the commencement of detailed negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the arrangements made for the participation of employees in the future development of the company will enable them to make a meaningful contribution to the future direction of the company.  The draft order before the House today, which includes arrangements for employee directors under the Worker Participation Acts, is part of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation Acts apply to ten State enterprises in total, including Telecom Éireann, and provide for the election of employee directors to the boards of those enterprises.  In the case of nine of the enterprises involved, all nine being commercial State enterprises, one third of the board positions are reserved for employee directors.  In the other case, a non-commercial State enterprise, provision for less than one third exists.</P>
    <P>Currently, the board of Telecom Éireann consists of 12 members appointed by the Minister, of which four are employee directors.  This is clearly appropriate where the State is a 100 per cent owner of the company and where the Minister has power to appoint all the directors.  The strategic alliance involving the Government, Telecom Éireann and the KPN-Telia consortium provides for the sale of up to 35 per cent of the equity of the company to the consortium, as part of the arrangement.  The consortium, as a substantial shareholder in the company, will be entitled to representation on the board of the company.  In that situation, a revision of the board structure is required to balance the interests of the Government, the strategic partner and the employees. The provision reserving one third of the total number of seats at the board for employee directors is no longer appropriate in these changed circumstances. It is more appropriate that the number of employee director seats should be determined by reference to the number of directors which the Minister is entitled to appoint.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed in the context of the strategic alliance transaction that the consortium will be entitled to appoint three directors to a board of 12, reflecting their shareholding in the company.  In restructuring the board the Government sought a solution which would satisfy a number of essential requirements.  These are the need to preserve effective control for the State's majority shareholding, the representational interests of the strategic partner, the objective of maintaining a small to medium sized board for the purpose of effective governance, and the need to have meaningful employee representation at the key decision-making forum in respect of company operations.</P>
    <P>On the basis of agreement with the strategic partner and following intensive discussions with the trade unions in Telecom Éireann, the Government has agreed a board structure as follows: seven members, including the chairman and <Col N="377" /> the chief executive, appointed by the Minister; three members appointed by the strategic partner; and four employee representatives.  Two of the employee representatives will be appointed as directors on the basis of an election under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts. The other two employee representatives will be alternate directors, appointed on the basis of the results of an election under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.  The alternate employee directors will be entitled to attend all board meetings but not to vote except in the absence of the directors to which they are alternates.</P>
    <P>When an employee shareholding scheme in Telecom Éireann is established the members of the scheme will be entitled to nominate a director for appointment to the board by the Minister.  In that event, the employee director who was second placed in the last election will become an alternate director, and the term of office of the alternate director who was placed second of the two alternates in the election will expire.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the order before the House is to facilitate the restructuring of the employee representation on the Telecom Éireann board in accordance with the arrangements I have outlined. The order will fix the total number of members of the board of the company for the purposes of the Worker Participation Acts and the number of members to be appointed under the Worker Participation Acts.</P>
    <P>The Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 provides that an order under the Worker Participation Acts in relation to the board of Telecom may specify that the number of employee directors shall not exceed one third of the number the Minister is otherwise entitled to appoint.  The draft order provides that the number of directors of the company will be 12 and that, of those, two will be appointed under the Worker Participation Acts.  This is the only provision of the order.  However, in addition, the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 enables the Minister to appoint two alternate directors to the board.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the board of the company will take place as soon as the strategic alliance transaction is concluded.  It is intended that the draft order before the House will come into effect following the conclusion of the transaction.  As well as this order, certain further steps will be taken to complete the restructuring of the board of the company.  These include the expiry of the terms of office of two of the current employee directors, the appointment of those persons as alternate directors and the appointment to the board of the three nominees of the strategic partner.</P>
    <P>This restructuring of employee representation on the board of a State enterprise in the context of the sale of equity in the enterprise is not unique.  Deputies may recall that when the B &amp; I Line was sold by the State, that company was removed altogether from the ambit of the <Col N="378" /> Worker Participation Acts under the B &amp; I Line Act, 1991.  In contrast, in the case of Telecom Éireann we are effectively maintaining the existing level of employee representation on the board.</P>
    <P>The draft order before the House is one element of a process aimed at preparing Telecom Éireann for successful development and growth in a new competitive telecommunications environment. The implementation of the strategic alliance is essential to enabling the company to achieve that success.  The board of the company will have a key role to play in guiding the company to success in this new environment.  The new board structure for the company has been carefully balanced to reflect the various interests involved and I am satisfied that this will facilitate the effective performance of its functions.  I am also pleased that the employees of the company will continue to have a meaningful representation on the board of the company in this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>I commend this resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding my respect for the Minister of State &mdash; I am always pleased to do business with him &mdash; I must protest at the absence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications who was in the House for the Order of Business.  This is a major debate on Telecom Éireann and it is probably the last opportunity to discuss the disgraceful sell-off of 20 per cent of the company.  I appreciate the Minister has official engagements but I would have wished him to be available to listen to some last minute pleas and argument, which up to now he has not had an opportunity to hear about the process of this sell-off.  As the decision to sign the final contract for the sale of Telecom Éireann will obviously be the Minister's, rather than the Minister of State's, I would have wished to be able to put some points to him this morning.  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to convey my points to him as I am conscious that he is new to the office.</P>
      <P>Under this Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, the 12,000 workers in Telecom Éireann have been sold out, particularly by the left wing element of this Government, and I am amazed at the absolute silence from that part of the Government on this issue.  I never thought I would see the day that a Labour or Democratic Left Minister would come before this House and seek to remove worker directors from a State board.  How things have changed.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister raised that matter now because whoever put that reference in his speech does not know what he or she is talking about.  The Minister said, &ldquo;Deputies may recall that when the B &amp; I Line was sold by the State, that company was removed altogether from the ambit of the Worker Participation <Col N="379" /> Acts&rdquo;.  What kind of nonsense is that?  Whoever put this gobbledygook together does not what they are talking about.  When the whole company was sold, of course the State no longer had an interest in it.  It was not responsible for the debts, the profits or losses, but that is not the case with Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>That was a disingenuous reference.  Somebody was obviously conscious of the fact that I was the Minister who sold the B &amp; I Line.</P>

      <P>Prior to this order being drafted as part of his flawed telecommunications Bill, four of the 12 directors on the board of Telecom Éireann were worker directors.  Under the order, there are now just two worker directors on the 12 member board.  While all kinds of sops have been offered, these amount to shadow rather than substance.  There will be two shadow worker directors for the two worker directors but the shadow directors will have no votes.  From now on, there will only ever be just two worker director votes on the Telecom Éireann board and the workers' representation has decreased from one-third to one-sixth of the seats.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>This side of the House opposed this downgrading of employee participation when the telecommunications Bill was debated.  We argued that the four worker director seats should be kept.  We did not accept the case for dropping two worker directors so that KPN-Telia, who have purchased 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann, could get on the board.  If the Minister was so sure that KPN-Telia will act in the best interests of Telecom Éireann, he should have reduced his ministerial directorships and given those places to the foreign institutions.  That has not happened.  The Minister has retained his appointments and KPN-Telia, who have purchased 20 per cent of the company, are getting one-quarter of the seats on the board while the worker directors' representation is being reduced from one-third to one-sixth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We said that, if this was allowed to go through by the Labour Party and Democratic Left, it would diminish the ability of the workforce to influence the strategic direction of this company.  We also said that a change in circumstances, whereby the representation of workers on the board is altered from one-third of the board to one-sixth of the Minister's nominees, has serious implication in the event of any further dilution of the State's shareholding in the future.</P>
      <P>We warned of the consequences for social partnership as the restructuring of the board runs contrary to the commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the programme for Government to extend social partnership arrangements in industry.  We highlighted how the reduction in the number of voting board seats would disenfranchise five of the Telecom Éireann trades unions.</P>
      <P>None of this seems to matter to the Labour Party or Democratic Left in particular who claim some role in Government for the protection of workers' rights but have neglected to do so on this occasion.  They claim to be committed to the concept of employee participation and worker directorships but go along with reducing the involvement of directors on the board of Telecom Éireann from one-third to one-sixth.</P>
      <P>They also ignore the arguments we made in relation to the opportunity to strengthen and deepen employee representation at Telecom Éireann.  We argued during the debate on the Bill that, in addition to the Minister maintaining the four worker director positions on the Telecom Éireann board, he should also have made provision on the board for whatever employee benefit trust is established to hold shares for the workers.</P>

      <P>What is accurate is that the Minister has come before this House this morning to reduce the number of worker directors.  We are debating the Minister's proposal to reduce the number of worker directors from four to two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment proposed less than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not legislating here.  The Minister has a proposal for decision by this House to reduce the number of worker directors from four to two.  If he wishes to change that proposal, he is entitled to do so.  It is not too late.  It is not my proposal to reduce their number from four to two, it is the Minister's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trust which will be set up to hold the workers' shares should also have the ability at <Col N="381" /> some point to appoint its own director.  I hope the Minister will take on board that point.  Holding shares will place a further onerous responsibility on the employee directors.</P>
    <P>The worker directors will need access to the best financial, legal and corporate advice.  Some of my colleagues disagree with me on this point, but I am not averse to the idea if it is agreed by the workers in Telecom Éireann that the representative of the employee trust, that is the trust holding the shares, could have a professional director.  I acknowledge that people on my side of the House have difficulty with that concept but I do not.  This person could help to guide the employees and the other worker directors in acting in their own and the company's best interests in the complex world of finance and corporate law.</P>
    <P>The handling of the worker director issue has been no better than the handling of the other matters relating to the sell-out of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  This House remains in the dark as to the terms of the deal.  Despite the fact that the EU is to give the final go ahead for the Tele-com-KPN-Telia deal in the next few days, there has not been a disclosure of any of the consultants'reports on Telecom Éireann, of assessments made by professional advisers to the Government, of the contract that was signed last July and the date of the final contract.  In other words, this is a secret deal.</P>
    <P>I invite the new Minister, Deputy Dukes, to publish the documentation concerned with this decision.  There is still no explanation as to why 20 per cent of one of Ireland's most successful State companies is being sold for a song in a secret deal or why KPN-Telia holds all the rights and vetoes in this deal.  Will the Minister, Deputy Dukes, tell the House what precise vetoes KPN-Telia holds?  Will the Minister tell the House that KPN-Telia has no more than the ordinary rights of a 20 per cent shareholder?  Will he confirm that the company which will shortly own 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann has no veto on who owns the rest of the company in future or on what the majority shareholder may do?</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Government publishing the documentation, I understand that these vetoes exist and that the tail will wag the dog. The 20 per cent shareholder will dictate the pace, future investment, future sell offs and so on in this deal.  If that is not the case, I invite the Minister to state that my fears in this regard are not well founded.  The only way to do that successfully is to publish the contract documentation, or at least the heads of agreement, between the Government and these overseas companies that led to this secret deal.</P>
    <P>The former Minister exhibited a certain attitude to office which I hope the present Minister does not continue.  One of the hallmarks of that attitude was a commitment to secrecy, a commitment not to publish and not to tell the House very much.  The House was told very little about who owned the remaining shares in ESAT and virtually <Col N="382" /> nothing about the vetoes in the KPN-Telia deal.  The House was told nothing about the real players in the ESB Moneypoint deal.  I am not suggesting anything is wrong, but because these are public deals of State assets all the information should be published, including names, amounts, dates and vetoes.  Why are we not getting that information?  What is the big secret?  Why is The Labour Party going along with all this secrecy?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to change the attitude of the Government and his Department in this regard.  I am sure there is nothing to hide.  Let us have the information.  I am disappointed the Minister is not here because he should do business in a different way.  He is experienced and has a different attitude to this House.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt.  He should now publish all the information concerning this deal.</P>
    <P>There has to be a reason the sale of a minority stake in Telecom which could have raised nearly £500 million four years ago can achieve only £183 million for a 20 per cent stake today.  We did not receive an explanation for that from the previous Minister and I invite the present Minister to give this explanation clearly.  He should not slavishly continue with what is already in place because it is still not too late.  The previous Minister told the annual conference of the Communication Workers' Union on 4 May 1995, that one of the reasons for the alliance was to raise badly needed equity for Telecom Éireann.  At that time the Minister said that new equity from a strategic partner could shrink the debt down to a level where it would be much easier to cope with. Despite that he practically give away 20 per cent with no major investment or reduction of the debt from the new partners.</P>
    <P>The strategic alliance was extremely badly handled by the previous Minister and by Cabinet which allowed it to happen.  Some nine of the ten best telecommunications players in the world dropped out of the race because of the way the Government handled this sell off.  The Minister was then left with KPN-Telia.  I have no doubt they are two respected players, but they are two regional players who knew they had this Cabinet over a barrel because nine out of the ten players had vanished from the scene.  They picked up 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann for £183 million when everybody including the workforce knows that it is worth up to four times that price, particularly when you consider the rights and vetoes that have been given away by the Government and Telecom Éireann to the new minority shareholders.</P>
    <P>The price of £183 million represents just three times Telecom's profits.  It is equivalent to £915 million for 100 per cent of the company or just three and a half times Telecom's real profits of £260 million in 1995.  The German Telecommunications company, Deutsche Telecom, recently raised an amount equivalent to 15 times its profits in a public issue even though it is more heavily indebted than Telecom Éireann.  British Telecom raised an amount equal to ten times its <Col N="383" /> profits.  Why are the Germans able to get 15 times the profits of their company and the British able to get ten times the profits of their company for the value of the shares if we are only able to get three and a half times the value of our shares?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss B &amp; I with the Minister any day he wants to do so.  He cannot put down questions to me according to the procedures of the House but I am delighted to talk about the B &amp; I deal which saved this country a lot of money.  B &amp; I is still going strong, unlike Irish Shipping which went out of business.  People all over the world were left high and dry and no debts were paid.  Employees of B &amp; I are still working today.  I ask the Minister why the British and the Germans can get these kind of deals and the geniuses negotiating the Telecom Éireann-KPN-Telia deal can only get three and a half times profits.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I am keen to see the terms of the KPN-Telia deal published is to establish what was promised to KPN-Telia in relation to links with the world player AT &amp; T.  There had been plans for KPN-Telia to firm up alliance plans with AT &amp; T.  This was to be done through KPN-Telia's European grouping, known as Unisource, which is not directly involved in the Telecom deal as only two parts of Unisource now are tied up with Ireland.  The AT &amp; T &mdash; Unisource deal has stalled and appears to have gone into reverse.  Key Unisource executives, including its chief executive who, going on previous comments, did not regard the Telecom deal have now jumped ship.  Unisource has also lost its deal in France for an alternative telecommunications network.  The French have now signed up with BT and MCI.</P>
      <P>One of the issues that may also be buried in the KPN-Telia deal in secret is in relation to public flotation of Telecom Éireann.  That may be the real reason Labour and Democratic Left were so keen to keep this deal secret.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House or reiterate the arguments made during the recent debate on the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.  This order is being made under the terms of that Act to give effect to the provision for changes in the number of worker directors to be appointed in view of the introduction of a strategic partner to the Telecom company.</P>
      <P>When considering the development of Telecom Éireann, I recall it was formerly connected with An Post, came directly under the ambit of the Civil Service and was the responsibility of the Minister for Post and Telegraphs.  Major developments have taken place in both services in the intervening years since they were removed from beneath the umbrella of the Civil Service.  I was in Government when the decision to separate them was made.  The then Minister for Post and Telegraphs, Mr. Pádraig Faulkner, introduced legislation to establish two commercial semi-State companies, An Post and Telecom Éireann.  The employees in Telecom who experienced the trauma of that change would agree, with the benefit of hindsight, that it was in the best interest of the company.  Those employees gained from the change and the service provide by Telecom Éireann and An Post improved greatly when they transferred to the commercial arena.  I do not believe there are any doubts in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act brought the development of <Col N="385" /> Telecom Éireann a further stage toward a goal which my party would like to see eventually realised.  The introduction of a strategic partner to Telecom Éireann will prepare that company for eventual privatisation.  This represents a natural progression for Telecom, from its time as a Civil Service State company to its establishment as a commercial State company to the introduction of a strategic partner from the private sector and eventual privatisation.</P>
    <P>I recall occasions during election campaigns when my Labour Party colleague in Galway West always sought, at public meetings, to highlight the difference between the principles for which we stood.  He indicated he was solidly in favour of maintaining this type of service under the umbrella of the State and did not agree with any attempt to sell off any part of &ldquo;the State's family silver&rdquo;, namely, State or semi-State commercial companies, particularly those that were successful or had a capacity to generate substantial profits.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall that Deputy Michael D. Higgins and Deputy Stagg were considered the two champions of the extreme socialist view on State involvement in the economy within the Labour Party.</P>

Deputy Higgins became a Minister, Deputy Stagg became a Minister of State and these toothless tigers seem, on the surface, to have completely reneged on the <i>raison d'être</i> and political principles they stood for and sought support for when they went before the electorate.  There has been a tremendous transformation in the approach of both Members since they assumed ministerial office.  One can only come to one's own conclusions regarding the reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, introduced this provision to reduce the number of worker directors on the board of Telecom Éireann from four to two.  My party is satisfied with the progression of Telecom from a Civil Service State company to a commercial State company to a strategic alliance with a reduction of State involvement.  I am certain the next stage will be full privatisation.  As forecast, there will be an expansion of the strategic alliance representation or percentage and Telecom will eventually enter the private sector.  It is interesting that the debates on this order and the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 are being steered by the Minister of <Col N="386" /> State, Deputy Stagg.  It may not be satisfactory for me to hold up a mirror for him to reflect on the position he has adopted and the way he reneged on the political objectives he espoused and the principles he enunciated.</P>

      <P>I do not know how the Minister of State can satisfy his political conscience with regard to the proposals before the House. However, it is a matter for him to live with his political conscience and explain to the people from whom he sought support on a different platfrom, his reasons for changing mid-stream.  Perhaps, in time, he will join the Progressive Democrats because he seems to be moving in our direction or is he merely doing so as a device to retain office?  Do principles not matter when it comes to the crunch?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state these things because principles were enunciated in the past which differ from the steps being taken.  The way the sale of the 20 per cent or 35 per cent, which it may eventually turn out be, was carried out left a lot of unanswered questions.  That is most unsatisfactory. We raised these questions during the debate on the Bill and there is no point in rehashing <Col N="387" /> them, particularly when the Minister with full responsibility is not in the House to answer them. We have a newly appointed Minister who was not involved in the negotiations or in making the final decision.</P>
      <P>People are puzzled at how £5 million was paid to consultants to advise the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications on how it should seek a strategic partner for Telecom Éireann.  It is an enormous amount of money. Outstanding resources are available in the Department and having spent some years in it, I am aware of the quality and abilities of its personnel. Amounts paid to consultants for similar work do not compare to the £4.5 million or £5 million paid to consultants to advise on the sale of part of Telecom Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a huge question mark over that particularly when only one company was interested in buying this share and did so practically on its own terms.  Most private commentators and the Opposition parties are highly critical of the low figure achieved for such a substantial part of this valuable company.  Whatever about selling part of the family silver, to sell it at under its full market valuable is a crime and a huge financial loss to the taxpayer who invested enormous sums of money in the development of Telecom Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was tragic to see a valuable national asset being sold under its value.</P>
      <P>It is a little disingenuous to seek to retain the four worker directors while reducing them to two. It is a type of &ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo; sleight of hand approach.  To pacify one aspect of worker participation, the Minister has said that only two shall be entitled to act as directors but that there shall be alternates who shall be permitted to attend board meetings.  I do not know if that is good commercial practice.  It is a political compromise which may not be in the best interest of the commercial development of the company. It smacks of a lack of political will to do the job in the way it should have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is State involvement, I <Col N="388" /> have no objection to workers being represented on the board.  What role does the Minister see for worker directors?  There is confusion about their role, responsibilities, rate of remuneration and for what they are being remunerated.  When an employee of the company is appointed worker director, will he continue to carry out his normal duties in whatever position he holds?  Will he be free to attend board meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know what the practice is because I had some difficulty with this in the past.  It is important it is brought into the open.  Is a worker director open to promotion in whatever position he held?  Will he continue to be in receipt of his salary and is it topped up by overtime opportunities?  Will he undertake normal duties? If he does not do so, what is the basis for the level of remuneration given to him?  What does the worker director do besides attend board meetings? Directors receive a low level of remuneration.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of expenses.  What facilities are made available and who decides on them?  Does the Minister have a say or is it a matter left solely to the discretion of the chief executive, the chairman or the board?  Who decides on the practice?  Is the practice the same in all commercial semi-State companies, that is, that when a person is elected director of the company they enter into a new arrangement with their employer?  The Minister should give information in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in addressing questions to a junior Minister adopting such an attitude.  Perhaps the Minister does not know the answers or does not want to give them.</P>
      <P>Practices have developed in commercial semi-State companies which are not good commercial practices.  It is appropriate to discuss this matter in the House.  I hope the Minister will give a comprehensive response rather than say there has been no change since I was in the Department because I discovered there were different practices in commercial semi-State companies.  I would like to know the practice in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the number of worker directors is to be reduced from four to two and if the practice has been that they do not do work for the company and that they are paid their full salary and telephone, office and travel expenses, I would like to know the full plethora of facilities made available <Col N="389" /> to them.  If two of the worker directors are to revert to being alternate directors, what will be the difference in the method of remuneration and the role and the duties they perform as employees?  That is an important question which arises now because we will have two classes of worker director.  Only two will be voting directors, but the four may attend board meetings. What will be the distinction in their roles?  If I could get information on that, I would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that now the Tipperary slasher has been sidelined, the ground hurling will still continue.  It is ironic that 20 years ago a Labour Minister, Michael O'Leary, introduced a worker participation Bill.  I think today of the same former Deputy who now sits on the Bench, dispensing justice, listening to legal argument and reflecting on the Labour Party.  He probably thinks he was run out of the Labour Party because it did not consider his thinking sufficiently socialist and left wing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg might have been one of the people who edged the former Deputy out of the party.</P>

He certainly would have considered it to be in keeping with the ethos of Democratic Left.  However, the current leader of the Labour Party, who took over from Deputy O'Leary, is now shifting to the right and dismantling everything the latter wished to achieve.</P>
      <P>Is it not also ironic that the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, attends Labour Party regional conferences proclaiming himself &ldquo;the bulwark of public enterprise.  People can depend on me and the Labour Party to look after the best interests of the public sector&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should not hold his breath.  I am disappointed at the loss of two worker director positions on the board of Telecom Éireann, which is a 50 per cent decrease. One shareholder position may be available in the long-term.  When this Bill was published I thought the reduction to two positions would not be final and the number of worker directors would increase again to three and possibly four.</P>
      <P>Given my semi-State background, I believe the board should consist entirely of workers.  I give credit to the Minister for holding this position and ensuring that in the future this will be the case.  I was suspicious that other people might come in through the back door.  I regret the loss of two worker positions.  If a company is part-privatised, that is probably to be expected.  It is sad that the Government has privatised a section of the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Seán Ryan said in his contribution on Second Stage that the privatisation of 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann was incidental.  I was amazed at the use of that word.  When I think of the many utterances of Deputy Seán Ryan and the Labour Party on this issue in this House and elsewhere, including our previous existence in a semi-State body, I find this extraordinary.  Our views on those issues as private citizens are close.  We all <Col N="394" /> have to vote for certain issues occasionally and if my party was privatising a company I would reluctantly go along with it.  I do not think I would have the neck to come in and say it was incidental and insignificant.  A number of people on the other side of the House, particularly Democratic Left and the Labour Party, have a brass neck in condoning something they previously criticised.  I would vote for it if my party was doing it but I would not have the neck to be openly seen as a hypocrite.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to score a point off Deputy Séamus Brennan as regards the B &amp; I Line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying Telecom Éireann is the equivalent of the B &amp; I Line.  We have made the first step towards that.  I agree with privatising but the big ideological argument concerns the first step.  As regards Irish Life and Greencore, the argument was about the first percentage. It does not matter any more about next year or the year after when it becomes another 10 or 20 per cent.  The Minister is admitting this by equating B &amp; I Line with Telecom Éireann. That first step has now been taken and it will be easy for this or any other Government to say it is slightly extending that point.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann was the jewel in the crown. For those of us who believe semi-State companies should be kept under State control, the argument has been weakened.  There is a hole in the dyke because once a big company has been privatised it will be harder for people in Government or in Opposition to hold and defend that line in future.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech that when an employee shareholding scheme in Telecom Éireann is established, the members of the scheme will be entitled to nominate a director for appointment to the board by the Minister.  In that event, the employee director who was second placed in the last election will become an alternate director and the term of office of the alternate director who was placed second of the two alternates in the election will expire.  Can the Minister clarify this?  Perhaps I should read it a third time, but I find it hard to understand.  I invite the Minister to reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In Telecom Éireann and the semi-State company I worked for, the big unions took the first couple of positions and the last position usually went to a coalition of the smaller unions.  I do not know whether anything has been or can be done to protect the minor unions.  In all walks of life the big bodies take most of the power.  When there were four worker directors there was a certain amount of protection for the smaller unions. <Col N="395" /> I have not read the order and I do not know if they can be protected in some way.  In a similar manner, in reducing a five seat constituency to four or three, somebody will be squeezed out and it is more difficult for the less important people who may have a genuine point of view to put forward. When it comes to picking the third person for the shareholder stake, there is a danger that the small unions will be pushed out.  Perhaps there is no real solution and they cannot be protected.</P>
    <P>I am saddened at the way the matter has progressed. This issue, aside from getting into a row about the price we have sold shares for, weakens the view of all of us who believe that the State should have an involvement in semi-State companies. I have not changed my mind and I regret what is happening.</P>

      <P>I am the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, which has the responsibility of overseeing the operations of at least 32 commercial semi-State bodies.  We have the opportunity to hear the views of a committee of 11 Members.  The Progressive Democrats have recently been unable to cover all the committees and does not have a member on this committee.  It has, however, had members on previous Joint Committees on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies.  Democratic Left does not have a member on the committee either due to its lack of numbers.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the comments of other speakers, particularly Deputy O'Keeffe lecturing the Labour Party on its participation in, and policies for, semi-State bodies.  He must have had a lapse of memory because I recall that Irish Life and Greencore were commercial semi-State bodies sold off by the Fianna Fáil Administration. Members of the committee, such as Deputy Cullen and Deputy Séamus Brennan, repeatedly call for the privatisation of many semi-State companies or the part privatisation of the successful elements of semi-State companies.</P>

      <P>When the former Deputy Michael O'Leary was Minister for Labour 20 years ago he brought in the Worker Participation Act.  There was some opposition at the time from the then Fianna Fáil Opposition to that Act which provided for worker representation on boards. Twenty years have elapsed since then and perhaps there is a need for change and for different views on the future of many of these companies to be taken on board.  I do not criticise the decisions made by Fianna Fáil to privatise two of our most successful companies, which are now booming in the private sector; their share prices <Col N="396" /> have greatly increased and their managements have been updated and improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why the Labour Party should not consider the question of where the semi-State companies can usefully do a job on behalf of the State which cannot be done by others.  Parties are, of course, entitled to reflect a private sector view if they wish.  However, a party cannot walk on both sides of the street at the same time.  They cannot say from the backbenches that they want to uphold worker directorships and oppose privatisation and, at the same time, have representatives on semi-State boards who demand the privatisation of semi-State companies where possible.  I am glad to see Deputy Séamus Brennan coming into the Chamber to advise his colleague that he wishes to see liberalisation and privatisation occurring in many semi-State companies.  I ask him to inform his colleagues on the backbenches of the policy of Fianna Fáil which is, in many cases, to privatise either part or all of the semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>I remind the Opposition we are having a very interesting debate on the ESB at the moment. There is an acceptance that, because of EU directives and regulations, changes have to be made in semi-State companies.  They cannot exist in the form they did 20 years ago because we must implement these directives&mdash;liberalisation is being forced on us, if that is how we wish to look at it.</P>
      <P>At meetings of the joint committee I have listened to the Opposition arguing for the part privatisation of certain areas of CIÉ and Bord na Móna.  Some of us had the opportunity two weeks ago to attend an international conference in London dealing with telecommunications and I recognise that small players are lost in that area.  They have to join big players because of the nature of the industry.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Government to sell 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann to KPN-Telia has maintained a very large public sector involvement in telecommunications.  The Minister could have retained the number of worker directors on the board but that would have meant increasing the number of directors by at least six to preserve a balance which would represent the shareholding of the new partner.  We all recognise that the way to solve problems with directors in private or semi-State compaines is not to increase the number but to maintain an efficient sized board which can make decisions without requiring a mini Dáil or Seanad to operate over all the semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister solved the problem by setting the maximum number of directors at a particular level while, at the same time, reflecting the worker interest in this company.  There will be two voting worker directors and a further two will be there to make the voice of workers known without having voting rights.  The only alternative <Col N="397" /> would have been to increase the number and have more private sector directors on the board.</P>
    <P>When the Government makes a decision on the lines of what has been demanded by the Opposition during meetings of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, which are seldom held in public, those Opposition views should be reflected in its contributions to the debate on that decision.  No semi-State company can sit back and say it will always be a public company under the aegis of the State.  The Opposition has criticised semi-State bodies for running hotels and other activities which it believes should be run by the private sector.  That criticism can be made but I opposed it when I was Minister for Labour because I bought the Great Southern Hotel group and maintained them as hotels.  They would otherwise have been broken up and sold off and perhaps their subsequent success would have been lost to us.</P>
    <P>There should be consistency.  What happened 20 years ago was right for that time but the world has moved on.  As very active members of the EU, as we have seen over the past six months, we have to take a broader view.  However, the State can still provide in many areas where the private sector failed to do so.  The private sector failed to provide competition in several areas in the past and the State had to step in and provide the necessary commercial activities.</P>
    <P>We should always be prepared to review the running of companies.  We also have to implement EU directives and regulations which means that competition may be forced on us in particular areas.  When the State has to improve semi-State bodies by making alliances with private partners those partners must be included on the board.  However, many semi-State bodies need strong representation from a party, such as the Labour Party in Government, to ensure we do not rush towards a mad privatisation of every semi-State body.  The Deputy can be assured that view is reflected strongly by the Labour Party at our committee, often in opposition to the views of the Deputy's party.</P>

What I want the Deputy and his party to accept is that there are many people in that party <Col N="398" /> who believe the future for many public companies is to privatise them.  That is certainly the policy of the Progressive Democrats.  My intervention is simply to point to the party policies in this area. Let the parties tell the House and the public what their policies are, and let us not have one backbencher saying he is in favour of the public sector and people on the Front Bench saying they are for the private sector.  At least let us be honest about it.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this matter.  I do not intend to speak at length because the detail of the strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and KPN-Telia has been well laid out over many debates in this House by my colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  What was viewed with seriousness was the lack of openness and transparency in laying before the House and the public generally the exact components of the contracts and other matters appertaining to the new relationship. Where it is intended to sell 20 per cent of a shareholding of a company to an outside consortium, the people have a right to know about it.  I wonder if situations like this will be covered by the new Freedom of Information Bill, which will be in the Seanad tomorrow and will wend its way through the Dáil thereafter.  I wonder whether the legislation can be applied retrospectively to give people the right to find out the terms of the contract entered into by the Government with Telecom Éireann's new partners.  If it could, I am quite sure a citizen of the land who wishes to know will come forward.  We asked that the documents be laid in the Library and put before the House.  That has not happened.  Therefore we can only surmise as to the detail of the agreement.  I hope my colleague, Deputy Brennan, will be able to avail of the new legislation to arrive at the facts of this sale.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh, for whom I have a great regard, said Irish Life was privatised under Fianna Fáil and the Government got a golden handshake.  On seven separate occasions I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question and by way of question on the Adjournment.  I have to contradict the Deputy and say that all is not well with the conditions of the workers in Irish Life, and they include sales managers at all levels and staff at administrative level.  Each time I raised it in the House the Minister for Finance said it had nothing to do with him.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment also said it had nothing to do with him, that Irish Life was out in the brave new world and could take care of itself.</P>

      <P>I did not privatise that company, <Col N="399" /> and there is no point in the Minister of State saying I did.  I am answering Deputy Kavanagh who said that everything in Irish Life is wonderful now.  As late as yesterday I received a detailed submission from a group of sales people at an intermediate level detailing what I would regard as shabby behaviour towards them by the management within that company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My second point is that this purports to be a draft order on worker participation in State enterprises, but it is really a draft order on diminished worker participation in State enterprises.  The Minister should read the small print which states there are to be fewer worker directors on the board of Telecom Éireann than heretofore to make way for two of the directors from KPN-Telia to take their place on the board. It may be simplistic to ask&mdash;nobody seems to be able to give me an answer&mdash;why not leave the four worker directors and increase the number of directors.  Deputy Kavanagh said the alternative was to increase the number of directors and that was not considered feasible.  He referred to it as creating a Senate&mdash;I do not know what he was getting at.  Surely it would have been better to have kept on the two worker directors.</P>

      <P>I have followed this with great interest from the workers' point of view and I think we will rue the day this House passed a Bill which chopped two worker directors from the board of Telecom.   I agree with the concept of stakeholding.  It is the rage in the UK&mdash;Tony Blair is moving from <Col N="400" /> town to town, hamlet to hamlet and county to county promoting the idea of stakeholding.  The concept is interesting and it is a good idea because it creates interest in the company, a feeling of having a stake in it and wanting to see that stake properly realised. It must be asked, and as time goes on it will be frequently asked, why 20 per cent of the company was sold for £183 million which is widely regarded in commercial circles as a paltry sum for one fifth of what will be a very valuable arm of commercial activity.  I wish to say directly to the workers in Telecom Éireann that while the deal was approved officially what is at stake is that two worker directors will be taken from the board of Telecom.</P>

      <P>Given the allegations made on the other side of the House it is important that somebody on this side in addition to the Minister of State put on record the position of the Labour Party on semi-State bodies, including Telecom Éireann.  The Labour Party considers that these bodies have a crucial role to play in the wider community.  We want to see a strong, well managed and dynamic public sector because it has a major contribution to make to the country's future.  Nobody in the Labour Party would wish to participate in a Government hostile to the involvement, continued growth and development of the semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation enabling the formation of a strategic alliance by Telecom Éireann has been debated.  I expressed views on Second Stage regarding worker participation and numbers and I asked the Minister of State to meet with the unions and the worker representatives with a view to producing a Bill that would represent the <Col N="401" /> views of the membership of the company, including the unions and the workers' representatives. However, the ultimate priority was to establish a board to undertake a strategic alliance which we all, including the unions, consider to be necessary to meet changes in the telecommunications industry which are taking place throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It is important to note how Fianna Fáil changes its approach to these matters.  Like Deputy Kavanagh, I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. At every opportunity Fianna Fáil members of this committee effectively seek the privatisation or sale of sections of some of the most valuable semi-State bodies which play a major role in development, such as the ESB, Telecom Éireann, Bord na Móna or Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Séamus Brennan, I welcome, albeit from a different perspective, the appointment of Deputy Dukes as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  The Deputy expressed the hope that the Minister would examine and change the policy of the previous Minister and take a different approach.  He even questioned the need for Aer Rianta to diversify. Everybody knows the dilemma Aer Rianta faces over duty free shopping, which is due to be abolished in 1999.  While I hope the Government will do something to delay this, the company will be in difficulty if it does not diversify to meet this challenge.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked the Minister to reconsider the need for a second commercial airport for Dublin.  It is my view, and that of the majority of people in north Dublin, that such an airport is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>That means asking him to reopen the matter.  I welcome the strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and KPN-Telia.  The question to be addressed is what kind of board will ensure the best results for Telecom Éireann. Deputy O'Rourke suggested that its membership be increased to 19.  If Fianna Fáil was in Government it would not recommend such a number for a board that must take strategic decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also suggested that the Government, with the support of the Labour Party, was reducing worker representation on the board.  He is technically correct, but the decision was taken after much consultation.  However, his suggestion that there be four worker directors on the board must be considered in the light of the <Col N="402" /> relevant amendment he proposed to the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on the motion.  The reason the Minister, Deputy Dukes, is not present is that he is attending a special Council of Telecommunications Ministers in Brussels, convened during our Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the order is to facilitate the restructuring of the board of Telecom Éireann in the context of the strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and the KPN-Telia consortium.  As part of the strategic alliance agreement, provision must be made for board representation for the partner.  While representation for the partner is to be provided the Government wishes to see a continued meaningful role for employee directors on the board together with continued provision for voting control by the majority shareholder. The formula agreed with the strategic partner, taking account of detailed discussions with the trade unions in Telecom Éireann, is a board comprised as follows: seven Minister's appointees &mdash; which is a reduction in the number of ministerial <Col N="403" /> appointees &mdash; three partner appointees and four employee representatives, of which two are alternate directors with the right to attend all board meetings but not to vote except in the absence of the directors to whom they are alternate.</P>
    <P>It is not normal for the deliberations of the board of Telecom Éireann to be decided by a vote.  That the two alternate directors will not have a right to vote, except in the absence of the directors to whom they are alternate, would not normally be an issue in board deliberations.  This new board structure reflects both the scale of the alliance transaction, the position of the majority shareholder and the importance attached to the participative role of the employees.  More importantly it does this in the context of a manageable board structure which will see the main board continue to act as the key decision-making forum in the company.  The proposed board structure is designed to maintain employee representation on the board of the company while ensuring an appropriate balance of voting strength among the various interests on the board.  The solution of providing for two alternate directors to offset the reduction in employee directors from four to two raised substantial policy and legal questions.  The arrangement worked out has no precedent that I am aware of and this required careful consideration of a number of questions relating to the status of these alternate directors.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted was to base the concept on an already existing formula containing the Articles of Association and this formula was adapted to the needs of the emerging situation.  I am satisfied this is the most practical approach.  I am also happy the solution addresses the concerns of the employees, the Government, the company and the strategic partner.  Any move to retain four votes for employee representatives would require a board membership of at least 19 to protect the position of the shareholders.  In consequence the real work of the board would inevitably be devolved to sub-committees, thereby effectively weakening the impact of the employee directors in the process.  The board size would also inevitably complicate the transaction of board business at a time when the company needs to become sharper and quicker to respond to an increasingly competitive market place.</P>
    <P>The solution to the board restructuring in Telecom Éireann, as set out in the Act, does not bypass the employee directors.  It does not shuttle the representational interest of the staff into a meaningless cul-de-sac.  Employees will continue to have a strong role at the key decision-making forum of the company.</P>
    <P>I wish to address a number of points made by Deputies during the debate.  The amendment tabled by the Opposition on Committee Stage and debated at some length was for two worker directors and one alternate.  Not only was there to be two worker directors but authority was to be given that effectively the union would be entitled to have a person who was not a worker <Col N="404" /> as one of the two worker directors.  That would effectively reduce the worker directors to one, with one alternate.  We have improved on that position considerably.  I thank Deputy Ahern and others across the floor of the House for the idea that worker directors should be workers and people in the company.  There was extreme pressure from Fianna Fáil to allow for one of the directors to be a non-worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows where that came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate where it came from, but I had to deal with the argument in the House. Ireland accepted the Maastricht Treaty by an overwhelming majority.  Arising from that treaty we have to separate roles within the companies we now have.  We had a choice.  The Minister could have retained the right to regulate, the power to determine policy down to detail and hive off the stockholding or, we could retain the stockholding or the majority part of that stockholding and give away the right to regulate.  We have made a decision to give away the regulation, to put it outside the authority of this House and outside the democratic control.  That is a major decision and a major shift in the balance of power in our society.  This House will no longer have that regulating authority over very large chunks of our economy and services.  I am not convinced which is the most valuable, and whether to hive off the shareholding and retain the right to regulate would have been a more powerful position for the people to retain.  In years to come we will look at that seriously.</P>
      <P>Arising from Maastricht had we made the other decision that would have required the mass privatisation of State companies.  Under the Maastricht Treaty we will effectively be obliged to give the major control of State companies to the regulator who will not be responsible to a Minister or to this House.  That is what we are dealing with.  Let us stop the shenanigans and stop playing politics.  The reality is that the authority of this House will be greatly reduced by the Maastricht Treaty and the knock-on decisions and directives arising from it.  Some people particularly on the Opposition side of the House still argue that not alone should we give away the regulation but the stockholding as well.  The regulation is going and irreversible decisions are being made.  There are examples of giving away.  Irish Life was mentioned by both sides of the House. One Deputy said that as a result there were good financial results.  There are good profits for the private owners of Irish Life.  A Deputy from the Opposition was able to point out it was a bad deal for workers in that privatised company.  That is something about which we need to be conscious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has a cheek to lecture the Government on privatisation.  As we saw on a recent television programme, when he was Minister he sold a chunk of real estate in Blessington valued at £100 million to a private company for £1 million.  That was not a good deal for the public. <Col N="405" /> During the same period public lands in County Kildare were sold to the private sector.  It ill becomes Deputy Molloy to lecture the Government on the need for value for money given that he did not get a good deal for the public in the sale of real estate in Blessington.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to the last in, first out system.  Under the worker director scheme, the last two elected worker directors will become alternate directors.  If a shareholding scheme is adopted and a worker director is appointed the elected worker directors will move down one step, which means the last person elected will be the first out.  However, it may happen that the last person elected is the person appointed under the shareholding scheme.  Deputy Molloy asked about the position of the alternate directors.  It will be the same as that for directors and, apart from not having the right to vote, there will be no change.</P>
    <P>The Government selected the KPN-Telia consortium which has a genuine long-term commitment to the market.  These companies have the necessary strategic and financial resources and experience to bring major benefit to all telecommunications customers.  It is nonsense, therefore, to suggest the sale of equity in Telecom Éireann should be considered simply in cash terms.  It also explains why the Opposition's suggestion that the shares should be offered to pension funds is nonsense. The idea that shares could be offered on an exclusive basis to Irish pension funds only is unworkable and unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The transaction structure of the Telecom Éireann alliance comprises four key components: (1) an initial payment of £183 million for the transfer of 20 per cent of the equity; (2) an option on an additional 15 per cent on payment of a further £200 million; (3) valuation clawbacks on <Col N="406" /> the partners' stake leading to potential total proceeds for the State of more than £500 million &mdash; this means the company will be valued after a three year period and if there is an additional valuation the Government, the shareholder, will take 60 per cent of the increase in value and will be entitled to payment for it &mdash; and (4) significant contributions of human resources, technology and access to global services by the partners.  No other investor could meet this key requirement demanded by Telecom.</P>
    <P>The initial proceeds of £183 million are linked to the transfer of the 20 per cent stake.  However, the price for the 20 per cent stake and the 15 per cent option will not be fixed for three years and it is likely to amount to £500 million for a 35 per cent stake.  Given the potential of the market and Telecom Éireann's state of development, the Government was, rightly, not prepared to agree a final price at this stage.</P>
    <P>No development such as the alliance can be achieved without all parties being prepared to change.  We have addressed the changes required to the board structure of the company in a wholly realistic manner.  This has been done in a way which is sensitive to the interests of all parties involved.  I am particularly pleased that during the passage of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act through the House it was possible to address the key issues involved in restructuring the board having full regard to the views of Members as well as to those of semi-State employees and worker directors.  The order is designed to implement the solution agreed by both Houses when the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was approved by them.</P>
    <P>I commend the order to the House.</P>

Who summoned the Attorney General to Government Buildings on that day?  Given that it now transpires that nobody knew more about Mr. Ben Dunne's payments than the Attorney General and Mr. Dunne, will the Minister of State accept that it was inappropriate for the Attorney General to have been in Government Buildings on that day in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about the absence of the Taoiseach.  The Deputy's office was made fully aware of the Taoiseach's position regarding his absence from the House yesterday and today.  The secretary in the Taoiseach's Office spoke directly to Deputy O'Donoghue regarding this matter and asked him if he wanted to proceed with this question.  Doubt should not be cast on the Taoiseach's intentions. It was right for him as President of the European Union to go to the United States and Canada on very important Irish and EU business, which he did perfectly.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Attorney General being in the vicinity of Government Buildings on that day, he comes into his office most Saturdays.  I wish to reiterate what the Taoiseach told the Dáil about this matter.  At column 463 of the Official Report of 3 December 1996, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> Arising from a media report it is appropriate at this point to refer to one further matter.  The Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, informed me on 30 November that he had acted as counsel for Mr. Ben Dunne in the litigation between Mr. Dunne and other members of the Dunne family.  This fact was already public knowledge.  No conflict has arisen in respect of any matter upon which the Attorney General has been asked to advise.  He is, of course, aware that a conflict could arise if his advice were sought by Government on any issues which arose in the litigation previously referred to.  If this should happen, there are procedures in place in the Attorney General's office to ensure the advice required by Government could be provided without the Attorney General becoming involved.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Taoiseach is the President of the European Union is irrelevant.  We can await another day to get a white horse for the new Napoleon of Europe.  That is a different issue.  I am asking the Minister of State a simple question. What was the Attorney General doing in Government Buildings on 30 November 1996 and who summoned him there?  Those are legitimate questions. Given that the Attorney General knew more about the payments made by Mr. Dunne than anybody other than Mr. Dunne, it appears that it may have been inappropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Regarding the Price Waterhouse report, the Government has asked an independent senior counsel, Mr. James Nugent, to act and give advice, and that is the proper way to proceed.  As Deputy O'Donoghue will recall, this information was given verbatim by Mr. Matthew Russell at a meeting of the special committee convened after the fall of the previous Government.  The fact that the Attorney General comes to work each Saturday does not entitle Members on the far side of the House to continuously cast doubt on his integrity.</P>

      <P>No one on this side of the House is casting aspersions on the Attorney General, we are merely posing simple questions about his presence in Government Buildings on that particular day.  Does the Minister of State not accept that his attendance in Government Buildings that day was the subject of much comment and that he was seen &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; on RTÉ News entering Government Buildings that evening?  Does the Minister of State not accept that the presence of the Attorney General in Government Buildings was the subject of much media comment that evening and the following day?  When present in Government Buildings on that day, will the Minister of State say whether the Attorney General had any communication with the Taoiseach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>The Taoiseach said at column 463 of the Official Report of 3 December 1996: &ldquo;The Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, informed me on 30 November that he had acted as counsel for Mr. Ben Dunne in the litigation between Mr. Dunne and other members of the Dunne family&rdquo;.  That was the Taoiseach speaking on the Nomination of Member of Government motion on that day.  It appears that the thrust of these continuous questions is to cast doubt on the integrity of the Attorney General, for reasons I fail to understand.  The most eminent, certainly skilled lawyer nationally has been appointed to the post of Attorney General to which he is devoting his attention full-time; he could have continued to practise but has not done so.  He has honoured all his commitments, leaving me at a loss to understand the reason for these repeated questions.</P>

As the Minister of State appears to imply, I have not suggested, nor would I, that the Attorney General would divulge information available to him in relation to a client; I would be very surprised if he did.  Having unsatisfactorily answered previous supplementaries, will the Minister of State say whether it is satisfactory that the Attorney General, who had Mr. Ben Dunne as a client should have been in Government Buildings on the day in question?  Bearing in mind that the Attorney General also had a conflict of interest in relation to Mr. Goodman and Mr. Matthew Russell, will the Minister of State inform the House whether he considers he can properly fulfil his role as legal adviser to the Government in the context of a number of such conflicts of interest?</P>

      <P>I should remind him that it is impossible for any Attorney General to predict wherever and however conflict of interest may arise until such time as given cases may present themselves.  The present Attorney General is in no different position from that of any of his predecessors. By reason of the nature of his practice before appointment such conflicts may arise. Whenever necessary, as in the negotiation of the handing over of the Price Waterhouse report, the advice of independent counsel is sought by and furnished to the Government.  I am sure the Deputy agrees it would be undesirable to appoint to the post of Attorney General a barrister who had never practised, which would be the only sure way to eliminate such potential conflicts of interests.  Since Deputy O'Donoghue in his practice as a solicitor has availed of the services of the Attorney General, I am quite sure he agrees with what I have just said.</P>

As all Members opposite will be aware, this obligation continues at all times after any such relationship has ceased unless with the specific consent of a client.  I cannot say what the state of knowledge of the Attorney General was at that time but, in any event, he would have been bound by that code of conduct not to reveal any information he may have had.</P>

Is the Minister of State saying that the Attorney General's presence in Government Buildings was a coincidence?

      <P>I have said repeatedly that the Attorney General works most Saturdays.  As Deputy McGinley said, it would be unusual if he did not turn up on a Saturday.  I remind the Deputy of the Taoiseach's reply in this House on 3 December in which he stated:</P>
      <P>The Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, informed me on 30 November that he had acted as counsel for Mr. Ben Dunne in the litigation between Mr. Dunne and other members of the Dunne family.  The fact was already public knowledge.  No conflict has arisen in respect of any matter upon which the Attorney General has been asked to advise.  He is, of course, aware that a conflict could arise if his advice were sought by Government on any issues which arose in the litigation previously referred to.  If this should happen, there are procedures in place in the Attorney General's office to ensure the advice required by Government could be provided without the Attorney General becoming involved.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach clearly said that the Attorney General spoke to him on 30 November and told him he had acted as counsel for Mr. Ben Dunne in litigation between Mr. Dunne and other members of the Dunne family.</P>

The approved capital projects that could not proceed because of weather restrictions and other development problems will go ahead.  Those projects to which the £600,000 has been allocated will go ahead during 1997.  That is a great move forward.</P>

      <P>The proposal to develop an airstrip on Inishbofin island is one of the priority access projects selected by the islands committee of Galway County Council.  I support the approach being taken by the council and the Inishbofin Development Company to have a detailed feasibility study carried out on a proposed development. As soon as certain administrative procedures in connection with the feasibility study are completed, I hope to be in a position to allocate funding towards this project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reply.  However, I am disappointed that it has taken so long to get this far.  It was the number one priority of Galway County Council's submission last June.  When will the Minister sanction this feasibility grant and when does he hope to have the feasibility study completed?  Is it his intention to sanction a similar study on the construction of an airstrip on Clare Island and Inishturk <Col N="419" /> as the viability of airstrips on those islands will depend on developing the three islands together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has good knowledge of the islands.  He gives them very good support in the House, and I admire him for that.  Before funding can be allocated to any project involving the engagement of consultants standard practices must be complied with, and that is the reason for the delay.  Galway County Council has advised that in order for it to prepare a business plan it will require expert assistance.  The council is in the process of selecting a consultant.  When the original application was made for Inishbofin it involved an estimated £100,000.  A feasibility study would be required in that case.  The estimate was later revised to £20,000.  Galway County Council has been in continual contact with the interdepartmental committee about this matter and progress will be made quickly.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of the people on Inishbofin and the need to develop the strips on other islands such as Clare Island and Inishturk.  However, Mayo County Council has not made a submission in that regard.  In examining the matter the committee will probably abide by the wishes of the islanders.  A new ferry was launched last year for Clare Island, costing a little more than £500,000.  A song released about life on Clare Island refers to the new ferry from Roonah to Clare Island.  Life on the islands has improved in recent times.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister has broadened the question, will he agree it is extraordinary that non-Gaeltacht islands are the only islands without subsidised ferry services?  Does he intend to rectify that matter in 1997, particularly in view of the withdrawal of services from the island, including the imminent closure of the one shop on Inishbofin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the number of people on Inishbofin has fallen.  The last census showed a decrease of approximately 30 between 1991 and 1996, from 181 to 150.  That does not auger well.  We are most anxious to assist the people on Inishbofin and will examine the matter of ferry subsidies during 1997.  The committee decided that in the first year access would be a priority.  Proposals for subsidising non-Gaeltacht island ferries will be favourably examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister responsible for the reform of family law I am conscious of the support for marriage given by voluntary organisations involved in marriage counselling over many years and of the great debt of gratitude we owe them for their perseverance with work in this and allied areas when official support of a practical nature was limited.</P>
      <P>Because of this I was determined, when appointed Minister for Equality and Law Reform, to endeavour to enhance the support available to these voluntary organisations and also to the State-funded Family Mediation Service in order that they would be able to continue to provide a quality professional service to their customers. Accordingly, in 1994 I was successful in obtaining funding for a scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage guidance and counselling services.  A sum of £750,000 was made available to these organisations in 1994 through my Department and again in 1995.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1994 grants to these organisations were administered by the Department of Health and supplementary grants were paid by the Department of Social Welfare in respect of some organisations. The amounts paid out in individual grants were relatively small and had remained virtually static over recent years.  In 1996 funding was increased to £900,000, the scheme was extended to include organisations providing counselling for children whose parents had already separated and 75 marriage and child counselling organisations nationwide benefited accordingly.  In the Estimates for 1997 I have again obtained £900,000 for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The State Family Mediation Service is the only mediation service funded by my Department.  In 1995 £260,000 was expended by my Department in the operation of the Family Mediation Service and I obtained funding of £300,000 to finance its operations in 1996 and again in 1997.  My development plan for the service is currently being implemented.  This involves the expansion of the Dublin Family Mediation Centre by the addition of an area mediation co-ordinator and the establishment of a new centre in Limerick which will be staffed by an area mediation co-ordinator and a part-time mediator.  The appointment of the area mediation co-ordinator for Limerick has been made and work is in progress on the appointment of a person to the post at the Dublin centre.  It is my intention that the service will soon set in train the procedures necessary for the recruitment of additional mediators.  I would expect that in time this will lead to the services of the Family Mediation Service being within reach of people regardless of where they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to supporting marriage and as Minister for Equality and Law Reform I have endeavoured, through the legislates <Col N="421" /> ive programme I initiated in my Department, to achieve this.  Placing the funding of voluntary organisations providing marriage and child counselling services on a sounder footing as well as taking steps to develop the Family Mediation Service is further evidence of my and the Government's earnest in this regard.</P>
    <P>I received with great interest the Interim Report of the Commission on the Family and in particular the recommendations contained therein regarding counselling and mediation.  Many of these issues are already being attended to by my Department.  For example, a list of voluntary marriage and child counselling organisations will be published in a booklet on the services operated or funded by my Department which impact on families.  In addition, the implementation of the development plan for the Family Mediation Service is a significant step towards establishing a soundly based National Family Mediation Service.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in congratulating the many voluntary organisations and volunteers working in this area.  The question relates particularly to the resources needed in 1997.  The Minister gave a recitation of what happened in the past, but the Book of Estimates for the public Service, Vote 33 &mdash; Equality and Law Reform &mdash; shows that the figure provided for the Family Mediation Service in 1996 was £300,000 and the figure for 1997 is also £300,000.  The amount provided for marriage and children's counselling services in 1996 was £900,000 and the amount provided for 1997 is also £900,000.</P>

      <P>The Government proposes no increase for 1997.  That is bitterly disappointing for those involved in that area who expect, with the introduction of the divorce legislation early in 1997, there will be increased need for mediation and counselling services.  However, the Government is making no extra provision.  Can the Minister explain how, in the absence of extra funds, those services are supposed to meet the extra demand which he acknowledged would exist in 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Woods is disappointed but there is no need because the organisations are happy with the remarkable expansion and progress they have achieved in the past few years.  The Deputy would be well advised to remember the bad old days before 1993, when some of these organisations existed on <i>ad hoc</i>, casual, small, uncertain handouts from the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare. Contrast that to the status, position and secure funding I have provided to those organisations since I became Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The funding started at £750,000 and has <Col N="422" /> risen to £900,000, far higher than the total amount of <i>ad hoc</i> grants given in former years by the Departments which then had responsibility for them.  Significant, tangible benefits have accrued from the scheme of grants I introduced.  Premises and facilities have been improved, training for counsellors and supervisors have been extended. I am aware that, as a result of these funds, members of many of these groups are exhibiting a new enthusiasm for marriage counselling.  Many others have initiated new projects or have been enabled to move to premises which are much more suitable for their work.  An appreciable number of new groups has been established and others which were experiencing financial difficulties as a result of past restrictions are enjoying a new lease of life.  Many communities which had not previously enjoyed the benefits of having a local marriage counselling group in their area now have that experience.  All this follows from the huge increase in funding I have made available to them and I assure Deputy Woods they are happy about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the urgent need for additional resources as we go into 1997 and the recommendation of the Commission on the Family for an increase in these services.  This Government commission reported in late November, a matter of weeks ago.  It stated there was a significant role for the promotion of greater use of early counselling and mediation.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on what has been done.  As he knows, I began some of that work when I was in the Department of Social Welfare. It was not specifically our area but we were dealing with some voluntary organisations.  I was happy when the Minister took responsibility for that area and had the opportunity to develop it. However, we are facing into another year and have received the studied, careful, interim report of the Commission on the Family, which states there is a need for extra resources in both these areas.  We know there will be a huge increase in demand because divorce is being introduced in the new year, yet the Government is providing no extra funds, although the Taoiseach promised they would be granted.  I want to assist the Minister by creating as much fuss as possible about this, as there is still some hope that the Government will give him extra funds at budget time to cater for the obvious demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy is anxious to assist in this matter as there is a way in which he could do so &mdash; by asking his colleague, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to cease describing expenditure of this nature as a frittering away of Government funds.  I am also pleased Deputy Woods acknowledged that these important social expenditures are necessary. That is why the Government is making these substantial allocations, far higher than provided in previous years, which have enabled 75 marriage guidance and counselling organisations <Col N="423" /> nationwide to receive funding.  I can provide any Member who is interested with a list of organisations which received funding.  As a result of the allocations of £900,000 for this year and the same amount next year, they are geared up to make provision for this most important area of social work.  This is the type of social expenditure to which this Government is committed and which it will continue to undertake in the future as it has in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the suggestion by Women's Aid that a resource unit be established to provide and co-ordinate a long-term response to tackling domestic violence. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated to the House, in reply to Question No. 98 of 25 September 1996, that the office of the Tánaiste has been assigned responsibility at central Government level for co-ordinating action to deal with relevant Government Departments and other interested groups on the issue of domestic violence.  On that occasion he informed the House about the establishment of a working group to develop a co-ordinated response and strategy. That group, chaired by the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste and at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, comprises representation from seven Government Departments, including my own, the Garda Síochána and interest groups such as Women's Aid.  Part of the remit of the group is to examine existing services and supports for victims of domestic violence and to make recommendations on how those services and supports could be improved and made more effective. The suggestion from Women's Aid will presumably be taken into account by the Government working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a recent survey commissioned by Women's Aid has shown that 18 per cent of women reported that they had been subjected at some time to either mental cruelty or another form of physical abuse, 11 per <Col N="424" /> cent had experienced physical violence, meaning not light but serious violence, and that of those who had experienced violence, 71 per cent had suffered broken bones, head injuries, loss of consciousness and miscarriages?  Would he agree, therefore, that this is a particularly urgent matter?  Those who are dealing with it in Women's Aid and other organisations in that area recognise the need for a resource unit, which should be set up without delay.</P>

      <P>I fully share Deputy Woods's concern about this serious subject.  As the House will know, in fulfilment of my ministerial responsibilities I introduced and, with the assistance of colleagues in the House, speedily processed through it, the Domestic Violence Bill.  I understand that Act is operating very effectively and is bringing considerable relief to many women in particular.</P>
      <P>The working group to which I referred operates under the ambit of the office of the Tánaiste. Relevant Departments are represented on it, namely, the Departments of Justice, Education, Social Welfare, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Health as well as the Garda Síochána and the health boards.  In addition, the NGOs represented on it include a representative, lately of Threshold but currently with Dublin Corporation, a representative of Women's Aid, the National Women's Council, MOVE, the Cork Rape Crisis Centre, the Family Law Association of Solicitors and also Father Pádraig Greene of Boyle, County Roscommon who has a special interest in that regard.  All relevant Government Departments and NGOs are being drawn together and I look forward to their ongoing work in this connection.  I am sure the suggestions from Women's Aid will be taken into account by the Government working group, in the course of its deliberations.  I fully concur with the comments and observations made by Deputy Woods and I am happy to be in a position to assure him that setting up this working group indicates the Government's serious concern about this matter and the active and proactive steps it has taken and will continue to take in that regard.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the publication of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which will have a profound effect on the lives of people with disabilities and their families and carers.  The report is a unique and historic document which has seen, for <Col N="425" /> the first time, people with a disability speak with one voice and clearly articulate the steps required to ensure they will be treated as equal citizens. The recommendations in the report will become the cornerstone of future Government policy on people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The report impacts on a wide range of policy issues which are the responsibility of many Government Departments and agencies.  The Government has decided to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the report, and has authorised me to establish an interdepartmental task force, chaired by my Department, to begin work on the preparation of that plan.  I have already put arrangements in train to set up the task force which will meet early in the new year.</P>
      <P>I have also been authorised by Government to establish a monitoring committee, comprising organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers, service providers, the social partners and Government Departments, to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations.

Since the publication of the report was later than many people anticipated, it is important that the understandable frustration of people with disabilities is taken into account, particularly when we consider the appalling position in which those people find themselves in society.  The Minister said also he has sought nominations to the monitoring committee. Who has the Minister asked to nominate people to the committee?  Will the nominees be people with disabilities?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Keogh for her kind comments about the commission and its report. In regard to the nomination of persons to the monitoring committee, rather than get involved with negotiations on the various organisations I have asked the commission to meet one more time to nominate for me four or five members of the committee who will be the representatives of people with disabilities on the monitoring committee. I understand the commission will meet for that purpose on 10 January next.  There will be other representation also on the monitoring committee but so far as representatives of people with disabilities are concerned, they will be nominated <Col N="426" /> by the commission and I will appoint whoever the commission nominates.  In so far as the report of the interdepartmental task force is concerned, I expect there will be a time constraint and I hope its initial report will be available by perhaps the end of June.</P>

      <P>In his forward to the report Mr. Justice Flood called for immediate action on six issues; for the sake of brevity I will not refer to them all.  Will the Minister be in a position to act immediately on those issues which cover substandard facilities for people with disabilities as well as funding of the permanent Council on the Status of People with Disabilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that at this time, but obviously such issues will have the immediate attention of the task force.  The task force will have the entire report and it will be open to it to draw any particular matters to my attention.  Various matters that have relevance to the report of the commission are already ongoing, both in my Department and in others.  The report contains 402 recommendations, so we are talking about a major piece of work that will be the responsibility of Government for a number of years to come. Prioritisation will be a major undertaking for the task force.  That is the reason I am anxious to get it up and running as quickly as possible, likewise the monitoring committee which will work in association with it.  We have to make a major start on this project to decide which recommendations will be brought forward as priority items.  I will be in a better position to judge the situation when I get the report of the task force in the middle of next year.</P>

      <P>I have been authorised by the Government to establish an interdepartmental task <Col N="427" /> force to begin work on the preparation of a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  I have already put in train arrangements to set up the task force which will meet early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The Government has also authorised me to establish a monitoring committee, comprising organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers, as well as the social partners and Departments, to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  In this connection, I have asked the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities to meet on one more occasion to nominate four or five members to the committee. I understand this meeting is scheduled to take place on 10 January 1997.</P>
      <P>Among the issues to be considered by both these groups will be the question of establishing a national disability authority.  I look forward to considering their recommendation in this regard in due course.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister expect the national disability authority will be established? He told us he has been given authority to set up an interdepartmental task force but what is the time frame for the establishment of the authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say at this point.  The question of the establishment of the national disability authority will be one of the important matters to be dealt with by the task force which, as I said, is being established on foot of the publication of the report.  That process is under way and letters to the relevant Departments were issued on 12 December asking for their nominees to the task force.  The manner and timing of the establishment of the authority are some of the key matters which the task force will examine, no doubt in consultation with the monitoring committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are great fears that this matter will be put on the long finger and left in abeyance for quite some time, and that there will be more talking, discussions and task forces.  Most of the people involved know what needs to be done.  The report set out many of the practical measures which need to be taken.  Will the Minister and the Government not consider giving the task force a time limit, such as three months, for producing definite proposals so that it will be an action task force?</P>
      <P>Where is money provided in the Estimates to meet those positive proposals?  There is no additional money in this year's Estimates for the implementation of any of these proposals.  What plans does the Government have to provide resources to meet the priorities set out by the task force? Otherwise it will just be another talking shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="428" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of holding up the operation of the task force.  As I said, letters have already been issued by my Department to relevant Departments asking them for their nominees to this task force.  A recommended time period &mdash; the middle of next year &mdash; will be set for the presentation of the task force's report.</P>
      <P>We are talking about 402 recommendations which have to be sifted, examined, prioritised and costed and arrangements must be made with the relevant Departments.  We are not talking about their implementation by just one Department but about responsibilities affecting most, if not all, Departments.  Most Departments will have roles and involvements in regard to people with disabilities. These must all be arranged, costed and prepared.  Many Departments already have funds provided for various aspects of the lives of people with disabilities.  The extension of those on a year on year basis will have the attention of the monitoring group, in particular.</P>
      <P>These are sensible procedures to put in place for dealing with a very major report covering all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities.  The Government takes this very seriously which is why it set up and funded the commission.  There will also be a permanent Council for the Status of People with Disabilities which will have a major input and play a major role.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that never before has any Government got as near to addressing the realities of the lives of people with disabilities.  This report will be a blueprint for their lives and their assistance over the years.  I am very pleased, as is the Government, to have been instrumental in producing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in November 1993.  We now have the report in December 1996.  Could the Government not provide the resources to implement even a small number of the recommendations? For example, there is a request for a disability support service which would ultimately come under the national disability authority and would provide disability resource centres throughout the country.  We know that disability resource centres work because I was involved in setting up one with the Irish Wheelchair Association which has been extremely successful and very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Government not say at this stage, or in the next budget, that some practical step will be taken so that people with disabilities will see that this will not be just another report to be considered at some future date?  All these matters should be considered but some practical actions should also be taken.  Will the Minister seek resources before the budget so that some practical steps can be taken urgently?  Meeting that request <Col N="429" /> of people with disabilities will give them confidence in the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for Deputy Woods to flick through the report and pick out one particular item from 402 recommendations, but the Government must go about this in a sensible, practical, ordered way.  It is doing that by setting up a task force to prioritise these items and a monitoring group, which will include in its membership people with disabilities, their families and carers, to work with the task force.</P>
      <P>As far as funding is concerned, various Departments already have built into their funding various aspects of the commission's report.  For example, the Department of Education has ongoing programmes for people with disabilities and my Department has produced anti-discrimination legislation, which is a subject extensively dealt with in the commission's report.  Of course, the Government will keep under review at all times funding needs in a budgetary context on a year on year basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods can be assured that the Government, having set up this commission, secured its report, set up a task force and monitoring committee and provided funding for an ongoing Council for the Status of People with Disabilities to give them a permanent, ongoing voice, will take care of their needs and roles safely and securely into the future.  The Government regards these issues as extremely important.  We take the view that people with disabilities are full citizens and must be provided for with exactly the same care as everybody else.  We have established that procedure, base and precedent which will be put into force this year and in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that none of the recommendations in the strategy for equality will be in place until at least six months' time?  It is very important for the Minister to be exact about that.  People with disabilities welcome the report, but they are impatient.  Would it not be possible to implement some of the recommendations before the six months have elapsed?  Will the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities be up and running in the early months of next year as reported?  Without in any way taking away from the work of the task force, will the Minister agree that the six issues brought up by Mr. Justice Flood in the foreword to the report point to issues that could be addressed without waiting for the results of the task force examination? If there are over 400 recommendations, does it not make sense that some of the more obvious ones might be put into operation sooner rather than later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities have fixed a date in March for the launch of the organisation, and extensive arrangements are under way in preparation for it.  A number of regional conferences have been held &mdash; I addressed the regional <Col N="430" /> conference for Leinster which was held in the last couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>Implementation of recommendations is an ongoing procedure in the various Departments.  The Departments will look at the Commission's report to see how it impacts on their work programmes for people with disabilities.  I cannot say that any particular recommendation will be dealt with now, but it is open to Deputy Keogh to table a question on any particular item to the Minister who deals with that aspect.</P>
      <P>These matters require funding, and it is provided by the Government in the Estimates for 1997.  Deputy McDowell, the spokesman on Finance for the Progressive Democrats, and Deputy McCreevy, the spokesman on Finance for Fianna Fáil, who again and again pass adverse comment on the Government's social expenditures &mdash; they call it frittering away taxpayers' money &mdash; have to accept that they cannot have it both ways.  We will wait to see what kind of discussion takes place in the House tomorrow on the Estimates. There is no point in Deputies Keogh and Woods coming in at Question Time and telling the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that there should be more expenditure on this or that when they send in their spokespeople on Finance to criticise the Government's expenditure on important social matters such as the needs of people with disabilities, education, health, environment, housing and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be of some use to the Minister on the question of remarks made about spending.  The Minister's colleague in the Department of Education needlessly spent £150,000 on a very glossy report on education which had already been published in black and white.  That is the kind of waste of money we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister touched on a very important point.  He must realise that now is the time to do something about people with disabilities. Various things have been done over have years, and the country is much better off.  There is a need to keep expenditure under control, but that is a separate question.  The Government should also recognise needs.</P>

I look forward to his support on these matters when the Government debates them tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 12 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I propose to have the Equal Status Bill published shortly.  The enactment of equal status legislation is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965.  The proposed Equal Status Bill will prohibit discrimination on specified grounds only.  The right of a publican to refuse admission for any reason other than discrimination on the specified grounds will be unaffected.  The Bill will not change the obligation of publicans to run orderly establishments.</P>
      <P>In preparing this Bill I have had a series of meetings with vintners and other service providers and have invited proposals for safeguards to be included in the Bill which would meet their concerns.  A number of constructive proposals have been made, and these have been carefully considered in my Department.  I intend to ensure that the Equal Status Bill, while meeting its essential objective of outlawing discrimination on specified grounds, will not harm the legitimate interests of vintners and other service providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly what is meant by &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;? I have seen many reports on this, and have even been told that the Bill would be published tomorrow, which I was delighted to hear.  Obviously, I was misinformed.  Does the Minister hope to publish the Bill and have a debate on Second Stage early in the new year?  Is he satisfied that he has arrived at a suitable compromise, bearing in mind that many other minority groups are concerned about the publication of the Bill. To a certain extent travellers have been blamed <Col N="432" /> for their lobbying in relation to the Bill.  We have been unable to interpret the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; over the past year because we have been led to believe on many occasions that the Bill was about to be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of the Equal Status Bill is at a very advanced stage.  It had been hoped to publish it during the present Dáil session but I regret it has not been possible to meet this target.  However, I expect to publish it early in the new year and am hopeful that we will be in the new to debate it on Second Stage early in the new session.  It has been a difficult Bill to prepare.  It covers a wide range of activities in connection with which great care was required.  I look forward to discussing with colleagues in the House the safeguards I will introduce in the Bill and all other aspects of it in due course.  I will listen carefully to contributions; our legislative system is especially constructed to that end.  I will also keep an open mind on these matters and will constructively and sympathetically consider workable and practicable suggestions as the Bill proceeds through both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Publication of the Bill has been continually deferred.  Only last week the Taoiseach advised that it would be published before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of problems that may arise with regard to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989?  While the Act is mainly concerned with the protection of workers, section 7 provides protection to people visiting those at work, including visitors to licensed premises. While it may be for the courts to decide on issues arising from this, there is also a duty of care to customers.  I am concerned that the proposed legislation may take this away.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline what he meant when he referred to specified grounds only?  Will a publican have to go to court if he refuses a person? We have often debated situations where proof may not be available to pinpoint those engaged in anti-social activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to have a productive discussion on Question Time as to what precisely will be in the Bill.  We must await its publication. When it is before the House we can have a detailed and constructive discussion on all its aspects.  I have noted the Deputy's remarks regarding section 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  I do not see how it will impact on the Equal Status Bill, but if on seeing the text of the Bill the Deputy considers there is such a connection I will be happy to discuss the matter with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been hoped to publish the Bill during this session.  Regrettably this has not been possible, but we are getting close to the stage when it will be possible to have it cleared by the Government and published.  I hope we will be able to <Col N="433" /> proceed with this very important legislation as soon as possible in the coming session and I look forward to debating it with Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The study carried out by Fr. Micheál MacGréil, entitled Prejudice in Ireland Revisited, which I launched on 22 November 1996, illustrates the continuing prejudice against certain groups in our society, and reinforces the case for effective anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, currently awaiting Report Stage in the Dáil, and the Equal Status Bill, which will be published shortly, will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds, both in employment and non-employment areas.  While legislation alone may not fully change attitudes, the enactment of anti-discrimination legislation will afford protection to many groups in our society, including groups similar to those covered in Fr. MacGréil's study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to legislation currently before the House and the forthcoming Equal Status Bill.  The need for such legislation is underlined by Fr. MacGréil's findings.  With regard to his findings on prejudice against the travelling community, does the Minister believe that in tandem with changing legislation there is the potential to change attitudes, especially the appalling attitudes often displayed towards travellers? Does he believe that legislation alone will assist in changing these attitudes or can other devices be used and does he consider that he or his Department has a role in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions Fr. MacGréil's research threw up disturbingly high levels of prejudice which many of us would like to think were not present.  It will take more than legislation alone to change people's attitudes in these areas.  We all have a responsibility in this regard. The kind of work undertaken by Deputy Flood, <Col N="434" /> including his outspokenness on these issues, is most helpful and important.  I compliment the Deputy on his consistent stance in this area.</P>
      <P>However, legislation is important and necessary. Apart from other considerations, it shows the Government is giveing a lead and indicates, by definition, that there is a need for it.  By its action the Government also gives a lead in demonstrating that we must all be conscious that there is an unacceptable level of prejudice.  In Ireland the numbers of people comprising minorities are minuscule when one compares our position with the number of racial minorities in other countries such as the UK, France and the Netherlands where there are percentages of minorities which are very visible.  The number of minorities here is extremely small and there is less justification for prejudice amoung us of the type indicated so disturbingly by Fr. McGreil's research.  He deserves our congratulations and thanks for the carefully researched work he has done and continues to do in this area.</P>

      <P>That could be considered but we did have the report on travellers relatively recently which made a number of recommendations, which are in the process of being dealt with by the various Departments which have responsibility in that area.  Fr. MacGréil regards status legislation. In his address at the launch of his book in Maynooth, at which I was present, he specifically referred to the importance of the equal status and employment equality legislation and urged the Government to proceed with it and ensure it was passed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 2, after &ldquo;abolished.&rdquo;  to insert &ldquo;All offences carrying a penalty of imprisonment for a period of five years or greater shall henceforth be known as felonies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from the Minister's proposal to abolish the concept of felonies as we have known them and to introduce the concept of arrestable and non-arrestable offences.  On Second and Committee Stages Deputy Lenihan and I referred to the difficulty of completely abolishing the concept of felonies given that Article 15.13 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The members of each House of the Oireachtas shall, except in case of treason as defined in this Constitution, felony or breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest in going to and returning from, and while within the precincts of, either House, and shall not, in respect of any utterance in either House, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was attempting to overturn a provision of the Constitution by way of legislation.  As a provision of the Constitution can only be overturned <Col N="438" /> by the electorate, it is obvious the Bill needs to be amended.  My amendment proposes that all offences carrying a penalty of imprisonment for a period of five years or more shall henceforth be known as felonies.  Deputy Lenihan, who brought this matter to the attention of the House on Second Stage, has tabled a similar amendment. The Minister clearly accepts our argument as she has also tabled an amendment in this respect. I have no great problem with the Minister's amendment which states:</P>
    <P>In page 9, to delete lines 26 and 27 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  For the purpose of Article 15.13 of the Constitution and for that purpose only, offences which were felonies immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue to be treated as felonies and, accordingly, for all other purposes any rule of law or enactment whereby an offence is, or is regarded as, a felony shall be construed as relating to an indictable offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, the only purpose for which a felony will now exist in law is, strangely enough, for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some cynics may say this is appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dissatisfied with the Minister's reply on Second Stage and I am glad she has accepted our point that the term &ldquo;felony&rdquo; is used in the Constitution and we may not abolish it. The legislation will abolish the concept of a felony for all purposes except for the limited purpose of defining an offence which it may be possible for us to commit and in respect of which we may not claim privilege.  I thank the Minister for tabling her amendment which is more extensive than those tabled by Deputy O'Donoghue and me.  As amendment No. 5 meets the substance of our point, I will not move my amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Donoghue on Committee Stage was to take account of the reference in Article 15.13 of the Constitution to the term &ldquo;felony&rdquo; in respect of the provision of immunity from arrest for Members of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Justice stated on Committee Stage that she would consider tabling a Report Stage amendment on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as drafted, will increase the level of immunity from arrest envisaged in Article 15.13 as Members of the Oireachtas will be liable for arrest in the circumstances set out in that Article only in the case of treason and breach of the peace but not in the case of a felony.  The inclusion in the Bill of a saving provision which will &ldquo;save&rdquo; felonies &ldquo;For the purpose of Article 15.13 of the Constitution and for that purpose only...&rdquo; is a sounder approach to this problem.  Amendment No. 5 achieve this purpose and meets the concerns of the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4; In page 4, line 28, to delete &ldquo;including&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;excluding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our thanks are due to Deputy Lenihan for bringing this matter to the attention of the House as otherwise the Bill would have been clearly unconstitutional. There is every possibility that the Bill may prove to be unconstitutional in that it allows for arrest without warrant in an individual's family home.  There is a considerable amount of authority to back up this suggestion.  This is why I seriously question whether the proposed power should be conferred.  The minister is introducing legislation which seeks to amend Article 40.5 of the Constitution which state:</P>
      <P>The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of legal precedent concerning the inviolability of an individual's dwelling house.  Mr. Justice Walsh, one of our most eminent jurists, stated in The People v. O'Brien, 1965 &mdash;<i>Irish Reports 142</i>, page 170:</P>
      <P>In Article 40 of the Constitution the State has undertaken to defend and vindicate the inviolability of the constitutional rights of the citizen.  The defence and vindication of the constitutional rights of the citizen is a duty superior to that of trying such citizen for a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>It appears from other cases such as Ryan v. O'Callaghan and King v. the Attorney General that what the Minister is proposing in section 6 may prove unconstitutional.  This argument may stand up ultimately in the Supreme Court.  I am entitled to ask if the Minister for Justice will accept accountability and responsibility if section 6 is found to be unconstitutional.  Instead of reforming the criminal law the Minister has embarked on what can only be described as an inevitable path of constitutional challenge.  Far from assisting in the fight against crime, she is hampering it by seeking to overturn constitutional provisions by way of legislation.</P>
      <P>Since 1765 the executive has been prevented from claiming a general warrant to look through private premises.  This has been one of the cornerstones of our jurisprudence and it was even carried through in Article 7 of the 1922 Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to the Minister is that the legislation is in accordance with constitutional law.  Section 6 provides that, for the purposes of arresting a person for an arrestable offence, a member of the Garda Síochána may enter a family home.  The definition of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; and the changes set out in <Col N="440" /> the legislation are the basis on which it is deemed to be constitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation makes statutory provision for the European Union directive on working time we adopted in 1993.  Similar legislation is being enacted in the other member states.</P>
      <P>I hold a different position from that enunciated by certain sections of the Opposition, particularly the Progressive Democrats who seem to believe the sky will fall in if we provide for an organised pattern of working time in the workplace.  They are harking back to the days of the industrial revolution, when people worked very long hours and women and children worked in the mines.  We certainly do not want that type of working environment. We want a coherent, well organised, healthy, safe and secure working environment.</P>
      <P>When labour legislation was first enacted in the 1930s the average industrial working week was 53 hours.  Surely a reduction to 48 hours &mdash; five hours in six decades &mdash; is not outrageious.  I take issue with the dark picture painted for the industrial sector by the Euro sceptics in the Progressive Democrats and in some sectors of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>This legislation will consolidate and update labour law.  As we approach the 21st century it is coherent safety standards in the workplace.  I am sure all employees will welcome the provision to increase an employee's entitlement to paid holidays from three to four weeks.  This will be enforced on a phased basis and fully implemented by 1999.  It is the norm in most workplaces at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also deals with part-time work and the question of zero contracts which has caused a great deal of industrial strife.  Women have been discouraged from entering the workforce because of the casual way employers treat them.  The rapid increase in the workforce can be attributed to a large extent to the number of women employed on a casual, part-time basis, many of <Col N="441" /> whom are being exploited.  The part-time workforce has increased from less than 10 per cent seven or eight years ago to almost 15 per cent. Therefore, it is necessary to legislate for this area. I am pleased the legislation proposes to ban zero hour contracts and provides that employees shall be entitled to notification in advance of the hours the employer will require them to work.  This takes into account individual and family considerations, which have been abused in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an entitlement by an employee to a minimum rest period of 11 consecutive hours in each 24 hour period, a rest break after every four and half hours worked, a half hour after six hours and an uninterrupted period of 24 hours each week.  It also provides for a limit of eight hours' night work in a 24 hour period and, one of the most controversial provisions, a period of 48 hours rest in a seven day week.  As these provisions currently operate in most good workplaces, we need not apologise for placing them on a statutory basis and for showing social and industrial solidarity with workers here and internationally.  Employees are entitled to adequate rest breaks, leisure time and advance notice of working hours.</P>
    <P>The assertion that we will lose our competitiveness has little basis.  International studies reveal that a workforce performs better in conditions conducive to work.  It is not simply a question of getting more productivity from an increase in the number of hours worked.  More productivity will come from proper team work, management and a happy and motivated workforce. We should respect the dignity of workers and the context in which they work.  The claim from Members opposite that the economy and business will founder does not have any basis.  Competitiveness will be enhanced by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of the 48 hours is a red herring. There is a considerable degree of flexibility within the 48 hour period.  Lunch and tea breaks are not necessarily part and parcel of the 48 hours provision.  The number of hours can be totalled and the period of work can be based on a monthly period or on a period of four, six or 12 months.  There is considerable flexibility where seasonable changes have to be taken into consideration and overtime is necessary at certain times.  The number of hours worked can be totalled and annualised.</P>
    <P>At present only 6 per cent of employees work more than 48 hours.  That covers employees in every area of employment.  Almost 95 per cent of employees adhere to the proposals in this area. Members of the Dáil are one of the few categories which exceed the 48 hours provision by a great many hours.  I often think we would benefit from some form of trade union representation to ensure Members adhere to working a reasonable number of hours per week.</P>

      <P>There is provision for exemptions and derogations from provisions in the Bill.  Employees in the prison service, where there is approximately a 1:1 ratio, work on average 60 hours per week. We should not consider giving a derogation from that provision to employees in that part of the State sector.  Where employees work on a 1:1 basis they should not work many hours overtime because they can get tired easily and in tense situations where sensitivity is required many serious problems can result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill which implements EU Directive 93/104.  For many years labour legislation, notably that enacted as far back as the 1930s, has required updating to make it relevant to modern working conditions.  Reform of that legislation to make it relevant to the modern era was urgently required. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, for doing that.  She utilised the social charter and the social action programme under the European charter to bring our working time and conditions of work into line with what is appropriate in the modern era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill lays down basic minimum standards of rest and maximum working hours for all workers.  I also welcome the fact that it will be implemented across member states of the EU.  The debate on this legislation to which I listened with great interest revealed some <Col N="443" /> interesting characteristics of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  Throughout the European landscape only the battered and totally discredited English Tory Party can surpass the antics of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil when it comes to introducing necessary social legislation.  Across the floor of this House are our Irish Tories.  They fit that label in all respects. They spouted about workers' rights this morning when debating other legislation and now they run to this House as if they were IBEC's lap dogs, representing employers' vested interests and constantly whinge about the rights of large employers when they know the economy, particularly the private sector, can be a harsh place for the working man or woman.  Sadly, some of those people continue to vote for the Fianna Fáil Party although they should recognise that in terms of the most important aspect of their lives that party is their mortal enemy.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the comments on the opt-out clause in respect of the 48 hours provision, it is clear that the party opposite would put workers in a vulnerable position and would require them to almost place themselves in a difficult and heroic role.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy accept an intervention? The then Minister, Deputy Quinn, and our colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, signed for the opt-out clause in regard to the 48 hours provision. The Deputy has talked a good deal about Fianna Fáil, but a Minister of his party agreed to the opt-out clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the record of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Sadly, Deputy Kitt's party has begun to lock itself into the orbit of the Progressive Democrats.  As the pre-election campaign develops after Christmas we will have to draw to the attention of the electorate in greater detail the unfortunate relationship between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and the implications that will have for the working people, particularly for <Col N="444" /> employees in the exposed private sector and for public sector workers.  That is what we will be faced with if we have a harsh English Tory style Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this vital legislation and for steadfastly representing workers, particularly the most vulnerable.  We had to protest on the street and represent workers on zero hour contracts a few months ago when a famous store effectively refused to negotiate with them.  Those employees who are on short-term contracts are required to work difficult hours.  The Minister of State has sought to lay down basic working conditions in this legislation to cover those vulnerable workers.  The provisions in sections 15 and 16 are particularly welcome.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of how one views the opt-out controversy and the 48 hours provision, having regard to basic issues of health and safety and the stress-related character or the quality of much of modern work in our increasingly efficient economy, this is a basic provision which we should require employers to make.  I deplore the fact that the parties opposite have acted as the lap dogs of big business in this regard and refuse to stand up for the workers of Ireland in this House.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provisions covering breaks at work, the extension of holiday time, a rights commissioner, the Labour Court and the LRC. This is fundamental legislation which a Labour Minister and Labour Party are very proud to lay before the House.  There are one or two aspects, perhaps, in relation to zero hour contracts which we will ask the Minister of State to consider.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that within a couple of hours on one sitting day a motion and a Bill are introduced, representing an attack on the rights and freedom of workers.  Just a few hours ago we dealt with a motion on the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1996 seeking the approval of the House to restructure the board of Telecom Éireann following the conclusion of a strategic alliance between that board and the KPN-Telia consortium which will involve its workers losing two of their former four places on that board.  As a compromise the Government has devised a sort of &ldquo;Pat Rabbitte, baby chair&rdquo; type solution which will permit two workers to be present at board meetings as second-class members but their rights and status as full board members will have ceased.</P>
      <P>Now we are asked to deal with this Bill whose provisions constitute a further attack on the rights and freedom of workers.</P>

      <P>Since in 1993 there was no disagreement between the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties in Government, has the Labour Party been corrupted by Democratic Left or Fine Gael? Where are the northside conscience-stricken eight?  While some aspects of this Bill are to be welcomed it is regrettable the Minister of State did not avail of the opportunity afforded by the relevant European Union directive to introduce it in a form that would afford workers the protection envisaged in the directive, the right to choose to work longer hours if they so wished.  It is unfortunate the Minister did not travel that distance.</P>
      <P>Some provisions, such as the zero hour contracts and so on, are welcome although the Minister has not exactly gone wild talking about 24-hour notice and similar aspects on which she touched when introducing the Bill.  To be of any real benefit, such provisions would have to be greatly strengthened.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tom Kitt recently introduced a Private Members' Bill dealing with Sunday trading, on which this Bill will have some bearing.  No doubt we will be afforded an opportunity to deal with that matter in greater depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acknowledging that this Bill has been foisted on us in order to comply with an EU directive, the Minister could have allowed the 48-hour opt-out. We cannot and should not ignore the rights and freedoms of workers.  I am concerned that one of its provisions will eliminate an individual <Col N="446" /> worker's right, in conjunction with an employer, to choose his or her working hours.  It discriminates against hourly, low-paid workers, about whom many crocodile tears have been shed.  It imposes an arbitrary ceiling on the earnings of low grade workers, encouraging a shift to part-time labour, atypical employment, or whatever is the appropriate term.  In addition, limiting voluntary overtime will add to the live register and drive many wishing to have an opportunity to earn a few extra pounds into the black economy. I cannot see any alternative.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, the Minister said workers should not have to work excessive hours for a decent wage &mdash; we all subscribe to that sentiment &mdash; but without the inclusion of the individual opt-out she is raising expectations, giving workers the impression that this Labour Minister is introducing a new law which means we will earn the same money for a 40-hour week.  All Members will have had representations and objections from individual workers rather than from big businesses or unions.  If the real message was clearly understood outside this House, there would be very many more objectors.  Many workers believe they will retain the same wage packet and standard of living having worked fewer hours.  I do not believe the Minister will be able to deliver on that type of perceived advantage for workers and I am particularly unhappy she did not insert an individual opt-out clause.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said the provisions of the Bill will affect 6 per cent or 7 per cent of workers only.  One can jockey statistics about to prove anything.  Although somebody contended that an average Irish employee works only 48 hours weekly, &ldquo;average&rdquo; includes many three-day, part-time, female workers.  Even on the basis of the Minister's own figures, it is evident that 6 per cent or 7 per cent of people work more than a 48-hour week and their standard of living will be seriously affected.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that we are quite willing to enact laws without ensuring their enforcement in the belief that life can continue as before.  Some may say this is yet more legislation which can be thrown on the shelf and that there is no point in continuing that practice perpetrated by successive Governments.  Presuming that the provisions of this Bill will be enforced, I note a handy loophole of exemptions for anybody involved in the business of transportation.  I can foresee many people loading two or three cartons on to a truck for a couple of minutes each morning, pretending they are engaged in transportation, and then returning to their machinery or other normal working practices. If exemption is as simple as that, and that would appear to be its general interpretation, the Bill might as well be thrown in the bin.  There has been some reference to another directive in the offing relating to transport workers, hospital doctors and others who work long hours, so perhaps <Col N="447" /> that loophole will be closed in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an inconsistency in that the Minister of State talks about the numbers of unemployed, about her concern that workers should earn a decent wage, yet if they cannot engage in voluntary overtime &mdash; accepting that some people can withstand longer working hours than others, as I discovered in my own employment &mdash; the Minister has not addressed the consequences. Such workers will continue to want to earn more and their only means will be through a second job or moving into the black economy. One legitimate reading of this Bill is that its provisions constitute an attack on many of the conditions of employment and benefits built up over the years by workers and trade unions.  It will encourage temporary and part-time employment.</P>
    <P>Some people try to improve themselves by educating their children and furnishing their houses and they will work every hour God gives them if they are given the opportunity.  However, we are stopping them from doing so.  I cannot understand why a Labour Minister is trying to discourage people from improving themselves or their standard of living.  That is like saying to someone that because they are a manual or factory worker with a certain earning capacity and who lives in a certain suburb they should not try to improve their lot.  There should always be an opportunity for people to improve themselves and to contribute to society whether in a capitalist or a socialist country.  However, if we tell people they can only work a certain number of hours, we are denying them the right to do so.</P>
    <P>This is a form of snobbery because people who have reached a certain standing in life are trying to deprive others of doing so.  There is much talk at local authority level about social integration, which should be welcomed.  Some local authorities buy houses in private estates for people. However, the Minister is categorising people and saying that because they are a certain type of worker and they have a certain earning capacity, they should not try to improve themselves.</P>
    <P>In my previous job one could improve oneself through promotion.  However, there are no opportunities for promotion for many industrial workers.  The only way they can improve their lot is to work longer hours.  Overtime is the only way that many workers can earn extra money. However, the Minister is capping their earning capacity which means they will enter the black economy in order to improve themselves.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago we were told this legislation would take effect from 23 November.  If it is not passed until February, will it still be effective from that date?  Will the number of hours people have worked from 23 November be taken into account?</P>
    <P>Low paid workers will be hardest hit by the Minister's proposals.  Recently I met workers <Col N="448" /> from security businesses who complained bitterly about these measures.  They work more hours than the average worker because they are needed from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday.  Many of these people work 60 and 70 hours a week but they are paid an hourly rate.  Does the Minister expect them to change their standard of living?  Her proposal to change meal breaks, etc. will not help these people who are being asked to take a huge drop in salary.  This will add to part-time and black economy labour.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the trade unions, which are affiliated to the Labour Party, have not created blue murder at the way the Minister has nullified the conditions of employment set out by the trade union movement over the years.  What will happen if a person works up extra hours over a four or 12 month period?  Must they take two weeks off work without pay?  Must they go on the dole?</P>
    <P>This Bill seems to suggest that the onus is on the individual and on the company to adhere to the legislation when it is passed.  How can that be controlled and what disciplinary measures will be taken against the company or the individual if they break the law?</P>
    <P>The Minister is denying people freedom of choice &mdash; this used to be a Labour Party slogan &mdash; to work the hours they wish.  The Minister should introduce measures which encourage people to work, reward effort and develop a workmanlike ethos.  This Bill probably represents an ideological point of view which gives the Government control over people's lives &mdash; where they live, how they look and the hours they work.  It seems strange that in the same week the Minister published the Freedom of Information Bill, she is taking away people's freedom to work the hours they choose.  Surely she recognises the contradiction?</P>
    <P>Security people respond to emergencies such as if there is a problem on a site or in a factory. The company will want the same person, not a stranger who has been taken off the dole, to deal with such problems as they will know the layout of the premises.  I hope the Minister will do something for this industry because many of its workers are paid on an hourly basis.  They are convinced they will lose the right to earn money and that their standard of living will change drastically. I hope the Minister of State can at least do something for that group of workers as the Bill proceeds through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The spirit and thrust of this Bill was agreed three years at a meeting of social affairs Ministers when Deputy Woods was Minister.  It was decided to have it introduced throughout Europe by 5 November 1996.  Luxembourg has introduced it, other countries may be in the process of doing so, others have reservations about the spirit of the Bill and the UK has decided to opt-out.  My information is based on a submission I received from ICOS in recent days.  Perhaps it is not as clued in as the <Col N="449" /> Minister of State with regard to the operation of this Bill.  To what degree will this legislation be implemented in Europe?</P>
      <P>Certain sections of the community have made representations to politicians.  The security industry has been earmarked today but in my area I have had representations from two leading co-operatives which are concerned about this legislation. Milk is to Limerick what oil is to Texas. People often work excessive hours during peak periods in the dairy industry because of its seasonal nature and many work seven days a week. Concerns have been expressed by workers who consider this an accepted tradition.  Over the course of a year overtime makes it worthwhile for people to work such hours.  Working long hours has been an inherent part of the industry and trade unions accept that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stated that a 48 hour week will be extended by lunch breaks and morning and afternoon breaks.  To a certain degree there is a feeling that certain industries are exaggerating the effects of this Bill.  I want these industries reassured that the Bill has been thought out, is measured and that its implementation satisfies ICOS, the co-operatives and IBEC, which initially voiced many concerns about its introduction.  On a positive note, the Minister of State has attempted to improve a raft of legislation which dates back to the 1930s and encompass it in this Bill. One has to welcome that.</P>
      <P>The dairy industry is worth £6 billion per annum to this country.  There are 26,000 workers and this legislation impacts directly on 8,000 of them.  I have tried to explain the intention of the Bill to many deputations which I have received.  It was planned a long time ago and people do not necessarily accept that.  Perhaps, on Committee Stage the Minister of State could bring us up to date and allay any concerns expressed.  There may be a need to make other exemptions.  Does the Minister have an open mind on this or are the provisions written in tablets of stone?  Are the exemptions earmarked in this legislation the only ones that will be entertained?  Is the Minister afraid of diluting the overall emphasis of this legislation by adding further exemptions or by accommodating a specific industry?</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister had discussions with ICOS and listened to its concerns articulated on behalf of its membership.  I hope the legislation is compatible and fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The broad outline of this Bill is welcome, particularly the issue of zero hour contracts and the application of premium rates or time off <i>in lieu</i> for Sunday work or a combination of both.  My party opposes the Bill because of the <Col N="450" /> refusal to include an opt-out clause.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Finucane speaking in that regard as it is the major problem.  Most of the people who approached me about this were workers in factories, co-operatives and other industries who want to continue working overtime as long as they feel fit enough to do so.  I do not understand why the Minister of State removed this after it had been included by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Enterprise and Employment and by Deputy O'Rourke when she was Minister for Labour in the previous Government. They saw it as common sense.  One of the workers who came to me was a member of the Labour Party.  He said the more time off he has, the more money he needs; the less time off he has, the more money he saves.  He has two children attending university and has to give them money each week.  He has to earn £160 per week to give them £40 each for the week.</P>
      <P>Only one employer approached me on this matter. The others were individuals or groups of workers who were concerned about their right to work overtime. They have been guaranteed overtime for many years and have incorporated it in their lifestyles.  They have new cars and houses or have built extensions to their houses.  They could not afford that lifestyle on a basic wage.  Those people want to continue working for as long as they are strong and able enough.  There is no reason for the Minister of State to be ideological on this issue.  It is a throwback to Democratic Left and strong Labour Party beliefs that the Minister insists on this being introduced.  Members of Fine Gael are extremely worried about this.  The chairman of the Party, Deputy Hogan, stated there were problems in the party in regard to it.  Again, it amounts to the tail wagging the dog.  It is the decision of the Minister of State and Democratic Left to block this. It is frightening she will not even entertain an opt-out clause when it is the workers who are seeking to have such a clause retained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane referred to co-operatives.  Co-operatives are busy at certain times of the year and at other times they could let workers go but do not do so.  There is a tremendous amount of overtime in the high season which, in terms of milk production, is April-May.  The proposal in the Bill would prevent people in that industry, some of whom work 70 hours per week &mdash; rural TDs work 80 or 90 hours per week &mdash; from doing overtime.  Those people are up in arms about the fact that they will be prevented from working more than 48 hours per week.  The worker should have a right to opt out if he does not want to work overtime, but for those who need the extra money, they have a right to work extra hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is surprising the Minister did not listen to the representations made by employers and Members who have regard for workers.  I speak particularly about co-operatives in Tipperary, Merck Sharp and Dohme, Medite and other industries whose workers wish to do overtime but will be prevented from doing so under this legislation.  Will their lifestyle change if they are not allowed work more than 48 hours per week?  Will they have to return their cars or sell their houses because they cannot afford to pay for them? Will it mean they will be unable to send money to <Col N="451" /> their children who are attending college or university?</P>
    <P>Abuse was hurled at us today by the Northside Eight who purport to be the conscience of the Labour Party.  The Minister should be wary when they praise her because they are a dangerous group.  I plead with the Minister to consider the opt-out clause, which would not interfere with the Bill.  The vast majority of workers want the right to work overtime so that they can provide a better life for their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no major criticism of the Bill, but I would like to see the inclusion of an opt-out clause.  At yesterday's meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy it was decided to advertise for interested parties to make submissions on this matter.  This is far-reaching and complex legislation, particularly in terms of the 48 hour restriction.  I come from the north Cork area where a large segment of the food processing industry operates.  For example, in Mitchelstown 1,350 people are employed in the processing business, the lifeblood of the area, and many service industries operate there.</P>
      <P>Considering the seasonality aspect of the dairy industry, and other industries, this legislation will cause problems in terms of loss of earnings and a greater amount of management time will be consumed in organising workers.  That will have critical cost implications for the industries involved.  When this directive was negotiated in Brussels by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; Deputy Quinn was Minister for Enterprise and Employment at that time &mdash; the voluntary opt-out clause was agreed, and I fail to understand what has changed since then.  If such a clause was included it would solve all the problems.</P>
      <P>Not only will the north Cork area be affected by this legislation but so also will many other areas.  The food industry is the backbone of the economy and because of the seasonality aspect of the business a concession must be granted.  I have been lobbied on this matter by people involved in the dairy industry. An extract from an ICOS document states:</P>
      <P>The Irish Co-operative Dairy Industry is a business totalling 6 billion pounds turnover per annum. It employs almost 26,000 persons of whom approximately 8,000 are engaged directly in the manufacture of dairy products.</P>
      <P>That is a huge number of people by any standard. That industry is very important to the economy, particularly to the southern region.  The document states:</P>
      <P>The industry relies in the main on exports and contributes enormously to the Irish economy.  The Irish industry is very different from its counterparts in Europe in that it experiences a marked peak production period in the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Finucane shares my views in that regard because he comes from one of the finest dairying counties, County Limerick.  The dairy industry experiences peak production in May.  There are <Col N="452" /> insufficient processing facilities at that time of year and employees work long hours to overcome difficulties such as breakdowns in plants and so on.  The restriction would have enormous cost effects as more processing facilities would have to be put in place to improve efficiency.  There would be cost implications for the producer, the processor and the economy.</P>
    <P>The ICOS document states: &ldquo;This involves the industry in very high capital investment because it must cope with a high to low ratio of 8:1.&rdquo;  Ireland experiences a higher peak production period than any other milk producing country in the European Union.  For example, Denmark and Holland have a much lower peak of supply.  The document goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Dairy industries in Europe experience an increase of approximately 10% in summer.  The Co-operative Dairy Industry is modern progressive industry which has a positive attitude to its employees.  Earnings in the industry are comparable to earnings elsewhere.  The average basic rate of pay was £200 per week approximately with average earnings in 1995, as per CSO statistics in the region, of approximately £300 per week.</P>
    <P>The health, safety and welfare of its employees is a primary consideration for the industry.  Indeed the industry has an impressive record in relation to health and safety in its plants.  Measures therefore which protect employees are generally welcome. Despite this however the industry views with some concern the current Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996, which is being discussed in the Dáil.  This paper expresses the industry's concerns at various aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The current Bill is based on the Council of the European Union Directive Number: 93/104/EC of 23rd November 1993.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to that directive.  This is important legislation, but the consequences for the industry when it is passed must be spelled out.  The document states:</P>
    <P>A primary area of concern for the Dairy Industry is the question of the consequences arising from the implementation of the Working Time Directive for both the industry and its employees. Milk prices are falling and farmers are facing reductions in income over the coming years.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of that.  This is the first Government in the history of the State that has tampered with farm prices.  There was a re-evaluation of the punt some weeks ago and we are threatened with another re-evaluation, with further price reductions. The Government has no commitment to the agriculture industry.  The document states:</P>
    <P>Restrictions on working time will also mean a fall in earnings for employees.  The results could be serious for an industry which depends on export markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> Since we are an island nation our goods must be transported by ferry, which involves huge costs.  We must compete with countries such as Denmark and Holland where goods can be transported cross-border and there is no cost factor involved.  We have many disadvantages in the marketplace but those are the main ones.</P>
    <P>It has long been the tradition in the dairy industry that employees work a seven day week in the peak season.  This practice has grown up over the years in accordance with the agreement made with the unions representing employees.  When employees require a day off it is arranged locally by mutual agreement. Many of these employees exceed the 48 hour limit and it may not be possible to offset this during the off-season.  In cases where employees do not want the work to be offset, attempts by the industry to alter present arrangements will be resisted by employees and their unions.</P>
    <P>Under section 25, an employer is obliged to keep records which will show whether the legislation is being complied with in respect of any employee.  Failure to do so will be a criminal offence and in any proceedings before the rights commissioner or the Labour Court the onus of proof will be on the employer.  The Bill does not recognise or take account of any contractual or industrial relations difficulties an employer may encounter with employees in seeking the time record, whether by clocking in and out or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I hope I was not too negative.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow herself to be compromised on this occasion.  She should agree with this side of the House and recognise the difficulties the Bill will cause to the processing industry, which have been mentioned by both sides.  I have spelt out the problems which will arise for the farming community and that industry.  We are disadvantaged in having to cross a sea to reach our markets, which involves a huge cost factor.</P>

      <P>It was fascinating to hear the earlier contribution of Deputy Broughan.  I cannot understand the Labour Party's position because this is the most profoundly anti-worker legislation to have been introduced in the time that my family and I have spent in this House.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that two anti-worker measures are being discussed today and I am proud to say we oppose both.  As I said earlier, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order should have been called the &ldquo;Diminution of Workers' Rights in Telecom Éireann Order&rdquo;, because it reduced the number of employees on the board from four to two.  Astonishingly, a Labour Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, introduced a measure to reduce workers' influence and participation.</P>
      <P>Only one provision of this legislation is anti-worker. I agree with Deputies Tom Kitt and Ned O'Keeffe that this is a fine Bill in many respects, for example, in its provisions on zero hour contracts.</P>

      <P>No, and I ask the Minister to let me say my piece.  The anti-worker aspect is the refusal to grant workers their voluntary right to opt out of the legislation.  Anyone looking back in the next century will get a dreadful impression of present day Ireland from this Bill, which goes out of its way to refuse to grant a worker the right to work.  This is extraordinary no matter how one looks at it.</P>
      <P>I would like to show the Minister my file on this legislation.  I have said little on the Bill because my colleague is dealing with it ably but workers all over the country have asked me if I intended to vote to refuse them the right to work.  One person quoted a man mentioned by Deputy Broughan, the late &ldquo;Big Jim&rdquo; Larkin, who said: &ldquo;A man's wealth is his labour&rdquo;. This Bill proposes to take away a man's right to his labour, and hence his wealth, by refusing him the right to opt out.  Deputy Kitt, the Opposition spokesman on labour affairs, has competently pointed out the many fine points in the Bill but this provision is extraordinarily draconian, anti-worker, anti-employee and anti-labour.</P>
      <P>In 1993, I was the Minister responsible for labour affairs, as Deputy Fitzgerald is now.  I travelled to and fro to Brussels, as the Minister of State quite correctly does also.  The directive on this matter was being discussed over a long period and we thought we would never see the end of it.  On the day on which a final decision was to be made, my officials received a telephone call from my senior Minister at that time, Deputy Quinn.  The then Minister for Enterprise and Employment always gave me plenty of leeway in my duties but he gave me a clear order that morning.  Not only was I to vote in favour of a voluntary opt-out clause, I was to speak on the desirability of such a provision.  That was my inclination anyway because I am strongly pro-worker and my record and that of my family on workers' rights is well known.  The record shows that I voted for that provision and spoke strongly for the need for a voluntary opt-out clause, so that workers would have the right to earn if they wanted to.  I accept there are health and safety considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not have a magic wand with which to give proper pay to everyone immediately, but the fallacy that she does is growing.  Two workers discussed this Bill with me; one protested about it but the other said that if it was passed, he would be paid the same for 48 hours as he had been for 60 hours.  I told him he would not and that he would lose his right to overtime; he replied that he would get the same money because the Minister had said it <Col N="455" /> was a method to give people a proper wage.  Of course we want everyone to have proper wages but this Bill will not provide them.  That will be done by a different Bill which will be much more far-reaching than this one.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Kitt and I met representatives from Congress, I showed them a wage slip given to me by a SIPTU member, which indicated his current wages and what he would receive if the Bill was passed without a voluntary opt-out clause.  The Congress people had no answer to that point.  This man has a third child about to enter third level education.  He does not live in Dún Laoghaire or a well-heeled area of Dublin, so the abolition of fees is not a bonus to him because he must give his college-going children £50 each every week to pay for their digs and meals. He said he would not be able to earn extra money and I told him I agreed with his point.  He said he wanted to get the Official Report of this debate so that fellow members of his union could see what was being done to them.</P>
    <P>Workers do not fully understand what is happening here, although the alert ones do.  The legislation has been covered with an enveloping blanket and they assume that Labour knows best, that they should not work any more than 48 hours, and that there will be a redistribution of wealth.  That would be wonderful if it could be done.</P>
    <P>Real distribution of wealth is from the wealthy to the low paid, but that has not happened.  The ESRI report highlighted the yawning poverty gap which increased during the period of our Administration with Labour and this Administration with Labour. We need to redistribute wealth from those who have it.  Abolishing university fees for those who could afford to pay them is not a redistribution of wealth. It would have been far better to raise the income threshold levels for those people caught in the middle.</P>
    <P>Workers do not know what is being done in this legislation.  It is like a massive snow job and nobody dares to speak out.  The man to whom I referred told me something which I found extremely funny, and I have had several other letters and callers on this issue.  He said they were told through their union not to go to any public representative to make a complant about this matter because it was for their own good.  I can give this man's name, address and union number to anybody who wants it, and several others also.</P>
    <P>This legislation is profoundly anti-worker, anti-labour and anti-employee and it is not in the best interests of workers.  I regret very much that the Minister of State has presided over such erroneous legislation, particularly in regard to not allowing a voluntary opt-out, which is a civil right.  It is the right to work, earn a living and provide for one's children. By denying a voluntary opt-out to workers we are taking from them their God-given wealth which is <Col N="456" /> their labour and their right to earn a living for those in their care.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that these workers are not living to high standards or earning huge salaries. They are earning modest salaries but they have worked into their weekly or monthly wage packets a factor, namely, overtime which we are eliminating in one fell swoop in this legislation.  We are saying to them that it is for their own good and they cannot earn any more because we say so.</P>
    <P>I have telephoned people in other countries in regard to this issue and they laughed.  They do not understand the reason everybody is getting so intense about this matter.  We are getting intense because we know there will be a follow-up on this and that workers will be extremely perplexed when the full enormity of this legislation becomes clear to them. That is regrettable but I stand on the commitment I gave when I spoke in Brussels in November 1993, with the words of the then Government ringing in my ears, which were that I should espouse the voluntary opt-out clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille sea.  The thrust of the Bill is good.  Nobody in the House would disagree with it but where abuses are taking place there is not adequate provision in the Bill to stamp out those abuses.  On the other hand, particularly for the small employer, there is over-regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred in her contribution to local arrangements, collective bargaining and partnerships. Did it ever strike her that a large number of employees work for small employers and have a personal relationship with those employers?  Yet in this legislation the Minister will burden those two, three and four person enterprises with this mass of regulation and then give them vastly complicated opt-outs through organisations of which they might not even be members.  The current presumption is that all employers are members of an employers' organisation and that all employees are members of unions.  That is not true.  There is a growing small sector in the economy which does not belong to either of those groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problems in relation to workers have arisen in the large organised sectors of this economy, particularly in recent times in the retail sector.  Everybody in this House would favour bringing those abuses under control.  For a long time I worked as the manager of a small co-operative employing between 30 and 40 people at various times.  I knew all the workers, who lived locally.  Like other small enterprise, we developed house rules that were convenient to us and to the workers.  We entered into dialogue &mdash; it would have been strange to meet every day and not have good dialogue on a worker-management basis.  Most of those workers, or their families, were shareholders in the co-operative and the board of management was made up of local people. <Col N="457" /> We had to devise rules that suited both the viability of the business and the workers.  I have discovered that in drawing up rules in consultation with people 95 per cent, particularly of small employers, will agree rules that are convenient to both sides.</P>
    <P>I oppose zero hour contracts and the lack of notice that seems to be prevalent in some bigger companies. Apart from anything else that is bad business because ules managers have employees support for what they are doing, it is difficult for them to run a good operation.  There is no excuse for any employer planning on that basis.  If we needed 15 people to work on a particular day in the co-operative of which I was manager, we gave the maximum notice to those who would be working that week.  We also had a call-up list and if for some unforeseen reason a person could not attend, we contacted the next person on the list. People always obliged us by coming in to work because they knew the system and they knew that, where possible, maximum notice was given.  It is clear some people do not operate to those standards and it is right that strong legislation protecting workers in those circumstances be introduced, but this legislation is not sufficiently clear in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding Sunday work, we must write into the legislation what we mean by premium rates.  We must be absolutely specific in that regard.  Premium rates should be paid for Sunday work as of right and there should be no beating around the bush in that respect. Furthermore, we should examine the European norm in relation to Sunday work because there is a Union aspect to this issue that is important.</P>
    <P>I support the opening of small retail outlets on Sunday, but it is not necessarily in people's interests if employers force them to work on Sundays.  It is difficult to draw a line between having an opt-out in regard to Sunday work and the fear on the part of employees that if they avail of that opt-out they will be the first to be let go when difficulties arise in the company.  Regardless of whether that might happen, it would certainly be in people's minds.</P>
    <P>On the Sunday work issue in general, we must have regard to the fact that in many rural areas certain sports and community activities take place on Sundays.  There is a certain benefit in co-ordinating it in such a way that the maximum number of people are free to participate in these activities at the same time.  It gives a rhythm to society which allows it to act as a community.</P>
    <P>My colleague has published a Private Member's Bill.  Will the Minister examine this issue in terms of the organisation of society?  We always say in this House that we do something because it is the European norm, but it is my understanding that, other than the UK, we are the only country without some legislation in this field.</P>
    <P>All my colleagues mentioned the limit on hours of work.  I support such a limit as good management practice.  An employer has not a right to force workers to work more than a certain number of <Col N="458" /> hours.  I was slightly amused by the reference to the study carried out in California which showed that working more than 48 hours a week&mdash;&mdash; risk of coronary heart disease.  I hope, in view of that statement, the Minister will organise regular coronary checks, particularly for rural Deputies who work far in excess of 48 hours a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and who must be at not double but treble the risk of coronary heart disease, according to the statistics produced in California. Nobody should be forced to work more than 48 hours a week.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to 12 months, but that is not an option for small employers because the process is too complicated for them.  The kind of companies working in areas such as that in which I worked are more likely to have a four month average.</P>
      <P>I know many people who choose to work long hours over long periods.  I cannot understand why there is not an opt-out to allow them continue.  The reality is that this will not be policed, particularly in small firms employing fewer than ten people.  If the employee does not blow the whistle the employer will not and a nod is as good as a wink.  If that is what is intended it is an abuse of the whole concept of legislation and brings the law into disrepute.</P>
      <P>In my long time as a manager I learned that one can make two mistakes &mdash; not having enough rules and having too many rules &mdash; and one is as bad as the other.  If there are too many rules it is impossible to comply with all of them and the good rules get ignored along with the frivolous or unnecessary ones. That is what will happen in this case.  If an employer and employee decide it is convenient for both to work for more hours than are specified in this Bill, they will ignore the legislation.  However, that opens the door to real abuse.  A distinction will then have to be made between serious abuse and abuse which occurs on a nod and a wink basis between employers and employees to get around regulations which they regard as an unnecessary imposition.</P>
      <P>Many small operations depend on employees working long hours.  I can testify that was the case in the kind of work in which I was engaged for 20 years. I do not know if the people who draw up these regulations comprehend the pressure on employers and employees in small businesses.  The two groups often work in partnership to try to keep those businesses afloat.  Employers and employees in such businesses work longer hours than is allowed for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most small employers work far more than 48 hours a week.  When I was in that position, although I was on a fixed salary it was necessary for me to work for much longer than 48 hours a week to keep the business afloat.  Many of our employees worked far more than 48 hours a week, both in the interests of the business and to provide for their families.  Of <Col N="459" /> course, that would not be necessary in an ideal world. I always worked on the basis that, where possible, it was better if people could earn an adequate income and get all the work done in a well worked 39 hour week.  The reality is that is not always possible but a reasonable opt-out has not been provided in the Bill for such cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the holiday period to four weeks.  I have always believed there should be a direct proportionality between holidays and time worked.  Long before it was contained in legislation, proportion to the hours worked by an employee during the year.  Holidays are very important for workers.</P>
    <P>Something which is wrongly accepted as fact should be made a fact at this stage.  Most workers think that Good Friday is a public holiday but it is only a bank holiday.  It would be a step forward to make Good Friday a public holiday so that workers would not have to take it out of their annual leave or would not be under an obligation if it was given as a day <i>ex gratia.</i> Most people take that long weekend off and it is only reasonable to make the Friday before that holiday weekend a public holiday also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on this important Bill which updates a great deal of outdated legislation on workers' rights.  It is important for us to be seen to be a caring Government. The legislation will be well received by many people, and by employers who wish to be fair to their workers and to give them the best treatment they can afford in the conditions under which their businesses must operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers' conditions have improved dramatically in the last ten years, and unions have played a large part.  It is only right that they do so as health and safety issues are extremely important.  Employees should not have to work under conditions that are injurious to their health.  One major industry on the outskirts of this city, one of the most outstanding employers here, is setting a high agenda for that type of multinational <Col N="460" /> computer industry that is being attracted to this country. I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be an incentive to work. The person who gets out of bed in the morning to do a day's work must have a reward as against the person who simply will not work and depends on social welfare.  I agree with what the Minister is trying to do but I ask her to look in particular at the food industry which is a difficult area to manage in the context of the Bill.  That industry here is worth about £6 billion and employs almost 26,000 people, 6,000 of whom are employed in the dairy sector.  It is in relation to the dairy sector that I will be making my case.  It is a seasonal industry, and in Cavan we manufacture dairy products to a high standard.  Farmers in Cavan work under difficult conditions and, without boasting about my county, if a Cavan farmer were sent to County Meath he would be a millionaire; conversely, a Meath farmer, if he were sent to County Cavan, would become a pauper because he would not be able to manage the land there as we have learned to do.</P>
    <P>Dairying is seasonal in Cavan, and in the constituency as a whole.  There may be other regions where milk can be produced from grass for practically 12 months of the year, but farmers in Cavan are limited to the months from April to September or October when there is a rush of milk to the creameries, with the result that workers must do a great deal of overtime and that is balanced out by the slack periods. The Minister should consider that aspect and ensure that the provisions of the Bill do not impinge on that industry.  I highlight that industry because it is the one with which I am familiar.  There may be other industries, for example, hotels, tourism, etc. that will have difficulty in complying with this legislation. However, I have no difficulty with protecting the rights of workers and making their working environment safe so that families do not have to worry about dangers or the life span of parents who, perhaps, work in chemical industries that might be injurious to their health.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I made about the dairy industry.  I have no difficulty in supporting the Bill but would like a response from the Minister to the points I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be short.  I welcome some aspects of the Bill and compliment the Minister on them.  Governments have been promising for years to introduce such a Bill.  There is concern about one aspect of the Bill, and I hope the Minister of State will take into account the views of both Members of the Opposition and of the Government parties on the problems of overtime in certain industries. People should be allowed to work.  Some people, even if millions of jobs were available, would not work, but others have worked in low paid jobs over the years and have raised children who have been lucky enough to go on to third level education and obtain degrees.  Those people were prepared to work in jobs that others did not want because of the unsocial hours and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider amending the Bill because people are concerned about the impact of its provisions on overtime working &mdash; I received letters <Col N="461" /> from constituents about this.  The Opposition is hyping this up and has referred to matters that are not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has some positive and negative aspects. The Minister should consider what Deputy Boylan said.  I also come from an agricultural area where there are not many major industries.  Some people in the constituency work long hours, but only for a few months of the year.  They are used to this, and if this legislation interferes with their income it will upset and annoy them.  I am aware that it is not the Minister's intention to stop these people from working but to deal with those who abuse the system.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill employees will have a statutory right to complain, if they wish, and to have their complaints heeded.  Those doing seasonal work in industries should not have their jobs interfered with.  The Government should encourage people to work.  If people want and are able to have two or three jobs to supplement their income and assist their families, they should be allowed and be congratulated on doing so.  Too many people depend on the State. Also, we should not drive people into the black economy. They should be encouraged to make a contribution to the State by paying their taxes.  Workers should be protected by law, but if they want to work extra hours, they should have the right to do it.  I hope the Minister will consider the valid points made by all Members.  It is our duty to legislate for the people and to help them.  If people are not satisfied with some of the provisions they should be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Michael Ahern, Mattie Brennan and Batt O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed by the somewhat contentious character of Deputy Broughan's contribution.  My party's record is second to none as far as defending the rights of workers is concerned.  That goes back to the tradition established by Seán Lemass in the 1930s, the work he did in the International Labour Organisation at the time, the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 and his attempt during the Emergency to reform trade union structures and introduce a rational trade union structure.  This would have been very much to the long-term benefit of the trade union movement which could have spoken with a more unified voice; that was not possible because of the continued fragmentation of British-based unions here, something the Labour Party historically defended and our party did not.  The Department of Labour was established by my party.  For Deputy Broughan, on the eve of a general election, to come into the House and abuse my party on the issue of the protection of workers was quite ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has a difficult task in introducing a measure of this kind.  Discretion is permitted under the regulation and the Minister has a choice as to form and methods of implementation.  Special pleas will be made from various groups and, at the end of the day, a balance has to be drawn as to what is appropriate. Broadly, I welcome this measure, particularly the provisions relating to rest breaks and annual <Col N="462" /> leave.  However, concern has been expressed by employees in the security industry that the provision of a maximum amount of weekly working time will result in a reduction of earnings for persons who wish to earn money to support themselves and their families.  A married person who is supporting a spouse and children by working for a reputable security company &mdash; I stress the word &ldquo;reputable&rdquo;&mdash; and earning a somewhat modest wage may wish to supplement that wage by working an extra shift to boost earnings.  That person is rewarded through an improved standard of living.  He is not forced by his employer to work those hours, and there is no question of neglect in relation to basic health and safety provisions. That person is caught by this legislation, although apparently a fisherman at sea is exempt, as is a member of the Garda Síochána, a soldier, and a junior doctor &mdash; something the public finds extraordinary.  Yet a person working in the security industry is not exempt and may be deprived of additional earnings.</P>
    <P>Article 17 of EU Directive 93/104/EC provides for a derogation.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider enshrining it in the legislation.  The directive specifically provides that, in the case of security and surveillance activities requiring a permanent presence to protect property and persons, a derogation is permitted to member states, especially in respect of security guards, caretakers and security firms.  The derogation was provided for on the basis that this was a matter in which flexibility should be left to member states.  If the social conditions of the country require us to exercise it, she should consider permitting a breach of the maximum time limit in this instance.</P>
    <P>I make this plea to the Minister of State on the basis of a substantial number of representations received.  There is nothing wrong with bringing to the attention of the House representations of individual citizens who are adversely affected by prospective legislation.  The Minister of State, representing as I do a substantial urban constituency, must also be aware of them.  They should be heeded because while the purpose and rationale of a maximum weekly hour provision is to prevent stress to the worker, the introduction of this measure will increase the stress of individual workers.  The Minister of State should give attention to this when considering amendments to the Bill.  I compliment her on introducing the Bill. There are other points which I look forward to addressing on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not surprised at Deputy Broughan's contribution.  It will not surprise anybody who has listened to the Deputy over the past two years that he takes a narrow view on proposals made by this side of the House.  A Deputy of his ability should consider the facts rather than attempt to score points against the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, especially its provisions on rest breaks and maximum weekly working hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> Legislation is necessary in this area to take care of the less well off who are not being looked after by the unions.  The Bill goes some way to improving workers' conditions.</P>
    <P>However, Deputies from all sides of the House have expressed concern at certain aspects of the Bill.  Deputy Lenihan spoke about the situation regarding those working in the security industry. A proprietor in the industry who lives near me is concerned that the proposed legislation will change his business and may ruin it.  Workers in the industry have also made representations to me to the effect that if they are not allowed use the opt-out they will lose substantial income. They are in favour of their present working hour arrangements and do not want to change them.</P>
    <P>A similar situation applies with regard to agriculture. For example, over the past ten to 15 years those employed in the cheese-making industry in Cork have worked long hours on a seasonal basis.  This is necessary to provide them with a decent income and to ensure the survival of the industry.  Similarly, vegetable growing, whether it be beet, peas or cauliflower, is an important industry in my area.  Vegetables must be set and reaped at specific times of the year when those involved must work exceptionally long hours.  They would breach the regulations set out in the Bill.  The Minister of State should examine these areas as the proposed measures are a cause of concern to workers.</P>
    <P>Sunday work and zero hour contracts are not sufficiently addressed in the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will present more detailed proposals on Committee Stage.  The Bill does not clarify that those working on Sundays have the right to premium payments.  Indeed, the question of Sunday work must be seriously considered.  For Muslims Friday is a rest day and for Jews it is Saturday. However, for most people in this country Sunday is a day of rest, sporting events and community activity.  It would not be good to allow it become an ordinary day of the week.  Will the Minister of State give greater consideration to this matter?</P>
    <P>I hope we will consider aspects of the Bill in greater depth on Committee Stage.  I also hope that the amendments introduced by the Minister of State will conform with provisions allowing for opt-outs, agreed to by the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, when they signed the directive.</P>

      <P>I agree with the rights and safety provisions in the Bill.  They are important because too many people have been injured and crippled in the past, especially those working on building sites.  Some have died from injuries sustained in the workplace.  Any person who wants to work should have that right and the right to <Col N="464" /> work long hours if they so wish, in particular in the run-up to Christmas.  I worked in a factory and in the run-up to summer holidays when orders had to be met people who wished to earn extra money for their holidays were allowed to do so.  This was necessary, particularly in a joinery factory where work has to be completed by a certain date.</P>
      <P>In rural areas there is not the same type of transport service as in Dublin.  Young people in these areas who have to travel up to 30 miles to work must have a loan for their car insurance.  A young person with a provisional licence or even a full licence has a loan on a car costing in the region of £4,000 to £7,000.  On a loan of £7,000 they are paying back over a period of four years at the rate of £42 per week.  They are also paying between £1,000 and £1,900 for third party insurance.  These people have to earn money and have to work long hours if they are to meet their repayments.  Will the Minister give these people the right to work long hours if they wish to meet their repayments?</P>
      <P>A young married couple on a local authority loan or a mortgage have to meet their repayments monthly.  Overtime working would help them to do so.  This Bill probably helps higher civil servants who are earning high salaries.</P>
      <P>This Bill will create unemployment.  More people would go to work if they were allowed work longer hours.  In the forthcoming budget there will be an increase in unemployment figures. Given that a worker is not entitled to a medical card if earning in excess of a certain amount, the difference between going to work and not being allowed work overtime will result in more unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is between a rock and a hard place with this Bill.  On the one hand she has genuine concerns about health and safety and on the other she is trying to meet the various demands of the Garda, prison officers and other exempted categories.  I am not sure she has reached the correct conclusion.  The inconsistencies in the Bill will rankle with many workers.</P>
      <P>I am astounded that junior doctors are exempted from the Bill.  Most junior doctors work 65 hours per week and some as many as 85.  This means a junior doctor goes on duty on a Friday morning and will come off duty at 8 a.m. on Monday morning.  These are the people who are in the front line of patient care.  We must be concerned that they have the capacity, energy and expertise over those long hours to cater properly for the people who come before them.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member gets a weekly report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which clearly indicates that the level of overtime in certain parts of the public sector is astonishing.  Following an examination of the prison service last year we found that the average overtime earnings for a prison officer were £300 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> One particular officer worked such an enormous amount of overtime that one wondered how he could fit it into his way of living; if he had a wife and family he had serious difficulties.  These workers, including gardaí, are in what would be considered safe, pensionable and well paid jobs.  People working in the security industry, the construction industry and in various stores will ask why it is all right for those people to work overtime and not themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, as stated in her speech, is so concerned about the health and safety of workers why does that factor not equate for people such as doctors who are in the front line of health care, prison officers who are looking after the welfare of people and maintaining prisoners and the Garda who have to fulfil all the roles pertinent to them?  It is difficult to understand the thinking behind the exemptions.</P>
    <P>I see a real difficulty for the Minister in that the Bill, if enacted, will mean many people will lose in the region of £30 to £60 per week.  That is a huge sum of money if one has a wife and family. Many of these workers have entered into contracts on the basis of their earnings.  The provisions of this Bill will mean a lower standard of living.  One must also take into account that the cost factor for smaller industries could be as high as 4 per cent or 1 per cent for the larger industries. We are always shouting about being competitive and being able to export into Europe and to ensure that our goods and services are available at the most economic cost.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to a lively debate and the broad welcome which the vast majority of the Bill's provisions have received. Sometimes the media give the impression that we are all in the pocket of Dunnes Stores.  I am pleased at the welcome for the outlawing of zero hour contracts and the addressing of Sunday working, issues that were at the heart of the recent Dunnes Stores dispute.</P>
      <P>Deputies quoted from the ICOS document which states that the milk business is highly seasonal with a peak to normal ratio of 8:1.  This means there will be no difficulty in accommodating long hours during a concentrated peak period and spreading the season over six months automatically and over 12 months by collective agreement. I do not envisage any difficulty in securing collective agreements in this highly unionised sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to clocking in, to which there is also a reference in the ICOS submission. I will look carefully at the regulations in this area as I do not want industrial disputes to arise over the way records are kept.  I am very open to receiving submissions on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt and others referred to Sunday trading.  I gave careful consideration to the way this issue should be addressed and have built in a <Col N="466" /> premium for Sunday working.  This premium is the norm in the industry and is determined by the Labour Court.  I have not put a maximum ceiling on the premium which will be considered by the Labour Court.  Deputy Ó Cuív said we should not prevent small shops in rural areas from trading on Sunday.  I took legal advice on the matter of Sunday trading and the same rules must apply to large and small shops.  This matter is being addressed by way of the premium.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to the need for flexibility.  In the case of nine items arising from the directive we had the option of choosing a flexible or narrow interpretation.  We have chosen the most flexible interpretation in the case of eight items.  Having discussed the matter with Congress and IBEC, we need to strike a balance &mdash; Congress favours less flexibility in these areas while IBEC favours maximum flexibility.  We decided not to follow the most flexible route in the case of the 48 hour rule, about which there are many myths.  For example, some Deputies said that overtime would disappear.  This will not happen as people will still be able to work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with normal lunch breaks, six days a week and still come within the rules.</P>
    <P>A recent opinion poll carried out by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> showed that 80 per cent of people support the 48 hour rule.  A similar opinion poll carried out in the UK showed that 80 per cent of people there support the 48 hour rule and that, surprisingly, 72 per cent of declared Tory voters support it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke accused me of introducing anti-worker legislation.  She later said it was only the 48 hour rule that was anti-worker and acknowledged that the rest of the legislation was progressive and pro-worker.  She said we should not set down mandatory rules.  However, I remind her and the House that it was the dreaded socialists Seán Lemass and Éamon de Valera who introduced the 1936 Conditions of Employment Act which set down mandatory rules on a maximum working week of 53 hours.  We are reducing the number of working hours by five. There was no voluntary opt-out provided for in 1936.  It is not appropriate to allow a voluntary opt-out from the health and safety rules.  We do not allow a voluntary opt-out from the rules governing the wearing of hard hats on building sites or carrying excess loads which may endanger workers' health.  It is not appropriate to allow a situation to develop where some workers may be put under pressure by their employers to agree to an opt-out.  The hard scientific evidence available shows that workers who work more than 48 hours per week are twice as likely as other workers to suffer from a heart condition.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy O'Keeffe and others in regard to junior doctors. The Health Council in Brussels is working on this issue and it hopes to reach agreement early in the new year.  If agreement is reached in time I will be happy to incorporate it in the legislation and, <Col N="467" /> if not, I will introduce rules governing the position of junior doctors under other legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane suggested that some European countries were reluctant to proceed with the legislation.  The European Court has ruled that all European countries must implement the legislation, and I understand all of them are happy to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of what happened at the European Council meeting, the Article 18 opt-out was originally negotiated by the UK which did not want the directive.  At the time the 48 hour rule became an option for individual countries, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Luxembourg stated they would not make use of it as an agreement between an employer and worker would be totally inadequate in a matter as important as that referred to in Article 18 and the issue should be governed by stringent and uniform provisions. Other countries are far from lukewarm about the legislation; they feel so strongly about it that they wrote it into the minutes of the meeting that health and safety rules should apply across the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt generally takes a progressive line on labour legislation and his heart was not in his criticisms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney made an extraordinary contribution which was more worthy of Euro sceptics Bill Cash and Tessa Gorman. She referred to the horrible rules which were descending on us from Brussels.  She does not seem to recognise that we are simplifying the employment codes going back to the 1930s.  She might regard this as deregulation.  She said nobody would invest here and plucked figures out of the air.  For example, the figure of £100 million <Col N="468" /> given by her has no basis in reality.  I have rarely heard such a destructive Euro sceptic contribution in this House.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Bill at the beginning of November 7,300 new jobs have been announced by the IDA.  Today it announced the creation of 400 new jobs at the Kodak plant in Limerick.  When Deputy Harney's colleague, Deputy O'Malley, was Minister for Industry and Commerce this country lost an average of 47 jobs every day.  The record speaks for itself.  Adherence to modern employment rights does not frighten off investors and good companies which already adhere to them.</P>
      <P>This progressive legislation will bring our labour law into the 21st century.  While I welcome the general support for the Bill, some Members appear to misunderstand the 48 hour rule.  There has been a sterling defence of overtime from some quarters at a time when there are 280,000 people out of work.  I want work shared equally. People have a right to overtime under the legislation, but they should not be forced to do excessive overtime to provide for their families or to earn a decent wage.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on Committee and Report Stages and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify Fianna Fáil's position in this regard.  I am proud to have taken the workers' line on many issues, including the Dunnes Stores dispute.  Under the EU Directive a worker may work more than 48 hours a week if he or she consents to do so, with the provision that no worker should suffer for not agreeing to work more than 48 hours per week.  Workers have an opt-out clause and we are taking a proworkers position on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his professionalism and courtesy during Committee Stage proceedings and for taking my amendments on board in the main.</P>
      <P>As we all know, the definition of control is of particular importance in the takeover or acquisition business.  Wisely the Bill provided that this should be set at 30 per cent similar to the figure used in London where some Irish companies are also traded.  The amended Bill now provides that the figure of 30 per cent shall not be changed by the Minister until a resolution so approving has been passed by the Seanad and this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at principles 11 and 12 as set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  After the first ten principles, with which I agree, numbers 11 and 12 seem to submerge into nitty-gritty. I cannot say that taken together numbers 11 and <Col N="471" /> 12 present a paradox.  It would seem that there is a straight contradiction between &ldquo;beyond a reasonable time&rdquo; as set out in number 11 and &ldquo;at an acceptable speed ... subject to adequate and timely disclosure&rdquo; in number 12.  If what is required is to make &ldquo;time of the essence&rdquo;, this should be stated in simple language or the reference to time omitted.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some more general matters. We have our own separate Stock Exchange again and we are about to have our own Takeover Panel for the first time.  The handful of major stocks traded in Dublin are also traded in London. The number of companies with an active listing on the Dublin exchange is steadily declining. The halfway house represented by the unlisted securities market never became the success hoped for by its proponents.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we have a large number of companies not suitable for being financed through borrowing and even if finance were available &mdash; often it is not &mdash; such companies badly need equity and capital such as the Stock Exchange is designed to provide.  However, the cost of acquiring a listing and annual compliance is prohibitive for many of those companies.  If proof were needed, the business expansion scheme has shown the great need for equity in this sector and the willingness of investors, albeit wearing their taxpaying hats, to provide investment funds.</P>
    <P>Venture capital funding is available, but often here the minimum investment is too large or would involve the proprietors giving up too big a percentage of ownership and control.  There is a big gap here that needs to be breached and I am sure with determination and imagination it can be.  I suggest to the Minister that he set up a small working group to come up with proposals in this regard within six months.  That group could be serviced by officials from the Minister's Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I would be willing to co-chair such a group with the Minister.  I had in mind a small membership, with one representative of the ISMA, the Stock Exchange, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, a nominee of the Government and a nominee of the Opposition.  The brief for that working group would be, first, to make recommendations on how the Stock Exchange could be rendered more accessible to small and medium companies, Irish and foreign-owned and, second, to examine the scope for financial and taxation incentives lying between the present business expansion scheme and a simple investment on the Stock Exchange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity of addressing the House on this subject.</P>
      <P>Any Bill which aims to make our country a safe place for our children is most welcome.  The commercial exploitation of children constitutes a general assault on them and represents a form of forced labour, worse than most.  It is a type of slavery, worse than most, representing as it does a vile if not the most contemptible violation of human rights imaginable.</P>
      <P>Last August I attended the world congress against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Stockholm and I was appalled at what I saw and heard.  It emerged from that conference that the reason the majority of children enter child prostitution is that they are abused at home and know that if they go on the streets at least they will earn some money to feed themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> The family unit is enormously important and whenever it breaks down children are most at risk.  Ireland has a wonderful reputation for being supportive of the family, grandparents and the extended family often caring for children.  This phenomenon is representative of our pro-family culture, but this culture is no longer as strong or as prevalent as heretofore.  The results of this decline can be seen daily and nightly on our streets through increased levels of juvenile crime and general recklessness.</P>
    <P>Child abuse often is a hidden problem.  The majority of abusers are not strangers to their victims but rather people they know and trust. Consequently abused children are afraid to confide in any adult.  Some time ago I called for the establishment of a special task force within the Garda Síochána to deal with children in danger comprising male and female members of the force.  This force should be specially trained, mobile and based in every Garda district.  I commend the Garda and social workers who are doing and have done wonderful work in this area but more trained personnel are required.</P>
    <P>I was not surprised to read in an article entitled &ldquo;Lambs bleating for Wolves&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 September last that we already have a considerable child prostitution problem here.  That article stated that children as young as 13 offer themselves for sale on our streets and that child prostitution is not a haphazard occurrence, that while there are particular categories of children at risk, especially the homeless, child prostitution is organised and increasing, that it is big business. That article detailed the level of activity on the streets of Dublin.  We are all aware from other reports that no part of the country is immune from this cancer.</P>
    <P>I listened to the debate last evening with great interest.  The Minister said that the Bill, as drafted, contains flaws and offered to table amendments to eliminate them in the course of the Children Bill, 1996, when introduced early in the new year.  His proposal did not have the approval of the Opposition who contend the present Bill should be amended and allowed to proceed through this House.  Let me declare my absolute neutrality on this issue.  My sole concern is that the issues raised in this Bill be addressed legislatively as soon as possible.  The Minister is correct in saying that, through no fault of his, the Bill's proposers had been unable to incorporate the most recent developments within the European Union, particularly in relation to our Presidency proposals on the Agenda for Action agreed at the Stockholm conference.  I do not perceive this to be a party political point and will support the Minister's proposal this evening.  However, proper legislative provisions cannot be delayed. Our response to this enormous problem is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I have not confined my comments thus far to child pornography, the subject of this Bill, because we are dealing here with related issues. If it can be established that there is a market here <Col N="474" /> for child prostitution &mdash; and it is quite clear that there is &mdash; inevitably it follows that we also have a market for child pornography.  International evidence produced at the Stockholm conference indicated that there are continuous links between those who engage in other forms of evil activity, such as drug abuse, and those who deal in child trafficking and child pornography.  Therefore, I see no reason the newly established Criminal Assets Bureau, which is proving so successful in targeting the ill-gotten gains of drug barons, should not turn its attention also to those who make money from trafficking in children and child pornography.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government proposals advanced during our EU Presidency to extend the mandate of the European Drugs Unit to include trafficking in human beings.  Clearly, while it has a manifestation in Ireland, child pornography is an international problem warranting an international response.  Increased co-operation between European police authorities, referred to by the Minister, constitutes a welcome first move, as is the decision by the Justice and Home Affairs Council that all member states should undertake a review of their existing laws in relation to child abuse.</P>
    <P>Let this debate represent a beginning for all of us in Ireland.  Let us not be reluctant to go as far as is needed regardless of the European position.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I felt the place of the family within our society was declining.  Let me put that in proper context.  In the past we were prepared to elevate the role of the family, to place it on a pedestal. We were then surprised when the revelations of the past few years indicated that matters were not as perfect as we had believed.  The truth is that children's concerns, their role and requirements often have not been the primary concern in family life.  This is the task we must now set ourselves. The results of child abuse are catastrophic, often incapable of being remedied within a single lifetime. We must do all in our power to ensure it does not and cannot take place.  If that involves introducing programmes such as the Stay Safe programme in our schools, which are disliked by many of our so-called pro-family organisations, then so be it.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly pointed out that a major flaw in this legislation is that the possession of pornographic material is not an offence.  There appears to be some dispute as to whether the Bill adequately addresses this issue.  We, as legislators, must address this matter without delay in light of the recent decision by the European Justice and Home Affairs Committee.</P>

      <P>Unlike some of my colleagues on this side of the House, I congratulate Deputy <Col N="475" /> Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue for introducing this Bill following the terrible disclosures in Belgium in recent months.  However, we do not have to go to Belgium to be aware of the vilest trade in the world today.  This Bill focuses attention on the modern sex slave trade in many countries, particularly Eastern countries, where the exploitation of women and, more particularly, children is a huge and lucrative market.</P>
      <P>The decriminalisation of homosexuality in this country opened the door to all types of perversion and filth.  There is evidence of a moral decline in every county and that the rot has set in.  Part of the new spirit of liberalisation is that drugs, drink and prostitution are freely available among the smart-ass set that passes for society in the Ireland of today.</P>
      <P>The use and abuse of children as sex objects by paedophiles and others can only be described as base and evil.  No punishment is good enough for perverts and deviants who prey on children for sexual gratification.  They should be publicly identified, locked up for years and, in some cases, whipped.</P>
      <P>The Internet offers an opportunity for many people engaged in this disgusting practice to advertise for playmates and to seek vulnerable young men and women.  In America the Internet was used by an unbalanced woman to advertise for a sex partner to murder her, which he duly did.  Despite the many obvious advantages of the Internet and the business opportunities it presents, it is generally acknowledged that there is no ability to control child pornography.  Many other harmful activities can be found on the Internet.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Opposition cannot agree on this Bill because of the need for confrontational politics in the Dáil.  I have said repeatedly over the years that the confrontational nature of politics is detrimental to it.  If this topic was discussed at committee level, we would reach a consensus because we all abhor child abuse and child pornography.  The best way to deal with such issues is at committee level where we can reach consensus rather than allowing the Government to claim that it introduced a better Bill than the Opposition.  As long as such subjects are discussed here, there will be disagreement over nothing to score points.  A subject such as this should be above politics.</P>
      <P>Although this Bill is commendable, it does not punish a person caught with offending material as long as he can claim it is for his enjoyment or titillation.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I understand the Minister will correct this in the Children Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Bill will, however, focus the public's attention on this serious and depraved form of sexual gratification and alert the people to be on <Col N="476" /> the lookout for anything connected with child pornography.</P>
      <P>The Customs and Excise raided a warehouse in Dublin recently and seized £50,000 worth of dirty magazines.  I know something about this business because for 40 years I was a retailer and a wholesaler in the newspaper industry.  Some 40 years ago I was aware of the existence of a dirty book trade which came from England via Belfast and Newry into the south.  There was and will always be punters for such material.  The fact that £50,000 worth of dirty books was seized shows the extent of the market available to people peddling dirty books and pornography.</P>
      <P>It is time extreme penalties were introduced to deal with this trade and children were afforded the protection a civilised society should always give them.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McGahon that the way the system operates makes it difficult for the Government to accept an Opposition Bill and amend it accordingly. Deputy Eoin Ryan knows that is the way the game is played, except in exceptional circumstances. However, that is not to take from what the Deputies are trying to do.  I have often criticised Fianna Fáil for political opportunism. However, that is not the case on this occasion because this is worthwhile legislation.  We all owe the two Deputies a debt of gratitude for allowing the subject to be aired in Private Members' Time. I hope the Government takes speedy action on this issue.  I have spoken to Deputy Eoin Ryan on numerous occasions and I know how deeply he feels about the need to protect our children. Child pornography begins with postcards at seaside resorts on which little girls are portrayed in various states of undress supposedly enjoying their family holiday.  They are perceived as being cute.  However, it is not cute to expose our children to the scrutiny that certain people give postcards. What is considered to be cute, as Deputy McGahon said, provides titillation for others. Care has to be taken with that and with equating homosexuality with child abusers.  That is wrong. The homosexual community has within its ranks, as does the heterosexual community, a percentage of people who take pleasure in abusing children. However, the majority do not abuse children; they are honest, decent people like the rest of us.  I attended an assembly where for the first time I heard someone make sense of this mess.  It is difficult because, as adults, we are charged first and foremost with the protection of the young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is most disturbing about these people who attack children, 99.9 per cent of whom are men, is they do not lurk in shadows and do not look any different from the rest of us.  We cannot identify them and, therefore, protect our children from danger.  This is why it is psychologically disturbing. At the assembly attended by 200 professionals we were first asked to describe a paedophile apart from the fact that it is usually male. The speaker wanted another characteristic; none <Col N="477" /> of us could answer.  He said they are neither rich nor poor, young or old, ugly or beautiful.  They are just like everyone else and that is the problem. His next question was the one that hit home &mdash; describe his victim.  Everyone could do that &mdash; a child usually without much self-esteem, introverted, isolated, in need of a friend and usually alone in a school playground.  His point was that if the perpetrator cannot be identified but the victim can, resources should be put into ensuring there are no victims.  Paedophiles look out for these characteristics.  They stand outside school gates and watch children who are isolated and neglected.  They enter homes, become friendly with the families and wait for years before they strike.</P>
    <P>There is a need to instil in our children the ability and the confidence to say no.  He told us that a child who is aggressive, arrogant, self-confident will tell either a teacher, parent or friend if a person says something to them that they do not like.  Other social issues such as homosexuality must not be mixed up in this as they are not part of the problem.  There have always been people who have turned to evil rather than good.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Government introduces its amendments to the Child Care Act, 1991, it will take on board what has been said and that Opposition Deputies will be involved as they have such a keen and worthwhile interest in this issue. Deputy McGahon is correct in saying that we do not have to look to Belgium to find horrific stories of child abuse.  It may be the latest one on the list, but we also have horror stories.  Recently, I was told about a woman who was abandoned because she was pregnant.  I want to ask her if she thinks she was abused.  This Bill puts a value on mothers and children.  If mothers are protected, so are children.</P>
    <P>I congratulate both Deputies.  It is a worthwhile topic and I hope it will be addressed quickly.</P>

      <P>Recent events in Belgium, England and in Ireland have highlighted the horror of child sexual abuse and the damage it does to children, families and the fabric of society. Tackling the problem of child sexual abuse demands action in many areas.  The criminalisation of the possession of child pornography, as proposed in this Bill, is just one small step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child pornography is, in effect, a record of child sexual abuse.  The fact that the production of child pornography is part of the abuse of children means that criminalising its possession is one way of targeting the abusers and tackling the abuse.  In the past addressing the problem of child pornography fell victim to consensus.  While the majority of people agreed that it was fundamentally wrong and inherently evil, few Governments <Col N="478" /> moved to outlaw its possession or distribution. The Johnson, Meese and Longford reports on both sides of the Atlantic grappled with the wider issue of pornography.  Discussions inevitably became bogged down in disagreements on the causal link between pornography and violence as well as free speech and censorship considerations.</P>
    <P>The reality of child pornography is that it cannot be produced without a child being sexually abused.  Over past months I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach on Question Time in terms of it being looked at in a comprehensive way.  This debate is part of that.  It behoves us as legislators to try to deal with it.  Failure to grasp that led to years of legislative confusion.  While that confusion reigned, child pornography became established as a worldwide commodity.  By the late 1980s dealing in child pornography had become illegal in almost every western nation, but unfortunately much of the damage had already been done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity this Bill, put forward by my colleagues, provides to discuss this serious problem.  I hope our comments will help generate a wider public debate on the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and increase awareness of the extent of the problem.  For too long there was a refusal to discuss the possibility of the abuse of children, not to mind the possibility that people would seek commercial gain from it.  The facts however have forced us to think and act otherwise.</P>
    <P>Commercial child pornography developed in 1969 when Denmark removed all restrictions on the production and sale of any type of pornography. At that time two adult pornography producers claim to have launched the world's first child pornography magazine and were subsequently responsible for commercialising child pornography films.  When Denmark reversed its decision in 1979 and banned the production, sale and distribution of child pornography, the two original producers had many rivals and the material was no longer confined to the domestic market.</P>
    <P>Many child pornographic magazines include requests for new material thereby amounting to an incitement to purchasers to abuse more children. The magazines also provide a contact service for readers enabling them to advertise for child pornography and child sexual partners.  The latter is evidence of the relationship between child pornography and paedophilia.  Evidence of the link between child sex abuse and pornography is also available from other sources.  There are three main ways in which pornography is used in connection with sexual abuse.  First, it is shown to children to persuade them that they would enjoy certain sexual acts.  Second, abusers show children child pornography to convince them that what they are being asked to do is all right.  Third, some abusers use child pornography for their own arousal before abusing a child.</P>
    <P>A 1988 Scotland Yard report stated that paedophiles often blackmail their victims.  The existence <Col N="479" /> of sexually explicit photographs can be an effective silencer.  The report also supported the view that child pornography is used by abusers to normalise or legitimise the activity and convince the child that the activity is acceptable.  An American study revealed that most paedophile rings are involved in the production of child pornography which serves to generate profit, establish links with other rings and entrap children by threatening to show pictures to their parents and others.</P>
    <P>The United States postal service runs an extremely successful anti-child pornography programme. Its statistics show that at least 80 per cent of those it identifies as purchasers of child pornography are active abusers.  Child pornography also serves to normalise the abuse for the offender, which is important to paedophiles &mdash; this point was stressed by an internal policy review report from the obscene publications branch of the British police.  The report highlighted the fact that child pornography is normally one of the most important things in the life of a paedophile and he can never get enough of it.  Collections are invariably carefully organised and documented.  A paedophile may move his collection if he believes he is in danger of being discovered but rarely destroys it.  A paedophile often has the need to share his collection with others either to get validation or to boast and brag.</P>
    <P>Liz Kelly, a research fellow in a London child abuse studies unit, writing in an essay entitled &ldquo;Pornography and Child Sexual Abuse&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>What emerges from examining the production and use of child pornography is a pattern of mutually reinforcing connections.  Child pornography is itself a document of abuse of one child.  It is then used by abusers to reinforce their will to abuse.  They may in turn show it to children they wish to abuse to secure their cooperation.  Some of these children may, in turn, be photographed or filmed while being abused and/or trained to pose for pictures.  The process then begins anew.</P>
    <P>Child abuse and child pornography transcend all barriers, whether geographic, economic or intellectual.  Children in all parts of the world are at risk of exploitation and involvement in pornography. However, the sex industry trades on inequalities.  While children in general are vulnerable because they are seen by abusers as powerless, economically deprived children are even more at risk.  Much child pornography uses children from poor countries and backgrounds.  Just as with adult pornography, there are significant racist undertones to commercial pornography because the white male consumer is perceived to be more accepting of the abuse of women and children from African or Asian countries.</P>
    <P>The common link between many of the children used in pornography is that they are trying to find ways to ensure their own physical survival. The threat to survival may come from poverty <Col N="480" /> and homelessness or the threat of physical violence if they do not comply with requests.  A study of child prostitution in three of the richest countries in the world revealed that almost all of the children had been asked at some point to pose for pornographic pictures or to appear in films. Many studies of homeless children show that a high proportion of them run away from home to escape physical and sexual abuse.  It is sadly ironic that many of these children are then forced to sell their bodies to survive.</P>
    <P>The American Government is one of the very few western governments to take the issue of child pornography seriously.  The US Department of Justice estimates it to be worth between $2 billion and $3 billion a year.  It also claims that pornography producers have filmed the abuse of more than one million children in the United States alone.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to think that child pornography is only commercially produced &mdash; nobody in this debate said that, but it is stated in many of the articles I have read over the years.  Most child pornography is produced by small &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; industries run by abusers.  They record their own abuse of children and this pornography may be kept as part of a private collection or shared and swopped with other abusers or reproduced and sold.  It is easier, for both law enforcement and social reasons, to view child pornography as being distinct from adult pornography.  However, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have pointed to the way in which supposedly mainstream, soft porn magazines such as Playboy have developed devious ways of publishing pictures of children.  This is done, for example, by including photographs of the centrefold Playmate as a child with sexually suggestive or provocative captions.  It is time to challenge attitudes about child pornography which range from complacency to ignorance to a refusal to believe the extent of the problem. Moral outrage is powerless in face of the reality of child pornography.  The reality is that an average police seizure of a so-called private collection of a paedophile will include 200 videos and thousands of slides and photographs.  The abuse of children, some only toddlers, is broadcast live on the Internet.  When one types the words &ldquo;kiddy porn&rdquo; for an Internet search, one finds more than 7,000 matches.  This figure does not even begin to take account of the numerous supposedly innocent titles given to pornographic material in order to avoid detection.  A more sinister development in recent times is the placing of child pornography on the Internet using websites normally associated with cartoon characters which are regularly accessed by children.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill proposed by Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue seeks to prohibit the possession, making or trading in photographs, images or literature of a pornographic nature relating to children.  We know this Bill alone will not solve the problem.  It is a measure to deal with a problem that is quickly moving into our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> I have pointed out to the Taoiseach consistently that this is a complex issue demanding an examination of the wider censorship legislation.  I am grateful he has responded positively to my suggestion that we establish a working group to generate public discussion on this area.  I thank the Minister of State, who is involved in trying to deal with this issue, for his support.</P>
    <P>Our hope is that this Bill will be go some way towards addressing the suffering of those involved in the production of the pornography and those children who are coerced in sexual activity through the use of child pornography.  On that basis we urge the Government to accept it and follow it through in Committee with whatever amendments it deems useful. Our complacency and silence must no longer be allowed add to the powerlessness of the children harmed by pornography.  It is time for their voices to be heard, and I know the House will join with me in those sentiments.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the proposers of this timely and legally sound legislation, Deputies O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan, on their ingenious drafting of the Bill and for checking and re-checking it before bringing it to the House.</P>
      <P>No one who has reached the age of reason can doubt that there is a causal link between pornography and child sexual abuse and that the former fuels the latter.  Even if we were to doubt that proposition, we are prevented from doing so by our actions as a nation.  For example, we have put in place an elaborate censorship system through a panoply of legislative, administrative and other measures.  This system prevents sexually explicit and other material from reaching the public.  If we seek to argue that sexually explicit material of a type banned by the censorship system is harmless, why exclude it? However, no one would argue that we should not exclude it.  There is a causal connection between child pornography and child sexual abuse and this country believes and acts accordingly.</P>
      <P>However, some sexually explicit material escapes the net put in place by the censorship system and reaches the various distribution agencies. Unfortunately, there is a gap in the law in this regard.  Obviously this gap was not left there deliberately.  It is an accidental oversight and this Bill is specifically designed to close that loophole in the law.  The problem is that if sexually explicit material of a sort which should not reach the public slips through the censorship net, people who store it or have it in their possession for distribution or sale can possess, distribute and sell it for profit without attracting any criminal sanction. The possession for distribution, the distribution itself and the sale of such material is not a criminal offence and does not attract any criminal or penal sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This glaringly obvious loophole has occurred accidentally or through an oversight rather than through a deliberate omission by any past <Col N="482" /> Government.  This Bill closes that loophole and strengthens the law.  If the system provides that the storage and distribution of pornographic material is penalised and if the Garda can, on the making of a complaint, search premises where the material is or is reputed to be, and if people can be brought before the courts and dealt with severely for possessing such material for distribution or for distributing such material, it does not require a great leap of the imagination to conclude that the armoury the State deploys against this squalid business will be strengthened immeasurably.  That is precisely what the Bill is designed to do.</P>
    <P>I condemn the Government's disingenuous and deceitful attitude to the Bill.  On the one hand it says it will not vote against the measure on Second Stage; on the other it says it cannot accept the Bill and will bring forward its own proposal. The decision not to vote against the measure is strictly for the optics.  The Government does not want it said by the media and others that it voted against a measure to protect children from child sexual abusers by banning pornography.  To make a good impression it has decided to support the Bill on Second Stage and jettison it thereafter.</P>
    <P>In March 1995 the Minister, Deputy Taylor, said the Government had decided not to vote against a Private Members' Bill on defamation and that the Bill would be put into Committee Stage in the following November.  That promise was not fulfilled and the Bill has not emerged yet &mdash; it has been buried and there it shall remain. There was another unfortunate experience on Deputy Mary Wallace's Bill to provide minimum facilities for disabled voters.  The Government accepted the Bill on Second Stage but it dragged out Committee Stage almost interminably until it was shamed into accepting the legislation because of the imminence of a general election.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I do not take seriously the promise of the Minister of State at various Government Departments, Deputy Currie, that he will amend the Children Bill to include measures such as are contained in this legislation. The Children Bill has been in gestation for many years and it did not occur to the Government that it should contain any provision on child pornography until this Fianna Fáil Bill was introduced.  The Children Bill is designed to deal with something wholly different, juvenile crime and the facilities for juvenile offenders.  It has nothing to do with child pornography and those who assist and serve it.  It would be totally inappropriate to tag measures such as are contained in this legislation on to a Bill dealing with a different topic.  The Government never intended to do so and I do not think it intends to now.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister said the Bill was so fundamentally flawed that it could not be repaired by a committee, regardless of how imaginative that committee might be.  Even though this Bill was irreparably holed below the waterline, the Government decided not to oppose it.  Let us examine these fatal flaws which render the Bill <Col N="483" /> incapable of repair by any process of amendment. We should also remember that this defence for the Government's inaction is put up on the same day that it proposed no less than 105 amendments to its own Universities Bill, some of which involve the complete re-writing of various sections.  That can be tackled on Committee Stage but the flaws in this Bill are so fundamental and fatal that they cannot be repaired.  In 1989 and 1990 we spent months discussing the legislation which became the Companies Act, 1990.  The Minister of State should know that about 350 amendments were made by the Government and Opposition to that Bill.  We even considered amendments to amendments. I lost count of the number of amendments accepted to the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, which I had the honour of piloting through the House in 1993 and 1994.  Yet we are told this Bill is so damaged that it cannot be repaired by any process of amendment.</P>
    <P>I carefully examined the Minister's speech to discover these fundamental flaws which made the Bills irreparable.  He said it had been prepared before the conclusion of the EU summit and, as a consequence, it did not go far enough.  To say that a Bill is so flawed that it cannot be repaired simply because it does not go far enough is a downright falsehood.  If the Government genuinely believes that the Bill does not go far enough, why not accept the Bill, as it is immediately urgent and necessary, and if there are areas in which it can be strengthened, why not bring forward proposals to amend it?  That is the simple answer to that defence.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental objection, which I could hardly believe when I heard it, was that the Bill was based on &ldquo;an unsuitable legislative model&rdquo;. Are we to accept this as a serious objection?  The reality is that the Bill is trying to strengthen the law to deal with the child pornography trade and thereby save both current and potential child victims from sexual abuse and exploitation.  That problem, as Government backbenchers have acknowledged, exists in this country and it is growing, particularly in tandem with homelessness, in our major urban areas, but we are supposed to accept that the Bill has to be delayed until some indefinite time in the future because the proposal to strengthen the law and close the loophole is based on an unsuitable legislative model.</P>
    <P>We are also told that we have not considered how the Bill fits in with the Censorship Act, 1929. The answer to that is blindingly obvious.  It fits in with that Act by supplementing and augmenting our system of censorship because some of the filth the censorship system is designed to keep out slips through the net.  This legislation is designed to deal with those into whose possession that material comes and who possess, distribute or sell it.  From that point of view it deals with the problem whereby the material comes through the net put up by the censorship system.</P>
    <P>We are told that another fundamental flaw in <Col N="484" /> the legislation which makes it irreparable is that the definition section refers to photographic images instead of pseudo photographs.  If I ever heard a pseudo objection, that is a typical example.  The term &ldquo;photographic images&rdquo; is sufficiently wide to cover what is commonly known as pseudo photographs, but because the term &ldquo;photographic images&rdquo; is used in the definition section rather than &ldquo;pseudo photographs&rdquo;, the Bill is fundamentally flawed and must be sent back to the drawing board.</P>
    <P>We are told also that another so-called fundamental flaw is that the Minister of State at the Department of various things, Deputy Currie, is not sure whether &ldquo;under 16 years&rdquo; is the right definition of a child.  Members will have different notions as to how a child should be defined in this context, but surely this is a typical example of what should be debated on Committee Stage.  We have to include an age if we are defining the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; in the context of child pornography, but that is a debating point for Committee Stage.  It is not such a fundamental irreparable flaw that it renders the Bill entirely nugatory.</P>
    <P>We are told the legislation does not prohibit the sale of pornographic material, that it deals only with distribution.  On my reading of the legislation it does prohibit the sale of pornographic material but if it does not, that is something we can debate on Committee Stage.  It will take us a mere ten seconds to debate an appropriate amendment to include the words &ldquo;distribution or sale&rdquo;.  A two word amendment on Committee Stage will repair that so-called fundamental flaw.</P>
    <P>I suspect when Minister of State Currie's scriptwriter read what he propounded as fundamental flaws it looked a bit skimpy, and he was right, so he decided to advance a few more excuses, going on Aldous Huxley's theory that the more excuses one has, the more convincing one is.  However, it gets even better.  The Minister of State said the penalties were a bit on the low side.  That is the fundamental flaw that is supposed to prevent us taking urgent action now to protect children who are victims and potential victims.  The Bill has been drafted and has reached the floor of the House but now it must now go back to the drawing board for an entirely different proposal because the penalties are a bit on the low side. This must be the first time in the history of parliamentary democracy that a Bill which had reached this stage has to go back to the drawing board to be redrafted because &ldquo;the penalties are a bit on the low side&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are also told that another fundamental flaw in the Bill is that it is not gender proofed.  I have not read it closely enough to be in a position to comment accurately on whether it is but if it is not, and since we all believe in gender equality, it would take us approximately ten seconds to deal with that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware these are bogus alibis for failure to take action now, particularly in this area.  They are tawdry excuses for failure to accept amending legislation which would greatly <Col N="485" /> enhance the State's efforts to combat this sordid trade.  If one potential victim was saved by this Bill, would it not be worthwhile?  I am surprised that Minister of State Currie, who has a proud civil rights record in another context, should allow himself to be used by the Government as a sort of man in the iron mask to block and delay necessary legislation, particularly in this area.</P>
    <P>Those who will be well served by the Government's mean-minded obduracy are the practitioners of this squalid business and their fellow travellers who conspire with them by assisting them in their squalid activity.  Those people who, by their own choice, involve themselves in this sordid trade, by providing the necessary aids and materials, will have cause to celebrate tonight while the children continue to suffer.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue for bringing forward the Bill.  It is an opportune time, and not before time, that we examine the whole area of child pornography and the current status of our law.  The Bill addresses an extremely important issue and identifies serious loopholes in the current halfhearted attempt to deal with the problem of child pornography.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill creates a number of offences relating to the production, distribution, display and publication of child pornography it does not specifically criminalise the possession simpliciter of child pornography if it is not for distribution or for showing to others, but that could have been addressed by way of amendment.  I note the Government has accepted the principle of the Bill and intends to bring forward its own legislation. The Government is trying to have it both ways and it would be fair to the Deputies who sponsored the Bill to accept it and put it into committee where it could be scrutinised and amended if that proves necessary.</P>
      <P>Child pornography, abduction, prostitution and the sexual abuse of children by adults in authority should be regarded as a dimension of the same problem rather than as separate issues.  We need to have a debate on the efficacy of our child sexual abuse prosecution policy generally.  I have had cause to be disappointed and frustrated at the difficulty experienced in trying to get reliable data and statistics on child sexual abuse prosecution ratios from the Taoiseach's office and the Office of the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that children featured in child pornography may have been abducted and that the act which was photographed is a crime.  International agencies have drawn the world's attention to the problem of the trafficking of children. Until the recent past, people in Ireland tended to think of the problem as one of First World paedophiles abusing Third World children. However, the recent scandal in Belgium has brought the matter of trafficking of children and their organised sexual abuse very close to home. That is all the more reason, therefore, for us to <Col N="486" /> update our law and enact very stringent regulations to guard against the proliferation of child pornographic material.</P>
    <P>Many paedophiles express no remorse, even when convicted, as for them their activities represent a perverse sexual preference.  Therefore, it is debatable whether remedial treatment is of any use.  It is mistaken and misguided to think that child pornography offers an acceptable outlet for those who would otherwise physically abuse children.</P>
    <P>As I said, many pornographic images of children involve photographing the abuse of children which is, in itself, a crime.  It might be said that this argument does not apply to computer generated images.  However, even if this is so, it is very hard to think of any reason which would justify the legitimate possession of such images.</P>
    <P>It is important to identify the market in Ireland.  The authorities seized large amounts of pornographic material last year.  I wonder if any prosecutions are pending in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Internet is a contemporary player in this area.  It is widely recognised as a vehicle for the spread of child pornography and information about sex tourism and child abuse generally.  In the UK the companies which provide access to the Internet launched an initiative seven months ago to clean it up and a hot line was set up for people to report instances of pornography on the Internet.  There must be a role in this regard for the Irish service providers.  There is no doubt that regulation of the Internet is complex and difficult, both on the technical level and in terms of maintaining a balance between free speech and censorship. However, the balance must ultimately weigh in favour of the protection of children and stopping the distribution of this material.</P>
    <P>The horrors of the Belgian paedophile scandal has brought this whole matter closer to home.  We need to look at our prosecution policy in relation to child abuse.  It is very difficult to get hard facts about the level of prosecutions in child abuse cases.  In a reply from the Minister for Health to a parliamentary question, I learned that in the three years from 1993 to 1995 there was a total of 6,050 complaints of sexual abuse of children to all the health boards, of which 2,003 were confirmed. Yet, when I asked the Department of Justice for separate details on prosecutions taken in the same period, I was told there was a total of 547 prosecutions.  It is important for better co-ordination and statistical evaluation to be provided by the authorities of what happens to child abuse allegations after they are made to them.  At the moment there is no dovetailing of information between the Department of Health, the Garda authorities and the DPP's office.</P>
    <P>We need a debate on prosecution policy on child abuse.  It has been impossible to find a vehicle for that debate because there is no annual report by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Many prosecutions are not taken due to lapse of <Col N="487" /> time and alleged abusers can halt prosecutions for the same reason.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support this Bill.  We have recently moved to make it a criminal offence in this jurisdiction and to criminalise the activities of paedophiles who abuse foreign children and then hope to return to their normal lives here without being prosecuted.  That is very good but we must examine our own prosecution rates which are not very healthy at the moment in terms of justice for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  I join other Members in acknowledging the work of Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue in introducing this Bill, which is rooted in concern for the protection of children against the evil trade of child pornography.  I know this concern is shared by Members and by right thinking and decent people.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland is a state party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The primary focus of the convention is the best interest of the child.  The individual whom the convention seeks to protect is the child in his or her natural, cultural and spiritual environment. The convention recognises children as human beings of equal value.  It marks the end of an age old idea that children, at least in legal terms, are no more than possessions of their guardians.</P>
      <P>It is possible to group the articles of the convention under three headings: provision, participation and protection.  Provision is the right to have one's basic needs fulfilled, for example, the right to food, etc.  Participation is the right to be heard on decisions affecting one's life.  Protection is the right to be shielded from harmful acts or practices, for example, the right to be protected from sexual abuse or exploitation.</P>
      <P>The convention is very strong on the provision and protection aspects.  The trafficking of children and sexual abuse and exploitation are banned. Article 34 provides that states parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.  Part 4B of the agenda for action approved by the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children builds on the article of the convention by providing for developing or strengthening national laws to establish the criminal responsibility of service providers, customers and intermediaries in child pornography, including the provision of child pornography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of technological developments which assist the distribution of child pornography, the main focus of attention is on the Interest.  It is understandable that this should be the case and for many Members to refer to the problems related to that medium.  Of course, measures need to be taken to effectively tackle abuse of the Internet for this purpose.  However, there is a danger that by focusing too much on the Internet attention is distracted from other technological <Col N="488" /> developments which are increasingly used by paedophiles.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that during our Presidency of the European Union we, with Belgium, took a lead in addressing the child sexual abuse problem by making trafficking in persons and sexual abuse of children one of our Presidency priorities.  The prioritising of this issue culminated in the Justice and Home Affairs Council held in Brussels last month giving political approval to a number of important measures, the most relevant of which in the context of this debate is a joint action which obliges all EU member states to ensure, among other things, that the exploitative use of children in pornography is criminalised, including the production, sale, distribution and possession of child pornography.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks of the Bill, of which there are a number, is that, despite its stated aims and objectives and what Deputies opposite claim, it would not criminalise the possession of child pornography for personal use.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, pointed out yesterday, the bulk of the Bill has been lifted straight from the English Protection of Children Act; sections of that Act are reproduced almost word for word.  It is unfortunate, and indeed puzzling, that in one important respect the English law was not followed, which is the failure of the Bill to make it an offence to possess child pornography for personal use.  However, I understand the English law is not readily adaptable to our situation and is not an appropriate model to follow.  I am surprised indeed that Deputy O'Dea is making the case so strongly.  I would have thought the days of blindly following English law were over.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea spoke of this as being on the low side.  I would call it lenient.  It fails to reflect the seriousness of the issue before us.  If we are really committed to tackling the problem in an effective way it is incumbent on us to bring forward legislation which sends out a strong signal that the sexual exploitation of a child in any manifestation will not be tolerated and that the penalties are capable of fitting the crime.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that legislative changes need to be made.  One of the difficulties with the existing law in this area, that is, our general censorship laws, is that they are not comprehensive enough. In other words, they do not meet the need to deal with all aspects of the pornography problem, including, in particular, the need to criminalise the production, distribution and possession of child pornography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> The Government is committed to bringing forward detailed proposals on child pornography with a view to incorporating them into the Children Bill.  That is a commitment that will be honoured. That Bill contains a number of measures designed to protect children and is a much more appropriate vehicle with which to address and progress legislative proposals of this nature.</P>

      <P>The Children Bill will be debated in this House early in the new year and Deputies will have an opportunity then to debate it.  This means the matter will be dealt with quickly.  There will be no need, therefore, for this Bill to be progressed any further.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea urged that we continue on what I believe is an unrealistic approach and simply put this Bill into Committee.  Unfortunately, changing the law is not as simple as that.  I suspect that even Deputy O'Dea understands that.  In an area such as this, it cannot be done without regard for existing law or without, for instance, making any necessary consequential amendments or repeals as the case may be to existing law.</P>

I look forward to the debate on the Government's proposals early next year in the context of the Children Bill.  That will be the effective result every Deputy in this House seeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take a few moments of Deputy O'Donoghue's time.  I welcome the opportunity to voice my support for this legislation which is very important and should be enacted as quickly as possible.  It is to the credit of Deputies John O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan that this legislation has come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Once again members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party with the limited resources available to them drafted comprehensive positive legislation to tackle the very serious problems associated with the sexual exploitation of children.</P>
      <P>The commercial sexual exploitation of children is one of the many horrendous crimes committed against humanity nowadays.  The horrible nature of these activities is brought home to us all the more when we consider the victims, namely, innocent, defenceless children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminalisation of the possession of child pornography is a proposal that meets with the approval of the overwhelming majority of the people.  We must have the appropriate penalties to mete out to people who ply such a dreadful <Col N="490" /> trade.  The penalties proposed in the Fianna Fáil Bill are the proper ones.  The growth in child pornography through various channels must be stopped, and the aim of society must be to eliminate this trade.</P>
    <P>The Government should accept this Bill, and the measures in these legislative proposals should be enforced without delay.  This is the type of legislative measure all Members of the Oireachtas can support, and support for this measure would reflect the general view of this subject.  Similarly, the penalties to be imposed on these criminals should reflect the evil involved. The punishments proposed in this legislation are correct, and anybody who has those penalties meted out to them has earned such punishment. This Bill, if enacted by the Oireachtas, will be effective.  It is needed and unnecessary delays should not occur in having it placed on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Serious concern exists about child sexual abuse, and this Child Pornography Bill is one measure that can help in a very positive manner to tackle this most serious issue.  This evil trade should not be allowed to be plied through magazines, photographs or the Internet.  The message must go out from this House that people trading in child pornography will suffer the appropriate harsh penalties. The protection of children has to be given the utmost priority.</P>

      <P>There is no greater illustration of the Machiavellian ministerings of the rainbow Coalition Government than the speech by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice in the Dáil last night.  In as mean-spirited and gutless a response as has ever been witnessed in the House the Minister of State, speaking on behalf of the Government said:</P>
      <P>The Government has no objection, in principle, to what this Bill sets out to achieve and for that reason is not opposing its Second Reading.  I want to make it clear, however, that I will be proposing an alternative approach which will have the effect of achieving the Bill's objective, but in a more complete and effective manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice is a very experienced politician who knows full well, as does the Government, that the place for putting forward amendments to legislation is in Committee.  That has been the law here and in other jurisdictions for as long as anybody can remember.  If the Bill has failings, amendments can be put forward in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear the gremlins got in the way of the Bill in relation to the penalties.  However, it would provide, in respect of a conviction on indictment, for a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment or a fine of £100,000.  Irrespective of gremlins or anything else, if the Minister of State and the Government had amendments to make, the amendments could have been put forward on Committee Stage.  Last night the Minister <Col N="491" /> of State said our legislation was &ldquo;seriously flawed&rdquo;.  That amounts to a gratuitous insult which does not become the Minister of State, but it does fit neatly into the rainbow jigsaw.  The Bill was presented in a spirit of magnanimity.  It is not about politics, yet it was rejected because of politics. Political expediency and opportunism took precedence over the need to urgently legislate to protect the most vulnerable in our society.  The Government was presented with a unique opportunity to enact a most vital piece of legislation to protect the defenceless in our society, and the Government played politics.</P>
    <P>Let it not be forgotten that this is the Government that came to power on a wave of putative indignation over the delay in the Brendan Smyth case.  It is a Government which has not produced one single Bill to protect children since then.  The only legislation presented in this area was by Fianna Fáil in its Criminal Law (Sexual Jurisdiction) Bill, 1996.  It is ironic and sad, and a damning indictment of the rainbow Coalition Government that on the day when the Criminal Law (Sexual Jurisdiction) Bill, 1996 was passed through the Seanad, on the day when the Bill was published as having been passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas, a Bill which was to buttress the legislation in respect of the possession of child pornography was shelved by the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Eoin Ryan and I introduced the Criminal Law (Sexual Jurisdiction) Bill, 1996, its intention was to ensure that an individual who committed a sexual offence against a child abroad could be tried in this country.  It was our intention to ensure that the possession of child pornography and its distribution would become a criminal offence with appropriate penalties.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to our Bill is heartless and uncaring.  Writing in the Bar Review in October 1996, an eminent member of the international organisation to end child prostitution, pornography and trafficking argued that criminalising the possession of child pornography would assist in finding child abusers.  She pointed to the New Zealand experience where the authorities eventually began to trace paedophile networks by, instead of destroying the pornography seized, tracing its origins, where it was being sent, who was in the pictures and who was taking them.</P>
    <P>When photographs and videos of child sex are exchanged between paedophiles, they learn from each other, sanction each other's behaviour and provide audio visual lessons to teach children such behaviour.  Every year an estimated one million children world-wide are lured and forced into child prostitution.  The UN rapporteur on child trafficking recently stated that the children being tricked into prostitution are younger and younger.  Children aged nine, ten and 11 years of age are involved.  Experts have warned that this trend will continue unless immediate action is taken.  Child pornography is inextricably linked with paedophilia.  A child is abused when an <Col N="492" /> image or photograph is taken to abuse another child.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not immune to the horrors of child pornography and paedophile rings.  They exist in our cities and they regularly trade child pornographic material.  They will continue to do so for as long as the Government buries its head in the sand.  Yesterday's putative indignation, which supposedly gave birth to this wretched Government, has become today's stagnation.</P>
    <P>This is the same Government whose Minister for Justice said that our Disposal and Restraint of Illicit Assets Bill, 1996, dealing with the freezing and disposal of assets, the subject matter of crime, was not only flawed but unconstitutional. She said on television that the powers we proposed were already law.  I challenged her at the time to produce the Attorney General's opinion but she did not do so.  In an about turn, reminiscent of the great retreat from Moscow, she accepted the Fianna Fáil Bill last July.  She would not have done so but for the fact that she was stampeded into it by an outraged public and the Government grasping at straws.</P>
    <P>I again challenge the Minister to produce the Attorney General's opinion on this Bill which states it is seriously flawed.  While it is not perfect, the Bill is not flawed in the sense indicated last night by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  In my opinion, it is constitutional. Everybody knows that it is also apposite and necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have indicated that they will not oppose the Bill but will introduce their own measures.  This is a fig leaf to cover the Government's blushes.  Doubtless the Minister will introduce legislation based on our Bill, the essential provisions of which will be lifted.  She will embroider it a little and present it as her own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <P>I said last July that the Minister's long finger resembled Pinocchio's nose.  In delaying this legislation she has decided to extend Pinocchio's nose.  It is by no means the first time that a Fine Gael Minister has become involved in an unexplained extension.  The Minister is on something of an extension herself.  The public has become as weary of her machinations as it has of thrashing about in the dark to find the halo belonging to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Full time early release for the Minister and the rainbow coalition Government is but the break of a ballot box seal away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister declared to the House in early 1996 that she would not oppose Fianna Fáil's Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, we foolishly took her at her word.  Instead she produced a poorly watered down version of Part I of our Bill and presented it to the House as the Drug Trafficking Bill, 1996.  It was not the first time that we had witnessed such shameless plagiarism.  In a <Col N="493" /> desperate bid to rescue her Incest Proceedings Bill, 1995, from a labyrinth of despair, she lifted the essential provision of our Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, to ensure that details of evidence could again be published in incest cases.</P>
    <P>The Government subsequently gorged itself on Fianna Fáil Bills, such as the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution (No. 1) Bill, 1996, to provide for a bail referendum, and the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, having earlier deemed both Bills to be superfluous.  It is strange that what was superfluous last year became this year not only necessary but an absolute imperative.  Even the most hardened political cynics and connoisseurs will be left gasping for breath at the sheer magnitude of the U-turns which we are witnessing by the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
    <P>In this instance the Government has made the classical political error of assuming that because flowers smell sweeter than parsnips they will also make better soup.  It will not take a chef to advise that the opposite is the case.  If it does not believe this it should try to make soup with flowers.  Some members of the Government have taken the soup.  When a Bill such as this is accepted but rejected it would appear that politics and parliamentary democracy is debased.  When a decent man, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, tells the House on behalf of the Executive that he is not opposing a Bill but will subsequently introduce his own Bill, the convulsions involved must, of necessity, cause the deepest concern to anybody worried about the body politic.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister of State questioned why the Bill refers to photographic images and not pseudo photographs, as referred to in the English translation.  The reference to photographic images captures pornography which is computer generated.  Cartoon type, or any amalgamation of photographs, can give the impression that a child is involved in the pornographic material by juxtaposing a child's face on an otherwise adult body.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is not correct to suggest that the Bill does not inhibit the sale of indecent material or possession for personal use.  A reasonable interpretation of section 2 would demonstrate that this point is covered.  If the Minister of State or any other Member is satisfied that the Bill is not explicit or does not go far enough in relation to any item, it can be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>For the past two years we have been used to the intellectual bankruptcy which has forced the Opposition to produce almost every meaningful statute regarding the reform of criminal law here. In this instance intellectual bankruptcy has been compounded by moral bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>I express my appreciation of the co-operation I have received from all parties for the speedy and timely way in which they have dealt with this measure.  It was done on the basis that it had been outstanding for some time and that it was necessary to have it enacted before the end of the year. It has been stated in some quarters that it is being done with indecent haste, on the contrary it is being done with the speed necessary to ensure we deal with some of the measures which have been outstanding for almost a year.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House since 1977.  I had the honour to be appointed to the Seanad by the late Brendan Corish in July 1976. I stood for election in June 1973 and have been an apprentice politician from 1968 or 1969. Against that background and that experience, I address my fellow parliamentarians in this respect, parliamentary democracy in Ireland is under attack.</P>
      <P>It is under attack, not as it has been at various times and places throughout this century by enemies who openly admit their contempt for the ballot box, from authoritarian groups or military elites but from those who see themselves as its friends, and tragically some have travelling companions, members of which are in this House.  The method of attack is not the sudden coup or the putsch, or the bomb or the bullet, it is the soundbite loaded with innuendo, the headline crafted with subliminal images.  The impact is corrosive, not sudden but no less pernicious for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message conveyed is that we in this House, who are elected by the people to represent them and legislate for them, are corrupt &mdash; on the take &mdash; and in it for the money.  It is rarely put so crudely &mdash; we are talking about professional communicators &mdash; but the overall relentless impact of acres of print over a period conveys that impression.  We now have one evening newspaper in the city.  Deputies on all sides would be well advised to read it.  The overall impression, over the acres of print, is not a healthy one.  All of us <Col N="495" /> accept that we are fallible, all of us appreciate that we, like others, may be tempted but, despite our political and ideological differences, we resent and are justified in resenting attempts to tarnish us with the sins, or alleged sins, of a few.</P>
    <P>Our lives, public and private, are subject to a scrutiny which our predecessors neither expected nor would accept.  The commentators who comment on our lives refuse to have their lives or their lifestyles subjected to the same scrutiny or exposure.  All we ask is that comment on our actions, our putative transactions, be accurate and couched in a form to which we as individuals can respond rather than vague allegations directed at us as a group.</P>
    <P>Let me be specific.  The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 15 December 1996 featured two banner headlines: one reputedly referring to a member of what some describe as the third House of the Oireachtas.  Precedent prevents me from commenting on its contents.  That allegation was comprehensively rejected by a spokesperson on behalf of Aras an Uachtaráin on the Monday as reported in <i>The Irish Times.</i> As I said on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night, &ldquo;What it says in the papers&rdquo;&mdash;which has a listenership of about 800,000, approximately ten times the circulation of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>&mdash; suggested that my party Leader and Tánaiste, friend and colleague, was an investor in a project which had received money from a particular benefactor, who has recently featured in news reports.  What the story referred to was the reality that Deputy Spring with, I suspect, every other public representative in north Kerry had contributed to a community enterprise which, for reasons of corporate structure, was constituted as a limited liability company and, therefore, donations were described in the form of shares and investments. The assertion was that there was a beneficial interest in Deputy Dick Spring and Christy Spring's investment in a community facility.  I presume every other public representative made a similar contribution.  The newspaper headline and &ldquo;What in says in the papers&rdquo; at 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. on Monday morning, implied to a much wider listening audience, than the readership of that newspaper would otherwise achieve, that there was a nasty relationship between a politician investing in a project, to which donations had been solicited by the same politician, and that, therefore, there was a less than honourable relationship.  In effect that was the guts of the story.  We all know in this House that that was a million miles from the truth.  I offer that by way of the most current illustration to underpin the point I have just made.</P>
    <P>It is not that we as politicians have failed in any significant way to advance our case.  The problem is that we have for too long lacked the courage to take the message to the public that there is a price to pay for parliamentary democracy.  We and our families pay &mdash; and pay willingly &mdash; that price in terms of time, toil, tedium and disruption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> However, it is the price the public asks us to pay and we are prepared to pay it.  The Government is indicating in this Bill and in another measure sponsored by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, what that price, which we believe represents value for public money, will be.</P>
    <P>It may come as a surprise to many people to learn that political parties are unknown legally in the Constitution.  They existed before it was put to the people, they have existed since and hopefully they will flourish into the future.  Throughout most of the history of this State &mdash; and even before that in the case of my party &mdash; they have been effective in articulating the aspirations of individuals or groups in our society.  The silence of the Constitution notwithstanding, the reality is that political parties are essential to the functioning of parliamentary democracy.  No parliamentary democracy in the world functions without some form of formalised political party structure.  A parliament composed of 166 independent Deputies would be an interesting phenomenon.  I am sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, would love to preside over such a parliament. How workable it would be I leave, Sir, to your more superior and mature imagination.  I mean no disrespect to my absent colleagues whose perspectives and electability often serve to remind all parties of the consequences of failure in formulating or communicating policies.  Without the tension or clash between divergent approaches to political, social and economic issues generated by the activities of political parties malign developments in our society could go unquestioned and unchallenged.</P>
    <P>Developments on this island during the 19th century did much to imbed in the public consciousness the assumption that political parties and political activity should be funded by the donations of party supporters and the activities of volunteers.  Students of modern history going back to the days of Daniel O'Connell, the creator, if not inventor, of mass participatory parliamentary democracy, could not but be aware of that phenomenon.  The people who learned that lesson carried it with them to Australia, America, New Zealand and Canada.  It is little wonder that Jim Bolger, whose grandparents came from Wexford, was recently re-elected, that Paul Keating, who addressed this House and visited Tynagh to see where his great-grandfather Matthew lived, was elected Prime Minister of Australia and that Brian Mulrooney and others were also elected. Irish emigrants took with them, in advance of any other such group, a knowledge of political democracy which they utilised in such a way that they left an extraordinary legacy of political acumen and history among Irish communities throughout the world.  They did not learn this from the birds and the bees, the hawthorn bushes or hedge school masters, they learned it from people like Daniel O'Connell and others.</P>
    <P>For much of the lifetime of this State political parties have been funded through the activities of <Col N="497" /> party supporters and volunteers.  However, this has started to wane.  It is open to the nostalgic to argue that it would be preferable if what parties needed to sustain their involvement in the democratic process and to enable them to examine and develop policies suitable for the public was funded in the traditional way.  However, dangers lurk in such a system.  It was no accident that a popular programme on politics some years ago was called &ldquo;The Hurler on the Ditch&rdquo;, for in politics as in sport people are more inclined to be spectators than participants.</P>
    <P>The funding of parties exclusively by supporters involves a risk.  A party with wealthy supporters may more easily garner resources than a party which strives to represent the weak or vulnerable in society.  Some business people are prepared, because of family traditions or individual commitment to an ideology or outlook on the world, to make financial contributions to charitable, sporting or political organisations with a mission.  There is nothing dishonourable in such persons deciding to make their contributions to a political party rather than to some other organisation, or being invited to do so.  As our society has become more sophisticated, the perception of such contributions has changed.  Given the current climate, it is understandable if contributors and political parties are compromised when such funding is maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to articulate the case for State funding of political parties <i>per se</i>, although my party has long believed that the case for so doing is very strong.  The information we received from our sister parties in the European Socialist group stated that, with the exception of that paragon of progress, the United Kingdom, political parties in all European countries from Finland to Greece, Portugal and Denmark receive state funding.  We have argued in favour of such a system for many years and I have written about the need for it on many occasions.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with here is the financing of one element of a political party, that is the parliamentary party which has to fight its corner in this House and in the Seanad throughout the lifetime of each House and which is, in a very real sense, the shop front for the values, ideas and policies which each party wishes to promote nationally.  Discussions have taken place from time to time on increasing the resources available to these Houses by, for example, recruiting researchers to the joint staff.  I am not averse to such a development but it is important for a parliamentary party, when it wishes to develop policies, undertake research or deal effectively with an issue before the House, to be able to draw on the resources and views of a wider pool of skill, talent, experience and imagination than it is likely to find among those who have chosen, with the best will in the world, to work in a small segment of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In larger countries the driving force behind the development of the details of policy initiatives taken by parties, whether in Opposition or in <Col N="498" /> Government, has frequently been the think-tanks they have established or the foundations associated with them.  It can be argued that Government parties can draw for these tasks on the civil servants employed in their Departments. However, I question whether civil servants are the right people to ask to develop ideas for political parties and whether their basic rights are compromised in some way by asking them to engage in activities where the product of their labour is utilised for party political purposes.  The Government and individual Ministers can draw on them for work related to their Departments. However, this is always within the constraints of the life cycle of a particular Government and in the knowledge that civil servants are non-political and able to distinguish between the legitimate demands of their Minister and work related in essence to the political outlook or longer term strategy of his or her party.</P>
    <P>Section 5 has attracted a degree of controversy. It provides a new basis for funding parliamentary parties by providing a clear and fair mechanism of funding, by increasing the total amount of funds available to support their parliamentary activities and by introducing changes to a system which, as it grew through a thicket of legislative provisions, developed quirks and anomalies which hardened civil servants found difficult to explain and politicians found hard to justify.  The kernel of our approach is to accept that parliamentary activity involves expenditure for party, no matter how small.  Consequently, there are economies of scale for larger parties.  Accordingly, we propose a tapered system of allowances which have an in-built bias towards smaller parties.  The allowances will not be paid to individual party Deputies, but to the leader of that party in Dáil Éireann.  We also recognise that such a system should always have, as our current system has, an element of advantage for the parties in Opposition.  We propose to do this by imposing a discount of one-third on the allowances to which Government parties would individually be entitled.  Finally, we are giving recognition for the first time to the role played by Independents by providing for the payment directly to each non-party Deputy of a sum of £10,000 for the same purpose.  The Bill requires that such moneys are used only for parliamentary activities.  This is based on the legal advice we received on foot of the McKenna judgment and must be viewed in the context of the comprehensive measures which I as Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, will introduce by way of an amendment to the electoral Bill.</P>
    <P>The measures I propose to introduce here, subject to the agreement of both Houses, must be considered in the context of the integrated package of measures proposed in the Bill that will be amended by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The first element of funding will be used to regulate the way elections take place, the second relates to the Bill under discussion and the third will cover moneys available on an ongoing basis for the activities of registered political parties which may or may not have elected Members in the House. The Minister for the Environment will give <Col N="499" /> details of that to the House in due course.  The funding provided for in this legislation can be used only for parliamentary activities.  There is a specific and wide-ranging prohibition on their use for electoral expenditure.  That covers the substantial enhancement of the leader's allowance to provide for an increase of approximately 150 per cent to parliamentary parties representing registered parties who have the good fortune of being represented in the House.</P>
    <P>A scheme of secretarial assistance for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas has operated since 1971.  Under its provision staff are employed by Members or parties in Leinster House or in constituencies.  In addition, some move to Government offices as the parties or Deputies with whom they work take up ministerial office. For some time it has been suggested that the scheme under which this employment is provided might not be consistent with Article 15.15 of the Constitution, which allows for the provision by law of &ldquo;facilities&rdquo; for Members of the Oireachtas. The scheme under which we have operated for many years does not have a specific statutory base.</P>
    <P>When this issue was last before the House many of the people in question resented being described as a &ldquo;facility for members&rdquo; but, in pure legal terms, the provision from Exchequer finance of secretarial staff and equipment constitutes a &ldquo;facility&rdquo; under the Constitution and it is necessary to deal with it accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am simply providing a mechanism under which the scheme, or a scheme which replaces it, is made compatible with the Constitution and fire proofing against the termination, because of a legal technicality, of the employment of more than 200 people known to all of us, a prospect which arose early in the life of this Dáil.  The simple legislative provision I propose to introduce in section 2 does not alter the terms and conditions under which people have been employed and does not set aside any agreement they have made with individual Deputies, Senators or parliamentary parties.  Secretarial assistants are currently selected by the parties or individual Deputies who are thus technically their employers.</P>
    <P>Although the major task of an employer, payment falls on the Exchequer.  Section 4 is designed to deal with circumstances in which a secretarial assistant is injured in the course of work and initiates legal action.  At present an action is directed against the Deputy or party and could involve them, individually or collectively, in substantial cost.</P>

      <P>The paymaster rather than the notional employer should shoulder the burden. The Bill will empower the Minister for Finance to indemnify a Deputy or party in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other components of the Bill are mainly of a technical nature.  At present Members are deterred from claiming overnight expenses unless <Col N="500" /> a House or a committee concludes its formal business at a later hour.  This penalises Members who carry out significant additional work in Leinster House after formal sittings are finished and as a result incur accommodation costs in the Dublin area on final sitting days.  It may also result in tired Members undertaking long journeys at personal risk.  The Bill will allow an overnight allowance to be paid in those circumstances and no doubt contribute to the safety of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The second change to the arrangements governing the overnight allowance is primarily intended to deal with the attendance at parliamentary party meetings when the Houses or committees are not sitting by allowing overnight payments to be made for the night before such meetings.  As non-party Deputies may have similar reasons to meet in connection with parliamentary business, the provision extends to all Members but is subject to a limit of five such meetings per year.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas (Allowance to Members) and Ministerial Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1992, made provision for a new constituency telephone facility for Oireachtas Members. Under the current arrangements, a contribution may be made towards the cost of telephone calls made by Members from their homes or constituency offices.  In the case of TDs, the amount to be recouped is 75 per cent of the total cost of calls, subject to an upper limit of £2,000 per annum.  The annual limit for Senators is £1,000. The limit for Oireachtas committee chairpersons and Dáil party whips is £1,000 higher.</P>
    <P>I consider, in common with Members generally, that the current arrangements are cumbersome, difficult and expensive to administer.  Accordingly, I propose that they be amended to provide for the payment of an annual unvouched allowance to Members based on the current upper limits. Payments will be made on a quarterly basis and I will deal with the detailed implementation of the new legislative provision by way of regulations. The revised arrangements will apply with effect from 1 January 1996.  I want to tell the House, particularly those who might accuse me of frittering away the nation's finances that I have already made provision in this regard in the 1996 Estimates.  I was under the impression our intention at that time was that this could be done under existing regulations.  There is no additional expenditure in terms of what has been published and what was provided for.</P>
    <P>On the 100 day rule, section 4 (4) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 provides that Members' travelling claims in respect of journeys between their homes and Leinster House must be submitted to the Leinster House authorities within 100 days of the date on which such travel was undertaken.  The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Travel Facilities) (Amendment) Regulations, 1994 provided for the payment of a daily travel allowance to certain Members of the Oireachtas on any day in which they travel to Leinster House.  Prior to the 1994 legislation coming into force the daily <Col N="501" /> travel allowance was only payable for travel to Leinster House on sitting days.  This rule cost a number of Deputies their entitlement to the new allowance because of the delay between the qualifying date and the signing of the required regulations.  I decided that Members should be paid the allowance with effect from 10 July 1994 as an exceptional measure and subject to any necessary amending legislation being introduced at the next suitable opportunity.  Accordingly, section 6 provides for this.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to every Member of the House, irrespective of their political philosophical position or their party or non-party membership. The cost of running this House is a mere fraction of the democracy we fund daily and which on current account terms costs £13,000 million.  I am an honoured Member of this House and I am here at the grace and favour of my electors.  I and every democrat in this House must accept their verdict which is ultimate and final, but while I am here, for myself and every other Member I want the resources to do the job the electorate is entitled to expect and which we must do on its behalf. Democracy is not some kind of fixed rigid edifice that needs no maintenance or that is permanent and beyond the harsh climes of the ill-formed criticism or unctuous envy of those who fail to make it on to these benches but get to write the columns of certain newspapers.  I hope the people in the press gallery got that.  If some of them want to come down here, they can take their chances.</P>
    <P>Democracy is a precious flower, one I love, but one which needs nurturing, nourishment and constant attention.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance for having the guts to make a very spirited defence of the plight of parliamentarians in this House and to speak authoritatively against the attack on the Irish democratic system.  That is not new in 1996, but has been part of political life for more than a generation.  Since the Minister and I came into this House on the same day in 1977 we have experienced ups and downs and have seen things change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The night of the count when Deputy Currie was elected to Dáil Éireann I was with a wellknown Fine Gael activist in RTE helping with the figures.  That man has gone on to bigger and better things and now sits on the Bench.  At that time it was my job to comment on proportional representation. After the interviewer congratulated the newly elected Austin Currie in succeeding to move from one Parliament to another, the interviewer asked him what he found most significant about the Irish election.  I remember his words at that time which reiterated what I had said some years previously.  He said more or less <Col N="502" /> what the Minister said in the early part of his contribution, that the most amazing aspect of the Irish election was the threat to democracy in this State.  He had come from a part of Ireland where there was the threat of the bomb and the bullet and people could see and hear the threat to democracy from the people who preached that type of philosophy.  He said the danger to politics and institutions in this part of the country was far greater than he could have realised because it was far more insidious.  There was a lack of faith among the electorate that any of us make any difference. Unfortunately a number of people who comment on the activities of this House day in day out contribute to part of the alienation of the electorate.  Most of them know the reality yet they make no attempt to highlight it.  They think that is a good way to sell newspapers or other publications.  This concentration among our people and by the media on the financial affairs of Oireachtas Éireann and the allowances given to Members is uniquely Irish, a unique form of begrudgery.  I do not know of any other democracy in Europe where there has been such concentration on such an issue for as long a period. In the United Kingdom there are media reports on a wide variety of issues, but they tend to concentrate on the lifestyles of parliamentarians not on the moneys they receive and maybe we should be thankful that the Irish media do not concentrate on our lifestyles.  We have made this form of begrudgery into a fine art and what it is doing to the body politic must be seen to be believed. It has also been contributed to by people of this House over a long period of time, maybe to curry favour with the electorate because presumably we all want to be re-elected.  Some people think the best way to go about that is to denigrate themselves.</P>
    <P>We have brought the House to a low level.  I have come to the conclusion that part of the reason for this is that there are too many TDs. People are so familiar with their public representatives that they call on them in the middle of the night, never mind in the middle of the day, including Christmas day.  That happens because we are too available to the electorate and to the media.  There must be too many of us.  We would probably not have put a provision in the Constitution in 1996 that the average population per Deputy would be somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.  Do Members think that any political party in this House will be successful in passing a Bill to reduce the number of Deputies in Dáil Éireann?  That is not on.  I am a pragmatist and realist as much as anything else.  The best we can do is to keep the number of Deputies to 166 and increase the threshold.</P>
    <P>There is a strange divergence in the minds of our people and among the media regarding our electoral system.  We are constantly harried and told by our betters in the journalistic world that we should not do all the things we do, that we should not be so available to constituents and that a good deal of the work we do is not necessary. <Col N="503" /> Perhaps they are right, but if Members do not do that work they will not be re-elected.  Each time we try to change the electoral system, the people who lead the charge and get a debate going on the matter come from the same quarter.  I have said before that while it was not a mistake for my party to propose a change in our electoral system in 1959 and 1968 it was a mistake not to have opted, on an all-party basis, for the first past the post system.  The 1968 amendment, of which the Minister reminded me, probably would have had a greater chance of success.</P>
    <P>This is a topic on which I have spoken since a debate in Cavan, I think in 1981, on our electoral system.  I have consistently refrained from advocating what precise form any new system should take but I have advocated a type of cross-party approach to ascertain whether we can devise a better electoral system.  That being said, the people have a great grá for the current system. When it suits them, our peers or betters in the media also appear to love our present electoral system.</P>
    <P>During my 20 years as a Member of this House I noted that, whenever a Member spoke, regardless of the topic, his or her comments would be covered diligently by those who reported this House in the media.  I remember correspondents such as the late Ned Murphy and others who operated a pool system so that, no matter what was said here, it was reported in the press.  In those days, while it was not possible to go to the Editor of Debates as speedily to obtain the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; of the Official Report, Members were reported assiduously in all of the national newspapers the following day.  Now, unless one supplies a scripted speech or contributes to a major debate on a topical subject, one is unlikely to be reported in the press at all.</P>
    <P>The expansion of our committee system in recent years was in theory regarded as being very good.  Within my parliamentary party I and the late Deputy Brian Lenihan spoke against that proposal, both for the same reason, contending that within our electoral multi-seat constituency system the extension of the committee system would place an impossible task on Members.  We also suggested that their deliberations would not be reported by the media given that proceedings in the Dáil were not being covered to any great extent, which is exactly what has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell is Chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs where there have been many fine debates within the past year.  Submissions have been invited and made to us offering a wide range of public opinion regarding economic and monetary union. We succeeded in bringing before us people ranging from those who were very opposed to the idea to those who would be in the vanguard of the promoters of the concept.  Yet the coverage we got in the national media was derisory.  One newspaper made some effort to cover some comments and contributions of some invited commentators <Col N="504" /> while another covered hardly any of our deliberations. That continued over quite a period.  We are lectured by those same people that we public representatives are not doing our job, while many of us run from committee to committee.  One can predict the time of year when a certain newspaper will run an article about TDs' long holidays, claiming that they work only so many hours in Dáil Éireann whereas Members of all parties and Independents, who must run a lot faster to keep apace, know that to be simply not true.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to an article in last weekend's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and I agree with what he had to say.  I laughed continuously from about 1 o'clock that day until the following morning.  While I would have thought the culmination of our Presidency of the European Union should have been the highlight of the past six months, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke on RTÉ radio explaining why, as a local representative in the town of Tralee, he had contributed £1,000 to a local leisure complex and trying to say that there was nothing really wrong or bad about that.  What really made me laugh was that, for the remainder of the day, his comments hit the headlines of all later news bulletins. Given the events of some two years ago I have to admit it gave me some little, smug satisfaction; it would be very dishonest of me not to say that. While not all members of my party would be as friendly with him, I have remained a friend of his over that length of time, even playing the odd game of golf with him since our little contretemps in the months of November and December 1994 and I continue to do so.</P>
    <P>That media coverage also gave me some food for thought as to what had brought that about, leading me to the conclusion that certain events over the preceding five or six years, or even those in the past decade or more, and the manner in which politics was conducted within this House contributed to this phenomenon.  That conduct was perceived by some as the way to enhance their standing in the polls and was exploited by them.  I suggest we have now reaped the disadvantages of that whirlwind.  While it may have been good politics for those who engaged in that practice it was of short-term benefit for democracy.</P>
    <P>Now that all parties in this House have been in power, practically all parties have been pilloried and excoriated to the same extent as mine, which appeared to have a monopoly when it came to excoriation by the press and media over such a long period.  That will be a lesson to us all when planning our tactics for the next ten years.  Rather than engage in the type of politics which I denounced over the previous decade, perhaps we will put something different in its place over the forthcoming decade to the mutual benefit of public representatives and our democratic system.</P>
    <P>Despite the impression given in the print and broadcast media earlier today, this Bill does not represent Dick Turpin riding up with a shotgun <Col N="505" /> on a Wednesday and returning on the following Friday morning to collect the loot.  I was not aware until late yesterday that this Bill would contain a section relating to party leaders' allowances or funds.  This money which goes to party leaders is expended directly on all the facilities and salaries paid by party members.  From media comment one would think this money was going directly into the hands of members of all parties, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance has said, there is a price to be paid for democracy if we are serious about its preservation.  I have not seen so many Members in the Chamber for some time.  I am glad the Minister advanced such a sound defence of Members because for too long it has been left to a few to defend their colleagues.  I am aware that Members on all sides are exasperated with the type of media excoriation to which they have been subjected.  I am glad to note that Members are standing up for themselves.</P>
    <P>During my membership of this House only two Members were applauded by their colleagues for speaking out and doing something to improve Members' working conditions and allowances. One was the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, who as Minister for Finance implemented a major improvement in that respect.  The other was John Boland, who lost his seat for other reasons, who also stood up for Members' conditions and defended them.  I am sorry he is no longer a Member because, even though he could be tetchy on occasion and was not necessarily a friend of all Members, he and I got on exceptionally well.  He was not afraid to stand up for Members' rights.  I am glad the Minister for Finance has followed in his footsteps.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  The former Deputy, John Boland, is doing an awful lot better in his career as a barrister.  Next February I will have been ten years in the House.  Within days of coming into this House, my car insurance increased by 25 per cent and when I inquired of my insurance company why I was told it was because I was a Member of Dáil Éireann.  I caused the insurance company grief for a long time after that.  Ten years ago the facilities in this House were Dickensian. I shared an office with four other Deputies and three secretaries.  As a result of a number of changes made by the people mentioned by Deputy McCreevy, the facilities are now much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have alleged that this Bill is coming in the dark of the night.  I give the Minister for Finance credit for introducing this Bill which has been in gestation for a number of months. Perhaps I am unfortunate in that I am Chief Whip of the largest party in this House and in Opposition, which does not have the facilities of the Government parties, and I am, therefore, <Col N="506" /> responsible for approximately 90 Oireachtas Members and 95 secretarial staff.  From the day I was appointed Chief Whip I made the point that I was not elected by the people of my constituency to be an employer.</P>
    <P>Article 15.15 of the Constitution states that the Executive must provide us with the facilities we require to do our duty as Oireachtas Members. For the past two years I have fought a rearguard action on behalf of the Oireachtas Members I represent as Chief Whip and the secretarial staff. They and their union representatives may have thought I was turning a blind eye or a deaf ear to their predicament.  However, I was not.  The employment of secretarial staff in this House and in the constituencies is a minefield of bureaucracy. Many of the staff work more hours than they are required to do under their terms of employment, particularly at election time.  I thank the Minister for putting this on a statutory footing which means that negotiations can be finalised with the unions on behalf of secretarial assistants, particularly those in the constituencies, who are in the union and those who are not.</P>
    <P>I became aware of a ludicrous situation in the past two years since I became Chief Whip.  We are supposed to be legislators who pass laws ensuring that all employers and those in responsible positions have employers' liability.  Yet, for the past number of years the secretarial staff in this House and in the constituencies, who are working on our behalf, have not been insured. This defies belief.  For the past two years I have made a nuisance of myself at Whips' meetings by constantly stating that this situation could not continue.  The situation came to a dramatic head some time ago when a Deputy's secretary had a serious accident in this House.  As a result, not only is the State being sued, but the Deputy and the party of which she is a member are also being sued.  Such an accident could happen to any secretary either inside or outside this House.  At present, constituents who visit a constituency office are insured in case they fall.  However, the secretarial assistant who works there five days a week is not insured.</P>
    <P>Last night I spent a half an hour trying to explain this situation to a number of our media friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>However, not one word of what I said was printed.  I was told today it was not newsworthy.  How could the fact that 200 people are not insured not be newsworthy?  That may be an indictment of this House, but it was not for want of trying on the part of the Oireachtas Members that it was not highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State refused to acknowledge that it was the employer of these secretarial assistants.  It said <Col N="507" /> we were the employers but I denied this because we do not pay them.  It was said that because we have control over the secretaries, we were their employers.  Contracts and insurance for secretarial staff are linked because the State refused to indemnify Deputies and political parties for accidents because it was not prepared to say it was employing the staff.  However, Article 15.15 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas may make provision by law for the payment of allowances to members of each House thereof in respect of their duties as public representatives and for the grant to them of free travelling [which we do not get] and other such facilities (if any) in connection with those duties as the Oireachtas may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet, for many years we have been flying on a wing and a prayer as regards the indemnity of our staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be complimented, not pilloried, for his decisive action.  Strike notice was served on the political parties in relation to the secretarial staff who wanted this issue brought to a conclusion by the end of the session.  The Whips asked the Minister to come to a number of Whips' meetings, which he did voluntarily, where he explained the difficulties.  This Bill is the culmination of those proceedings.</P>
    <P>The current issue relates to the party leaders' allowances, which is newsworthy, unlike the issue of insurance for the secretarial staff.  The reason this Bill has been introduced was to correct the most ludicrous of situations so that people who work night and day on behalf of Oireachtas Members were insured.  I compliment the Minister for doing that.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, as a result of this Bill, the Deputy and political party in jeopardy as a result of a substantial High Court claim will be indemnified. They had nothing to do with the accident but were brought in on it.  One of our committee chairmen is in an equally disastrous situation where, again, the State refuses to indemnify him in regard to a pending libel case against him.  He had to employ his own solicitors to defend him in regard to an issue in which he became embroiled as a committee chairman.  He was acting on the advice of the civil servants in charge of the committee when he replied to a newspaper.  They dictated a letter to him, part of which, unfortunately, may be the cause of the action, and now he is being sued in a personal capacity.  I have said to this person privately that there should be no more meetings of that committee until such time as indemnification or help is given to him.  Otherwise we might as well close up shop.  Why should Members become committee chairpersons if they will leave themselves open to court actions in regard to committee business?  Anyone who takes on these responsibilities needs to watch out because they could be in serious jeopardy.  That issue has yet to be addressed and it is most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> It is vital we put these issues right.  Other members of my party will deal with the parliamentary leaders' allowance.  We have a number of points to make on the proportionality of the way in which it is divided.  This issue was brought up in the recent past as a result of the adverse publicity in regard to the Price Waterhouse report.  It is being dealt with in this Bill and we support that.  People cannot have it both ways. There should be a proper system of State funding where people are given assistance.  When Fianna Fáil was in opposition from 1982-7, many of the policies that were ultimately put in place upon entering Government in 1987 such as the International Financial Services Centre and Temple Bar were a result of research we did in Opposition. The Minister stated earlier that if one was to rely on civil servants, with no disrespect to them, perhaps those policies would not have come to the fore.  That is why a political party as big as Fianna Fáil needs proper research facilities.</P>
    <P>Despite the adverse publicity we have a front bench of 15 people who are supposed to shadow Ministers with huge Departments behind them on a daily basis.  Between them they have one fax, one photocopier and two secretaries.  In this day and age, why not give them the proper facilities? It should not cost anyone money to enter this House but unfortunately it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Every measure in this Bill is sensible, well designed, welcome and overdue and should be supported by every Member.  The most important point, undoubtedly, in the Bill as far as the public is concerned, though perhaps not for the secretarial staff or individual Deputies, is the parliamentary leaders' allowance.  It is important that the proposed amendment being brought about by section 5 is &ldquo;in respect of expenses arising from the parliamentary activities, including research, of a qualifying party.&rdquo;  It is about making us better parliamentarians. It is about &ldquo;no money in my back pocket and no extra benefit to me.&rdquo;  It is concerned with making this body a better Parliament. This Parliament is run on a shoestring in several respects, the most important of which is that it is always beholden to the Government for a few shillings for this, that or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A subcommittee of the Select Committee of Finance and General Affairs was established to take a long, hard look at the proposed legislation on compellability and privilege of witnesses at Oireachtas committee meetings.  We found ourselves in the position that we could not even hire advisers to tell us what was the situation.  A barrister, a decent colleague of mine, said not to worry and that he would continue to advise us even though we did not have the money to pay him because he presumed in the last analysis we are all gentlemen and ladies and that the bill will be paid.  The clerk and the committee chairman, <Col N="509" /> Deputy Jim Mitchell, could not say that they will pay his bill straight up.  Is it not a strange thing in a parliamentary democracy that it cannot say, with legal force, it will get advice on its relationship with the Executive and undertake to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The system of parliamentary leaders' allowances has always been tipped massively in favour of the Opposition and within the Opposition for historical reasons in favour of a smaller party in Opposition so that the Progressive Democrats effectively got one third of the money available to Opposition parties.  That was not a princely sum of money.  In terms of engaging expertise, researchers, running a fax machine, dealing with press queries and day to day matters such as paying for a mobile phone for the person who has to liaise between you and the press or sending people on delegations to Sellafield, it was grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>A formula has been devised in such a way that it leaves us no worse off at the end of the day but not substantially better off.  We were not looking for more, but I can well imagine that other people in this House thought if a party was entitled to this, surely other parties are entitled to more.  I understand the proposition that the system in so far as it was skewed in some way was skewed in favour of the Progressive Democrats on a relative basis.  However, in absolute terms, it gave us nothing to which we were not entitled.  Like every other party, we are faced with the need for press relations officers and researchers and to send members on delegations to commission research. Like every other party, we undertake expenditure. It may be somewhat crude and doubtless other Members may argue on the detail of it, but in the last analysis the formula struck tends to give recognition to the proposition that every party has standing expenses, which are not doubled for bigger parties.  One cannot have half a press officer, unless that person is a half wit, or half a telephone, half a fax machine or half a delegate at Sellafield and there are certain fixed overhead expenses that are recognised by this formula, which is reasonable.</P>
    <P>This House should stand up for its rights <i>vis-ávis</i> the Executive.  It is about time committees of this House said they are entitled, as of democratic right, to the resources they need to operate.  They should not have to ask an assistant principal officer in the Department of Finance for permission to be advised properly on how they stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> that Department &mdash; I am not singling out the Department of Finance in particular.  This House, as a democratic assembly, has democratic rights to give to itself sufficient resources to discharge its duties.  Every Member should stand up for the right of the House to adequately fund not the remuneration of its Deputies but its activities.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say we are adequately funded.  An Opposition Deputy who goes to a meeting of an Oireachtas committee, attended by a Minister who has six or eight people behind him handing <Col N="510" /> him notes, does not feel on equal terms with the Minister although he may be on equal terms in that he received as many votes as the Minister. An Opposition Deputy attending an Oireachtas committee or a Dáil debate on legislation or a motion is, as of right, entitled to as much assistance as any other Member.  Perhaps that sounds startling because the tradition is that the Executive weights in on one side and the Opposition must flounder around looking for voluntary help from briefless barristers with ambition, somebody who will draft a Bill for them as an act of charity. That is not the way to run a democracy or to strike a balance between the rights of citizens.  All Members received a quota of votes and everybody is equal.  The House should stand against the Executive and say we require it to give us the resources to discharge our functions.</P>
    <P>I take issue with some of the Minister's comments. He said parliamentary democracy in Ireland is under attack, but I do not agree.  If he says the present controversies amount to an orchestrated media attack on the institution of parliamentary democracy, that is overstating the situation.  In recent times media reports have tended to suggest there is something wrong with the behaviour of some public people, elected and non-elected, that their behaviour has been less than acceptable.  There have been suggestions that they received moneys in circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I fully accept that there has been a frenzy of innuendo and that people have built rumour upon rumour.

      <P>Deputy McCreevy said no other democracy concerns itself with the incomes or financial status of its representatives as much as we do, but that is not true.  MPs in Westminster go through the same meat mincer every time they vote themselves an increase.  There is an horrific hullabaloo if they get an extra penny.  American Congressmen and Senators spend half their lives defending themselves from charges of impropriety or allegations about excessive expenditure on their part.</P>
      <P>A few people in the media have taken advantage of recent rumours and controversies based on rumours to smear the whole political apparatus, but the best we can do in those circumstances is to shrug it off and say it is not correct. Attacking the media in bulk is wrong and saying we as representatives of parliamentary democracy are under attack is wrong.</P>

      <P>If Mr. Sam Smyth had not published his story, or if the &ldquo;you know who&rdquo; stories had never appeared, there would be neither a stronger nor weaker case for funding elections from the public purse.  On the contrary, the vast majority of people do not want politics to be funded entirely in that way.  If that is to be the case, the question which the Vincent Brownes of this world must address is whether innuendo and suggestion will always be attached to even the smallest private contribution to political parties or politicians?  Is one supposed to be dramatically less interested in a person who gives £3,000 than in a person who gives £30,000?  I do not know the answer, but no one who is serious about politics should suggest that we could ever fund the entire political process from the public purse.  It follows that we cannot pretend that every private contribution to a political party is in some way tainted.  I welcome the Minister's remarks to that effect because, going by some of the things one reads, one would be afraid to receive £5 towards party expenses as it carried a degree of luggage with it.</P>
      <P>We should forget what we are told about political parties being funded in every country in Europe except the UK and Ireland.  In every democracy in the world, it is lawful, proper and respectable for people to contribute privately to the political process.  There is no democracy which decides that process is so important that no one may give money.  It is an absurdity to suggest that it should be free from private contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the right of the citizen, subject to some constraints, to which I will return, to do so with privacy.  It is not the right of everyone <Col N="513" /> to know that Deputy McCreevy gave me £100 or I gave his constituency party £200 at a given stage, because if it is made a matter of public record all contributions to political parties will be destroyed.  If every contribution is made public, one will inevitably root out those who are willing to be generous to parties.  Why should a businessman in a small midland town give £1,000 to Labour if he knows it will appear on a list and Deputy McCreevy, Deputy Connolly or I will call on him to ask if something is wrong?  We cannot have a system like that, therefore we must have some degree of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  People must be entitled to pay funds towards political causes if they wish.  They are entitled to pay to charities, gaelic football or rugby clubs, and all manner of things.  We should not put ourselves on a lower scale and decree that we should not receive private contributions because there is an assumption in the perverted minds of a few people that every contribution to the democratic process carries with it an unacceptable degree of luggage.</P>
      <P>To qualify that, I am willing to live with limits.  I do not know what sum will be fixed but £5,000 or £10,000 is enough for any individual to give to a party.  Perhaps £180,000 to one party, even over two or three years, is too much for one individual to give without there being a sense in the public mind that the person must have bought considerable influence with it.  There should not be an automatic assumption that any contribution to a political party is somehow tainted, and that people who give money to assist politicians in their democratic efforts and to parties they believe in are somehow suspect.  No one suggests there is something wrong with giving £5,000 to the Anti-Apartheid Movement and that such a contribution must be declared.  No one says that £5,000 given to SPUC or another pro-life group must be disclosed.  We should be careful about this process, because it puts us on a spiral of lack of self-respect. It suggests that the political process is different from all others and private contributions to a political party are virtually always tainted.</P>
      <P>I can say all these things because I know that, apart from the Greens, my party receives the least contributions of all the political parties in this House.  We receive less in corporate sponsorship and contributions than the Labour Party.  That may be fair because we had ten seats at the beginning of this Dáil and it had 33, but Labour should not kid itself in this respect.  We certainly received nothing from the trade union movement, not that I begrudge Labour what it receives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We receive nothing from IBEC, ISME or corporate structures in the private sector.  Every significant party operates on more or less the same basis of having to look for subscriptions from supporters and if one is looking for subscriptions one must ask people who have money rather than those who do not.  The suggestion that one should ask for a substantial subscription from those who are struggling to keep bread on the table is a nonsense.</P>
      <P>We need to maintain self-respect.  I believe that this is a House of honest men and women and that, if some people disappoint us in that standard, they will turn out to be very few.  I am willing to make the assumption that everyone in this House is honourable and committed to honourable democratic politics. I believe that, in the main, everyone who contributes to the democratic process by buying a £5 or £100 ticket for a lunch or by giving £1,000 at election time is only trying to assist this country by fortifying democracy.  None of those people should feel condemned as someone trying to corrupt a pure political process which knows nothing about money.</P>
      <P>A political process dependent upon the public purse in its entirety would be twice as corrupt as a political process that gets a little help from parliamentary activities and from other sectors.  We will never get to the point of perfection where those who have power, influence and economic wealth will not use it in some way to achieve their economic goals.  If the Minister sets up a situation on paper whereby nothing goes to political parties except through the public purse, he will play straight into the hands of those who will bend and break the rules and take the money in the back pocket to achieve political ends.</P>
      <P>Politics and democracy is an imperfect system and it requires people for diverse motives to get together. Some are protecting class or business interests, others are protecting family traditions while some come out of pure, unalloyed idealism but those people have to co-operate in parties.  They get together in parties as political movements and they have to live in a community and be resourced by it.  I do not believe, however, that the only way to be resourced by the community is to be resourced centrally by it because the naive assumption underlying that proposition &mdash; and thankfully nobody here is suggesting that &mdash; is that it makes for better or purer politics.  No political system worth its salt is operated on that basis.</P>
      <P>Any political system that has any vibrancy, self-respect, dynamism and strength, any democracy that really believes in democratic values, would not portray itself as such a pure spirit that it cannot take money from ordinary people to fund its day to day activities.  The whey-faced puritans with drips at the end of their noses who say they know better and that somehow the political system can be funded totally out of the Exchequer and that will make it honest, pure and incorrupt are the people we should really be afraid of because they are the Cromwells of democracy and we will all have our heads on the block when they come to exercise the kind of political power which such abstract theories could bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The Minister's proposal is right but phase two, which he has flagged from Minister Howlin, is wrong. I will go along with some of what I have heard Minister Howlin's Bill will contain but I also say as a matter of deep personal conviction that we should not erect standards by which nobody can thrive and which in the last analysis mean we have to accuse ourselves in public of failing to live up to unrealistic standards.</P>

High standards were set at the founding of the State by W.T. Cosgrave, followed through by the next Government under Eamon de Valera and have largely been followed since that time.

If a doctor is struck off the register by the Medical Council for misbehaviour, we do not hear those in RTÉ talking about &ldquo;the doctors&rdquo;, but if a politician is suspected of wrongdoing all we hear from Pat Kenny, Gay Byrne, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the &ldquo;News At One&rdquo; and other programmes is &ldquo;the politicians&rdquo;.  We are all brought down by this deliberate misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need journalism and investigative journalism but during my time here I have seen the coverage of the affairs of this House deteriorate both in quality and quantity.  What passes for investigative journalism was highlighted by an article last week in the <i>Sunday World.</i> Somebody sneaked into the Members' bar, took photographs and then wrote about the plush surroundings in which TDs consume subsidised drink.  I do not know if the Chair knows the price of a pint in the Members' bar but I can go to pubs in Terenure where the price of a pint is cheaper.  That <Col N="516" /> article was a deliberate distortion of the facts because it implied we were all living it up on subsidised drink.  Such misrepresentation takes place on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone think these type of articles are confined to the <i>Sunday World</i>, I was asked to serve on a sub-committee of Members to examine facilities, etc.  We sought a report from consultants on the overall facilities and they reported back to us that TDs' pay had fallen £10,300 below that of principal officers in the Civil Service in the past ten years.  <i>The Irish Times</i>, the paper of record, turned that fact into the headline, &ldquo;Greedy TDs Looking for an Increase of £10,300&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In an article in the past week the same reporter accused the Taoiseach of wrongdoing.  In the article the Taoiseach admitted that Fine Gael had received three donations totalling £180,000 from Ben Dunne, but two paragraphs later the reporter referred to the Taoiseach admitting this wrongdoing. That was insidious reporting which misrepresented the facts.  The Taoiseach did not admit any wrongdoing and was not guilty of any wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> used to be the paper of record but it rarely reports the business of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  On the occasions it reports on the committee, it does not mention any of the significant contributions made by Members, whereas the <i>Irish Independent</i> reports fairly on those contributions.  In articles by some of its leader columnists <i>The Irish Times</i> has criticised the lack of work on the part of the committee.</P>
    <P>This problem must be addressed without conflict between politicians and the news media.  Perhaps we should hold a conference with representatives of political parties and the media to sort it out because it is undermining and eroding democracy. The cynicism which now abounds about politicians is incredible.  None of my friends would consider going into politics because they know that every party in this House is experiencing major difficulty in attracting candidates of any quality to run for the Dáil.  One person summed it up for me when they said it is low pay and low esteem.</P>
    <P>If one reads the media one would think we are all on huge pay.  However, many Members, including myself, receive less pay here than we would in our original employments.  The public, because of what they read in the media, would not believe that we are prepared to make financial sacrifices for the honour of public service.</P>
    <P>However, people are not prepared to sacrifice their reputation, which is why it is becoming increasingly difficult to get quality candidates to run for any party, even where a seat is assured. That is true of my party and I have heard it said by the Leaders of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  We cannot get good candidates to stand for election, even where seats are going a <Col N="517" /> begging, because of the corrosive and continuous misrepresentation of the profession of politics, which should be one of the most honourable professions. Perhaps there should be a conference between the political parties and the media to see if we can set new standards.</P>
    <P>How can we as politicians, seeing this misrepresentation on a daily basis, agree to an easing of the libel laws for the newspapers which defame us and others?  How can we agree to that even though in a responsible democracy less onerous libel laws could be a good thing?  I welcome this Bill in its entirety but it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>However, I have one criticism to make.  Much of what is represented in the media is wrong but some of it is our own fault.  How often are there only two or three Members in the Chamber?  That is the image which is depicted on television every day.  People get the impression that because we are not present in the Chamber we are skiving and not working, whereas we are in our offices or at committee meetings.  We must stop this nonsense of sitting for long hours to address empty seats.  We must reform ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned the poor facilities for Opposition spokespersons.  I have written papers on this matter and argued that the Opposition should be given a <i>pro rata</i> allowance per spokesperson so that they are at least as well funded as the chairman of a committee.  We cannot have a situation where the chairman of a committee is treated better than an Opposition spokesperson who has to shadow a whole Department.  That matter should be addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Additional secretarial and research assistance should be available to chairpersons of committees and Opposition spokespersons.  The committees themselves should have more staffing and funding because the present level of staffing is ridiculous. I agree completely with Deputy Michael McDowell about an earmarked Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government, which is supposed to be accountable to us, controls our finances.  It can stop us investigating it by cutting off our finance, which should not be the case.  There should be an earmarked Vote.</P>
    <P>We should insist that Ministers are answerable to this House.  I have criticised Ministers &mdash; yesterday I criticised the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who is an extremely attentive Minister, for leaving the Chamber during the two hour debate on one of his Bills.  When I came into the Chamber to make my contribution the Minister was not here.  I am sick of addressing issues when the Minister is not present to hear my contribution. That shows disregard for the House.  We are wasting our time making contributions because Ministers do not feel they are accountable to the House.</P>
    <P>The Constitution states that the Executive shall be answerable to Parliament.  The Government, through the Whip system and its control of finances, controls Parliament and treats it in a cavalier fashion.  That is true not just of this Government but of all Governments.  We must <Col N="518" /> also reform that issue.  We have a great deal to do to get our house in order, which we can only do by funding committees and Opposition spokespersons and having an earmarked Vote for this House so that we are not under the control of the Government.  I have much more to say but I must share my time with my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Much of the comment about the media has been confined to the print media, which is not fair because one needs to take valium to listen to RTE these days.  I listened to Pat Kenny's programme this morning and was depressed by the time I got to the Dáil.  There were four whinging, whining items in a row.  There was no good news &mdash; one would not think we had a booming economy with the best housing in the world.  RTE is a whine-in from morning until night.  That is what people are listening to every day.  I listen to Radio 1 and I do not know if other stations are any better. Is it any wonder that people are disillusioned about politics when all they listen to is this whining? Pat Kenny had people on his programme advocating the legalisation of the sale of cannabis. If I listen to any more of Pat Kenny and other programmes I might end up using cannabis to calm my nerves.  RTE is not beyond criticism.  I am not surprised Radio 1 is losing its audience because I turn it off much more often than I used to.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief as I am sharing this time with Deputy McGinley and Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Since 1954, when I first came to the House as a junior reporter for the <i>Irish Press</i>, I have observed the workings of Leinster House at close quarters in one capacity or another.  This is the first time I have seen a member of the Government or Opposition defend the work and practices of Deputies as they should be defended and as the Minister for Finance did tonight, for which I praise and applaud him.  We have fought on many occasions in this House for the interests of all sorts of people but we have been a total and miserable failure at defending our own interests, looking over our shoulders and seeing what effect it might have on the electorate and what fall out there might be.  However, the Minister stood up to it tonight and, in so doing, did a service for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixty years ago Deputies were part-timers and amateurs, although very good and dedicated people.  Since then enormous changes have taken place, particularly the huge increase in the workload. However, the services are still archaic, arcane and virtually the same.  In regard to the question of secretarial assistance, we are now thought to be in good shape because we have a secretary each.  However, if that secretary is working in a Deputy's constituency, his or her office is vacant while the Deputy is going about his or her duty in the House.  If a Deputy's secretary is here the Deputy's spouse or family has to do the work in the constituency.  That is not a proper secretarial service.  Research assistance is non existent.  I have been a Member of this House <Col N="519" /> for 16 years and only once have I done proper research by going to the National Library and the local library to look up all the necessary sources, which is a reflection on the back-up system provided.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal wrong with our electoral system.  While we have a single transferable vote in multi-seat constituencies we will have problems, but that is a matter for another day.  The public likes the proportional representation system and will not change it.  However, if all parties got together we could arrive at a halfway house of, perhaps, half the Deputies coming from the constituencies and the other half coming from a list system which would allow them to devote all their time to legislation.  However, if we are honest, we will admit that we who are elected as legislators to analyse, examine and pass laws spend 90 to 95 per cent of our time on our constituency work because otherwise we will not be re-elected. It is of no use to be a great legislator or Minister if one is not re-elected to the House.</P>
    <P>We should also pay ourselves a decent amount. Every pay increase we get is ridiculed while everyone knows the reality that it is very difficult to get by as a Deputy without an outside income. It is time we stopped moaning about our lack of facilities and provided them for ourselves, as we have the opportunity to do.  People will respect us more for doing that than for moaning about it and saying we are not able to deliver because we lack facilities.  The end result will be a better Dáil and Legislature.  In turn we will be able to provide a better service for the people who elect us.  The Minister has taken a courageous stand.  Recent times have been bad for politicians.  The stand taken by the Minister and by the Opposition speakers will be good for democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give a minute or so of my time to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>I support previous speakers and congratulate the Minister on the courageous way he introduced this Bill in the Dáil this evening.  He has given a lead to everyone.  I will be 15 years a Member of the Dáil next February and I have never commented on the working conditions and remuneration of Deputies.  Fifteen years ago I shared a room with five other colleagues on the third floor of this House with one secretary between us.  The conditions have improved a great deal since then.  Most of us have an office of our own, and most of us have a secretary. However, there is much yet to be done if we are to give the best service possible to the constituents we have the honour to represent in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of headlines that appear in the papers, many people believe Deputies get in excess of £100,000 a year.  However, out of that we have to pay for secretarial assistance, telephone calls, even the envelopes we use to communicate with our constituents which cost £250 a month.  I spend £500 on telephone calls every two months, and all this is calculated as income for the Deputy.  I was <Col N="520" /> principal of a fairly large Gaeltacht school before coming here and the difference between my salary as principal of that school today and what I get as a TD is but a few hundred pounds.  No one comes here to become wealthy.  They come here to serve their constituents to the best of their ability.  I believe in a free press, but it should be a responsible press and tell the facts as they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Democracies are very hard to establish.  Sometimes we fool ourselves by believing that our democracy is finished.  Of course it is not.  It is an unfinished democracy and there are many tasks still to be done before we can be absolutely sure we have a true democracy.  We have an unfinished democracy as far as women in this House and on our committees are concerned. We have very low numbers of women in our Parliament, and we have low numbers of young people.  That is the most obvious example.</P>
      <P>In many ways the debate tonight is a watershed, a market about being more open about the work of politicians and the supports we political parties need if we are to do the job properly.  It is important for us to recognise that there is great disillusionment with politics, and great cynicism. Many political parties throughout Europe are in turmoil and in conflict, and the public have serious questions about how they operate.  The other side of the debate tonight, the other discussion which we also have to have is about how we can continue to reform this Parliament to make it more relevant, bring our procedures up to date so that we can take emergency motions and respond quickly to issues of public concern, and continue to reform how our political parties operate.  We must face the fact that political parties here, just as elsewhere, are moving from a culture of secrecy where power was wielded and used secretly, where patronage was heavily used, to much more open decision making and less secretive financial transactions.  We still have a long way to go.  For example, we are having a new debate on the lottery, which I welcome, but we have to be more open about where money goes, where it comes from, how financial decisions are taken within political parties and within Government.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this legislation.  The other side of it is the need for ongoing reform both within this House and within our own political parties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the principles outlined in this Bill, particularly those dealing with the indemnity, the secretarial assistants and the party leader's allowance.  Much has been said by the media about the public anger at the presentation of this Bill.  I do not know whether we should blame ourselves or the media.  Perhaps the fact that we have spent so much time reacting to what the media have said only encourages them to blow the whole thing up again and again.  Perhaps if we paid less attention to them it would be better for us all round.  Any member of the media who knows anything about the lifestyle of Members of this House would not write the kind of articles we have seen over a period of time. Unfortunately, many of the articles are written by people who visit this House infrequently and think they know everything.</P>
      <P>I am a full-time politician; quite a high percentage of the Members of this House are full-time politicians.  It would be almost impossible to do the job conscientiously without a full-time commitment to it.  I and other Members on all sides are committed to the political process and to democracy.  I make no apology to the media, to anybody in this House, in Government or in the Civil Service for that.  Neither do I apologise for fighting for the facilities to do that job.  As far as I am concerned, I am answerable to my electorate. I let them judge me at the end of each term of office.  We should not respond as we do to the media because it just feeds the frenzy.</P>
      <P>Much has been said in the media over the years about our facilities, etc.  With the exception of one or two items, the equipment in my constituency office has been provided by me out of my pocket. In the middle of September a letter from the Houses of the Oireachtas advised me that my 75 per cent allowance on telephone calls had been used up, at a time when I had already spent £2,500.  While I do not whinge about this, I will not allow anybody to suggest that I get £2,500 to spend whatever way I like.  Nor do I make £2,500 to £4,000 worth of telephone calls to my friends; practically all such expenditure is on behalf of my constituents and I make no apology for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day is fast approaching when Members should take charge of our affairs by means of an all party committee.  It should draw up a budget for what we consider necessary to provide the kind of service our constituents seek.  Civil servants should not decide that if we have a telephone allowance we should only be covered in respect of 75 per cent of our telephone calls, nor should they decide that we should only get equipment <Col N="522" /> that is nearly out of date by the time it is installed in our offices.  We should make such decisions.</P>
    <P>The electorate, not civil servants, Ministers, the media or anybody else, will ultimately decided if we have abused our position.  Unlike all others who criticise us, we must face it.  I have no reason to doubt the Minister's sincerity.  Perhaps he would take the next step and agree to the establishment of such a committee.  I ask him to consult the Whips, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and Members on this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the leaders' allowance scheme, we all recognise the need to allow a tapering system to the advantage of smaller parties.  I accept Deputy Michael McDowell's argument that smaller parties have set-up costs and other expenses.  However, the system outlined here is very unfair to the larger parties and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  I know my idea does not find favour, but the allowance set out in section 5 of £10,000 per year for ten to 50 Members should be increased to 70 or 75 Members.  We are being disadvantaged as a party.  The Front Bench has only two secretaries and very poor equipment. Will the Minister consider this aspect on Committee Stage?  I support the Bill and will support any move in this House by any Minister and from any side of the House to improve the facilities for Members, not for themselves, but to allow them to do the job for which they are elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great admiration for Deputy Quinn, but today I applaud him as Minister for having the courage and commitment to introduce this legislation.  Section 4 originated in response to my experience as a Member. I had to employ a firm of solicitors, a junior counsel and a senior counsel to defend me against something for which I was not responsible.  My party had to employ a solicitor, a junior counsel and a senior counsel for the same purpose.  What happened to us could happen to any Member and to any political party in the House.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I was shocked to discover that none of the approximately 250 secretarial assistants in the House, and employed by the political parties in a technical way, was covered by public liability or employers' liability insurance. We now have an indemnification system in place. It took a long time to establish and I thank the Minister for taking a personal interest in it.  Without his insistence, no principal officer or civil servant at any other level in his Department would have been prepared to introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of rural Deputies who do not have constituency secretaries in this House and as somebody on my party's Front Bench who has been involved in much work and technical detail over the past two years in preparing for various discussions, debates and Bills, I echo what the Minister for the Environment said on many occasions when he sat on this side of the House. He always made the point to Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil was mostly in Government then &mdash;<Col N="523" /> that Opposition Front Bench spokespersons do not have facilities available to them from a research or equipment point of view to be able to deal in as comprehensive a way as he or she would like with legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>We all realise that we do not have the back-up. We have one facsimile machine and one photocopier. I share a researcher with five of my colleagues, which is an unacceptable situation for any Front Bench spokesperson.  The Minister should look at this because it affects many Members, regardless of who is in Government.</P>
    <P>The Government Telecommunications Network, the GTN, is a tremendous facility for Members when they are in the House.  By dialling an extension we can contact directly the relevant official in any Department in any part of the country.  Unfortunately, those of us whose secretarial assistants are based in the constituency do not have that facility.  I live in Galway city. There are two Departments in Galway, one in the city and one in Connemara.  Both have the GTN facility, yet when my constituency office needs to contact them my secretary must make a trunk telephone call.  There is a huge difference between the cost of a telephone call from Dublin to a Department and from my or any other Member's constituency office to Dublin.</P>
    <P>We recently obtained the wonderful facility of Lotus Notes.  It means that Members can obtain debates in the House, parliamentary questions and other such facilities.  I invested in E-mail for my constituency office long before it was provided to Members by the Minister's Department and I have a local service provider.  Every time I use my E-mail facility in my constituency office I can do so at the price of a local call.  However, when I want to use Lotus Notes it costs me the price of a trunk call.  This places me and other rural Deputies at an enormous disadvantage. While the Minister appreciates that, principal officers or other officials in his Department do not.  All a principal officer in the Department of Finance knows about my constituency is that it is beautiful, has lovely mountains, beautiful beaches and a great place to go on holidays&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but damn all about the cost involved, including telephone costs, to a TD based in that or any rural constituency.  There is a £2,000 limit on telephone calls.  My bill last year for the telephone, mobile telephone and fax machine amounted to £6,000.  What good is £2,000 to a rural Deputy and to others who incur even greater costs? Where is the justice and the equality for rural Deputies as opposed to city Deputies?  What civil servant in the Department of Finance would be prepared to move, on behalf of the Department, to Galway city and face the huge costs incurred by rural Deputies?  Lotus Notes should be on one's local service provider and the GTN service should be provided in the constituency office of every Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> I am extremely appreciative that my secretarial assistant of 11 years who had a serious injury in this House and will never work again, because she is paralysed from her left shoulder to her finger tips, and who previously had given years of service to the party, will now be able to take a case and that I and my party and the Houses of the Oireachtas will be indemnified against it.

For example, some of us have constituency offices away from our residences and have to pay the rent on those phones out of our pockets.  It is anomalous that Deputies in areas with 5,000 or 6,000 local subscribers where the remainder involve trunk calls receive the same allowance as those in an area with 600,000 local subscribers and all the Government Departments only a local call away.  I am bitterly disappointed that this matter has not been addressed.  Many Deputies have telephone bills amounting to £6,000.  A Deputy is allowed £1,000 for personal use, is given £2,000 and must pay £3,000 out of their pocket.  They need to earn £6,000 to pay that bill because they are being taxed at the rate of 50 per cent.  It would be better to tackle it in a fair and realistic way.  Much has been done, but much remains to be done.  I know of no business people who, after tax, have to pay for expenses necessarily and solely incurred in the course of their business.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dempsey, made the point about sharing the parliamentary leaders' allowance.  While we recognise there must be positive discrimination in favour of the smaller parties and Independents, for the reasons outlined some amendment could be put in place which would give more money to the larger parties. In that regard I put it to the Minister that a <Col N="526" /> reasonable compromise could be achieved under section 5 (c) (c) which states: &ldquo;in respect of more than 10 members but not more than 50 members of that party elected to Dáil Éireann at the last preceding general election as a member of that party... £10,000 in respect of each such member,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest an amendment along the following lines: In page 6, line 22, to delete &ldquo;50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;70&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If I had my way I would not be as lenient with the Minister as Deputy McCreevy. We have no problem with the principle of tapering the allowances or with smaller parties getting an advantage, but under the proposal larger parties are disadvantaged.  The position would be improved by the acceptance of Deputy McCreevy's proposed amendment.  I am not making a formal proposal, but will the Minister consider paying the annual allowance of £25,000 to the first 15 members as opposed to five members?  This would facilitate smaller parties.  It would cost more money but I do not apologise to anybody for seeking improvements for all Members.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to accept Deputy Dempsey proposal that we increase the base figure as this would affect every party in the House and would have a disproportionate impact on the cost.  As Deputy McDowell said, in our efforts to ensure a bias in favour of the smaller parties we may have gone too far in respect of the largest party in the House &mdash; it has been the largest since the 1932-33 general election.  Subject to the agreement of the House, I will increase the figure of 50 in section 5(c)(c) to 60.  Any subsequent amendments would be consequential.</P>

In other words, the salaries of, and provisions to, staff will be dealt with in the normal way and anything above and beyond that will be dealt with separately.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I have tabled many questions over a long period on the denial by the Department of Health of a service to disabled people and those with a mental handicap.  I have received many responses to these questions, for example, &ldquo;the services are being developed&rdquo;, &ldquo;additional funding has been made available&rdquo; and &ldquo;continued improvement will be made in this area depending on the resources made available&rdquo;.  The responses to the questions I table in this regard usually refer to resources being made available.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance on 17 December which stated:</P>
      <P>...with regard to the rights of people with a disability as referred to in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 59 of 6 November 1996 by Deputy Ivor Callely, if his attention has been drawn to the totally inadequate funding of services for people with a disability, particularly people with a mental handicap; the required level of funding to meet the 1977 demands; the actual level of funding for 1996; and the anticipated level of funding for 1997.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance would not respond and the matter was referred to the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>Page 34 of a document entitled Information Guide to our Health Services refers to community based services for people with disability, including public health nursing services, home help services, social work services, chiropody, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy.  The article states:</P>
      <P>Health boards also arrange assessments of people with disabilities and are involved in securing suitable day care and residential services.</P>
      <P>Voluntary organisations provide a wide range of services to people with disabilities, including information, counselling, home, day and residential care, social work support, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> Health boards provide mental handicap services in cooperation with a number of voluntary agencies.  These services include assessment, support, day care, residential care and financial allowances.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 104 of A Government of Renewal states:</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in improving services for those with a mental handicap in the past two years.  We are committed to building on these improvements in future years, to eliminate waiting lists and to maximise the quality of life and right of participation of every citizen with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In response to the question I tabled on 17 December, the Minister for Health stated:</P>
    <P>...substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services in the period 1990 to 1996 which has enabled health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies to put in place over 1,000 additional residential-respite places and 2,300 day care places.</P>
    <P>The estimated total revenue expenditure on services for persons with a mental handicap increased from £162 million in 1990 to £250 million in 1995...  The National Intellectual Disability Database is now providing my Department, the health boards and voluntary and mental handicap agencies with information on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period. I would hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.  My priority is to ensure that provision can be made to meet the needs of those who are currently without a service.</P>
    <P>In the period 1993 to 1996 additional funding of £10.55 million was made available to develop services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap or physical-sensory disability awaiting services. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.  The Government is committed under both the health strategy document &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; and A Government of Renewal to the continued development of services as resources become available.</P>
    <P>The bottom line in all those replies is that services will continue to develop as resources become available.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not give me the standard reply I have received to date about what the <Col N="530" /> Government has done in regard to additional funding.  It only looks good on paper.  In 1996 the Eastern Health Board assessed more than 430 people as requiring residential placement.  Funding from the Department of Health allowed only 28 additional residential places to be made available in 1996.  The Minister gave a commitment in A Government of Renewal, in various health documents and in replies to parliamentary questions in regard to services for the mentally handicapped. The provision of 28 of the 430 places required in one of our health boards is not good enough.  The mentally handicapped are being denied a service.  It is also unfair to their families who are trying to cope without an appropriate service.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities made 402 recommendations.  In 1997 what funding will be required and made available to meet the demands?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of services to persons with a mental handicap, as outlined in A Government of Renewal.  As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional resources have been invested in the services in recent years.  Additional funding amounting to £56.8 million was invested in the services in the period 1990 to 1996 which has enabled health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies to put in place more than 1,000 additional residential-respite places and more than 2,300 new day care places.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new day care and residential-respite places, other priority areas have also been targeted for development during this period.  The main areas include the establishment and expansion of the home support services; the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements to more suitable care settings; the implementation of the policy document on services to persons with autism; improvements to services for persons with a mental handicap who are also behaviourally disturbed; and the provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for staff and clients who are considered to be at risk.  The emphasis in recent years has been on maximising the impact of the additional resources on those most in need and, in particular, those awaiting services.</P>
      <P>Estimated total revenue expenditure on services to persons with a mental handicap increased from £162 million in 1990 to £250 million in 1995. Details of the total estimated expenditure for 1996 are not yet available.  While I am satisfied the annual injection of funds into the services in recent years has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database is now providing my Department, the health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies with information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a <Col N="531" /> five year period.  I hope to continue the development of further services to persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.  My priority is to ensure that provision can be made to meet the needs of those currently without a service.</P>
    <P>I am not yet in a position to give the Deputy any information in relation to the level of additional funding for 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the name of the couple involved.  This matter refers to a couple who, three and a half months before they got married, notified the registrar for marriages in the county in which they reside of their intention to get married and got a receipt from the registrar stating that matters were in order.  When the certificate of registration was sent to the registrar of marriages in another county following their marriage, he said that as he had not been notified of the marriage he could not register it. Therefore, the marriage is invalid in the eyes of the State.  The couple notified the registrar, an agent of the registrar-general.  They received the receipt from him confirming that everything was in order.  It is not unreasonable that people would expect the registrar in the county in which they live would deal with their case.  The couple were surprised to learn they should have notified the registrar in another county and because they did not do so their marriage was invalid.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question on this matter to the Minister for Health yesterday and he pointed out that there were similar cases and that he was in consultation with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the registrar-general to see how they might regularise the matter.</P>
      <P>Section 32(5) of the Family Law Act, 1995 states that the registrar means the registrar of marriages for the district concerned appointed under the Marriages Ireland Act, 1844 and the Registration of Marriages Ireland Act, 1863.  It appears that the Minister does not have any great discretion to regularise the position without amending the legislation.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the couple have found their marriage was invalid through no fault of theirs.  They notified the registrar and got a receipt from him.  I am also concerned about the delay by the Minister in taking action.  This could have extremely serious consequences for this couple and others who find themselves in a similar position.  I need not go into the consequences to which this could give rise if this is allowed continue. The Minister should treat this as urgent. The marriage of this couple took place in Church in September and there has been ample time to deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the law requires amendment, the Minister should do so retrospectively as a matter of urgency to cover the couples affected by the anomaly. If the matter can be resolved without <Col N="532" /> amending the law, I appeal to the Minister to do so in the next day or two.  If he were to tell this couple, or any other couple in a similar position, that their marriage which they believed was valid is valid, that would be the best Christmas present they could get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Hanlon for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The Family Law Act, 1995 which came into effect on 1 August 1996 contains new statutory provisions relating to marriage.  Under section 32 of that Act there is a requirement on the parties to a marriage to notify the registrar of marriages for the district concerned of their intention to marry not less than three months prior to the date on which the marriage is to be solemnised.  The effect of section 32 of the Act of 1995 is that unless special exemption has been obtained in accordance with the Act, a marriage shall not be valid unless the parties have met the notice requirement.</P>
      <P>The policy enshrined in this section derives from a considerable body of sources.  It was recommended by the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown in 1985.  It formed part of the Government's Statement of Intentions with regard to marriage, separation and divorce in the run up to the 1986 divorce referendum and the merits were discussed in the Government's White Paper on Marital Breakdown in 1992.  The provision now contained in the Family Law Act, 1995, which was before the Oireachtas for consideration in Bill form between February 1994 and its passing in September 1995, was welcomed by both sides of the House as a worthwhile measure to protect the institution of marriage. The provision was welcomed by various interest groups, including the churches, prior to the divorce referendum last year.  In the Government's information campaign prior to the referendum the section was highlighted as one of the Government's measures to protect and support marriage.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Health who has responsibility in relation to the Office of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages that a number of steps were taken by the office of the registrar-general to advise the general public, clergy and registrars of the new notification requirements under section 32 of the Act of 1995.  Priority was given by the office to the production of information leaflets for couples intending to marry, celebrants and registrars.  Necessary notification books together with written guidelines for their use were provided to registrars.  This process began early in March 1996.  Notices in relation to the new requirement appeared in all national papers on 19 April 1996 and in the subsequent days in the Sunday papers, 40 provincial papers and some magazines.  In addition there were advertisement slots on RTE and commercial radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the new procedures a number of circulars have been issued to registrars <Col N="533" /> reminding them of the importance of the notification procedures and strict compliance with the guidelines.  In addition, a number of training courses for registrars have been held and two more such courses are planned for January 1996.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Minister for Health of difficulties which have arisen in the case referred to by the Deputy.  I share the Minister's regret of the problems which seemed to have been caused for the couple involved.  As indicated by the Minister in reply to Question No. 44 of 17 December, the administration of the registration system for marriages is primarily a matter for the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.  However, consultations are taking place between my Department and the Department of Health with a view to finding a solution which would deal with the difficulties which have arisen.  Every effort is being made to find an early and satisfactory resolution to the problem involved.  All avenues of approach are being considered and decision in the matter will be announced as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter because at this time when we have an excellent economy and standard of living we have a dreadful problem of homelessness not only in Dublin and Cork but in many rural towns.  I am not suggesting this problem has arisen lately because I recall cardboard boxes in doorways close to this House over a number of years.  As late as last night I saw an unfortunate person sleeping in a doorway in a cardboard box in Baggot Street.</P>
      <P>We have some excellent voluntary bodies, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others, who give the homeless soup and other assistance and they must given credit for their good work.  However, we need to monitor this problem more closely.</P>
      <P>I tabled a Dáil question on this matter and the reply I received stated that everything possible was being done.  This morning I contacted the Eastern Health Board to ascertain the scale of the problem and by 5 p.m. this evening I was unable to get a satisfactory reply.  I read an article three or four days ago by Sister Stanislaus Kennedy in <i>The Irish Times</i> which suggested there had been a 150 per cent increase in the problem and I wanted to check if that is true.  If it is, the problem is alarming by any standards.  I was not able to establish if that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Departments are involved in this area, including the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  Local authorities and State agencies are also involved.  Co-ordination of the work <Col N="534" /> of those bodies is required.  The scale of the problem must be ascertained and it must be tackled in a coherent way.  I ask the Minister to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for allowing me time to raise this issue.  It is essential that we create a much greater awareness of this growing and disturbing problem, particularly in Dublin, of an increasing number of young people becoming homeless during the year.  If we do not do something about the problem we will fast track those children into greater deprivation, prostitution, danger and hopelessness.  We must plan and put in place appropriate systems of support and practical solutions which will ensure that Irish children do not end up homeless.  It may be difficult for many people to accept that many children under the age of 12 and hundreds under the age of 18 are becoming homeless and at risk of living rough on the streets of Dublin.  Most of us only catch glimpses of those children and by not seeing them and the conditions in which they live we may forget the urgency of the problem.  We know they are increasing in number but, as Deputy Joe Walsh said, even one homeless child is unacceptable in a thriving economy such as ours.  It appears we are talking annually about 400 homeless children in Dublin, a huge proportion of whom also emigrate to the cities of London and Birmingham.</P>
      <P>There is need for a national survey to identify the numbers of homeless children and the circumstances which led them on to the streets.  We need to concentrate on the development of the local services they need and an immediate identification and increase in the numbers of emergency places to cope with them as the seven emergency places at present available are inadequate.  We know that children are sleeping in doorways, vacant buildings and Garda stations.</P>
      <P>We really must take urgent action.  Dublin is following the pattern of many other urban areas. On our streets tonight there are children as young as ten and 12, documented by agencies working with the homeless, looking for their next &ldquo;fix&rdquo; and selling their bodies to get the money they need.  A recent study of adult homeless people indicated that some 50 per cent had a history of being in care and that 20 per cent of adult homeless, as children, slept on the street.  Therefore, the adult homeless will have been the former child homeless.  If we do not tackle this serious problem, not only are we failing those young homeless out there this evening, we are participating in consigning a proportion of them to the streets in the longer term.  I hope a major initiative will be undertaken in this area.</P>

    <P>Earlier this year, local authorities carried out an assessment of the number of homeless people <Col N="535" /> as part of an overall assessment of local authority housing needs.  That assessment showed that the overall need for the provision of local authority housing had stabilised and that the number of homeless people &mdash; a total of 2,501 &mdash; had fallen slightly since the last assessment in 1993 when the figure was 2,667.  While the figure for the number of homeless is essentially a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the situation, the figures indicate that the steps being taken to deal with homelessness are working.</P>
    <P>Various measures have been taken in recent times to alleviate the problem of homelessness, the most significant being the expansion of the local authority housing programme &mdash; from 1,000 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; in 1992; to 3,500 in 1993 and 1994; and 3,900 in 1995 and 1996.  This has benefited all groups in need of housing, not least the homeless, significant numbers of whom have been, and will continue to be, provided with accommodation.</P>
    <P>The capital assistance scheme for voluntary bodies continues to provide accommodation for homeless people.  A large part of the activity under this scheme, generally between one-third and one-half, is on the provision of accommodation for homeless people.  Examples of major projects are the Salvation Army hostel at Granby Row, Dublin, the Focus development at Stanhope Green, Dublin and Simon Community projects.</P>
    <P>The level of recoupment of local authority current expenditure on the accommodation of homeless people was increased from 80 per cent to 90 per cent from April 1993.  As a result of the increased level of activity by local authorities, the total recoupment paid by the Department of the Environment has increased from £674,000 in 1992 to just over £3 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>In November 1993, the Eastern Health Board, by arrangement with Dublin Corporation, introduced an after-hours referral service up to 1.00 a.m., including weekends, to assist homeless persons after normal working hours.</P>
    <P>This time last year we announced the homeless initiative with the aim of securing better co-ordination and delivery of services for homeless people in the Dublin-Kildare-Wicklow area where the problem is undoubtedly greatest.  Arising from this, new administrative arrangements and structures have been set up to co-ordinate and streamline services.  As part of that initiative, funding was announced for resettlement services and hostel-based care and support services provided by voluntary bodies in the area for homeless people.  Dublin Corporation has expended £273,500 on these services in 1996, 90 per cent of which has been recouped by the Department of the Environment.  The voluntary bodies funded under the initiative include the Dublin Simon Community, Focus Point and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Homelessness has been one of the priorities of the Department of the Environment in the last few years.</P>
    <P>When our economy is booming, there is an obligation on all to ensure that those most in <Col N="536" /> need share in the benefits of that growth.  We can be reasonably satisfied at the extent to which the measures we are taking are making inroads into homelessness, but there are certainly no grounds for complacency.  Therefore, we will continue to keep the situation under close review, and refining and extending our response measures, as the situation demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that in answering parliamentary questions earlier this year he indicated that the Government had contributed to the readaptation programme at Irish Steel.  Therefore, he will readily appreciate our surprise when we showed the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; of the Official Report to former workers of Irish Steel who informed us that what the Minister had stated here was inaccurate, was not factual and that the Government had not contributed to the overall retraining programme.</P>
      <P>They furnished us with a copy of Labour Court Recommendation 14506 clearly demonstrating that the redundancy package recommended by the Labour Court was to be paid by the company without any financial involvement by the Government.</P>
      <P>I request the Minister to clarify what he said at Question Time when this issue was raised.  Will he state whether what he told this House on that occasion was factual because former workers of Irish Steel are extremely annoyed and drew our attention to subparagraph (d) of that recommendation which reads:</P>
      <P>The company emphasised the dire financial position of the business, the accumulated losses and the fact that whatever financial injection it received would have to sustain it until such time as it achieved full viability.  This again highlights the court's awareness that the redundancy would be financed by no party other than the company.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to Article 3 of the Treaty Special Payment where it is clearly stated that the granting of ECSC aid shall be subject to the payment of a special contribution by the member state of an amount at least equivalent to that aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the Government will make an equal payment available to these former workers, which is their entitlement under Article 3 to which I just referred, which it has failed to do to date.  Given the Labour Court <Col N="537" /> recommendation, the Minister should seriously reconsider his position and ensure that this money is made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision was taken in 1985 to pay each worker of Irish Steel made redundant a total of £3,740, comprising a lump sum of £1,400 with £30 per month over the following 18 months. In today's money that would amount to approximately £9,000, whereas the other day 3,000 ECUs were offered to those workers, in today's terms, equivalent to some £2,400.  The Minister will readily see there is a large discrepancy between the amount offered in 1985 and that offered most recently.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the Government to honour the implied commitment given to the Labour Court when the redundancy agreements were drawn up, which was that the Government would provide matching funding. Did the Minister intend to get other funds under Articles 4 and 6 of the ECSC Treaty?  This matter was brought to the attention of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, on Wednesday, 31 July 1996 at a meeting with the delegation representing the Irish Steel beneficiaries.  However, no reply was received.</P>
      <P>These workers have been badly treated and it is time the Government rectified this.  They should be given similar treatment to that meted out to them in 1985.  I ask the Minister to take these points into account in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Batt O'Keeffe for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Like my colleagues, I make a strong appeal to the Minister to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>The former workers at Irish Steel are annoyed because they are convinced the Minister and this Government have not taken the initiative to finalise this matter.  They are due financial assistance but because of the Minister's inactivity the matter has not been clarified.  Recently I met the representatives of the former workers who are annoyed at the Government's attitude.  They believe that the financial assistance they received from the EU was as a result of their own initiative and that little help was received from the Government. They also make the point that they would have been £900 better off under the 1985 agreement than they are under the agreement they entered into.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees this is an unsatisfactory situation.  After the trauma of losing their jobs, these people should not have to pursue the Government for financial assistance to which they believe they are entitled.  The Government did not put up matching funds.  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation so that this traumatic chapter in the life of these Irish Steel workers can be finally closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I reaffirm that the replies I gave in the Dáil on the previous occasion were factual. In 1985 the precedent was established that matching <Col N="538" /> funds would be provided on the basis of extra statutory redundancy.  Equally, the payments which can be made by the EU have an overall ceiling of £3,000 ECU, and that is the sum being paid in this event.  When we originally approached the EU seeking funds to assist these workers, it was only willing to pay a smaller sum. We have secured, through negotiation with the European Commission, a significant improvement in the moneys available.  Far from being inactive, as the Deputies have suggested, we have been particularly active in pursuing this case and the outcome, in terms of the numbers and the level of aid, is a significant improvement on what was originally available.</P>
      <P>This new package represents a significant improvement in terms of the number of eligible workers, the amount of aid available and the payment conditions.  Re-adaptation aid will now be available for 209 former workers made redundant in 1994, 1995 and early 1996 as a result of the restructuring.  The total funding available from the Commission will be 627,000 ECU and this figure incorporates the original 376,000 ECU approved by the Commission in December 1995. The re-adaptation aid, as I indicated, will result in payments of 3,000 ECU per worker which is the average maximum aid available under Article 56.2 of the ECSC Treaty for workers made redundant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have overseen an expansion of the service of the Legal Aid Board.  From a base of 16 law centres in 1992 the board has expanded to 28 centres at present.  The 28th law centre, at Cavan, opened for business in midNovember 1996 and a further two law centres are due to open in the near future.  This expansion ensures that the board is now in a position to provide a nationwide service.  Waiting times at each of the 28 full-time law centres as at 30 November 1996 for persons seeking the service of the Legal Aid Board are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  In five centres the waiting time was one month or less, in six centres the time was between one and two months, in seven centres the time was between two and four months, in four centres the time was between four and six months, and in five centres the time was between six and eight months.  Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action where necessary.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to quantify the proportion of family law cases handled by the Legal Aid Board in 1996 as the figures will not be available until early in 1997.  However, the board expects that the proportion will be similar to the 1995 figures when 3,918 legal aid certificates were granted in respect of family law proceedings, i.e. about 97 per cent of the 4,060 certificates granted in 1995.  Also, of the 7,306 legal advice cases handled by the Legal Aid Board in 1995, 90 per cent were in the family law area.  These percentages are similar to previous years and I am informed by the board that the situation is unlikely to have changed significantly in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal advice is available to an applicant seeking the assistance of the board in respect of an alleged case of discrimination in either the employment or the non-employment areas, where the applicant meets the criteria for the <Col N="542" /> grant of legal advice as set out in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and in the regulations made under that Act.  Legal aid is available in similar circumstances where the proceedings in question are to be conducted in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court. Also, the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 contains a provision at sections 27 (2) that enables me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make an order to extend legal aid to tribunal hearings. It would be my intention to consider the question of the operation of that provision in due course taking into account progress on the current development and expansion of the Legal Aid Board's services, the demands which the introduction of divorce will make on that service, and the Exchequer position.</P>

      <P>In reply to a Dáil question on 2 May last, I outlined the strategy approved by the Government in response to the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community and the monitoring procedures.  I made clear that members of the Government are answerable for those aspects of the report which are within their respective areas of responsibility though, of course, I maintain an active interest in the implementation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> In the main, the recommendations relating to my Department are in the chapter on discrimination in the report.  The recommendations have been taken into account in the development of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills. I hope to publish the latter Bill shortly.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations of relevance to my Department are being implemented as appropriate. For example, the gender dimension of policies is examined.  Also, a number of traveller groups have been assisted under the Pilot Childcare Initiative of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the need for child care facilities for parents with family reponsibilities to enable them to participate in the workplace and is committed to the stimulation of the development of such facilities by employers, parents and community interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> The Government has sought to address the need for child care facilities for parents with family responsibilities through a number of initiatives. I set up a scheme of funding in my Department to assist in the development of a number of pilot child care projects in disadvantaged areas. The aim of this scheme is to provide support for the provision of local child care initiatives to enable those with family responsibilities to avail of training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do in the absence of a child care facility.  To date, grants totalling £1,650,000 have been issued to 108 approved projects.  A further £800,000 has been provided in my Department's 1997 Estimate for existing and new projects under the initiative.</P>
    <P>In addition, as a result of the National Development Plan, the Human Resources Operational Programme of the EU Community Support Framework has provided almost £8 million to support equal opportunities measures, including child care initiatives, over the period of the programme.  As part of this FÁS, under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, is committing £1.5 million to child care training measures and will supplement this with support for child care facilities for its trainees.  From 1997 to the end of the operational programme, the Department of Education will devote £900,000 each year to support child care provision for participants on the vocational opportunities scheme and the Youthreach programme. The Department of health currently provides £2 million per year for pre-school services for disadvantaged children.  Although mainly targeted at children at risk, these places also benefit working parents.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for legislation governing the monitoring of child care lies with my colleague the Minister for Health.  Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. I understand that new regulations which will give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Act will be introduced before the end of this month.  There are no proposals to introduce legislation on the provision of child care.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of my Department's pilot scheme is nearing completion.  I await with interest the additional insight which both this evaluation and implementation of the Department of Health Regulations will provide so that appropriate policy measures may be drawn up to respond to any major gaps which are signalled. My Department will also seek to address related matters in this area, including the preparation of legislation on parental leave to follow the existing statutory provisions for maternity and adoptive leave which I introduced in 1994 and 1995.  While the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 are important supports for the growing numbers of mothers who are increasingly opting to continue to participate on the labour market, the availability of parental leave as a statutory right to both parents will be <Col N="545" /> an important development in facilitating greater participation in the workplace for fathers and mothers.</P>
    <P>The provision of child care facilities, as a means to ensuring equality of opportunity in the workplace, is a matter appropriate for attention in the context of collective bargaining.  Earlier this year the Employment Equality Agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, launched a valuable publication entitled &ldquo;Introducing Family Friendly Policies in the Workplace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Recognising that the traditional model of full-time carer in the home is changing and the consequent need for flexibility to achieve a better balance of work and family responsibilities, the publication identifies a range of practical initiatives, including child care supports, which can help in achieving that necessary balance.  Employers and employees can select the arrangements most suitable to the combining of the needs of business with personal responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Women currently comprise over one-third of the labour force and over half of these women are married.  In many cases, the availability of child care is a crucial factor to their participation and, as my comments above indicate, the necessary facilities are generally available.  However, they are not yet sufficiently widely available and my Department will continue to promote the adoption of family friendly arrangements in the workplace, which have been shown to be beneficial both to business as well as employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Family Mediation Service, operated by my Department, is a professional confidential service which enables couples, who have decided to separate or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances, pensions, property and any other issues relevant to the separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> Funding to the Family Mediation Service has more than doubled since 1993 from £124,000 to a current level of £300,000.  This amount is also being made available in 1997, which will enable the Family Mediation Service to continue the programme for development and expansion of the service which is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>As part of this programme for development and expansion two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator have been created, one for the existing centre in Dublin and one for the new centre in Limerick.  An appointment has recently been made to the Limerick centre and an appointment to the Dublin centre is being processed.  The persons appointed to these posts will be responsible for the delivery of a quality mediation service and will also facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of private mediators in private practice to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre.</P>
    <P>All of the above are issues which have been raised by the familty mediation service who are aware of my commitment to providing a professional service to people who are experiencing difficulties in their marriages.</P>
    <P>On my appointment as Minister for Equality and Law Reform I instituted a scheme of grants for voluntary organisations which provide marriage counselling services, and my Department commenced funding these organisations in 1994. Prior to then grants to these organisations were administered by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  In 1993 approximately £300,000 was allocated by these Departments to the voluntary organisations.  In each of the years 1994 and 1995 my Department paid out £750,000 in grants. In 1996 it paid out £900,000.  A similar amount has been made available for this purpose for 1997.  The scheme was extended in 1996 to include the provision of assistance to organisations providing counselling to children whose parents have separated.</P>

      <P>My reply to Question No. 30 of 10 December 1996 provided details, including the costs incurred by my Department, of my usage of air transport for all foreign and internal travel in 1996.  I do not consider it an efficient use of administrative time to provide comparative details for 1980 and 1990.  The Department's Appropriation Account for the years in question indicate that the total expenditure under the travel and incidental expenses subheads was £192,077 in 1980 and £490,946 in 1990.  Some expenditure on travel for the EU Presidency in 1990 was charged to the information and public relations subhead of the Department's Vote and cannot now be easily identified.</P>

The information requested by the Deputy in regard to other air travel for the years 1980, during the term in office of the late Brian Lenihan, and in 1990 during the term in office of Gerard Collins, is not readily available. My Department installed a new computer system in November 1993, information contained on the previous systems cannot be accessed in a way that would immediately identify the information requested by the Deputy.

      <P>As the White Paper makes clear, one of the most significant European security developments in recent years was the decision of the Western European Union at Petersberg, Germany, in June 1992 to become involved in tasks other than those arising from the mutual defence commitments in the NATO and Western European Union Treaties.  These have become known as the Petersberg tasks.  Since 1992, there has been ongoing discussion between the EU and the Western European Union on ways in which the EU can utilise the resources of the Western European Union in accordance with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty in areas such as humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks.  Discussion of security and defence issues at the Intergovernmental Conference under our Presidency has included consideration of the question of incorporating the objectives of the Petersberg tasks in the Treaty on European Union in the context of giving the Union an enhanced role in crisis management and peace support, in furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations.  The Petersberg tasks are in no way a smokescreen, as has been suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As for the question of armaments and nuclear deterrence, full members of the Western European Union remain committed to the concept of nuclear deterrence in the context of their mutual defence commitments.  Armaments issues have been discussed by the Western European Union since its foundation and the Western European Armaments Organisation, which is a subsidiary body of the Western European Union, is the latest manifestation of such ongoing co-operation. Ireland is not a member of the Western European Union nor of its armaments bodies.</P>

      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy does not concern the discovery of illegal uranium, rather it involves the detection on 14 November 1996 by the operator of the Greifswald facility in Germany of one fuel assembly in a supposedly <Col N="552" /> empty container.  This fuel assembly had been part of a shipment from Greifswald to a facility in the United States earlier this year.  It appears to have been inadvertently returned to Greifswald from the United States.  Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and EURATOM were coincidentally on the Greifswald site on 14 November for routine inspection purposes, and they sealed the fuel assembly, which was subsequently shipped back to the United States.</P>
      <P>The incident underlines the need for nuclear transport regulations to be respected and officials from EURATOM are in contact with the relevant authorities to avoid any recurrence.  The Commission and the member states continue to support, liaise and co-operate with the IAEA and other relevant bodies to ensure the prevention of illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and compliance with international regulations governing safeguards and physical protection.</P>

      <P>The Biological and Toxin Weapons convention 1972 prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition and retention of biological weapons.  Ireland ratified the convention in 1972 and it now has 138 States Parties. While the convention embodies the key prohibitions on biological weapons, it does not contain a verification mechanism to monitor States Parties' compliance with their obligations under the convention. Comprehensive verification systems have since been elaborated for such important arms control and disarmament measures as the Chemical Weapons convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  In the field of weapons of mass destruction, the Biological and Toxin Weapons convention is the only major disarmament measures still lacking a verification system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my replies to related questions on 30 May and 30 October, the States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons convention agreed in 1994 to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> group with a mandate to consider measures, including verification measures, designed to strengthen the convention. Significantly, the impetus for this decision included the admission in 1992 by President Yeltsin that the former Soviet Union had <Col N="553" /> conducted a biological weapons programme and reports from UNSCOM inspectors that Iraq had developed a biological weapons programme before the Gulf War.  The Deputy's question cites reports that other countries are suspected of having active biological weapons systems.  The response of the EU to concerns about non-compliance has been to establish the <i>ad hoc</i> group with the agreement of all the States Parties and to work actively for the successful completion of the group's mandate by the adoption of a Protocol which would equip the convention with a mechanism for monitoring compliance.</P>
    <P>In June 1996 the EU adopted a Common Position on its preparations for the Fourth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention which took place from 25 November-6 December 1996 in Geneva.  Under this Common Position, the EU is committed to seeking an intensification of the negotiations in 1997 and 1998 with a view to securing agreement on a legally binding verification Protocol to the convention my mid 1998.  In September 1996, speaking at the UN General Assembly, President Clinton supported the completion of the negotiations by 1998.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> group has met five times since September 1994, including twice during the Irish Presidency of the EU, in July and September 1996.  At the July meeting Ireland, on behalf of the EU, tabled six working papers to the group, the first time that EU papers had been tabled in this forum.  Over the course of the Irish Presidency, the EU's contribution to the work of the group has developed considerably and the Union has played a key role in seeking to advance the initiative.  In September 1996 the group, following strong pressure from Ireland, other EU member states and the US, decided to intensify its work in 1997 and has allocated nine weeks for negotiations over the first nine months of 1997.  By September 1996 the group had identified the preliminary framework for such a verification Protocol.</P>
    <P>At the Fourth Review Conference of the State Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons convention, the Minister for Employment and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, speaking on behalf of the EU, noted that evidence indicates that not all biological weapons programmes have been abandoned. He also noted that issues of serious concern relating to the observance of the Convention had arisen since the Third Review Conference in 1991.  The EU statement to the Review Conference called for the conclusion of the negotiations on a verification Protocol by mid-1998 and set out in detail the EU's views on the possible contents of the Protocol.  A copy of the Minister's address to the review conference has been placed in the Library for the information of Deputies.  The Fourth Review conference encouraged the <i>ad hoc</i> group to move to a negotiating format in order to fulfil its mandate.  Ireland will continue to participate in the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> group with a view to facilitating early agreement <Col N="554" /> on a legally binding verification Protocol to the 1972 convention.</P>

      <P>Ireland ratified Protocol No. 11 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on 16 December 1996.  The Protocol was opened for signature on 11 May 1994.  Over a quarter of those member states of the Council of Europe whose ratification is necessary for its entry into force have yet to ratify the Protocol.  It seeks to reform the convention by replacing the existing non-permanent <Col N="555" /> Commission and Court of Human Rights with a new permanent court.  The Protocol represents the most fundamental reform to date of the European Convention on Human Rights and its control machinery.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland signed the Protocol on 11 May 1994 preparations have been under way to ratify this instrument along with many other important instruments adopted under the aegis of the Council of Europe.  Given the complexity of the provisions of the Protocol and the need for a thorough examination of those provisions before proceeding to ratification, I am satisfied that there has been no undue delay in this regard.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday, 17 December 1996, at its fifty-first session, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution concerning the establishment of an international criminal court.  In Operative Paragraph 7 of that resolution, the General Assembly requested the Sec-retary-General to establish a special fund to enable participation by the least developed countries in the work of the preparatory committee and the diplomatic conference leading up to the establishment of an international criminal court. In the same operative paragraph, the General Assembly called upon states to contribute voluntarily to the special fund.</P>

    <P>Both the request to establish a fund and the call to contribute to it are new.

      <P>I met with Mr. Rushdie in Dublin on 11 December.

I briefed Mr. Rushdie on the efforts which the Irish Presidency has made to arrive at <Col N="558" /> a satisfactory resolution with the Iranian Government, following on the efforts made during the last three Presidencies of the EU.  While some progress has been made, we have not reached the stage where we could claim that there has been any breakthrough.

I do not accept that the critical dialogue continues due to trade concerns rather than any moral objective.  The European Union's position is that &mdash; since its establishment at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 &mdash; the critical dialogue has provided a useful mechanism for consultation between the EU and Iran on a range of issues, including the threat against the life of Mr. Rushdie, the Middle East peace process, international terrorism, non-proliferation and regional issues. The European Union will continue to take advantage of its Critical Dialogue with Iran in order to defend fundamental rights and freedom of expression, including the issue of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie.</P>
      <P>As regards membership of the World Trade Organisation, Ireland is in favour of the maximum number of countries being bound by the rules of the multilateral trading system as represented by the World Trade Organisation.  This approach also applies in the case of Iran.</P>

      <P>The definition was agreed at the monitoring committee on the employment of people with disabilities in the public and private sectors.  The committee was set up by the Government to monitor progress under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It is made up of representatives from seven Government Departments as well as the Civil Service Commission, FÁS, the National Rehabilitation Board, the Forum of People with Disabilities, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Contact with the sap from the giant hogweed plant can cause damage to the human skin.  The plant is most commonly found adjacent to rivers and streams and is a cause of some nuisance to people frequenting them.  Spraying appears to be the most successful method of control and the Central Fisheries Board has carried out some spraying and cutting of the plant on riverbanks in recent years.  Public awareness is also important, and my Department has issued public health warnings on the potential dangers from contact with the plant.  The question of whether landowners should be compelled to control the spread of the plant would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981 to 1996, list all the diseases and categories of diseases which are notifiable.  The E coli 0157 infection is already included in the category, &ldquo;Food Poisoning (bacterial other than salmonella)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department has for several years now recognised the potentially serious implications of this infection.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.</P>
      <P>A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder was issued on 6 December 1996, this time to all the directors of public health in the health boards.  The directors were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning, with a view to identifying any possible cases of the E coli infection.</P>
      <P>I have also recently received the advice of the Food Safety Advisory Board on steps to increase awareness of the infection and on means of preventing and controlling it.  I am actively considering the board's proposals but meanwhile I would repeat the advice that the infection can best be controlled by thorough cooking of minced meat and by the observance of good personal and food hygiene practices in the home and by food workers in catering and other establishments.  I would add that this advice is particularly important in the case of certain vulnerable groups and those whose immunity to infection is reduced.  The observance of this simple but very effective advice will help to avoid any serious outbreak of the infection.  I will, of course, be keeping the situation under continuing review.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The Health Research Board is the statutory body under the aegis of my Department that has responsibility for medical and related research.  I am advised that the board has no research projects on genetic engineering.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information available, I am not aware of any other agency or institution under the aegis of my Department that is conducting such research.  However, in view of the short period of time available to address this question in what is a very complex area, it was not possible to carry out a thorough examination of the situation.  Therefore, I have instructed my officials to make detailed inquiries into this matter and should any further information result from these inquiries, I will communicate it to the Deputy.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, with whom my Department maintains liaison in relation to the human health aspects.  The International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection assessed all recent published scientific literature in this area. Following this assessment the commission stated in April this year that there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur in people exposed to levels of non-ionising radiation at or below guidelines set by the International Radiation Protection Association.  According to measurements made here by Forbairt at a number of locations, the highest exposure levels in the vicinity of base station towers in Ireland are about 1,000 times lower than the IRPA levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as it relates to my Department the position is as follows.  Since 1994, my Department has provided funding for a pilot childcare initiative, the purpose of which is to assist the initiation of projects for the establishment of childcare measures utilising the skills of trained local people, to enable local residents to avail of education, training, re-training and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do in the absence of a childcare facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding under the initiative, which is limited to once-off capital grants, is confined to groups in disadvantaged areas.  These are defined as those areas where there are area based partnerships &mdash; local community groups currently in receipt of funds from the global grant for local development. The pilot childcare initiative is administered by area development management ADM Ltd. on behalf of my Department.  ADM is an independent company designated by the Government <Col N="567" /> and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies established by the Government in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 2,000 childcare places in the 73 projects which were given financial assistance under the pilot childcare initiative in the period to the end of November 1996.  Approximately 900 of these places are directly attributable to the funding provided by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the anomalies involved in Garda pensions, particularly in relation to the decision in 1994 to make unsocial hours allowances pensionable but which did not allow for backdating nor an extension to pensioners; whether there are currently three grades of pension for retired gardaí; the costs involved in making the current scheme applicable to all retired gardaí; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">

      <P>The question refers to changes made to the basis for calculating Garda pensions in 1982 and 1994, which came into effect from the date of change was made but which did not have retrospective effect to include pensioners.</P>
      <P>The first, the pensionability of certain Garda allowances in 1982 arose out of a finding by the arbitrator that a number of Garda allowances, which had previously been non-pensionable, became reckonable for pension purposes with effect from 1 October 1982.  This was accepted by the then Minister for the Public Service and by the then Minister for Justice.  Garda pensioners who retired before the date were not covered by the arbitrator's finding, and the finding was not extended to them because of the considerable additional costs involved.</P>
      <P>The second change made to the basis for calculating Garda pensions, the decision in 1994 to make unsocial hours allowances pensionable, was done as part of a restructuring agreement reached under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and was in return for agreement by Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the force.  The agreement was subject to an overall limit on cost of 3 per cent of basic pay.  It did not provide for the extension of pensionability of unsocial hours to Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total cost of applying the 1982 arbitration finding and the 1994 restructuring agreement to pensioners who did not benefit would be of the order of £6.6 million each year. I should also add that any concession in this case would be likely to have costly repercussions elsewhere in the public service.</P>
      <P>However, in relation to the 1994 restructuring agreement, I should say that restructuring deals have still to be finalised in respect of several other major public service groups and that consideration is currently being given to the implications for existing pensioners of the existing and pending restructuring deals across the public sector and in relation to pensions increase policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Pending completion of the restructuring deals and consideration of the pensions issue generally, I am not in a position at this stage to set out the effects of such deals on the pensions of all former members of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>All Departments and offices are required, as part of the Government's Strategic Management Initiative, <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, to publish a statement of strategy.  In compliance with this policy, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds prepared a statement of strategy, which was launched by me on 6 December 1996 before the management and staff of both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.</P>
      <P>The total cost of origination, printing, editing and publication of the statement of strategy for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds was £23,157.  The printing of the strategy document was arranged by the Government Supplies Agency on behalf of the registries and I understand that the printing was put to tender in accordance with the agency's standard procedures. Total costs for printing 10,000 copies of the booklet were £12,981, including the Government Supplies Agency fee.</P>
      <P>As the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds have no in-house professional publication specialists, it was decided to engage consultants to assist in the review and design of the strategy document for publication.  The script was drafted entirely within the registries, however, the layout and editorial advice were provided by the consultants.  As Price Waterhouse had undertaken extensive reviews of the registries both in the financial area and in the organisation area, including information technology, and had acted as facilitators in the drafting of the strategic plan for the registries, it was felt that they were in a unique position to provide the expertise required.  Consequently, it was decided, with the sanction of the Department of Finance, to engage Price Waterhouse for the consultancy on a negotiated basis.  The total cost of the design and review consultancy was £10,176.  Of this sum, £1,865 was for the film separations required for printing, £385 was the rental cost of transparencies from Bord Fáilte and £870 was the cost of photography and scanning of transparencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registration of Title Act, 1964, provides that fees for services shall be fixed so as to produce an annual amount sufficient to discharge <Col N="578" /> all of the costs of running the Land Registry.  The requirement to be self-sufficient is met by the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the fee income is sufficient to cover all expenses.  Projected fee income for the registries in 1996 is estimated at £18 million.  The cost of producing the Statement of Strategy, which represents 0.13 per cent of fee income, has been met from moneys voted to the Registries and will not result in any excess in spending on the Vote allocation for 1996.  Consequently, there are no Exchequer implications arising from the publication of the statement of strategy by the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.</P>

      <P>My Department has not carried out any research projects into the effects of the genetic modification of crops.  My Department has a plant variety testing programme in place and this might, in the broad context, he considered as research into the effects of genetic modification of crops in so far as varieties are the result of recombinations of genetic materials.  However, officers of my Department generally monitor the developments in science relevant to the work of the Department and this would include developments in genetic modification techniques and how these impact on the production and use of crops.</P>
      <P>Teagasc, the National Agriculture and Food Development Authority, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has a programme of research in crop production which includes some conventional plant breeding work which involves genetic modification and the measurement of the effects achieved in the form of new varieties produced.</P>

      <P>Some research undertaken by Teagasc at the National Dairy Products Research Centre in Moorepark concerning the development of starter cultures for cheese making and bacteriocins &mdash; natural products produced by bacteria which have food preservative properties &mdash; involves the use of techniques which could be considered to come within the wider definition of the term &ldquo;genetic engineering&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Genetic engineering covers a wide range of bio-technologies.  Many of these have the potential for the betterment of the lot of mankind &mdash; uses include the production of vaccines and medicines, better quality and safer food, higher crop yields and reduction in chemical use in agriculture. These are also risks in the use of these as in many other newer technologies.  The EU has enacted a number of pieces of legislation concerning the approval and condition of use of genetic modification techniques and genetically modified organisms and their release into the environment.  These take due account of the risks, benefits and the protection of consumers and the environment.  Ireland implements this legislation.</P>

Bord na gCon has no involvement in the trade.</P>
      <P>At the request of Bord na gCon, the World Greyhound Racing Federation carried out an indepth examination in May 1995 of conditions prevailing at all four Spanish greyhound tracks and associated kennel complexes.  That report was published and brought to the attention of the relevant authorities in Spain, that is, the Spanish Greyhound Racing Federation, whose responsibility it is to ensure that greyhound racing in Spain is conducted to a satisfactory standard.</P>

      <P>As part of the reform of the Com-Agriculture Policy in 1992, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was obliged under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92 to <Col N="586" /> establish the Integrated Administration and Control System, or IACS.  A specific requirement of the system was the development of an alphanumeric land parcel identification system, or LPIS, for all land parcels which are the subject of an area aid application.  The purpose of this parcel identification system is to provide the Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified and have area values and land use attributed. The deadline for implementation of the system was 1 January 1996.</P>
      <P>The LPIS operated for the 1996 area aid scheme and is currently being updated for 1997. As part of this update, some applicants for area aid have been requested to supply maps because their 1996 applications contained inadequate details of land parcels.  In the event that an area aid applicant has been requested to submit a map which he supplied with a previous application, he should notify my Department in writing or by phone and identify the townland in which that parcel is located.  My Department will then arrange for the issue of a map of the townland in question.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 117 of 23 October 1996, Official Report, Volume 470, Column 1154.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing its active involvement in the agriculture and forestry biomass network. This group is co-ordinated by Teagasc and is funded under the EU Altener programme. Representation is from the farming sector, universities and colleges, environmental and energy consultants, agricultural agencies and Government Departments.  Membership is drawn from both sides of the Border.  The group is working to identify the barriers to agricultural based biomass energy development.  The cross-Border dimension of this initiative has allowed for information exchange on both the energy and agricultural aspects of biomass development.</P>
      <P>In addition, the joint North/South energy challenge programme, which is funded under INTERREG II, allows for a cross-Border approach to biomass development.  In 1995, energy challenge supported a feasibility study proposal on wood biomass to energy, submitted by a network of groups and experts from the North and the Republic.  A new energy challenge was launched in September this year and also includes grant support for biomass to energy feasibility studies.  Almost 50 applications across the energy efficiency and renewable energy sphere have been received and these are currently being assessed.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 126, 127, 128, 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Department of the Marine, Kerry County Council has submitted details of its top four coastal protection priorities for consideration for aid under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994 through 1999.  Kerry County Council submitted proposals in respect of the following locations listed in order of priority: 1.  Waterville; 2.  Maharees; 3. Ballybunion; and 4.  Rossbeigh.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform you that two of these projects, Waterville and Maharees, received grant aid for protection works in 1995 and I approved a further grant for protection works at Waterville in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will understand that as the funding under the programme is limited to <Col N="592" /> £5.1 million over the 1994 through 1999 period it is only possible to grant aid a limited number of projects in any one year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other priority locations identified by the council I am not in a position to allocate any funding at present.  However, the situation will be reviewed annually between now and the end of the programme in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has also asked about Cromane, Gallarus and Callinafercy, County Kerry.  Given the limited amount of funding available for coastal protection and the fact that none of these locations are on Kerry County Council's priority list, it is unlikely that any of these projects will be aided.  That being said, if the local community in conjunction with Kerry County Council wish to undertake any protection works directly, I will give favourable consideration to the granting of any appropriate foreshore permissions for such works.</P>
