      <P>During the last exchange on this issue the Taoiseach confirmed that the Government had decided to go against what it stated in the programme, A Government of Renewal, that it would refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission for consideration.  His attitude is not surprising in view of the comments he made recently about the Law Reform Commission, for which he was heavily criticised.</P>

      <P>What was the outcome of the investigations into the well publicised leaks during the period of office of his Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions of the Supreme Court create a doctrine of absolute confidentiality in regard to words spoken at Cabinet meetings.  I am satisfied that there have been no disclosures of proceedings at Cabinet meetings, but, as acknowledged on many occasions, there have been unauthorised disclosures of documents, some of which may have been considered at Cabinet.  This is contrary to the Official Secrets Act and I introduced a procedure whereby departmental secretaries have an obligation to initiate an inquiry whenever an unauthorised disclosure of information originating in their Department occurs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a recent report in one of the daily newspapers about the Freedom of Information Bill, the purpose of which is to strengthen the provisions dealing with Cabinet confidentiality, the words &ldquo;the memorandum to Government states as follows...&rdquo; were used as if the journalist in question had seen it.  Did the Taoiseach have that matter investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the article in question, but what is proscribed in the Official Secrets Act is unauthorised disclosures of information. Where the Government chooses to disclose information it is considering, the situation is entirely different.  I cannot comment on the case to which the Deputy referred because I am not <i>au fait</i> with it, but if he provides me with the relevant journal reference, I will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>In response to a question tabled by me last week the Minister for Social Welfare indicated that a number of members of his policy research unit examine documents to be presented to Cabinet at his request from time to time and are obliged to sign the Official Secrets Act.  Is there any procedure whereby programme managers and the many people who see documents prior to being presented to Cabinet or while being considered by Cabinet, other than Ministers, are vetted?  In years gone by they were seen only by departmental secretaries, officials and Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every person appointed to the public service who comes into possession of any confidential information, whether it is a temporary civil servant appointed for the duration of a Government or a permanent civil servant who continues in office indefinitely, is bound by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.  The responsibility for initiating any investigation into an unauthorised disclosure does not rest with the Minister or any temporary official, but with the permanent secretary of the Department who, at his or her discretion, has a responsibility to inaugurate an inquiry whenever an unauthorised disclosure of information occurs.  The decision to place such responsibility on the secretary, who is independent of political direction in this matter, was taken by this Government and is the appropriate procedure to follow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People appointed to public office are appointed on the basis of their character, judgment and expertise and, if appointed temporarily, they are appointed by Ministers who are accountable to this House for such appointments.  Those appointees are also subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act and investigation of any unauthorised conduct on their behalf, or on behalf of a permanent official, is the responsibility of the departmental secretary, a permanent non-political civil servant who can make decisions in that regard on his or her initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of leaks from a document or of confidential departmental information, whether Cabinet documentation or confidential for other purposes, responsibility rests with the secretary to initiate an investigation into the matter.  The confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, an area to which a constitutional doctrine of confidentiality as distinct from a mere statutory doctrine based on the Official Secrets Act applies, is a matter for which I, as Taoiseach, have primary responsibility. I indicated in my reply to Deputy Ahern that I am satisfied that the confidentiality of discussions at Cabinet meetings is, and has been, respected.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 21, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I express my revulsion at the latest atrocity in London which once again has visited suffering on innocent civilians.  I again put the question to the IRA &mdash; what do you hope to achieve by such actions?  How can violence possibly make any contribution to the objective of fully inclusive all-party negotiations on a settlement acceptable to all?  Surely the record of 25 years has shown, beyond all doubt, that violence drives people further apart, thereby making successful and fully inclusive negotiations more, not less, difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> In response to a number of questions tabled.  I refer Deputies to my statements in the House on Tuesday and Thursday last in which I dealt, in a comprehensive way, with many of the issues raised.  Instead of repeating what I said then, I propose to concentrate in this reply on key developments in recent days.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that the best opportunity to renew the peace process and to have the IRA ceasefire restored is through both Governments agreeing on a specific date for all-party negotiations.  We will continue to work intensively with the British Government, with all the political parties, including Sinn Féin, and with others as appropriate to achieve that specific date.</P>
    <P>Because of the particular sensitivities involved, I trust Deputies will understand that I cannot elaborate on the two meetings that have taken place between Sinn Féin and Government officials since the Canary Wharf bombing.  These were private meetings aimed at maintaining contact with Sinn Féin and exploring all possibilities to reinstate the peace process, in particular, to secure a restoration of the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to meeting Senator Mitchell on Thursday.  This and the many other meetings and contacts that the Government have had and will have in the coming days will focus, from the Government's perspective, on achieving the objective we see as providing the best opportunity for peace and a restoration of the ceasefire, namely, a specific date for all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>In that context, we have signalled our reservations and those of the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland with regard to an elective process.  If it is established, however, that a limited elective process could provide the most straightforward route to a specific date for all-party negotiations and to participation therein by all the parties, then there is an onus on us to explore if the conditions of the Mitchell report for an elective process can be met &mdash; namely, <Col N="1769" /> that it be broadly acceptable, have an appropriate mandate and respect the three strands.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the position of the SDLP is critical in that regard.  The Government is maintaining close contact with that party in our ongoing preparations for the forthcoming summit, a date for which will be settled shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, as reported by the UK and Irish media, the horrific injuries suffered by a Dublin man in the bus bombing on Sunday night graphically illustrate that the bombs in London are a reprehensible attack on all the people of these islands?  Does he have a clear picture of what might restore the ceasefire and the integrity of the peace process?  Does he agree that Senator George Mitchell, whom I am glad he proposes to meet on Thursday, has still a prominent part to play in getting the process back on track?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in regard to the injury of innocent people in London.  Many Irish and British people are liable to be injured by bombs exploded there.  The exploding of bombs in London causes great difficulty for the Irish community living in Britain, something which does not appear to be given any weight by those who plan such bombings.  I hope they will consider this factor as yet another reason for reverting to the path of peace.</P>
      <P>In my judgment the most appropriate and effective way of restoring the ceasefire is to agree a specific date for the opening of all-party negotiations and to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve that.  In that context I agree that the assistance of Senator George Mitchell will be particularly helpful and I look forward to my meeting with him on Thursday.  I appreciate the constructive and supportive role of the United States Administration and of American public opinion generally in regard to the peace process at this critical time and in the past.</P>

      <P>Is there any truth in newspaper reports that the Governments are trying to put together a proposal which combines the three, four or five proposals on the table at this stage? Does the Taoiseach agree it is not good enough to say, as he has said so often, that all-party talks are tantalisingly close and that they must take place?  I do not want to have to read the newspapers every day to get information &mdash; there are approximately eight minutes remaining to deal with the huge number of parliamentary questions being taken together &mdash; and I ask the Taoiseach to state up front the proposal the Government is following in regard to a specific date for all-party talks and how it intends to move towards these talks? Are we talking about holding a summit before all-party talks or setting a date for all-party talks and then a summit? Will the Taoiseach outline to the House exactly what way the Government is moving?</P>

      <P>Negotiations are taking place on a daily basis with the British Government.  Last night I had a conversation with the British Prime Minister and today officials from both Governments are involved in discussions in an effort to further the proposals I put to the Prime Minister during that conversation.  The intergovernmental consultations with the British Government are confidential and it is not for me to elaborate in detail on the nature of confidential communications which pass between this Government and the British Government. However, I have made it clear that our objective is a specific date for all-party talks.  Obviously we are seeking to take into account proposals which <Col N="1771" /> may have been made by others and to incorporate as much as is helpful from them in the proposals designed to achieve our overall objective.  It is prudent and sensible to seek to take into account the views of others given that we need these people to participate effectively in the all-party talks so that they will have the desired outcome, which is agreement.</P>

      <P>Is it still the Taoiseach's view that holding elections in Northern Ireland at this stage would pour petrol on the flames?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed that view in regard to a proposal which appeared to be put to me, that the British Government might proceed with elections unilaterally in the immediate aftermath of the resumption of IRA violence without necessarily having advance agreement on the appropriate mandate, agreement across the community on the process and about the three stranded nature of the procedure.  To have proceeded unilaterally in such a way would have been to pour petrol on the flames.  I do not resile from the expression I used as it is as graphic and accurate an expression as one could use to describe what would have happened if that course had been pursued.  However, that is not the matter now being examined.  Rather we are looking at whether an elective process which respects the three Mitchell principles of broad agreement, an appropriate mandate and a three stranded procedure could provide a form of assistance to us in achieving our primary objective of a specific date for all-party negotiations to open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>Can I take it from what he said the Taoiseach believes elections could provide a positive role for all-party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are currently examining that matter and whether it does depends to a great degree not just on any one person's opinion, regardless <Col N="1772" /> of whether it is mine or the British Prime Minister's, but on the opinion of the range of political interests whose agreement is necessary if the first of the Mitchell conditions is to be adhered to, namely broad agreement.  We must get the agreement of others to that proposition. It is not enough for either Government to simply say &ldquo;this is the way to go&rdquo;.  If this is to work there has to be agreement of the parties in Northern Ireland across the community.  If it is proper and correct to look for the broad agreement of all the parties it is also proper and responsible for all the parties in Northern Ireland to seek to reach agreement on a process which commands broad support.  It is not simply a matter for the Governments alone to take the responsibility; there is a shared responsibility on everyone's shoulders, including the Unionist community, to seek to agree a procedure which will give us the objective of a specific date for all-party talks, which are the best way of restoring the peace from which everyone in Northern Ireland, this jurisdiction and Great Britain benefited.</P>

      <P>Is it still the Government's view that proximity talks should be held before the end of February and, if so, what parties will be invited to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of proximity talks, or talks in an intensified form of negotiation which allows the ready communication of messages from one party to another even though those parties do not necessarily agree to meet one another face to face, is one of the issues being pursued by the Irish Government in its approach to the ongoing negotiations with the British Government. For the reasons I have outlined in some detail in the House and to the media in Britain and Ireland, we believe this approach is probably the only practical way of clearing up many of the misunderstandings and disagreements which exist about procedural issues in term of how to get to and manage all-party <Col N="1773" /> negotiations.  There are many procedural questions of a highly complex nature which need to be discussed and on which understandings need to be reached.  The most appropriate and common sense way of doing this is by bringing the relevant parties, who need to reach an understanding with one another, into close proximity with one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the objective of the two Governments is to set an early date for all-party talks.  How does he view Sir Patrick's Mayhew's claim yesterday that Sinn Féin has disqualified itself from participating in talks because of the renewed IRA bombing campaign?  I think the Taoiseach will agree this statement would be seen as more credible and sincere if Sir Patrick Mayhew had not ruled Sinn Féin out of talks almost a year ago.  As things stand, will Sinn Féin be at the talks referred to today by the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as Sinn Féin and the IRA are associated with one another and the IRA pursues a campaign of violence for political objectives, Sinn Féin is in a different position from parties which are not associated with organisations which actively use violence for political objectives.  I think that is understood and accepted in this House.  However, as I have also indicated, official level discussions have been taking place with Sinn Féin to ascertain its views and to communicate Government views to the party.  I hope it will be possible for some time to continue with the procedure of allowing, through official channels, Sinn Féin's views to be taken into account.  No matter how much one might abhor the IRA's campaign of violence and Sinn Féin's organisational association in some way with the IRA, one has also to take into account that the party has an electoral mandate from a significant section of the community and the views of those people need to be taken into <Col N="1774" /> account if one is looking for an overall settlement.  One is seeking to find a way which enables those people's views to be taken into account while clearly showing that this democratic State cannot acknowledge the right of any organisation to wage war as the IRA is doing.</P>

      <P>For clarity in the House, while the British Government for many months sought to have all party talks while excluding and debarring Sinn Féin because of the Washington three decommissioning issue, we are now talking about all-party talks excluding Sinn Féin.  That is the position.</P>

If it stops, there is no obstacle in our view in the way of the full participation of Sinn Féin in all-party talks. Our objective is to get a specific date for those talks and that, I believe, is the best way of bringing about an IRA ceasefire. I do not see any objection, once the IRA campaign has stopped, to Sinn Féin taking part in talks.  If Sir Patrick Mayhew was suggesting otherwise I would have respectfully to disagree with him.</P>

      <P>In order that we are clear on this matter, is it the view of the British Government also, as the Taoiseach understands it, that if there was a cessation of violence by the IRA, Sinn Féin would move to all-party talks?  I am clear that is the Irish Government's position.  Is that, in the Taoiseach's understanding, the position of the British Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in earlier replies, we are currently engaged in probably one of the most difficult negotiations an Irish Government has had to undertake, against the background of ongoing violence in Britain by the IRA, violence of a kind which makes the task we are undertaking all the more difficult because it naturally inflames opinion on the other side of the Irish Sea.  Having said that, our objective is all-party talks. We want to see Sinn Féin take part in them but it can only do so when the IRA stops killing people.  The British Government also wants to see all parties at the negotiating table, including Sinn Féin.  There are discussions ongoing as to the procedures which need to be gone through for that purpose.  Those discussions are taking place between the British and Irish Governments on a confidential basis and our aim is to reach agreement in those discussions.  I do not think the national interest would be served by giving any greater detail than that.  I have indicated to the House my objectives are a specific date for all-party talks and to enable Sinn Féin to take part in them.</P>
      <P>I also must affirm that the first responsibility for ensuring the party qualifies rests with the IRA, which can and should make a decision to stop killing people.  That has no place in politics. It is not part of the political process and is not acceptable in any republic that people should be killed for political purposes. The essence of republicanism is a system which allows equality before the law and there is none if some use violence to achieve political objectives and others do not.  The use of violence is, in my view, contrary to the republicanism which I believe is essential in any democratic republic.</P>

      <P>Is it still the Taoiseach's view that Sinn Féin can speak authoritatively for the IRA?  As a result of the contacts between his officials and Sinn Féin, is he optimistic the ceasefire will be restored?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will recall, I said in this House that I believed Sinn Féin could speak authoritatively for the IRA to the Mitchell commission on the arms issue, not that they could speak authoritatively for them on every other question.  I drew that distinction quite carefully when the Deputy asked me that question some weeks ago and I am not going to change the answer I gave then.  As regards optimism, it is not for me to express feelings on this matter &mdash; my primary feeling is that the IRA has a responsibility to stop its campaign.  This campaign is entirely contrary to the interests of the people it represents and of Irish people living in Britain.  It is entirely contrary to the objectives of all-party talks and agreement, because the more people that are killed, the harder it is to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling the effect of 25 years of IRA violence.  Before the campaign of violence started, Unionist people in Northern Ireland were asked in an opinion poll whether they considered themselves to be Irish; almost a quarter of them said they considered themselves primarily Irish.  After 25 years of IRA violence and thanks directly to it, when Unionists were asked the same question in a poll, only 5 per cent &mdash; one in 20 as distinct from one in four &mdash; were willing to acknowledge their Irishness.  That shows how directly contrary to its stated objectives is the campaign of violence waged by the IRA.  It is in every sense a campaign that is quite literally self-defeating.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;History and Geography&rdquo; is a core subject for junior certificate pupils in secondary schools.  It is not a core subject for pupils of vocational, community or comprehensive schools, but 740 out of a total of 772 second level schools offer history at junior certificate level.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Education White Paper, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, the primary objective of the junior cycle is for students to complete a broad, balanced and coherent course of study in a variety of curricular areas relevant to their own personal development and to allow them to achieve a level of competence in these which will enable them to proceed to senior cycle education.</P>
      <P>The White Paper indicates that the curricular framework at junior cycle has as one of its objectives that all students, in accordance with their abilities and aptitudes, will have experienced or achieved &ldquo;a knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The curricular framework will apply to all second level schools &mdash; secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive and to all students in the junior cycle.  While the White Paper does not specifically mention the subject &ldquo;history&rdquo; within the group of subjects in the core curriculum it is likely that the vast majority of schools will continue to offer either &ldquo;history and geography &ldquo;or the kindred option of &ldquo;environmental and social studies&rdquo;.</P>

Will it remain a core part of the junior cycle curriculum in the future?</P>

      <P>It is not an obligatory core part of the curriculum in all second level schools.  It is in secondary schools.  The White Paper only mentions four core subjects &mdash; Irish, English, Mathematics, Science or Technology, and then talks about three further subjects. In theory history can be one of the core subjects.  There is a promise of modules or short courses in some curricular areas, but this has not yet been developed.  These proposals originated in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and it is timely that I, as Minister, invite the NCCA to bring forward proposals about the remainder of the curriculum choice at junior certificate level after the four core subjects have been dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long lead-in to the publication of the White Paper.  It was meant to be a definitive document in terms of curriculum choice in the future.  There is a clear differentiation between the treatment of history and geography in the Green Paper proposals which derive from advice received from the NCCA and its treatment in the White Paper.  Clearly its status has been reduced in the White Paper, and I ask the Minister to reaffirm for the general public and for teachers of history the central importance of history in the development of a broad and balanced approach.  History is a multidisciplinary subject which embraces music, literature, the arts, political history, interpersonal understanding, understanding of different cultures and so forth, and there is considerable alarm that its status is being significantly reduced.  The Minister should give far greater commitment to the subject and particularly to the practitioners involved.</P>

      <P>The title of the White Paper is apposite.  It is entitled &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, and that is what it sets out to do.  There is a specific role in it for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment which has been invited over time to bring forward proposals to the Minister <Col N="1779" /> and the Department of Education about changes in our curriculum.  I repeat, there are only four core subjects in the junior certificate as proposed &mdash; Irish, English, mathematics and science or a technological subject.  We are also looking at the possibility of changes in the junior certificate curriculum and introducing a range of full and short courses. There are recommendations from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &mdash; language and literature, mathematical studies, science and technology, civic, social and political education, arts education, religious education, guidance counselling, pastoral care, physical education, health education and relationships and sexuality education.</P>
      <P>It is generally agreed that not all these courses will be in the form of full subjects.  Some will be modules of subjects. I repeat that in the light of the concerns, raised by the Deputy and history teachers, it is timely that I ask the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to respond to an invitation from me to bring forward proposals on the new junior certificate core and optional subjects.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the certificate examinations retain the full confidence of students, parents and teachers and the many institutions which rely on them.  For this reason I considered it essential that the operation of the 1995 leaving certificate art examination should be the subject of a full independent inquiry.  This inquiry, now being conducted by Price Waterhouse, will address all aspects of the matter including how and when the problem came to light and any question of delay.  I intend to publish the report of the inquiry.</P>
      <P>I have also asked Price Waterhouse to review the appeals procedure in the case of all subjects.</P>

Not only has Price Waterhouse been invited to inquire into the matter of last year's examination, it has been asked to look at the appeals mechanism for all subjects. If Price Waterhouse feels that in order to retain confidence in the examination &mdash; and that is my primary concern &mdash; it must bring forward recommendations seeking a review or a change in the appeals mechanism, I will undertake now, without seeing any report, to put those procedures in place for this year's examination.

      <P>While I share the Deputy's concern that primary schools in some areas have recently experienced difficulties in securing the services of trained substitute teachers, I would remind the Deputy that, since I took office, I have increased substantially the number of entrants into colleges of education each year.  Furthermore, in January 1995 I introduced a special 18-month post graduate course for 180 students in the colleges of education. All this will mean that a total of over 600 newly-qualified teachers will be available for employment in schools this September, 335 more than last year.</P>
      <P>The initiatives outlined above, together with the projected reduction in overall pupil enrolments at primary level &mdash; from over 478,000 at present to approximately 444,000 in 1998-99 &mdash; will alleviate the difficulties in September and will give rise to a surplus of teachers in subsequent years.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present difficulties are of a temporary nature only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated this is a temporary problem.  Irrespective of that, will she not agree that it is totally unsatisfactory for any principal, board of management or manager to find it almost impossible to find trained teachers and to have to resort to <Col N="1789" /> students and retired teachers?  I congratulate her on the initiative she took in 1995 in regard to the graduate programme. Will she consider continuing that programme for a number of years to address this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence that substitute teachers are being increasingly used in the system.  We created 980 additional posts, 570 to cater for special and disadvantaged education and 410 to effect improvements in the PTR.  Given that more teachers are taking optional early retirement and career breaks or are seconded for in-service training, and the school going population falling at a rate of 10,000 per year, it is appropriate to plan to provide extra teachers.  There will be 335 more trained teachers in September.  More graduate teachers will come out of the training colleges in June.</P>
      <P>On the shortage of available trained substitutes at this time of the year, and if I would continue to supply graduate training places each year since I became Minister we increased the number of entrants into training colleges, the graduate training programme and the recognition of teachers from Northern Ireland &mdash; who may have been registered as untrained until the introduction of the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. There will not be the shortage of teachers or trained substitutes we are experiencing six months before an extra 335 teachers come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally unhappy with that reply.  In my constituency there are untrained teachers with yearly contracts who cannot be investigated by the cigire from the Department.  We talk about standards, but it is ridiculous that we have no way of assessing them. There is no logic in preventing people from graduating from training colleges. There are many disappointed applicants for the H.Dip. programme and so on.  I do not see why the excellent graduate diploma programme in St. Patrick's College should not continue.  Will the Minister give her opinion on the substitute <Col N="1790" /> panels which have been in operation on a pilot basis?  Is there any possibility of extending them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the question refers to management.  We have to manage our resources well. When one looks at the demographic figures one sees the striking decline in the number of children entering the education system.  There are 478,000 pupils in 1995-96 but by 1998-99 that will have declined to 444,000.  Therefore, there will be a surplus of primary teachers.  I have to be careful to ensure that we do not return to the situation which existed under earlier Administrations whereby wonderfully trained teachers could not get full time jobs.</P>
      <P>The current situation partly results from my success in retaining posts which would have normally been surplus to requirements due to the demographic decline, by creating additional posts for the disadvantaged, special education and to address the PTR.  Next September, as a result of measures taken in the last three years, there will be 335 more teachers than there would otherwise have been.  That is partly as a result of the graduate group and the recognition of teachers trained in Northern Ireland and the European Union.  We have to wait to see the effect of that on the availability of posts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the supply panel, which has been very satisfactory. There is every reason to examine the possibility of extending it which will affect the supply and availability of teachers.  The embargo on public sector recruitment has to be taken into consideration. The project was set up in 1993 on a temporary basis in Ballyvaughan, Finglas, Limerick and north Mayo and has been very successful.  The reaction of all the partners to it has been very positive and we will have to look at the possibility of extending it throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat for those who are concerned about the shortage of substitute teachers that next June there will be an extra influx of teachers, which will <Col N="1791" /> alleviate the problem.  In future years there will be a surplus in teacher numbers. There will be no need for people to repeat the post-graduate course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister that previous Administrations had a key role to play in the retention of teachers surplus to requirements.  During the time of the <i>Programme for National Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the principle was established of retaining teachers to reduce the parent teacher ratio.  The problem of substitute teachers is particularly acute in rural Ireland.  A report commissioned by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of Education, published prior to Christmas, illustrates the degree to which there is major disadvantage in rural primary education and states that 70 per cent of all disadvantaged pupils reside in remote rural locations.  It is clear from that report that in rural schools, particularly one and two teacher schools, it is difficult to secure professionally trained substitute teachers at short notice.  Has the Minister specific proposals to alleviate the problem of substitute teachers, particularly in small rural primary schools, by providing additional support and services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was commissioned by me because I was concerned about disadvantage in rural areas and there was need for re-examination of the factors used in defining disadvantage.  The report is under active consideration and I will respond in a very positive way to proposals put forward by the Combat Poverty Agency.  There will be extra teachers in the system in June.  The shortage of substitute teachers is not a Twenty-six County phenomenon; some areas are affected more than others. Under the new rules relating to teachers trained in Northern Ireland it is expected that there will be a surplus of teachers in Border areas, but I cannot <Col N="1792" /> envisage that a teacher available for substitution in one part of the country would move to an area where the problem of substitution is more acute.  I think the Deputy's question arose from concern about facilities available to smaller rural schools.  I reassure him that I share his concern.  I will soon be in a position to bring forward proposals as a positive response to the need for such facilities, recognising in particular the difficulties in small rural schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred repeatedly to Northern teachers working here.  Has she proposals on how the Irish language will be retained as part of the primary level curriculum, particularly in small schools, in circumstances where teachers have no proficiency in the Irish language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have wandered away from the question of substitution. I remind the Deputy that last year I announced that teachers trained in the primary school system in Northern Ireland, or in the EU, who have recognised qualifications may become involved in the school system here for two years while completing the scrúdú cáinníochta sa Ghaeilge.  These people will have to receive a qualification in Irish.  Under the present system of substitution teachers who hold qualifications outside the State are paid as unqualified teachers.  It is difficult to say how many teachers will take part in this scheme.  We imagine it will be availed of more in the northern counties than in the most southern countries.  There is an obligation on teachers who move into the Irish system to obtain a qualification in Irish.  Details of the scheme are being worked out and will be made available.</P>

      <P>I have approved the provision of a new vocational school in Milford.  The first two stages of the architectural planning and design process have been completed and my Department received a developed sketch scheme under stage 111 of the architectural planning process on 1 February. This submission is currently being examined by the technical staff in my Department.  On completion of this evaluation my Department will be in contact with County Donegal Vocational Education Committee.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware of the appalling conditions in the vocational school in Milford.  Deputations have visited various Ministers concerning that school, which is commonly known as a cardboard jungle because of the number of prefabricated buildings.  Given that the architect's report has been issued to the Department, what is the current hold-up with the work?  It is important that it is carried out as quickly as possible.  Is the Minister aware of any problem with the architectural plans that issued to her Department?  If they are in order, when will it be possible to send the contract to tender?</P>

      <P>I received from the community in Milford very good photographic evidence of the condition of the school.  For many years Ministers met deputations from Donegal about this matter.  I was delighted to be the Minister who in early 1994 agreed that the problem should be resolved.  I agreed to the building of a replacement vocational school for 500 pupils and that the Loreto College would be redesignated as a community school, possibly within this year.  The sketch has been sent to the technical staff whose job it is to inform the Department of problems, but I have not been alerted of any such problems. Earlier problems involving cost limits and submissions were ironed out.  I expect that within the next month or two a full report will be available and if there are any problems we will revert to <Col N="1794" /> Donegal vocational education committee.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the arrangements, if any, that are in place to ensure that there is proper liaison between boards of management of primary schools and her Department to ensure an adequate number of places are available for pupils in the immediate catchment area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>While the enrolment policy for primary schools is a matter for the board of management of each school, schools will cater for their immediate areas in the first instance.  If, after that, places remain available, schools may enrol pupils from outside their areas should there be a demand. Where more than one school caters for an area or parish, it is expected that such schools will liaise to ensure that all pupils can be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 3,200 primary schools in the State.  Individual schools alert my Department where the question of the provision of additional accommodation <Col N="1795" /> arises or alternative arrangements need to be made to accommodate pupils.</P>
    <P>My Department liaises with local authorities and school patrons, particularly in large urban areas where major housing developments may lead to the need to provide new schools or extensions to existing schools.</P>
    <P>I have announced the setting up of a Commission on School Accommodation Needs, as proposed in the White Paper on Education.  This commission, which will commence operation shortly, will provide detailed information on current and projected positions in relation to school provision as part of its remit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister told us that nobody had responsibility for planning and there was no direct liaison between the Department of Education and boards of management?  Such a lack of liaison has led to a position in Carysfort national school, of which the Minister may be aware.  In that school 80 students, of whom 46 were eligible for enrolment as they came from the immediate catchment area, had to be turned away.  Is it the case that unless a board of management approached the Department of Education the Department did not have a role in planning for the provision of school places?  That is an extraordinary way for the Department to behave.  A commission is not needed as the Department should be responsible for forward planning for the schooling of our children.  Will the Minister accept that there is an onus on the Department to liaise directly with boards of management to ascertain what will happen in the future?  The Department should ascertain if members of those boards are aware of what is happening in their catchment areas and if it is likely that a particular school will be overcrowded.  I have given an example of overcrowding in a school in my constituency, which is typical of the position in many primary schools.  In that case there did not appear to be a process whereby the board of management of that school <Col N="1796" /> could liaise with the Department of Education or <i>vice versa.</i> That situation cannot continue, irrespective of whether a commission is set up to review the availability of school places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the ownership of these schools does not lie with the Department of Education but with the school patrons.  To date planning for the provision of school places has been undertaken in partnership.  A total of 3,200 primary schools operate under the Department.  In general, as the boards of management of those schools plan for the provision of school places and the need of their catchment area they put forward their proposals to the Department, although that did not happen in the case to which the Deputy Keogh referred.  Sometimes their needs are resolved by the short-term provision of prefabs or the sharing of accommodation between schools in a neighbourhood. In some cases a new school or an extension may be required.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a trend in the Dublin area.  Some Deputies who were members of local authorities opposed some development plans when they were drawn up.  An Bord Pleanála stated that a school development was required because schools in the area were already full.  It is ironic that a person who opposed that development finds herself in Marlborough Street and realises the need for that particular school development as the other schools in the area are full.  Local authorities grant permission for major developments. The provision of school places is as important as the provision of water, sewerage and traffic lights.</P>
      <P>Given that the population in primary schools is falling dramatically and excess accommodation will be available, there are other needs for education property. It is timely that the proposed commission should address the provision of places given our demographic trends. Our system is being managed to address those demographic changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that nobody in the Department of Education has responsibility to establish the capital expenditure needed for primary schools in the light of emerging trends or to approach local authorities or boards of management of schools?  Is there nobody in that Department with responsibility to determine what will happen in the future and whether in the short or long-term additional school accommodation will be needed in particular areas?  It is amazing that nobody has that responsibility in a Department with such a large budget and that it is necessary to establish a commission to determine what will happen in the future.  Will the Minister agree that some unit in the Department should have responsibility for forward planning?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how we plan for the future.  We do not plan without reference to our partners.  Planning for school places is done on a partnership basis with those who own the school buildings.  There is a responsibility on the Department to respond to requests for additional accommodation, but there is also a responsibility on the Department to ensure that because the primary school population is dramatically declining it does not invest in large buildings that will not be needed, especially in areas of low population. The proper approach is to assign planning to a group which will take an overall view of the position.  Education boards will have a particular role to <Col N="1798" /> respond to regional needs.  As I suggested, the Department should be decentralised to deal adequately with the daily needs of our 3,200 primary schools.  Deputy Keogh implied with great indignation that the Department should know how many children are in our primary schools.  However, it is not possible to plan properly for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals for the education boards will be brought forward and they will have a responsibility for planning provisions for their regions.  One of the tasks of the proposed commission, which is about to commence its business, will be the proper planning of school accommodation into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not for the first time today we have had a clear illustration of the need for a serious review of management structures within the Department of Education.  The Minister admitted to gross incompetence in the manner in which the Department does its business.  The Minister's suggestion that somehow local authorities are responsible for the delay in proceeding with the construction of school buildings is outrageous.  The experience of Members is that local authorities have been amenable to the provision of sites and that such delays are occasioned by her Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the commission the Minister mentioned appears to be the closure of schools, particularly in rural areas, whereas a proper planning system should be devised for accommodating children in primary schools, their basic constitutional right.  It is extraordinary that the Minister suggests that no such system exists, that she has no role to play in the provision of primary school places or for the proper transfer of primary pupils into second-level.  As recently as last week I raised on the <Col N="1799" /> Adjournment another incident in Cork last year.  It appears to me the Minister is waiting for disasters to happen, after which she will announce the establishment of commissions or review procedures, that we must all await their conclusions and, in the meantime, cannot ask any questions.</P>

      <P>I presume Deputy Michael McDowell tabled this question because of the serious pupil-school position in Dublin South-East.  It seems very strange that her Department is not investigating demographic changes as a huge number of families have moved into our constituency on both sides of the Grand Canal and constituents approach us saying they cannot obtain places for their children in local schools because they are all full.  Last week I was approached by a group of residents who wanted to set up their own school and were endeavouring to find a suitable premises.  Yesterday I received a letter from Charlemont Community Association informing me of the closure of St. Kevin's School, Grattan Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the question tabled by Deputy Michael McDowell because I assume he is experiencing the same frustration as I am.  Surely the Minister's Department asks school authorities whether there is a huge demand for places in their school and, if so, how we can help to relieve it? I warn the Minister that the position will become worse as greater numbers of people move into areas both sides of the Grand Canal.  I hope as a result of the wonderful policy document launched <Col N="1800" /> yesterday on Georgian Dublin, that more families will move into the area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister admitting that no unit or individual within her Department is responsible for advance planning in the provision of school places?  Does she also admit that no one within her Department is aware of new housing developments that may comprise new catchment areas or lead to extra student requirements within them; that nobody within her Department has any idea of what will happen in future despite the fact that the Department provides the requisite capital for new buildings or extension of existing ones? Is the Minister telling us that within her Department nobody has that responsibility, that she is now establishing a commission?  She is talking about never, never land, about the future rather than the immediate needs of children already in school or those who cannot gain admission at this time?  Is the Minister admitting that nobody in her Department is charged with the responsibility of planning for our children's education?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a most competent planning section within my Department which liaises with owners/patrons of schools.  I must repeat &mdash; and I cannot read Deputy Michael McDowell's mind, perhaps Deputy Keogh can &mdash; that there has been much rezoning of land throughout County Dublin in addition to migratory movements within the Grand Canal region and that local authorities and councillors can give permission for large scale development within those areas wheneyer existing schools are full.  I must <Col N="1801" /> stress that because lack of such permission caused the problem.  We do liaise with local authorities &mdash; who were told at the time that schools were full &mdash; that, if and when permission is sought for that size of development, the needs of those children growing up in such areas would have to be met, which condition was dismissed in the most cavalier fashion.  I must point out that, on my assuming office many years later I discovered there were no school places for four-year-old children in need of them in local parishes.  Of course, we can all use our local experiences as examples but my Department investigates problems, liaising with our planning section and the patrons and owners of schools, when we may agree to extensions, new buildings, the erection of pre-fabs or sharing with other schools within the area.  That is how school accommodation needs have been dealt with.  I must repeat that huge demographic changes are taking place and, knowing what will happen, it is only right and proper that we plan for future needs. That does not mean, as Deputy Martin appears to think, my Department will rationalise schools out of existence.  This is the year of life long learning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A decision in principle has been taken to extend maintenance grants to approved courses being followed by Irish students in Great Britain which effect from the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements to give effect to this are being drawn up in my Department at present.  The necessary changes will be detailed in the 1996 student support schemes together with any other amendments that may prove necessary in the light of the normal ongoing review of the schemes.</P>
      <P>In line with the practice in recent years, I expect the schemes will issue to the local authorities and Vocational Education Committees by early May.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many parents are asking questions on that issue?  A full year having elapsed since January 1995 when she announced that Irish students attending courses in Great Britain would be entitled to maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme, does the Minister agree that those contemplating pursuing such third level courses in Great Britain next year should be given some indication now of the type of courses deemed eligible for maintenance grants or support from this State?  It is getting late in the day and decisions have to be taken which involve expense for many people. People are endeavouring to make that decision based on firm knowledge.  If their son or daughter selects a particular course at a college they want to know whether it is eligible for funding.</P>

      <P>I take the points made by the Deputy but the budget provided that maintenance grants would apply from the academic year 1996-97, which begins in September 1996.  We are working on the scheme and recently we have been able to bring forward details of all schemes.  A parent whose child is planning to go to college here or abroad has an interest in the scheme.  The Minister for Finance said, it is also intended that maintenance grants, under the higher education grants scheme, will be extended to approved courses being followed by Irish students abroad, with effect from the 1996-97 academic year. I accept the points made by the Deputy and I will come forward with further information on maintenance grants for those who qualify as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it is too late because it is always the position that students do not know the results of their examinations and yet plan and take out different options when completing application forms.  The Department, with the Higher Education Authority, will submit its proposals to me on the mechanism for approval of courses. I will certainly ask the questions which were asked in the House but I expect the information will be available.  The information concerning maintenance grants is available each year regardless of whether a student is studying in Ireland or in Northern Ireland and will be available earlier this year &mdash; in May &mdash; than under previous Administrations. That is well in advance of taking the exam in which they will seek to have the qualification to take up one of the <Col N="1806" /> options chosen.  In completing application forms students have many options and I note the comments made here today.</P>

      <P>The National University of Ireland is an independent autonomous body.  My Department has no function in relation to the academic requirements for entry to its courses. These are set by the Senate of the University.</P>
      <P>I understand that the university sets requirements to take account of the secondary school programme; the level of attainment needed in general for the purpose of a university education and, specific subjects needed in the students' previous education if they are to successfully take university level courses in the subject chosen.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that these requirements result in unfair treatment for students.  However, if the Deputy has specific concerns, they would need to be raised with the NUI.  I would be happy to have them conveyed to the NUI on her behalf</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Students who have linguistic abilities have an advantage in gaining access to the NUI.  I wish to draw to the Minister's attention that for point purposes one can only aggregate six subjects.  It is unfair that those who are weak at languages are compelled to take as many as nine subjects in their leaving certificate.  Students can be excellent in other disciplines such as technical, business and science subjects. One could be an E student in honours maths and yet not have the ability to pass, perhaps, German.  Because of that students are excluded from NUI colleges. I have serious concerns in this * regard in that many students are excluded from admission to the NUI because they cannot fulfil the three language requirement.  To facilitate students will she allow them &mdash; particularly as there is now a transition year <Col N="1808" />&mdash; to take subjects, such as a foreign language, and, perhaps, Irish, in the fifth year of the course so that they can then concentrate on the six subjects for the leaving certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern but the Department of Education has no function in academic requirements for entry to those in the Senate of the University, that is, University College Dublin, University College Cork and Maynooth College.  The NUI language requirements are stricter in those colleges than in Trinity College, Dublin and Dublin City University.  The requirements in the University of Limerick are even stricter.  All that information is available but we are careful to allow the academic autonomy of the universities to be retained and standards for entry to be set by themselves.  In regard to the Deputy's second point about taking subjects in an earlier year, examinations are set following a two year programme and the transition year is not taken with examination subjects, <i>per se</i>, in mind.  It is a programme which has been put in place to allow the student to mature outside the examination programme. The transition year is important and has been monitored by the Department to ensure it is not abused.  The leaving certificate is set to be taken by students who have completed two years in each of the subjects.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the interests of the student should be a priority rather than the autonomy of the NUI?  I know students &mdash; and I am sure the Minister does &mdash; who had sufficient points to do disciplines in the NUI but because they did not satisfy the three language requirement they could not undertake such disciplines? Will the Minister accept that is a basic inequality within the system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat, the Department has no function in this matter. The standards set by the Senate of <Col N="1809" /> the NUI are different from the requirements of Trinity College and Dublin City University but the University of Limerick, which we have not mentioned, requires three languages, Irish, English and another language.  If the Deputy is asking me to convey her concerns to the NUI, I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she does not have any role in this matter yet she is telling universities the number of external members they should have on their governing bodies.  That suggests the Minister is obsessed with structures as opposed to the real meat of education, namely, curriculum and equality in education.  Given the high failure rates, for example, in French and Irish at leaving certificate level, this requirement is an impediment to people accessing third level education.  I do not accept the Minister's view that she does not have a role in this regard.  At the very least she should review the matter and make recommendations to the NUI because in an earlier document formulated by the Minister on reform of the university sector, she proposed the abolition of the NUI which, due to representations, she changed in subsequent documents.</P>

      <P>In an effort to be helpful, the Government is working on its adoption Bill which is mainly concerned with dealing with the implications of the Keegan judgement.  I expect that Bill will be ready in the first half of this year.  Obviously it will take into account any other adoption matters that might arise.  It is very important that the Deputy should realise that great care needs to be taken in drafting legislation governing adoption.  There have been many controversies and legal difficulties, causing a great deal of trauma for children and parents arising from legislation that may not have been as comprehensive as it ought.</P>
      <P>Adoption legislation is not necessarily a good subject in which to produce quick and easy solutions in response to particular events.  It is important that this Bill is properly and carefully drafted.  The Government is taking account of the concerns which the Deputy has expressed.  If the Deputy wishes to advance his own Bill there is nothing stopping him getting his party to agree that the Bill be taken in Private Members' time this evening or any other evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the years to come this Bill will be seen as landmark legislation in much the same way as the Wills Act, 1837.  Society is changing.  Above all, average life expectancy is increasing. There will be, therefore, an ever increasing higher incidence of the elderly who fear that their mental powers may be failing and wish to make sensible provision for such an eventuality.  In addition, people injured in accidents may suffer brain damage as a consequence.</P>
      <P>People should consider drawing up enduring powers of attorney in the same way they draw up a will.  Neither operation is painful or expensive, but in both instances is of enormous benefit to families. The need for this legislation arises from the fact that the power of attorney is automatically revoked when the donor becomes mentally incapable.  This is a ludicrous provision because it is when a person becomes mentally incapable that this power is necessary.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease which, I gather, affects approximately 25,000 people in the country.  As a consequence, many elderly people are anxiously awaiting the enactment of this Bill so that they can proceed to execute an enduring power of attorney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In processing this legislation the objective must be to ensure simplicity and keep associated costs as low as possible. While the principal objective of the legislation must be simplicity, safeguards are necessary to ensure that the elderly are not manipulated and that the person exercising powers of attorney does not abuse the positions.  In general, the Bill strikes a fine balance between those objectives and I welcome its broad <Col N="2009" /> approach.  Its provisions can be fine tuned on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>While it may not be very expensive to employ a solicitor to draw up an enduring power of attorney, that will not be the only cost involved.  I am concerned about the overall cost structure.  The Bill provides that an application for registration must be made to the High Court which could be prohibitively expensive. Will an application to court be necessary in all cases?  The Bill provides that notice should be given to various parties prior to registration.  While that is the correct approach, would an application to the registrar of wards of court after the issue of notices be sufficient?  From the point of view of cost, this option should be explored.  If the registrar of wards of court was dissatisfied or if an objection was raised, the matter could then be referred to court.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to deal with the matter in the High Court?  This would involve more expense than if it was dealt with in the Circuit Court?  Will the Minister examine the possibility of giving jurisdiction in this regard to the Circuit Court?</P>
    <P>Where possible people should register powers of attorney while in full health.  If they make arrangements to have their affairs managed by another person if they become incapacitated, the person making the arrangements should be entitled to take whatever steps are necessary.  Why must the donee apply for registration?  The possibility of a dual system should be considered.  This would allow the person giving the power to apply for registration or, if there were evidence of mental incapacity, the attorney could make such application.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister can make regulations covering many of the major characteristics attached to the power of attorney.  It should be possible to tease out the regulations on Committee Stage because they are as relevant as the Bill.  A number of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations will be included in the regulations rather than in the Bill and the manner in which they <Col N="2010" /> will be implemented should be discussed on Committee Stage.  If the Bill passes through Committee Stage and regulations are subsequently published and circulated, they will probably never be discussed, which would be unwise.  I am sure all Members want to put in place legislation that will not give rise to unnecessary litigation or dissatisfaction and the best way to ensure that is to hold a comprehensive Committee Stage debate that includes discussion on the regulations.</P>
    <P>The State should encourage people to exercise power of attorney if they believe it is necessary.  It is understandable that people in the initial stages of mental incapacity would be reluctant to have their affairs aired in public.  This is an important aspect of the Bill because such matters could be publicised in a number of ways.  Applications to court should be held in private and not reported.  In its latest submission on this legislation the Law Society stated: &ldquo;It is especially important to prevent the publication of details of the donor's mental health or his or her wealth&rdquo;.  It would be regrettable if people were reluctant to use the sensible powers available under this Bill because of the danger of publication of details of their personal affairs.  I am sure most people would not want details of their mental state or wealth published. While the Ethics in Public Office Bill places an obligation on those in the public arena to publish details of their interests, others should not be forced into that position.</P>
    <P>Under section 11, the Bill provides that on registration members of the public may inspect the register free of charge.  Will this give rise to the publication of details of powers of attorney in newspapers which at present is the case in respect of wills, details of which are frequently published in a ghoulish fashion?  If an attorney proposes to sell a property under such power, the solicitor for the puchaser must be able to ensure that the power of attorney is being exercised properly and that the necessary steps have been taken in <Col N="2011" /> regard to registration and so on.  Will this allow newspapers to publish details of such registration in a ghoulish fashion?  Solicitors must be able to protect the interests of third parties and the Minister should include a measure to prohibit such publication.  That would strike the correct balance.</P>
    <P>While in order to protect those dealing with attorneys the register must be open to the public, people may be inhibited from exercising such powers if they believe the details would be published in newspapers.  I strongly suggest that the Minister give consideration to such an approach.</P>
    <P>We are talking about private citizens making private arrangements about their private affairs for the benefit of their families. This is not any business of the media, yet some newspapers poke their noses into the registrations and publish them.  They attempt to justify their actions by telling us this is in the public interest.  Newspapers should be prohibited by law from doing this. Given the comments made by them about the attendance in the House and the interest among Deputies in various debates, I am sorry no member of the media has sufficient interest in the Bill to be present to listen to the debate. This may be an indication of the interest of the media generally in law reform.</P>
    <P>The Bill is landmark legislation.  I do not freely give plaudits to Ministers but I compliment the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on bringing this important legislation before the House. Prior to Committee Stage I will raise the issues put on paper by the Law Society, for example, the areas in which the Bill might run into difficulty.  The purpose of Committee Stage debates is to ensure that all difficulties are ironed out.  I look forward to that debate and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the points made by Deputy O'Keeffe about privacy etc.  If the Minister does not table amendments to incorporate the <Col N="2012" /> necessary changes in this regard then Members on this side of the House will do so.  I look forward to Deputy O'Keeffe's support for these amendments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is the culmination of a public campaign by a number of interested organisations representing the aged and people who suffer from various mental ailments.  The campaign has not been the raucous aggressive type of campaign of which we have seen too many examples in recent times; rather it has been a gentle campaign. We were contacted from time to time by various organisations who gently reminded us of the need to deal with this lacuna in the law.  The Government subsequently referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission who put forward detailed proposals which by and large are reflected in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at present to create a power of attorney which will survive the mental incapacity of the donor and the Bill is largely designed to fill that lacuna in the law.  Some speakers referred to our ageing population and Deputy Woods pointed out that up to 25,000 people suffer from Alzheimer's disease while approximately 28,000 were referred to the psychiatric services during the last year for which figures are available.  The phenomenon of an ageing population and an increase in the number of people suffering from senile dementia is not confined to Ireland. Other countries have responded to the economic pressures created by this phenomenon by privatising services for the elderly.  When looked at from one point of view there is an element of privatisation in the Bill.  When we were in office the State assisted in the privatisation of part of the care for the elderly by introducing the nursing homes subvention regulations.  These regulations have been grossly abused by private nursing home owners who simply jacked up the price for patients who were given a subvention.  It is little wonder that applications are made to Limerick <Col N="2013" /> County Council and Limerick Corporation every day of the week for new nursing homes.  Obviously there is money in this and the State is swelling the private bank accounts of some of those people.  While I would not go as far as my ex-colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and describe them as &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; nevertheless it must be said that the standard of care provided by many nursing homes is much less than what it should be or what we would expect.  The supervisory mechanism is also far from adequate and I ask the Minister to take up the matter with the Minister for Health, who I am sure is already aware of the situation but should be reminded of it again.  I will take the opportunity to remind him of this on every occasion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the culmination of a public campaign conducted over a number of years.  The matter was referred to the Law Reform Commission who took time to study it and put forward proposals which have culminated in this Bill.  Despite the fact that this work has been going on for some time or that this specific problem, which has been around for a long time, can be solved in a certain way, it is not clear when the legislation will be brought into operation. I read carefully the Minister's speech but I am still unclear as to when it will come into operation.  A number of organisations, particularly my local branch of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, have been in contact with me but I could not give them an approximate date as to when the legislation will come into operation.  Section 1 (2) merely states that the legislation will come into force on such day or days as the Minister shall appoint.  There is no time scale and the Minister does not set out a definite period within which he will be compelled to act.  The situation is exacerbated by the peculiar provision in section 5 (2) which deals with regulations on matters which are absolutely central to the Bill and how it will operate in practice.  It is clear that these regulations will have to be introduced, <Col N="2014" /> yet the section merely states that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; make provision.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the Minister's speech whether the regulations will be introduced at the same time as the Bill. The regulations deal with matters of such fundamental importance as the format of the enduring power of attorney and the involvement of doctors, solicitors etc. at the time of the execution of the power.  These matters should be part of the Bill and subject to scrutiny by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We seem to be dealing with the legislation largely in a vacuum.  It is undesirable that regulations which will form a central part of the legislation should be introduced at some indeterminate time in the future without any scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It will be impossible to bring the Bill into effect if the regulations are not in place.  If the Minister envisages bringing the Bill into effect without the regulations, what will be the format for an enduring power of attorney?  Presumably the people who create an enduring power of attorney and their legal advisers know what they want to create and it will be intolerable if disputes can subsequently arise in the courts as to whether it was an enduring power of attorney.</P>
    <P>That will be provided for by regulation, although the schedule to the Bill contains a format for a general power of attorney.  If such a format can be written into the legislation, why can not one for an enduring power of attorney?  That is incomprehensible.  Also, central matters &mdash; such as the involvement of doctors, solicitors, etc. so that people know and appreciate the effect of what they are doing &mdash; will be provided for by regulations which we have not seen and may be expected to pass the Bill without having seen.  That is intolerable and to a large extent it means we are debating this Bill in a vaccum.  Will the Minister say why these important matters are being left to be dealt with by way of regulation?  When will they be introduced? Will they be available simultaneously with the Bill?  Will they be <Col N="2015" /> ready for Committee Stage to be scrutinised by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in the same way that less important sections will be scrutinised line by line and word by word?</P>
    <P>The following is another example.  In his opening contribution the Minister emphasised the importance of certain people getting notice of the creation of the enduring power of attorney to prevent spurious objections at the point of registration.  That is a valid point and the Minister is acting on experience in other countries where such spurious objections have held up unnecessarily the registration of enduring powers of attorney.  When we ask what people are to be notified, we find they will be specified by regulations which we have not seen.  This means the Bill will be incomprehensible without those regulations being put in place and being available at the same time as we are debating this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said those entitled to get notice of the creation of a power of attorney would largely correspond to those entitled to notice when application for registration was made.  I can understand a time lag between execution and registration of the power of attorney &mdash; it could be many years and people may die or disappear in the meantime.  However, as regards the categories of people who are entitled to be notified on both occasions, I cannot understand why there should be any differential between the category of people to be informed on one occasion and those to be informed on another.  I cannot comment any further because I do not know who must be notified at the time of execution or of registration, since that is also to be provided for in regulations we have not seen.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) deals with people who are not entitled to be appointed as enduring attorneys or to get enduring powers of attorney, which appears to be confined to bankrupts, people under the age of 18 and nursing home owners in which the donor of the power of attorney is a patient.  It seems that if a <Col N="2016" /> person does not fall into one of those categories he is perfectly entitled to be appointed and to be given enduring powers of attorney, which is effective management of the estate of someone who becomes mentally incapable.  We can take it that criminals, fraudsters, people disqualified from acting as company directors and those convicted of horrendous crimes are all entitled to be given enduring powers of attorney, once they are not bankrupt.  The legislation should prevent those convicted of certain categories of criminal offence from being given those substantial powers of management and control over the property of a person who is mentally incapable of managing his or her affairs.</P>
    <P>The legislation goes on &mdash; in a provision probably included after the initial Seanad debate &mdash; to provide that if a person after being given an enduring power of attorney becomes bankrupt, his position as attorney automatically lapses.  What of those in the other category? If a person is given an enduring power of attorney and subsequently becomes the owner of the patient's nursing home after the power has been executed, what happens then?  Does he stay in that position although he was not fit to be appointed in the first place?  It is quite easy for nursing home owners to get around the Bill as drafted.  A person can set up a private company to own a nursing home and be the majority shareholder in the company, which drives a coach and four through the intended prohibition in section 5 (3).</P>
    <P>The present lacuna in the law, which the Bill is designed to fill, is that if a person becomes mentally incapable, whether or not he has given another person power of attorney, the wards of court procedure must be initiated if his property is to be managed.  Everyone who has the remotest connection with that procedure knows it is cumbersome, complex and massively expensive. However, although it could do with substantial alteration, its advantage is that someone who is appointed to manage the property of the mentally incapacitated person is under the supervision of <Col N="2017" /> and accountable to the wards of court office, having to produce accounts and answer for his stewardship.  Despite the best intentions of the Minister, the Law Reform Commission and others, this Bill provides a measure of privatisation. The State is abdicating responsibility for supervising the management of the property of incapacitated people and allowing it to be done by the donees of enduring powers of attorney.  They are private citizens, albeit chosen by the donor, who often will have some connection with the donor and may have a conflict of interest with him in managing the estate.</P>
    <P>Those private citizens are given the powers without any supervision.  The Bill only states that either the donor, the attorney or another interested party can obtain various orders from the High Court about how someone who has been given an enduring power of attorney is managing the property of the patient, which is an expensive process. Giving such power to the donor is useless because he may be mentally incapacitated and his chances of recovery will be low.  Also, the phrase &ldquo;another interested party&rdquo; is not defined.  That is not an adequate supervisory procedure. For example, if a person abuses the trust placed in him, the donor is not in a position to apply as he is mentally incapacitated, the person abusing his position will not apply to have himself restrained and there may be no one who falls into the category of &ldquo;another interested party&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to define what that phrase means.  Is it confined to someone with a financial interest or a future financial interest, such as the successor in title to the person who is mentally incapacitated?  How broad or how narrow is the definition?  What is the position of a friend of someone who becomes mentally incapacitated who wants to intervene if he or she sees the person giving enduring power of attorney abusing the trust placed in him by the unfortunate donor?</P>
    <P>Ideologically, I am an advocate of privatisation but it can be taken too far and may work against the public interest <Col N="2018" /> in many cases.  This form of privatisation will work disastrously against the interests of the people the Minister is honestly seeking to protect.  I am unsure of the definition of an &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; in section 12 (1) and am appalled that the person who will be given the power to manage the property of a mentally incapacitated person will have no statutory duty to act in a fiduciary way &mdash; I presume he has the general duties of a trustee in common law but there is nothing written into the legislation to that effect.  He has no obligation to submit even the barest form of accounts. He is accountable to nobody unless somebody, who must fall into the category of an interested party, takes it upon himself or herself to go to the High Court every time there is a problem. That is not desirable.  The sort of structure I would like to see is a simplification of the wards of court procedure.</P>
    <P>I would like to feel that there was even loose or general supervision, some accountability by officials, for example, the Master of the High Court or the Registrar of Wards of Court.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (3), which deals with revocation of a power of attorney, is too vague.  There should be a proper procedure set out in the Bill for revocation of an enduring power of attorney both before and after registration, and if an attorney is to be remunerated, the terms should be specified in the instrument creating the power.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (6) deals with people who automatically cease to have enduring power of attorney.  A spouse will cease to have an enduring power of attorney if there is a decree of judicial separation or if the marriage is annulled, but what about a case where a decree of divorce is given, or the person against whom a barring or protection order has been secured, or a person who has simply deserted and abdicated his or her responsibilities?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that all applications should be in private.  There is a compelling necessity that applications under this legislation should be in private to prevent public disclosure of <Col N="2019" /> the donor's mental state and his or her wealth.</P>
    <P>A number of other more technical points come to mind but I will not go into them.  They have been brought to our attention by the Law Society and others and they are more appropriate to Committee Stage.  However, I ask the Minister to direct his attention to the fact that we are allowing enormous responsibility to be transferred to people who are, in so far as I can ascertain, almost wholly unaccountable for their actions.  I would like to see the Minister take another look at the legislation in the light of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Eric Byrne.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  It is overdue, is complicated and raises many questions.</P>
      <P>At first glance it brings to our attention the large number of elderly people in our society.  It reminds us of the great difficulties families and individuals face in trying to plan for their future, and the particular difficulties where there is a physical or psychological illness that leads to mental incapacity.  This is not just a concern of the elderly but of young people, particularly in the case of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also makes us think about the issue of abuse of the elderly.  There has been a great deal of comment here about the abuse of children.  Health boards have drawn up guidelines and have become vigilant on this issue.  We have not been vigilant on the question of abuse of the elderly.  In most published reports and research its prevalence is probably underestimated because of the social chain that goes with it.  Such abuse does not become a social problem until enough people face up to and talk about it and society recognises the problem. We have been more concerned here with young people and with youth unemployment that with issues afflicting the older age group.  However, with the general rise in the population over <Col N="2020" /> 65 years of age and a substantial rise in those over 85, concerns and issues relating to the elderly will have to get higher policy priority.</P>
    <P>We have also chosen to overlook what we find upsetting.  I was reminded again of the inattention to children by a documentary about Goldenbridge and residential care that is to be broadcast on television this week.  We are going to have to open our eyes to the issue of abuse of the elderly, given that we now know so much about the patterns of abuse.  The Minister should establish a working group to investigate this issue. The Irish Association of Social Workers has called for this and the Green Paper on mental health proposed new measures to help people who are mentally infirm and who are victims of abuse.  To some degree this is a side issue to this Bill, but I raise it because the question of protecting the rights of elderly people is critical.</P>
    <P>Many people are anxious that their mental powers may be failing or may wish to make sensible provision in the event of their mental incapacity in the future.  Young people can also be brain damaged after traffic or other serious accidents.  It is interesting to note that in other countries increasing numbers of young people are making provision for enduring powers of attorney at the same time as they draw up their wills.  That does not happen much here but it is probably the way we will also go.</P>
    <P>What is meant by mental incapacity in section 4 and how is it to be established? I read the Minister's reply to this in the Seanad but I would like to know would it be necessary to obtain affidavits from medical practitioners, as is the case under the wards of court procedure? Will there be a requirement that they be experts in their field, and will there be a requirement that they examine the donor independently?</P>
    <P>On section 5, what level or degree of capacity is required to grant a power of attorney?  Is it sufficient that a donor understands in broad terms the nature and effect of the enduring power?  This was the test established in an English <Col N="2021" /> decision, but should the precise level of capacity be specified in the primary legislation?</P>
    <P>There is provision in regard to nursing homes.  I wonder if persons managing or employed in general and psychiatric hospitals in which the donor is resident should also be excluded from acting as attorneys, because there is always a danger of malpractice in any closed institution, and we must build in as many safeguards as possible.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that it is not an enduring power of attorney if somebody can appoint a successor, but should there be an opportunity for the donor to have power to appoint an alternative person to replace an attorney in the event of the latter dying, becoming bankrupt or separated from the donor?  The Minister dealt with this to some degree but I wonder if there is scope for, in some circumstances, not having to go through the procedure again.  It is difficult to get a balance, as the Minister said.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be any authority for conferring power in regard to personal welfare matters and especially matters concerning medical treatment. It appears that on these matters it is necessary to make an application to make a person a ward of court. However, in its report No. 231 on mental incapacity and based on its experience of enduring powers of attorney in the English jurisdiction, the English Law Commission proposed the creation by statute of a continuing power of attorney which, subject to certain safeguards, will provide for an attorney to take decisions relating to the personal welfare of the ward.  I wonder if the provisions of this Bill should be extended to cover these issues.  I realise we do not want to delay this legislation, but the issue of medical treatment is getting more attention internationally and clearly it will have to be dealt with.  If it cannot be dealt with in this Bill, will it be dealt with in future legislation?</P>
    <P>The donor of the power does not appear to have a right of objection to registration under the Bill.  Where the <Col N="2022" /> donor of the power objects to registration, the donee of the power should not effect it without a court order.  On section 9, what evidence must be adduced of mental incapacity?  Is medical evidence to be required and of what nature?  It might be helpful to specify the requirements because it would constitute an additional safeguard against wrongful registration.  Should the donor of the power have a right to object to registration?  Where he or she objects there should be no registration unless the court so orders.  I ask the Minister to look at this issue.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 11 (1) (a), at common law the donor of the power of attorney can revoke all or any part of a power of attorney without the necessity for court confirmation.  The donor of the power should retain this right at common law when he or she has the capacity to so do.  A donor should be deemed to have capacity in this regard if he or she understands the nature and effect of what he or she is doing.  The English Law Commission makes similar suggestions.</P>
    <P>What standard of care must the attorney comply with in carrying out his or her duties?  The imposition of a duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of the donor is desirable.  In its report on enduring powers of attorney the Law Reform Commission suggested the imposition of a duty to act in good faith.  In its recent report on mental incapacity the English Law Commission proposes that the attorney has a duty to act in the best interests of the donor. There is a range of issues that could be taken into account regarding what &ldquo;acting in the best interests&rdquo; means and they are outlined in the report I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 (4) the court may cancel the registration of an instrument on being satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, the attorney is unsuitable to be the donor's attorney. The wording of this provision is rather vague and a more precisely drawn supplementary provision providing for cancellation where an attorney behaves in a particularly improper way is desirable. <Col N="2023" /> Thus where the donor lacks capacity to do so the court should be empowered either to direct that a purported enduring power of attorney should not be registered or revoke a power where the attorney or intended attorney has behaved or is behaving or proposes to behave in a way that contravenes or would contravene the authority granted in the enduring power of attorney or where it is not and would not be in the donor's best interest.  This was made in the English Law Commission report No. 231 on mental incapacity.</P>
    <P>This important legislation will be supportive of individuals and their families. We need to ensure that its provisions are clearly explained.  It is extremely important to have good quality legal information made available in an easily accessible way to the public, particularly so in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this largely technical Bill, which will provide peace of mind for those who may become incapacitated.  It grants powers of attorney over property and will come into effect if a person is mentally incapacitated.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to make statutory provisions for so-called &ldquo;living wills&rdquo; which would enable an individual while still of sound mind and body to authorise persons acting under enduring powers of attorney to make health care decisions on their behalf.  This legislation is being introduced almost seven years after the Law Reform Commission reported on the subject.  The Minister has tackled a sensitive issue which many of us would rather not tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are likely to affect the elderly and in particular those suffering from that terrible illness, Alzheimer's disease, which is estimated to affect more than 25,000 people in this country.  The Bill will also affect those who are mentally incapacitated as a result of a car crash, stroke and so on. It will enable a person to make provision for the management of their <Col N="2024" /> affairs in the event of mental incapacity in the future and will ensure the family of the sufferer will not be forced to go through a lengthy, expensive and traumatic procedure to make the victim a ward of court.</P>
    <P>The need to provide for enduring powers of attorney has been recognised for some time.  We should be conscious that concern has been expressed that such a power could be open to abuse &mdash; a donor could be coerced into signing away his or her legal rights and a person's mental incapacity could be exploited.  However, having scrutinised the Bill I am satisfied that any potential loopholes which might facilitate such abuse have been closed.  I especially welcome the decision to exclude the proprietors and staff of nursing homes from acting as attorneys.  I say that with the greatest respect to them but it is important to distance the business relationship of the proprietor of a nursing home from the welfare of the patient.</P>
    <P>The Bill comprehensively addresses the granting of the power of attorney to manage an individual's financial and material affairs in the event of incapacity. Given the sensitivity and complexity of the issues it is not surprising that the Minister has refrained from going one step further and addressing the granting of enduring powers of attorney enabling health care decisions to be made on behalf of donors once they are incapacitated.  It is a sensitive issue and any legislation dealing with the matter would require detailed consideration and consultation with experts from the legal, medical and other fields.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that with medical advances the line between natural and artificial prolongation of life is increasingly blurred.  The medical advances in keeping people alive is well recorded. There are some who would not wish their life to be prolonged artificially in the event of suffering an illness or being involved in an accident from which they are unlikely to recover.  The time has come for us to follow the example set in other countries to deal with this issue.  It <Col N="2025" /> would be neither possible nor responsible to rush legislation through.  On the contrary, such legislation could only be drafted at the end of a wide ranging debate which would tease out the many ethical, medical and legal complexities surrounding the issue.  I hope the Minister will engage in consultations on this matter and after due consideration will bring forward relevant proposals on this delicate and sensitive issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal system in this or any other country is at best unfriendly and can appear downright hostile on occasion when it does not allow people to do what they are legitimately entitled to do.  The majority of people are not legal experts and hopefully this Bill will make the law on the powers of attorney a little more user friendly.  I welcome this legislation which, at its simplest, makes life easier for people and provides peace of mind for those who wish to avail of its provisions. The circumstances which necessitate the application for power of attorney are a drain on the emotional reserves of people at a difficult time in their lives.  The proposal to allow a person to make provision early in life for someone to manage his or her affairs in the event of them becoming incapacitated is a humane and compassionate measure.  In practical terms, it allows a person, despite later handicap, to be at all stages in charge of their own affairs by being the one to nominate the attorney who will later act for them should the need arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that in a country where the law allows someone to nominate the person who will look after their affairs when they have died, they cannot while in full health select the person who will carry out the more important task of seeing to their legal and temporal welfare while they are still alive and in need of such assistance.  In short, many people wish to plan ahead and, in the same way as they make provision for the certainty of death through a will, they must also be allowed to provide for incapacity which may also arise.  It is a <Col N="2026" /> grave deprivation of rights to be unable to provide for one's own affairs in the event of incapacity.  The creation of enduring power of attorney will do this and such a measure is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed, however, that as the Minister's declared intention is to make life easier for such people, he sees fit to designate the High Court as the place to which application for power of attorney is to be made.  The law must be brought closer to the people and the stress and cost of a High Court appearance is an unnecessary imposition on an appellant who may already be under great stress in looking after the physical welfare of the donor.</P>
    <P>Greater use should be made of county registrars in this instance.  As a body, they have proved themselves more than capable of discharging functions of equal importance and gravity in other spheres.  The assets of some of these people, while representing all that stands between them and destitution, may in other circumstances be regarded as quite modest and, in terms of the financial limits of some of the functions of the High Court, such assets would fall far short of what would be deemed an appropriate figure for that court to deal with.  People with small estates should not be forced into higher courts.</P>
    <P>In many instances, the Circuit Court may be the appropriate forum. However, the less formal surroundings in which county registrars work would be much more appropriate.  Will the Minister consider a scale of assets which would dictate the appropriate court to confirm registration?  There is little justice in having a major part of the estate swallowed up in legal fees in a court far in excess of what is required.</P>
    <P>Accessibility to the law is a pre-requisite for justice and the imposition of a High Court visit does not make the law accessible.  If a person decides to exercise this new right while they are in full health, the selection of an attorney is rightly theirs alone and is only to be confirmed by a reasonably formal process. I understand why safeguards may be necessary when the process takes <Col N="2027" /> place after the subject has become incapacitated. However, I appeal to the Minister in the present case to keep it simple and allow access to a lesser court or court officer.  All the safeguards need to come later when the attorney needs restrictions within which to work.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 (6) (a), which deals with an enduring power which is to be exercised by a spouse, such power will cease to be in force if the marriage is annulled in this State or annulled or dissolved validly elsewhere.  The introduction of divorce to this jurisdiction, which was allowed by the referendum last November and confirmed by the High Court, may be a factor in this Bill with which the Minister may have to contend. Will he outline his proposals in this regard and make proper provision in the Bill for that eventuality?</P>
    <P>A common practice among those who manage their affairs properly is to make a will at a specific time in their lives, such as at the time of marriage.  Such people might also execute an enduring power of attorney at the same time to safeguard themselves and their families in later life.  There could be a considerable gap between the time of such execution and registration under section 10.  All necessary formalities should be completed at that stage.</P>
    <P>For example, if a couple married at the age of 25 years and executed an enduring power of attorney, the relative certificates of mental fitness, a statement that the donors are aware of all the obligations and effects of the action and that it is being made without inappropriate influence should be completed at that stage.  Forty or 50 years later when the document needs to be registered, the person's doctor may not be alive or available to confirm the state of mental health when the power of attorney was made.  Would it be invalid in such a case?  Would the forward planning of the donor be set at naught in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to clarify all these points.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Woods, that they should be <Col N="2028" /> firmly stitched into the legislation or, at least, regulations at this stage rather than having to have a second bite at the cherry later.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for their general welcome for this very important social measure and their very helpful and constructive comments on various aspects of the Bill. I will bear in mind all that has been said between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill is timely and fulfills an urgent need.  At present, a power of attorney ceases to be operative where a person becomes mentally incapable. The Bill proposes to introduce a further power of attorney, namely an enduring power, which will be separate from, but may be complementary to, an ordinary power of attorney.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, we see the plight of elderly people and their need to have some responsible person look after their affairs when they arrive at this point in their lives.  This Bill will enable people to do just that by permitting them to appoint a person or persons to look after their affairs should they become mentally incapable.  However, I stress the point that the contents of the Bill are not just of interest to elderly people and those who look after them.  I hope that eventually the drawing up of an enduring power of attorney would be seen in much the same light as that of making a will.</P>
      <P>Deputies Woods and O'Dea made a couple of interesting points in their welcome for the Bill.  They suggested that persons convicted of certain crimes and disqualified directors of companies should be debarred from acting as attorneys.  That is a useful suggestion and I will bring forward a suitable amendment on the question on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also asked for those matters which are proposed to be dealt with by regulations under section 5 to be spelled out in the Bill itself.  The difficulty with doing so is that in this Bill we are entering a new branch of the law and <Col N="2029" /> the measure of flexibility provided by regulations is very desirable.  The form of enduring power will be a complicated document.  It must contain adequate information as to the effect of creating or accepting the power.  Both the form of the document and the information it has to contain are of the greatest importance.  Care will be needed in the drafting but there can be no guarantee that experience will not show that amendments may be necessary.  In fact, that is exactly what happened in another jurisdiction.  It is essential in the interests of those who will be affected to retain a regulation making power for the matters referred to in subsection (2). This will not delay the coming into operation of the Bill.  I hope to have the regulations ready at, or about, the time the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested the Bill should provide that where two or more attorneys are appointed and where the instrument is silent as to their status, it should be presumed that they have been appointed as joint attorneys.  This was one of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The form of enduring power to be prescribed under section 5 (2) will make it clear that attorneys are to be appointed either as joint attorneys or joint and several attorneys.  I see merit however in Deputy Woods's suggestion and I assure him I will give the matter careful consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods advocated the extension of the Bill to authorise persons acting under enduring powers of attorney to make personal welfare decisions on behalf of donors once they become mentally incapable &mdash; Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and Eric Byrne also raised this question.  That would constitute a substantial change in the Bill which is confined to the management of donors' property and financial affairs.  These personal welfare decisions could relate to very sensitive areas such as medical treatment.  Provisions to deal with those aspects would need to incorporate safeguards for the various circumstances <Col N="2030" /> that could arise and would necessarily have to be elaborate.  I will give further consideration to the matter but I would be reluctant to do anything that might delay the measure, which is awaited by many people.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the question of imposing on an attorney a positive duty to account.  Deputy O'Dea also referred to that matter.  Section 12 (2) empowers the court to give directions about the rendering of accounts by the attorney and the production of the attorney's records.  That is an important matter and I will see whether I can strengthen the Bill's provisions in that respect.  Deputy McDowell asked that section 5 (6) be amended to cover divorce as a valid reason for invalidating an enduring power.  I agree that is necessary and I will consider appropriate legislative provision if and when the divorce legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>On the question of providing for one instrument to cover both an enduring power and an ordinary power, such a provision would complicate the procedure and lead to uncertainty.  The object of the Bill is to make the enduring power come into operation only when the donor is, or is becoming, mentally incapable and to have that present in the mind of each donor when he or she is deciding to grant the power.  If a donor wishes to give an ordinary general power of attorney at the same time there is no difficulty in doing so.  The Bill provides an extremely simple statutory model for such a power.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea said that the Bill involves privatisation in that it enables a private person to be appointed as attorney, as opposed to the present position where the office of wards of court conducts this business.  The answer to his question was well given by his colleague, Deputy Kenneally, who rightly asked, given that a person may appoint an executor to deal with their affairs after death, therefore <i>a fortiori</i> why should a person not be in a position to appoint a member of their family, or whoever they think appropriate, to deal with their affairs while still alive <Col N="2031" /> although suffering from mental incapacity.</P>
    <P>The overall factor must be borne in mind that the appointment of the attorney, whether under an ordinary or enduring power of attorney, is the voluntary decision of the person who grants it &mdash; the person must be in a good state of mind when they make the appointment.  Nobody is compelled to appoint a person as their attorney. Obviously any person appointing an executor or an ordinary or enduring power of attorney should have very careful regard to and must take careful advice on the bona fides and worth of the person whom they appoint.</P>
    <P>Other points of detail were raised. Deputy Francis Fitzgerald asked what precisely should be the level of mental incapacity that would apply.  That definition is given in section 4.  We will discuss these and other points raised in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed for their warm and heartening welcome for the Bill and I look forward to further debate on it in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This legislation is about young people.  It is about protecting them in their most vulnerable years, when they are moving from full-time education into the world of work.  It is about ensuring that the law is clear and specific in stating that at this vulnerable age, education must come first.  It is about our duty as legislators to ensure that our laws and public policy create the framework necessary to ensure that future generations get a good start in life.  The legislation offers a statutory guide to parents, guardians and employers in ensuring that those years between the world of school and the world of work are properly regulated.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill strikes a balance between the need to put school first, on the hand, and the recognition of the growing independence of the child during these years, an independence often shown by a desire to work a few hours while still at school.  The legislation recognises this.  It also recognises the desire of many parents to instil a work ethic early in life and to generate an acceptance of working, earning and saving as good principles.</P>
    <P>Over very many years, there has been a process of concerted action by Governments at international level to prevent the exploitation of young people in employment and to establish basic safeguards.  In 1919, at its first meeting, the International Labour Organisation adopted the first of 11 conventions on the minimum age for working, along with the first of three conventions on night work for children. The United Nations has adopted successive instruments to protect the rights of young workers.  These protections are also central to the Council of Europe's Social Charter.  The EU Directive on Protection of Young People at work, to which this Bill gives effect, follows an honourable tradition of collective international action to protect young people.</P>
    <P>The focus of the earliest protections was on protecting children's health and <Col N="2033" /> physical development.  There is international legislation which prohibits the employment of very young children and outlaws the employment of young people in heavy work such as mining.  In more modern times the focus of protection has moved towards emphasising the importance of putting young people's education and development first.  That is a context which is particularly important for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those who are unemployed, particularly long-term unemployed, are drawn disproportionately from the ranks of those who left school early.  Some 48 per cent of our long-term unemployed are people who left school without qualification. About 5,000 young people leave school with minimal or no qualifications and 60 to 70 per cent of those end up on the dole, some maybe for life.  These are the unemployed of the future.  Put bluntly, today's early school leaver is likely to be tomorrow's unemployed person.  That is why the Government puts the emphasis on schooling rather than on earning during these important years of a young person's life.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises the minimum age for normal employment to 16 years of age. It updates and strengthens the protection afforded to young workers and offers a new channel of redress to young workers victimised for seeking compliance with the law.  It brings our law fully up-to-date with EU law giving effect to important principles in the Social Charter.</P>
    <P>As well as the new measures in the Bill, the legislation consolidates the law relating to young people in one legal instrument.  It repeals and re-enacts those provisions of the 1936 protection of employment legislation and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, in relation to young people's employment, which will remain unchanged.  This is important in that young workers and their employers can check their legal rights and responsibilities in one text.  I am following through the decision to repeal and re-enact the provisions of those Acts <Col N="2034" /> taken by my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, because it is important to clarify the rights of young workers and employers in one instrument to avoid cross-reference between three pieces of legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises the minimum age for normal working from 15 to 16 years of age or the school leaving age, whichever is the higher.  Those under 16 years of age may work a maximum of eight hours a week during term time and a maximum of 35 hours a week during the holiday period.  There must be a three week break from work during the summer holidays to enable students return to school refreshed.  Those aged under 16 may not work after 8 p.m.  These rules place working for students clearly in the context that their schooling must come first.</P>
    <P>Since I published the Bill I received support from teachers around the country who emphasised that in the longer term interest of young people it is important they put their education first and earning additional money should be kept in perspective.  It is particularly disheartening for teachers to teach students who are tired from working late hours or those who have not had time for a balanced mix of study and recreation and who are not getting the full benefit of their studies.</P>
    <P>The Bill re-enacts the existing law which prohibits the employment of young people aged 16 or 17 years of age after 10 p.m.  That is not new.  It has been the law since 1977 when we enacted the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act and ratified the ILO Convention on night work by young people adopted by international labour organisations as part of our international obligations as far back as 1946.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the Bill has caused some public controversy and it is important to restate some basic facts. Currently, it is illegal for employers to employ young people under 18 years of age after 10 p.m.  That has been the law for the past 18 years.  Most young people in that age group are in fifth or sixth year, important years for their future <Col N="2035" /> life chances.  These provisions have a sound educational basis as a concern for the health and potential exploitation of young people.  In the bar trade where abuse is most widely reported there is a double legal prohibition on employing young people at night not only under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, but under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, which prohibits young people under 18 years of age from working in bars at night.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the terms of an EU directive which has its origin in the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers or, as it is more commonly known, the Social Charter.  The Charter states that the minimum employment age must not be lower than the minimum school-leaving age and appropriate measures must be taken to adjust labour regulations applicable to young workers so that their specific developmental and vocational training and access to employment needs are met.  The Charter declares that the duration of work, in particular, must be limited for young workers and night work prohibited in the case of workers under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the existing legislation are similar to the terms of the directive in many respects.  There is good protection in existing legislation, but the introduction of new measures in this Bill strengthens the educational context in which the legislation operates. The existing legislation prohibits the employment of children under school-leaving age and sets statutory maximum working hours.  It provides for minimum intervals of rest, restrictions on night work and for offences and penalties for breaches of the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are some differences between the provisions in the EU directive and our existing law.  That is why we are amending the law and I am introducing new measures which, in some respects, go beyond the provisions of the directive. Certain categories of employment <Col N="2036" /> which are excluded from some provisions of the existing legislation come within the scope of the directive.  The directive requires a specific authorisation procedure for the employment of children in cultural or similar activities such as in films, the theatre and so on. The directive is more restrictive than the existing law on the maximum working time for those aged 16 to 18 years of age.  It provides for a longer minimum rest period to be given in any seven day period, putting the health and safety of young workers first.  The directive permits the employment of children for a limited number of hours during school term time, something that is not permitted under existing legislation.  I am allowing 14 year olds to work seven hours a week and 15 year olds to work eight hours a week.  This means their schooling will come first and that they will not work at night.</P>
    <P>In one respect the Bill goes beyond the terms of the directive by generally prohibiting the employment of persons who are under 16 years of age or the school-leaving age, whichever is the higher.  The existing minimum age for entry to employment is 15 years of age, but the proposal to raise the minimum age for entry to employment is consistent with the White Paper on Education which proposes a similar increase in the school-leaving age.  Young workers aged 14 and 15 years of age will be allowed to work a limited number of hours during school term and holidays, but they must have a three week break during the holidays so that they may return to school refreshed and gain full benefit from their education.  It is important that young people strike a proper balance between work and study and between recreation and general development.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide that for the first time young people will have an avenue of redress against employers who penalise them for not working longer hours than the legislation allows.  They can appeal to the Rights Commissioner Service in the first instance, following <Col N="2037" /> which they may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Under existing legislation they have redress to the courts, but it is appropriate that they have redress under labour law.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt this procedure is needed.  My Department has received complaints about the employment of children over long hours for low wages. The areas of complaint include, in particular, employment conditions in supermarkets, pubs, catering and fast food establishment, petrol service stations and the services sector generally.  The level of such complaints has increased in recent years.  That is evident given that the Labour Inspectorate of my Department carried out 686 inspections under the protection of young persons legislation in 1995 compared with 486 inspections in 1994 and 121 in 1993.  It is important to ensure that employers do not exploit young people by employing them as illegals, but meet their legal obligations in that regard.  I am increasing the penalties for employers who abuse the law by exploiting young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not interfere with the opportunities for young persons aged 15 to participate in approved training or work experience schemes which will offer valuable training or worthwhile genuine work experience skills, thereby enhancing their job prospects.  The new legislation does not seek to impose a ban on employing young people in the labour market, but to prevent abuse of young people's labour.  It supports measures designed to give young people the opportunity to obtain a certificate or diploma without having to prematurely leave the school system or an appropriate training course and, at the same time, boost their chances on the labour market.  It supports school programmes designed to provide students with work experience through structured training schemes.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of striking a balance between providing all the necessary protection for young people at work while not unduly hindering their access to suitable employment and to <Col N="2038" /> the type of experience they may need to make the transition from school to work.  I am satisfied this legislation strikes the right balance between the developmental and educational needs of young people and the need to provide for that important transition.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill is a standard interpretation section.  Section 2 empowers the Minister to declare any form of work to be industrial work for the purposes of the Bill because young people tend to engage in light, non-industrial work.</P>
    <P>Section 3 generally prohibits the employment of children under 16 years of age but allows children to be employed in certain circumstances by licence or regulation.  The employment of children in cultural, artistic, sports and advertising activities may be authorised in individual cases by licence. The employment of children over 13 years of age in such activities may also be authorised by regulation.  There is an important provision allowing the Minister, to draw up conditions regarding the protection, welfare and the educational training and developmental needs of young people who are employed under licence or by regulation.</P>
    <P>A child over 14 years of age may engage in non-industrial light work outside of the school term provided the hours of work do not exceed seven in any one day or 35 in any one week. However, it is important that a child has an adequate rest period during the summer holidays before returning to school and is prohibited from engaging in any work for at least 21 days during that period, which has been increased from 14 days under existing law.</P>
    <P>A child over 15 years is permitted to engage in light, non-industrial work for up to eight hours per week during school term.  While this is not permitted under present legislation, it is considered that short periods of light work &mdash; such as newspaper delivery, baby-sitting and so on &mdash; as long as it does not interfere with schooling, can help a child's development.  A child over 14 in <Col N="2039" /> full-time secondary education may be employed as part of a work experience or educational programme for up to eight hours in any one day or 40 hours in any one week.  A child over 15 years may participate in a training or work experience programme arranged or approved by the Minister or FÁS for up to eight hours in any day or 40 hours in any week.</P>
    <P>Section 4 specifies additional provisions relating to the employment of children, where permitted by licence or regulation under section 3, relating to night work, minimum rest periods and breaks.  A child may not be employed between 8 p.m. in the evening and 8 a.m. in the morning and must have a minimum rest period of 14 hours in each 24-hour period and two days in any period of seven days.  If it is found necessary for technical or organisational reasons, this two day period may be reduced, by regulation, to 36 hours.  This section also provides for a minimum break period of 30 minutes in any period of work which exceeds four hours.</P>
    <P>Section 5 outlines the duties of an employer in relation to the employment of young persons and children.  Before employing a young person or child, the employer must obtain a copy of the birth certificate or other satisfactory evidence of age and, when employing a child under 16, must obtain the written permission of the parent or guardian. The employer is also required to maintain a register containing particulars in relation to every young person or child employed by him or her.  These provisions &mdash; which we are consolidating &mdash; are already in the 1977 legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 specifies the circumstances in which an employer may employ a young person between 16 and 18 years of age.  The young person must not be required to work for more than eight hours per day or 40 hours per week.  As in the 1977 Act, a young person must not be required to work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.  He or she must have a minimum rest period of 12 hours in each 24-hour period and two days in any <Col N="2040" /> seven day period as well as a 30 minute break in any period of work which exceeds 4½ hours.</P>
    <P>The shipping and fishing sectors are exempted from the minimum rest provisions, provided there are objective grounds for not complying with the provisions and provided that the young persons receive compensatory rest times at some time during each 24 hours of work and night work provisions will not apply to members of the Defence Forces in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 permit, by licence or regulation, the employment of young persons on terms other than those specified in section 6 provided that the terms of such licences and regulations comply with the Directive, the health, welfare and safety of the employees is not endangered and compliance with the terms of section 6 would be impractical for technical or organisational reasons. Under the 1977 Act, regulations were made to exempt close relatives and agricultural workers from certain provisions of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 9 prohibits double employment. This provision is already in the present legislation.  Section 10 provides that any time spent by a young person working under a combined work-training scheme or in-plant work experience scheme is deemed to be working time. This provision is also in the present legislation.  Section 11 specifies that every employer must display an abstract of the Act.  Section 12 preserves existing pay and conditions of employment of employees where, in order to comply with the provisions of this Act when it comes into operation, the hours of work might be reduced or altered.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that it will be a defence to any proceedings taken against an employer for a breach of the act to show that the breach resulted from an emergency.  Section 14 specifies that the employer must keep records, for at least three years to show that he or she is complying with the Act. Section 15 makes provision for the <Col N="2041" /> recovery of money due to an employee. Section 16 provides that an employee who refuses to co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act shall not be penalised.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the parent or guardian of a child or young person may refer a complaint to a Rights Commissioner if the employer has contravened section 12 &mdash; preservation of pay and conditions &mdash; or section 16 &mdash; refusal to co-operate in breaching the Act.  This is a new provision allowing additional legal protection and an avenue of redress in such situations.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with appeals from and enforcement of the recommendations of a Rights Commissioner.  A party may appeal such a recommendation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal within six weeks and the tribunal will issue a determination which either affirms, varies or sets aside the recommendation of the Rights Commissioner. The section allows a party to appeal a determination of the tribunal to the High Court on a point of law and also provides that the Minister, at the request of the tribunal, may refer a question of law to the High Court for determination.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with enforcement of determinations of the tribunal and provides that, in circumstances where an employer fails to implement a determination of the tribunal &mdash; which has not been appealed &mdash; the District Court, on application to it by the Minister or the parent or guardian of the child or young person concerned or the trade union of the young person concerned, may make an order directing the employer to implement the determination without hearing the employer or requiring further evidence.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with evidence in relation to prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce documents.  Section 21 empowers the Minister to appoint inspectors for the purposes of the Act <Col N="2042" /> and sets out the powers of these inspectors. This is similar to the present legislation. Section 22 provides that where an offence is committed by a body corporate, senior officers who act on behalf of a body corporate shall also be deemed to be guilty of an offence if they either knowingly or through neglect allow a breach of the legislation.  This provision is already in the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that offences may be prosecuted summarily by the Minister. An offence &mdash; other than an offence under section 18 and 21 &mdash; may also be prosecuted by the employee's trade union.</P>
    <P>Section 24 proposes penalties for offences of up to £1,500 on summary conviction.  Where the person after conviction continues to contravene the provision concerned, a fine on summary conviction of up to £250 per day is proposed. This increase in penalties I hope, will act as a deterrent against the contravention of the legislation by employers.</P>
    <P>Section 25 repeals sections 15, 41 (1) (b), 45, 47 and 49 (7) of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 and the entire Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  While the present legislation could have been amended by regulation or an amending Act in order to implement the Directive, it was felt that a single new composite Act would be the more efficient option and easier for the public to follow.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is a standard provision dealing with expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  Section 27 is a standard requirement relating to orders and regulations made under the legislation and section 28 is a standard provision dealing with the short title and date of commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents further evidence of Ireland's commitment to the full implementation of measures adopted by the European Community in the context of the social dimension enshrined in European Community policy.  Ireland is a signatory to the Social Charter and I am happy to introduce this Bill which implements important provisions of that <Col N="2043" /> charter.  Good, responsible employers have nothing to fear from these provisions. They will be seen as an asset to the continued development of good relationships in the workplace and will protect the best interests of young people in education generally.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises from a European Union Council Directive of 22 June 1994 when my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I am conscious that all member states of the European Union must implement legislation to comply with this directive not later than 22 June 1996.  I am also conscious that we must repeal and replace the 1977 Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act.  My party supports Government efforts to protect the health of young workers, ensuring they are not exploited and endorses its emphasis on the importance of young persons remaining in school and obtaining adequate education.</P>
      <P>However, I cannot agree that the Minister of State has managed to strike the right balance on this occasion.  I believe the provisions of the Bill are too draconian and heavy-handed in relation to young people who take on part-time work.  I would go so far as to say that this legislation shows the Minister and the Government are out of touch with reality.  Most of us who went through third level have experience of working part-time.  My children, two of whom are in third level education and one who is sitting the leaving certificate, are involved in some shape or form in part-time work.  That is the reality on the ground for most people and they are contributing to the family income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 USI student poverty survey of 400 second year university students indicated that 50 per cent were in part-time employment and 84 per cent were working for more than 16 hours.  This <Col N="2044" /> legislation should accommodate the reality.</P>
    <P>I welcome the adoption of the EU Directive and the recognition in law of the academic rights of young people. The Government is failing to face up to the fact that thousands of young people have to work to support themselves financially. Their parents simply cannot afford to cover their maintenance costs, clothes, pocket money and so on.  In the vast majority of cases the young student is contributing to the family household income and is working out of necessity.</P>
    <P>This legislation would prohibit a 17 year old student from working after 10 p.m. the reality is that many 17 year olds are already in third level education and working part-time in bars, fast food restaurants and in the service sector.  In this context, the legislation which prohibits students from working after 10 p.m. would be extremely impractical to implement.  While I support the need to ensure that young people are not exploited by employers &mdash; that goes without saying &mdash; the legislation should allow for flexibility in relation to 17 year olds involved in part-time work.  Provision should be made in this legislation for consultation with trade unions and employers in regard to exemptions and derogations.  I note the EU Directive refers to the need for the collective agreement of the two sides of industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions which allow for a young person to go to the Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal if his or her rights are not being upheld by the employer.  I am conscious that there are abuses by employers, to which the Minister has referred.  I have heard some horrific examples of young workers being locked into supermarkets until they completed their work.  This type of exploitation has to be rooted out.  I am convinced that further work is required on the Bill in order to get the right balance. I also welcome the increase in fines.  However, the legislation is seriously flawed in that no provision has been made for resources to ensure the law can be enforced.  In calling for <Col N="2045" /> exemptions I am conscious that this could lead to abuse of workers unless proper enforcement procedures are in place.  I am conscious that no enforcement of the existing legislation has taken place for some time.  In order to get it right exemptions are needed on the one hand and proper enforcement procedures on the other.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address the issue of 17 year old apprentice bar staff?  For example, an apprentice bar person who has decided to pursue a career in that industry would, as I understand it, be required to work after 10 p.m.  In those circumstances it is difficult to understand how this legislation will not be an impediment.  I am concerned when a sledge hammer approach is adopted in regard to any area of legislation.  Unfortunately, this legislation falls into that category.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provision concerning employment of persons under 16 years.  The exemptions are well made in regard to cultural, artistic, sports or advertising activities.  We support the fact that they should not affect their school attendance and that educational programmes, work experience, FÁS programmes etc. are not part of the prohibition. I support the limit on work during school time to eight hours per week.</P>
    <P>I have read carefully what the Minister has to say about work during school holidays.  There is a limit of 35 hours per week for a young person and he or she must have 21 days off, an increase of one week on the existing legislation. From the consultations I have had and from experience, this is an area about which we should be careful.  The reality is that many young people get an opportunity to work for three months during the summer.  Are we saying to that person, whose family is often in a difficult financial situation, that he or she must have three weeks off?  I appreciate what the Minister is saying and, as a teacher, I support the educational system and agree that students should have holiday periods.  However, I would ask the Minister to examine its practicalities.  In <Col N="2046" /> effect, the legislation follows the EU directive closely.  It does not affect the majority of employers.  It affects mainly vintners, family shops, catering and areas of intensive labour.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in regard to the prohibition on double employment but how will it be implemented?  How can the employer know, if he is not told, whether a young person he employs is also working elsewhere?  There is a question of being aware of what is happening in relation to double employment and perhaps the Minister will examine that issue.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has a copy of the student poverty survey, to which I referred.  It is useful when examining this type of legislation, to look carefully at what third level students are seeking. This is clearly linked in with this debate. So far as the students are concerned, the Minister and the Department should concentrate on a number of areas, including student grants which they recommend should be increased substantially from £1,523 to £3,000; that all the various grants should be amalgamated; that all the existing third level student support schemes should be amalgamated to avoid confusion; that student grants &mdash; this is a worthwhile suggestion &mdash; should be paid monthly in advance to the nominated account of the recipient; that financial institutions should ensure that they fully comply with relevant legislation by informing students in writing as to the cost of borrowing money &mdash; clearly, this is the alternative to putting restrictions on young people from earning money &mdash; including the total sum which will be repaid at the termination of a loan and a detailed schedule of fees and charges; that students should be encouraged to open accounts with credit unions; that employers and trade union organisations should seek to eliminate the black economy which exploits students and others who are low paid &mdash; an area that will be addressed by this legislation. They refer to the Department of Social Welfare and acknowledge it made changes to the operation of the students <Col N="2047" /> summer jobs scheme in the past two years.  Those changes have made the scheme more attractive for students but the USI believes the Minister for Social Welfare should act to restore the rights of students to supplementary welfare benefits and encourage scheme sponsors to introduce training elements on their summer programmes.  They also say that private sector landlords &mdash; an issue close to the Minister's heart &mdash; should be advised that rent books are a legal requirement as well as supplying tenants with basic information.  They refer also to the need for third level students to have access to medical cards.</P>
    <P>The students have made specific proposals and we should consider those before introducing legislation restricting their only avenue to financial support which helps them through third level education.  There is no reference in the White Paper on Education to the real cost of living for students and the Department of Education has shown little interest in students outside the lecture hall and the library.  I acknowledge the various developments with regard to fees but the Government should urgently address the broader issue because there are enormous pressures on young people.</P>
    <P>The real needs of students are evident in their own survey of student poverty. They suggest that many students in receipt of full time maintenance grants are living well below the national poverty line.  No Government agency or Department has responsibility for students or their welfare yet such agencies exist in other EU countries.</P>
    <P>This is protective legislation and we all want to protect our vulnerable young people but the Minister of State will be aware that the costs incurred by students in third level education are enormous.</P>

      <P>For many young people part-time work is a means of supplementing the family income and in <Col N="2048" /> that regard one is reminded of the extreme cases, namely, the young person attending third level education whose parents are on social welfare. That example highlights the need to be careful of becoming too draconian in this legislation.  One could argue that the legislation in its present form would deny hundreds or even thousands of young people the opportunity to participate in third level education.</P>
      <P>Work experience is valuable and many employers believe that academic training alone is not a sufficient attribute of a good employee.  They are of the view that not having any experience of work can be a major handicap.  I am in favour of a combination of education and work experience.</P>
      <P>The growth areas in employment are in the services area which incorporates the food, catering and leisure sectors. Many of those sectors operate outside the traditional working hours of 9 to 5 and it could be rightly argued that the effect of this legislation would be to cut off a growth area in which many young people are employed.  In gaining work experience in these sectors, young people are exposed to the opportunities to become the entrepreneurs of the future.  Successive Governments have referred to the need to expand the services sector.  The majority of employers are fair but we must ensure that young people are protected by introducing legislation to deal with those who are abusing young people in terms of employment.</P>
      <P>That raises the question of EU directives. As a former Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs I have some experience of such directives which have been debated in this House. I am a strong supporter of social solidarity and partnership and in that regard we have put in place worthwhile protective measures for workers.  Much more work is needed in that area, however, and we must proceed with that as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the question as to whether there are too many rules and regulations at EU level and I am reminded of the <Col N="2049" /> case of the small firm versus the large German company employing 10,000 people.  The question is whether we can have EU rules and regulations governing all types of employment.  People in the small companies sector are of the view that flexibility and co-operation are the hallmarks of success and that is the case provided appropriate protection measures are in place.  I know the Minister of State is examining this area but is it feasible to introduce EU directives appropriate to both a large factory in Germany employing 10,000 and a small operation in the west of Ireland employing two or three?  That is not possible and there is strong resistance on the part of small firms to this complicated structure of directives.  To understand how complicated they are one only needs to examine any EU directive.</P>
    <P>This whole area should be examined when we take over the Presidency of the European Union because many business people say that if they must choose between taking on an additional staff member or buying a machine, they will buy the machine because there are not as many problems involved.  That is unfortunate.  We should examine those EU protection directives which allow for flexibility and co-operation, particularly in regard to small firms which provide many valuable jobs, particularly in the services sector.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on her work on the Bill but improvements are required in order to achieve the right balance.  I highlighted the case of the 17 year-old student and I ask the Minister of State to consider introducing exemptions for that type of person in relation to working after 10 p.m.  The Minister can do that by consulting with trade unions and employers.  If that element of the Bill is tackled, the right balance will be achieved and if the Minister of State accepts the suggestions I made, we will have a much better Bill.</P>

      <P>Any right-minded person would welcome legislation to protect and promote the well-being of young <Col N="2050" /> people, as do I, but I have mixed feelings about the overall effect of this Bill. I am concerned that in certain cases it may have unintended results but we can deal with that matter by way of amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister would be open to amendments that improve the Bill and Members could ensure that would be the case.</P>
      <P>Legislation that aims to reinforce young people's educational attainment has to be welcomed.  The Minister couched the Bill in those terms.  We recognise how vitally important it is that our young people get the best education possible.  Education is not just a passport to employment, but to a wider range of employment opportunities, to a higher quality of life and a higher standard of living.  Today those who fall off the educational ladder at an early stage are seriously disadvantaged in the employment market and elsewhere and statistics bear that out.  Failure to gain educational qualifications can blight the career prospects of young people and prevent them from realising their full potential.  Accordingly, I agree with the basic premise of the Bill that nothing should interfere with the education of school going young people.  However, we must ensure that in aiming to help our young people we must not enact legislation that has the unintended result of impeding their all-round education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a relief that we do not have to legislate for children in full-time labour, as was the case a century ago in Victorian times when children were used as chimney sweeps.  The main target of this Bill is part-time and casual employment. In most cases young people are working in the services sector, in hotels, bars, supermarkets and filling stations.  Many thousands work in these businesses on a part-time basis and there is no doubt that if young people work excessive hours, it could have an adverse effect on their education because they will have insufficient time to do their homework, their powers of concentration will be reduced in class, their ability to learn will be impaired and in some cases their <Col N="2051" /> attainment in crucial exams may be affected.  It is important that we seek to regulate the amount of time young people spend working.  I welcome and am in full agreement with the provisions stipulating that a young person of 15 years will not be allowed to work for more than eight hours per week during school term.</P>
    <P>This Bill arises directly from the necessity to comply with the European Union directive, a channel from which much of our social legislation flows.  As with other aspects of EU social legislation we must ask ourselves whether this Bill might introduce an undue element of bureaucracy.  A common complaint when we attempt to introduce EU legislation into our framework is that it gives rise to wasteful and unnecessary bureaucracy.  That leads to resentment among employers, many of whom are struggling to generate badly needed jobs.  We must be conscious of this as we attempt to transpose EU directives into our legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 prohibits persons under 16 years from working after 8 p.m.  Effectively this prohibits young people from working in bars and lounges and evening work in restaurants and hotels, all of which are important sources of part-time work for young people.  This provision would fall particularly heavily where a young person was in the habit of helping at busy times in a family business. The same provision could also be used to prevent young people from earning money babysitting, though I am unclear whether that is the case.  I am sure the Minister will clarify this point in her reply.  If it does apply to babysitting, it would be very foolish and needs to be amended.</P>

      <P>For the most part this is a safe environment for young people to earn badly needed cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the contents of the Bill were first made public, a <i>vox pop</i> conducted <Col N="2052" /> on RTE television news to ascertain young people's views on the matter showed that they did not perceive the problems, the consensus was that the legislation would be unnecessary interference. Many young people rely on part-time jobs during school term to earn a little extra money to enhance the family budget and to help with expenses directly related to their own needs, for example, clothes and recreation.  We have all worked.  When I was 17, 18 and 19 years I spent my summers working in factories in London and was able to earn money that helped to buy books and other necessities when I came home.  I spent my summer holidays in Kerry every year, I see young people working in bars and restaurants and when I come back to Cork at the end of the summer I meet them on the street because they are back at university or the regional college, and their summer work has not interfered with their educational attainment.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to differentiate between working during holiday time and school term.  Young people who go out and get jobs for themselves and work during the holidays bring to their later life a spirit of initiative and enterprise which sometimes is the best education of all for life.  I would be very slow to put in place legislation that would inhibit that.  It will test our skills to enact legislation that is flexible enough to identify and differentiate where young people do themselves damage by working and where they do not.  It is a fair enough ambition for young people to earn money to make a contribution to the family budget and it gives them a feeling of independence. Where we are so burdened with dependants because of the high rate of unemployment we should be trying to cultivate a spirit of independence in our young people.  I remember with great pride the day I brought home to my parents at the age of 17 my first pay packet which I earned working at the Ascot gas geyser factory in north London.  No other penny that I ever earned in later life gave me more pleasure.  We must <Col N="2053" /> take these factors into account and not kill off this spirit of enterprise.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will prohibit a young person in the 16 to 18 age bracket from working after 10 p.m.  This is unrealistic.  Young people in that age bracket regard themselves very much as young adults and 10 p.m. is long before their bed time. This provision will preclude them from accepting offers of lounge or bar work, particularly at weekends.  No bar owner will employ a young person to work from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. and another to work from 10 p.m. until closing time. That will not happen and young people will suffer as a consequence.</P>
    <P>I would place a strong obligation on employers to look after the welfare of young people.  In the Middle Ages employers treated young apprentices as if they were their own children.  It is a matter of attitude which cannot be legislated for, but it would be nice to think that employers adopt such a caring approach to the betterment of young people.</P>
    <P>It is my fear that if this section is applied, young people will not be offered any work because it will be easier for employers to take on someone to work from whatever time they are needed until closing time.  They will not employ two people as that would make the matter far too complicated and expensive.</P>
    <P>Part-time employment provides young people with valuable work experience and, if included on their CV, will stand in their favour when they later seek full-time employment.  That is another factor I would be slow to overlook. Part-time employment can be particularly advantageous for those in the 16 to 18 age group.  Is it right, therefore, that we should discourage them in this way?  Would it not be better to relax the time limit?</P>
    <P>This legislation will inevitably introduce a new layer of cumbersome bureaucracy involving licences, registers and regulations.  Has the Minister of State conducted any compliance audit <Col N="2054" /> to calculate the cost to the business sectior of satisfying the terms of this legislation? How does she propose to police it?  Will there be a team of government inspectors to visit pubs and hotels late at night to look for birth certificates and, if so, how much will this cost?  In this connection will the public service recruitment embargo be breached?  Has the Minister of State calculated how many additional civil servants will be needed to carry out these duties and monitor the implementation and enforcement of this Bill?</P>

      <P>How many prosecutions were brought under the 1977 legislation?  Former Deputy Michael O'Leary, now a judge, once admitted that much of the legislation in this area was a dead letter because of the lack of political will to police it.  Are we going through the motions of satisfying the European Union demand that we incorporate one of its directives in Irish law?  Is it realistic to expect the resources of the State to be used in prosecuting a family which gives a neighbour's son or daughter £10 for babysitting for an hour or two at night time?</P>
      <P>What will be the position of young paper boys who sell morning or evening newspapers on the street?  I am thinking in particular of the boys who sell the <i>Evening Echo</i> in Cork.  Will their employers be in breach of the law and who will police them?  Is it envisaged that a prosecution will be brought against them?  All these questions will have to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is a need for legislation to protect young people we ought to concentrate our scarce resources on <Col N="2055" /> making sure the existing legislation is properly enforced, particularly that dealing with school attendance.  Thousands of children drop out of the system each year long before they reach school leaving age and many take the first step on the road to crime.  Little is being done about this in urban areas.  It is now commonplace to see small children, many of primary school age, begging openly on the streets of our major cities, breaking not one but two existing laws. The State turns a blind eye to this activity.  The legislation is not being enforced and nothing is being done to ensure these vulnerable children are protected.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is rigorously enforced, huge numbers of young people will be displaced from part-time jobs.  Does the Minister of State believe they will be replaced by adult workers or will these part-time jobs disappear altogether?</P>
    <P>Each year we consume huge quantities of products manufactured by child labour in Third World countries which do not share our concern for the welfare of children.  In Morocco young girls of primary school age earn as little as £11 for a 55-hour working week making clothes that adorn the displays of some of our leading supermarkets and department stores.  Is it the Government's intention to address the issue of child labour imports into the European Union and avail of the opportunity when it assumes the Presidency to raise it at a wider level?  As the trend towards free trade continues to rise we in the developed world will find ourselves importing more and more goods produced by child labour in Third World countries.  At international level there must be a level playing pitch in terms of the cost of labour.  We should extend the same concern to other countries where cheap child labour seems to be the norm.</P>
    <P>We have a huge unemployment problem; one person in four is unable to find a proper job.  We should be careful in introducing new legislation that we do <Col N="2056" /> not make a bad situation worse.  Discouraging young people in the 16 to 18 age category from working is not likely to enhance their long-term employment prospects.  If they want to work and earn money to pay for clothes, holidays or books, should the Government stand in their way?</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and look forward to the Minister of State's reply to the points I have raised and my party framing amendments on Committee Stage with the aim of making this better legislation.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's neglect of the cattle and beef industry and calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to restore both competitiveness in the food industry and cattle farmers' incomes by securing the restoration in full of export refunds and calls on the Minister to fulfil his long standing commitment to institute a package of measures to sustain the sector in the face of unrelenting pressure resulting from the strength of the punt against sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down this motion because of the deepening crisis in the cattle industry.  It should not be necessary to emphasise the importance of the cattle sector.  Cattle make up to 90 per cent of our farm stock and are crucial to the incomes of thousands of farmers. Those in the dry stock sector have had to deal with tighter margins than any other sector of the agricultural industry. <Col N="2057" /> While this crisis was predictable, very little was done about it.  This is an outstanding example of what can happen when the difficulties in agriculture are neither understood nor accepted by our European partners.  We fought hard in Europe for the introduction of a direct payments system and common agricultural policy reforms and success was achieved by the Minister's predecessors in the face of severe criticism.</P>
      <P>We are not asking the Minister to seek something extra.  We are asking him to guard the systems that have been put in place as a result of the negotiating successes of his predecessors.  One of the greatest criticisms that can be levelled at the Minister is his abject failure to maintain the <i>status quo</i> which would have provided some prospect of viability for the thousands of farmers who depend on the dry stock sector. Those achievements did not benefit only cattle farmers.  A survey of national farms carried out in 1994 shows that premia payments are crucial to the viability of farm families in all sectors.</P>
      <P>We tabled this motion against the background of a crisis in the beef industry. We depend to a far greater extent than our European Union partners on markets outside the EU to dispose of our cattle.  This unique position is neither understood nor accepted by our EU partners and has not been acknowledged since this debacle began last October.  Since last autumn export refunds have been cut by 35 per cent. In recent weeks proposals emerged at Commission level to effectively remove the deseasonalisation premium from Irish beef producers and to reduce the 22 month premium.  Throughout this period, because of the strength of the punt against sterling, pressure on the sector has cost factory jobs and added to the downward pressure on farm gate prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil holds this Minister responsible.  He has reneged on his political responsibilities to our single largest industry.  He disastrously miscalculated the effect on the sector of the series of reductions of export refunds <Col N="2058" /> since last October.  On 2 February he compounded his earlier misjudgments by accepting an entirely unsatisfactory and &mdash; on his own admission &mdash; inadequate resolution of the issue.  He added insult to injury by saying the package of 2 February, &ldquo;would give a psychological boost to the beef and live cattle trade at a very sensitive time&rdquo;.  Cattle prices have remained at record loss making levels.  A nightmare scenario has been visited on winter finishers in particular &mdash; so much for the Minister's psychological boost.</P>
    <P>To date the Minister has not delivered on the promise he made last June to implement a special package to enable the processing sector survive the pressure of the sterling crisis.  Vital investment planned under the operational programme, which was launched at least five times during the Minister's time in office, has not gone ahead. Investment of up to £660 million was envisaged to maintain the competitiveness of the Irish food sector.  Will the Minister confirm that the basic assumptions and targets laid down under that programme were based on an exchange rate of 97p or 98p against £1 sterling? From talking to major players in the food industry I am aware that not only have proposed investments been deferred, but they have been postponed until such time as the exchange rate disadvantage with our major market is resolved.  The £660 million investment package will be pie in the sky for as long as the exchange rate between the punt and sterling remains at its present level. Those who examine the risk-reward ratio will not invest.  Factories are on short time, opportunities and jobs have been lost and existing jobs are at risk.</P>
    <P>Since last Autumn export refunds have been slashed by an unprecedented 35 per cent.  As nine out of ten of our cattle population must be exported and 60 per cent to countries outside the EU, the impact of that 35 per cent slash has been enormous.  Cattle farmers have been devastated.  Cattle bought last September at 106p and 107p per pound are being sold at 98p per pound and more <Col N="2059" /> than 13,000 people who specialise in beef finishing have been affected.</P>
    <P>How can the industry survive and prosper if farmers receive only 98p per pound having bought cattle at that price and fed them over the winter?  No business could service that sort of pressure. Taking into account the months of winter feeding, this represents a loss of more than £70 per head for steers, not to mention the loss on cattle.  Teagasc figures show that a price of 105p or 106p per pound is required if farmers are to break even.  To make a profit of £30 per head farmers need a price of 109p per pound for cattle.</P>
    <P>A loss of £70 per head on 460,000 steer spread over the springtime amounts to more than £32 million, and this is assuming that the situation does not get any worse.  However, there is every indication that it will get worse. Taking refund available, the price of cattle last autumn, the refund now available and the present price of cattle, the price at the beginning of March will be between 92p-94p per pound.  The situation is about to deteriorate, yet no policy decision has been taken and no influence has been exerted where the decisions are taken to alleviate the situation. In the hope that the situation will improve farmers have naturally held back their stock.  There is now a glut of cattle and these will soon have to be sent to the market.  Given the lower export refunds in operation and the lack of competition from the live trade, there is a real fear that prices will fall further. So much for the Minister's psychological boost.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a clear political responsibility for this enveloping calamity.  He is out of touch with what is happening in Brussels and out of tune with how things are done here.  It is clear that his eye has been off the ball.  He was repeatedly warned of the effects of the succession of reductions in export refunds of the price of cattle but he repeatedly ignored these warnings.  As recently as last December the Minister said he did not expect &ldquo;the new level of <Col N="2060" /> refunds to have any immediate effect on cattle prices&rdquo;.  Anyone who doubts the scale of the Minister's miscalculation should look at what is known as statement No. 257 of 1995 from his Department. One thing we are not short of is press statements from the Minister's office.  The Minister's assertion was the latest in a line of assurances to farmers that cattle prices would not be affected. Those assurances have now been shown to be totally false.  Damningly, those same assurances were as false then as they are now.  The fault of farmers, if fault it is, is that they took the Minister at his word and they are now paying collectively with their livelihoods.  The Minister is directly responsible for minimum losses of £32 million this spring.</P>
    <P>The problem relating to export refunds is a political one.  The decisions to reduce the refunds since last autumn have been taken by the EU Beef Management Committee.  This committee, which is a bureaucratic part of the Commission, has successfully undermined the political decisions of the Council of Ministers.  In April 1994 the Council decided on a price guide regime of 106p per pound.  Ascribing their decision to problems with GATT, the management committee has repeatedly undermined that decision while the politicians who are supposed to be masters of the situation have claimed they can do nothing about it.  There is no greater apologist than the Minister who has stood idly by. If as he says &mdash; and sadly we have no reason to doubt him &mdash; he has no support at Council level then the most serious questions must be asked about the political competence of this Administration. The Minister further undermined his position and that of farmers by deciding to engage in a slagging match with the Commissioner.  One does not score points in Brussels by playing to the peanut gallery at home.</P>
    <P>The beef sector faces further threats to its future.  For example, the future of the vital deseasonalisation premium is now in doubt.  This hard won success by the Minister's predecessor is worth £60 <Col N="2061" /> per head on slaughter between 1 September and 30 November.  Qualification depends upon 40 per cent or more of annual slaughter taking place between these dates during the year before last. This premium has been vital in redressing traditional imbalances in production and dealing with the seasonality problem.  Last year Ireland feel below the 40 per cent threshold.  When I tabled questions on this issue I was given many assurances.  The Minister put forward a proposal to reduce the threshold to 35 per cent.  His lack of success can be evaluated by measuring the difference between the 35 per cent threshold sought and the proposal on offer.  The unsatisfactory offer of a 38 per cent threshold will, in turn, be made less acceptable by the proposed financing of same by a 40 per cent cut in the premium. People look in amazement at these negotiations and wonder how well the Irish case has been put, not to mention how it has been accepted.</P>
    <P>Additional financing for this proposal will come from a cut in the 22 month premium.  The 1994 farm survey shows that 84,000 farmers collected a 22 month premium on 816,000 cattle while 12,000 farmers collected a deseasonalisation premium on 220,000 cattle.  Farmers are going from the frying pan into the fire. Significantly, these are the first concrete proposals brought forward to mitigate the MacSharry reforms.  The Minister has failed, not just to get something more but to hold on to what was negotiated by his predecessor.  Following on the heels of a major tactical defeat on the issue of export refunds, beef producers are now being walked into a strategic débâcle by the Minister on the issue of the deseasonalisation premium.</P>
    <P>Prices have been further depressed by a lack of real competition from the live trade.  Farm gate prices have always been boosted by the competition between factories and the live trade. The cut in export refunds has hit the live trade particularly hard.  We export 70 per cent of our cattle to third countries while our main markets are in the Middle East.  To date this year total live <Col N="2062" /> exports are down a whopping 30 per cent on the same period last year.  Certain markets, particularly Egypt, have been decimated and the market share so unnecessarily thrown away will be very difficult to regain.  Inexplicably, the market to Turkey has not been opened up. There was media speculation today that significant progress has been made &mdash; the spin doctors have been at work again.  For the sake of those depending on the trade I sincerely hope that this is not another false dawn.  I challenge the Minister to say when the trade to Turkey will be opened up as any delays will impact on the long suffering beef farmers.</P>
    <P>The live trade has been further hampered by the application of new regulations on animal welfare introduced by the Minister.  Fianna Fáil has always supported balanced regulations on animal welfare but there is something seriously wrong when boats are tied up for months on end as a result of bureaucratic decisions.  When one considers that six boats which previously worked the trade out of Ireland have been disbarred under the new regulations and are now working the trade out of other EU countries then questions must be asked about the Minister's agenda. These facts were confirmed to the Minister as recently as last evening by representatives of the trade and thus far he has not attempted a rebuttal.  Where exactly has he drawn the balance between animal, farmer and factory welfare?</P>
    <P>The problems in the processing sector were well under way before the Minister allowed the débâcle of the export refund reductions to arise.  He recognised this last summer when he promised to introduce a special package of measures to help the food industry by tackling the disparity with sterling.  The Minister is good at making promises but that industry and the thousands of jobs dependent on it are still awaiting the Minister's package.  Leading people in the industry lobbied the Minister for Finance and this Minister prior to the budget to see if they were prepared to <Col N="2063" /> give recognition to this labour-intensive industry whose main market is the UK &mdash; 75 per cent of the consumer food sector exports into that market.  The Budget Statement contained six meaningless lines on our biggest industry which showed, as <i>The Irish Times</i> cartoonist aptly illustrated, that when Labour and Democratic Left drew up the budget, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry were out making the tea.</P>
    <P>Because of the Minister's inertia there is a major question mark over the achievement of targets set out in the food sub-programme.  The assumptions for those investments are based on a valuation of 97 to 98 English pence to one Irish pound; the current position is £1.04 Sterling to £1 Irish.  In essence, many of the areas targeted for growth in sectors such as prepared consumer foods, the cheese industry, vacuum packed beef and processed meats were strongly targeted for a push in UK sales. People in those sectors have asked how they can increase sales when our currency policy puts them at an 8 per cent disadvantage over and above other problems in initially penetrating the market.  That is having a significant impact on producer price at the farm gate.  The targets were drawn up when the punt was 94 pence against sterling. The Minister recognised the problem &mdash; he is good at doing that and at saying what he was going to do, but he is also good at doing nothing about it.  If that sounds familiar from the Minister, Deputy Yates, that is because it is.</P>
    <P>In the critical area of imposed costs, such as employer's PRSI at 12.5 per cent versus 7.2 per cent in the UK, this Government has ignored the food sector generally and the beef processing industry in particular.  Specifically, the increase of the PRSI threshold from £12,000 to £13,000 failed to capture any significant number of food industry employees.  In many cases, any benefit in the measure was wiped out by the increase in the ceiling.  This time of opportunity for expansion is being lost <Col N="2064" /> by a Government which cannot grasp the big picture.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the beef sector is a manmade disaster.  Political ineptitude on a colossol scale is resulting in losses which are already being counted in tens of millions of pounds.  It is increasingly likely, according to predictions by everyone in the industry, that worse is still to come. The beef sector is the single largest component of the Irish economy but it is being chronically mismanaged at the political level.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had recognised reality when everyone else did much could have been avoided but unfortunately his agenda did not extend beyond good news.  Soon it will not even include that, because reality is biting quicker and harder than anticipated.  No sooner had the Minister announced the end of the &ldquo;cheques in the post&rdquo; era than the Commission announced proposals which effectively signal the dismantling of the MacSharry reforms.  Fianna Fáil rejects the Minister's policy of unilateral disarmament on common agricultural policy, because it bodes disaster.  If lost ground is to be recovered &mdash; and there is a great deal lost already &mdash; the Minister must construct a credible agenda at EU level.  We have already paid too high a price for the benefit of hindsight.</P>
    <P>On export refunds, as there are 700,000 tonnes at present with 24 weeks left it is clear March will be a big month, depending how the next beef management committee meeting goes.  The Minister should not be chronological or clinical in examining the problem &mdash; he now has the privilege, as a member of the Irish Government, to do something about it.  Farmers are not prepared to listen to more tales of woe.  They expect those who were quick to take responsibility to come up with the goods.</P>
    <P>It should be argued that the Irish case is unique with no parallel among EU partners and must be addressed in the interest of maintaining the single most important component of our biggest industry.  There are too many farm families who cannot rely on rhetoric.  They cannot go to bank managers and refer <Col N="2065" /> to a statement which claims a psychological boost.  We seek a proper price for a good product.  The Minister should not allow the further dismantling of hard won gains; he should maintain the successes achieved by his predecessors until someone else gets the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Beef is the least remunerative farming sector.  It has come through difficult times in the past few years but incomes are now hitting an all-time low.  Many people have become involved in beef farming because they are excluded from other sectors, including young farmers without milk quotas and people who ventured into alternative farming and found it did not pay.</P>
      <P>Beef farming has suffered a collapse. Neighbours of mine bought cattle for £70 to £80 more than they can get for them and they have no allowance for feed.  Many also kept cattle over in anticipation of slaughter premia in the spring.  About 40,000 people are affected, which is a sizable proportion of the numbers involved in farming.  Most of those people bought in store cattle and therefore have not been able to avail of suckler cow, beef cow or ten month premia.  They are totally dependent on the 20 month premium or, if they sell within the period, the slaughter premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is disappointed at the outcome of the EU beef management committee meeting on 26 January.  It was anticipated that the Minister would secure something for farmers.  However, the committee failed to put forward proposals. There will be a 30 to 35 per cent loss on the premium with no hope for improvement.  We were told efforts to structure the beef industry would ensure continuity of supply for the slaughter plants, thus securing worth-while employment, and our green image would result in European markets queuing up to buy our meat.  In the past three months the industry has destabilised and there is a serious lack of confidence. The EU has attributed this to the BSE scare and currency fluctuations. <Col N="2066" /> The Department and the Minister must, therefore, make an extra effort to offset the difficulties by improving in other areas.</P>
    <P>About two months ago when the market was beginning to fluctuate I tabled a question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry asking his views on the reduction in factory prices of beef. He replied:</P>
    <P>Factory prices for all grades of cattle have fallen slightly recently as a result of a number of factors, most notably the uncertainty surrounding the level of export refunds to third countries, the impact of the BSE scare on beef consumption in the United Kingdom and the reduction in demand for cow beef in France. However, it should be recognised that cattle prices have been at satisfactory levels this year.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that in my view the lower refunds should have only a limited effect on cattle prices over the next couple of months because the bulk of the trade in that period will be conducted with the help of refunds which were fixed at higher levels.</P>
    <P>We were told that consistently in the House.  An assurance was given that it would have only an insignificant effect. The Minister concluded his reply by saying:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am concerned about the longer-term implications of the lower level of refunds and I will continue to press the Commission to have refunds fixed at more realistic levels.</P>
    <P>His efforts at the meeting on 26 January were wasted because he was unsuccessful in making his case to the Commission. He should use his considerable influence with beef processing plants, which have received so much and have been spoon-fed over the years, receiving grant aid from the IDA, FEOGA, etc. He said in the House he would talk to the representatives of the meat procesing plants.  Either the Minister was not persuasive enough or they were very <Col N="2067" /> obstinate, but we finished up with a stalemate and no improvements.  I watched the papers afterwards to see if the beef plants had upped the price of beef because of presure from the Minister but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>I tabled another question in February 1996 about the price of beef during the month of January in each of the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 to which the Minister replied that the price per pound in 1994 was £1.11, in 1995 it was £1.05 and in 1996 it was £0.98.  That is about £140 an animal.  At that time beef producers said they were sailing very close to the wind by buying in cattle at high prices. How can they hope to survive now the price has come down to 98p a pound?</P>
    <P>During that period there was a substantial increase in the cost of feed.  I happened to be in a feed co-operative recently and remarked how few tractors and link boxes were coming for bulk meal.  I was told farmers were not feeding their cows because there was an oversupply of milk and most of them were over their quota, and that the beef men have no beef in their sheds this year.  A neighbour of mine, one of the best farmers in the country, who five years ago would not have thought of leaving an animal out during the winter, who has good quality feed houses with slatted floors and slurry tanks underneath, has left his cattle to stray through the fields.  This is happening on two farms I know of owned by good farmers who years ago would not have dreamed of doing that in winter.  Instead of sending cattle to a beef factory and creating employment, they are letting their cattle out in the hope that there will be an improvement in prices later in the year. This is a serious situation but the people in the beef business have no alternative.</P>
    <P>We hear much about operational programmes. We have been pressing for a review of these programmes in the context of the peace initiative.  The peace initiative has now gone and we do not have as good a case, but a review of the operational programmes is necessary. We were told that they would not be <Col N="2068" /> reviewed until mid-1997 and the reason given was that Fianna Fáil brought them in.  Fianna Fáil brought in those programmes in a time of progress.  Now it is a completely different ball game and those programmes should be reviewed in the context of the present conditions.</P>
    <P>Currency fluctuations were mentioned. No one has a better realisation of the problems caused by currency fluctuations than the poultry, mushroom and beef industries.  Many plants are not slaughtering plants but are involved in the downstream processing of meat and the preparation of foods to be sent abroad on a daily basis in massive volumes. The currency fluctuations are seriously affecting those industries.  At one of the poultry plants the producers, who have not had a rise for many years, were asked to take a cut of 20 per cent in their production fees in order to hold on to hard-earned markets in England. We must face the problems head on. The Minister has not done so.  If we want to ensure continuity in the beef industry he must act quickly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorse the measures which have already been taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the difficulties being experienced by beef producers, commends efforts by the Minister to secure a full restoration of export refunds and welcomes the measures contained in the Structural Fund Food Sub-Programme and in the recent budget to improve the competitiveness of the beef industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to propose this amendment because it gives me an opportunity to inform the House about the background to the problems being experienced by beef producers and of my efforts, and those of my Department, to <Col N="2069" /> secure the restoration of export refunds to realistic levels.</P>
    <P>I listened patiently to the Opposition's contributions.  They articulated the problems but, unfortunately, there was not one new idea or realistic proposal that I could advance in my campaign.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the difficult income position faced by our beef producers, particularly winter fatteners, which has arisen following the various reductions in export refunds last autumn. I do not need to be convinced of their vulnerability or their importance and role in ensuring an orderly flow of throughput for the beef sector. However, we need to see this problem in its proper context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen mentioned the negotiating achievements of my predecessor and I will now refer to some of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the problem has its origin in the GATT which was concluded in December 1993 and came into force on 1 July 1995. Under this agreement the volume of subsidised beef exports from the European Union has to be reduced by 21 per cent over the period of the agreement, which runs until the year 2000, and EU expenditure on export subsidies has to be reduced by 36 per cent over the same period.  In practical terms, the GATT commitment means that beef exports from the European Union must be reduced from 1.3 million tonnes in 1993 to 1.12 million tonnes in the first year of the agreement which runs from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 and to just over 800,000 tonnes by the end of the GATT period in the year 2000.  This commitment seemed quite daunting at the time the GATT negotiations were being concluded, particularly in view of the level of production in Europe and with over 1 million tonnes of beef in intervention. However, beef production has fallen substantially in the European Union in the meantime because of the ceiling imposed on imports of calves from third <Col N="2070" /> countries and the reduction in the number of dairy cows.  This enabled the European Union to dispose of virtually all of its intervention stocks without disrupting the market before the commencement of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Given the improvement in the balance of the beef market, combined with the elimination of intervention stocks, there was good reason to believe that the GATT agreement would not pose any major difficulties, at least in the initial stages.  However, I am extremely disappointed that the optimism has not been fulfilled and that the Commission has felt it necessary to take action to ensure that export licences issued do not exceed the GATT ceiling.  Compliance with the GATT ceiling is controlled on the basis of export licences issued rather than on the basis of actual physical exports.  In view of this, the level of export licences issued is monitored very carefully.  During the early autumn, the Commission took the view that the level of licences issued was excessive and it adopted a number of measures to discourage exporters from taking out export licences too far in advance of physical export.  Since September I rigorously opposed these measures at the Council, often without much support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission partially reversed the 25 per cent cut on 1 December when export refunds were increased by 14 per cent.  I made clear at the time that the increase was insufficient and raised the matter directly with Commissioner Fischler and at the Council in January where I impressed on the Commissioner and my colleagues the need for an immediate increase in refunds to ensure adequate returns for our beef producers particularly those specialising in winter fatteners.  My Department also raised the matter at the beef management committee and in bilateral contacts with senior Commission officials.  When Deputy Leonard <Col N="2071" /> referred to a meeting held on 26 January he omitted to state that on 2 February refunds were increased by between 5 per cent and 7.5 per cent.  In that decision the Commission took account of my specific request for a higher increase on male hindquarter cuts, fresh and chilled, which are of particular importance to Irish beef exporters.</P>
      <P>I do not consider these increases are or were the full solution to the price difficulties faced by producers but they represented some progress on an issue on which I had very little support initially.</P>

      <P>I did not ask one person to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also showed a change of attitude on the part of the Commission.  The fact that the validity period has been further shortened is also helpful in that it removes the scope for speculation in licences which was very much part of the problem in the first place.  In recent weeks licences were given out by other traders rather than the Commission.  I remain fully committed on this issue and have used every avenue open to me to press the case for restoration or refunds to levels which make Irish beef competitive on international markets and which will underpin a price level for our producers that will provide them with a reasonable return on their investment and effort.  Cattle prices should remain relatively stable for the immediate <Col N="2072" /> future because beef exporters are currently operating from licences which were prefixed at the higher rates which prevailed up to mid-November.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard mentioned my meeting with beef producers.  I was told some weeks ago that if certain events did not occur beef prices would collapse by 10p per pound.  I maintained that there were adequate prefixations in the system to ensure that pre-November levels of refunds would ensure higher prices could be paid and there was no basis for a cut given the level of prefixations taken out last week.  I strongly maintain that view and, as we see, prices did not drop this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand over it.  These higher rate prefixations are generally in adequate supply to cover exports until the end of this month and this has been borne out by events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also highlighted the fact that the European Union is in danger of being pushed out of certain important markets.  I am referring in particular to Egypt, a major market both for beef and live cattle where ground is being lost to non-EU suppliers, particularly Australia. I believe that a number of other member states share that concern and I intend to press that dimension more directly over the next week or so.  Any significant loss of market share could have serious implications for the balance in the beef market in the EU.  I will be discussing the situation with my Council colleagues and in bilateral discussions with Commissioner Fischler next week.  During the coming days I will visit Paris to discuss the matter with my colleague, the French Minister for Agriculture, who has given us the best support of any other member state.  This is not an issue which can be fought in isolation.  The attitude and support of <Col N="2073" /> other beef producing member states is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>We have been making strenuous efforts to agree workable arrangements with the Turkish authorities in regard to the export of live cattle to that market. In discussions with my officials I arranged for Ambassador Joe Small to go from Rome to visit the Turkish authorities in Ankara.  I am pleased to say that over recent weeks we have made progress in this regard.  As Members know, they define cattle in three categories: breeding, fattening and slaugthering. For the latter category, which is of most benefit to us, there was a condition which was not being sought by other third country importers that there would be a quarantine restriction for a period before import.  That has now been relaxed.  This progress has removed one of the major obstacles and discussions are now focused on getting the elements of a practical and acceptable veterinary certificate agreed with the veterinary authorities in Turkey.  I believe a final solution is in sight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tantalisingly close, just like the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether the links between Germany and Turkey will make that market a viable option, given the trade and ethnic links between the two countries.  However, I was lobbied some weeks ago by the IFA to make a major push for live exports in this regard and I am glad to say that there has been some progress.</P>
      <P>I have consistently made clear that I regard the role of the live export trade as a vital one in bringing the element of competition into the market.  There is certainly a case that the live trade is at a disadvantage when the DSP is in operation and I have put this point to Commissioner Fischler.  This country is the dominant exporter of live cattle from the EU.  Therefore, it follows that any upward adjustment in live refunds will benefit us disproportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen referred to the welfare issue.  I inherited a situation <Col N="2074" /> whereby substantial and serious losses and fatalities of cattle had, in effect, been undisclosed to the public and were leaked in newspaper reports this time last year.  The whole credibility of the live trade was put in some doubt. Through assiduous work by my officials and veterinary specialists we have now adopted the Australian rules for non-EU transport and implemented the rules for EU transport for other livestock. We now have the most credible rules for a legitimate, long-term trade in live cattle.  As long as there is a surplus of cattle and beef in Europe, in terms of consumption over production, I will unequivocally support that trade to give a floor price to cattle and a balance to the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear to the Commission over the past months that I do not agree with its approach of managing the GATT ceiling through the use of the export refund system.  The Secretary of my Department has been engaged in detailed discussions in Copenhagen and Paris, at my request, to ensure that for both the dairy and beef sectors we will have a more orderly management approach for the remaining five years of the GATT in relation to export refunds.  I believe the Commission has become unnecessarily obsessed with the levels of prefixation. There are easier and betters ways of ensuring that the limits are respected. We have put forward detailed alternative proposals including, for example, a further shortening of the period of validity of export licences in order to discourage speculation.  I am pleased that the Commission has adopted this proposal, somewhat belatedly perhaps, but I am extremely disappointed that it has not acted on my request to restore refunds to realistic levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For its part, the Commission has argued that cattle prices on the Continent are extremely strong at present and <Col N="2075" /> a further increase in refunds would overheat the market, leading eventually to a reduction in beef consumption as beef becomes uncompetitive compared to other meats, particularly white meat. The reality is that the price of young bulls in other member states has actually increased in recent months in spite of the cuts in refunds and is currently at 87 per cent of the intervention price.  It is proving extremely difficult in these circumstances to persuade the Commission that export refunds need to be increased further.  Most importantly, the fact that 38,000 tonnes of beef was prefixed in less than a week, from last Monday to last Thursday, with more than a fair share at 13,000 tonnes from this country, did not make an increase in refunds at last Friday's management committee a very realistic possibility. That totally understates the case &mdash; I had no technically credible case to advance, given the levels of prefixation which were well in advance of the weekly GATT divided quota of 22,000 tonnes per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that arising out of that we have to refocus our efforts on the live trade because the level of prefixation was not so high for that and we accounted for over 60 per cent of the 500,000 live animals exported from the EU last year.  Therefore, I am pursuing a credible strategy which is the likely way to get progress on the issue and the real way to ensure that the people who need stability in beef prices and viability as winter fatteners can be best protected.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also put forward the argument that cattle prices have been too high in recent years, particularly in the context of CAP reform which envisaged a 15 per cent reduction in cattle prices over the three years from 1993 to 1995.  It is now evident that part of the Commission's agenda is to ensure that cattle prices are brought down to what it sees as more realistic levels and that premia are factored into the pricing system.  Premia at their current level are worth 28p per lb.  That figure does not assume total usage of the DSP or the 22 month premium but is worked out on actual averages in utilisation.  The price of cattle prior to CAP reform was 99p per lb and premia were then worth 4.5p per lb.  It is easy to see, with premia at 28p and the current price at 99p per lb, where the Commission is coming from. It is not an issue we can ignore in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the reality that the balance of the EU beef market remains quite delicate and if we are to remain within the GATT ceiling on subsidised beef exports, beef consumption must remain at or above current levels.  The fall in consumption &mdash; which has been 1 per cent per annum in the EU or 10 per cent over the last decade &mdash; has consequences for compliance with the GATT ceiling.  The existence of the ceiling means that any EU surplus above <Col N="2078" /> the ceiling will have to be absorbed internally in the European Union, which would be a daunting prospect given that EU beef consumption has been in decline in recent years.  In other words, once we get at the turn of the century to 800,000 tonnes exported, there is nowhere else for it to go but within Europe.</P>
    <P>I have no quibble with the arguments about the value of the premia or the importance of maintaining consumption. However, my entire case and my major objection is the timing of the Commission's approach.  The cut was too steep and sudden for a strategic group of winter fatteners, which is the case we are pursuing.  It has affected a group of producers who, by definition, have high costs and have been left totally exposed to the turn in the market.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the price of store cattle has been good.  I fully accept that the store producer is entitled to a reasonable return similar to any other element in the beef sector.  However &mdash; I want to be explicit about this &mdash; I question the wisdom of paying high prices for store cattle without taking into account longer term considerations and prospects.</P>

      <P>There have been adverse comments in recent times about the use of illegal substances.  This is not a new problem, neither is it a peculiarly Irish phenomenon.  Virtually every member state has problems with illegal residues, as was shown by a recent Belgian survey. Comments by some people who should know better &mdash; I refer particularly to a former officer of the IVU &mdash; that the problem is being swept under the carpet are utterly untrue.  I will be making further announcements in this regard later in the week.  It is easy to get cheap publicity by making sweeping allegations, thereby damaging the beef industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To allege that one-quarter of animals have been treated with illegal substances is not only utterly fallacious but irresponsible.  There are no facts to show that is the case.  If Dr. Dargan and others cannot put up, which they patently cannot do, they should simply shut up.  We operate an extensive testing regime, with 86,500 samples taken in 1995, which is substantial by any standard. We have the most draconian system of any country in Europe in terms of legislation to deal with illegal substances. I have stepped up the activity of the special unit and elaborate testing facilities are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sampling results show that there is a relatively minor problem, with a small hard core of offenders.  The State <Col N="2081" /> has not backed away from tackling the problem.  I want to issue a simple message to those using illegal substances &mdash; the law will proceed in a direct line. There will be absolutely no escape from the rigours of the law.  As soon as the Supreme Court judgment is given in the animal remedies case &mdash; I hope it avails of the tough measures that are available &mdash; we will move to final adjudication on those issues.</P>

About 60 to 70 per cent of farmers, a greater percentage than in any other country, receive the extensification premium.  The 22 month premium for bull beef, which does not operate across the Community, is of <Col N="2082" /> greater benefit to Ireland than any other country.  We are seeking a special deal on refunds, we got a special deal for the sheep sector and I am seeking a further special concession in the price package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the deseasonalisation premium.  We have already put forward a proposal for a 35 per cent threshold.  Taking the island as a whole, which the Commission wants to do, the threshold would have to be reduced to 34 per cent, which is almost not a seasonality problem. I will not support the price package, which is separate from the refund issue, unless we get clarity on that issue and we receive a further special concession. It is facile at best and simplistic at worst for Deputies to think that Brussels will give Ireland another special deal on a monthly basis.  The system does not and will not work like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry fights at EU level to protect the largest element of the economy.  He must know that he is facing a crisis which will have a detrimental effect on the agricultural industry and on the many individuals who will have to sustain large financial losses in the beef sector.  The Minister must fight to fully restore export refunds for carcase beef and live cattle to the levels which applied last September. The massive cuts introduced by the EU Commission have destabilised the market and cattle prices.  The Minister's inertia has been compounded by his failure to have the refunds fully restored at the EU beef management committee meeting last week.  Cattle prices have been at record loss making levels.  What does the Minister propose to do regarding his promise to <Col N="2084" /> implement a special package to help the processing sectors survive the pressure of the sterling crisis?  The Minister must garner support from his colleagues in the Council of Ministers to offset the views of the Commission expressed through the EU beef management committee. What will happen to the deseasonalisation premium?</P>
      <P>Tonight Deputy Cowen pointed out that in 1995 Ireland fell below the 40 per cent threshold.  Surely the Minister is not prepared to accept the offer of a 38 per cent threshold.  Does he realise the crisis that will arise if there is a cut in the 22 month premium?  The 1994 figures reveal that 96,000 farmers collected the deseasonalisation and 22 month premiums. The Minister must recognise Ireland's unique position given that we export more than 70 per cent of our steer beef to world markets.  Irish cattle prices are much more sensitive to cuts in export refunds than those in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be prepared to take the fight to Brussels.  It is not enough for him to say he understands the problem, he must demonstrate that by positive action.  The Minister should remember he is not a spokesperson for the Commission in Ireland, but is the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in Brussels.  I hope he acts and fights on behalf of Irish beef producers with that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will welcome the opportunity to discuss this important question for our winter feeders and store producers.  We are all aware of the demands made by the IFA and other farm lobby groups during recent weeks.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the problem posed by the cut in export refunds last November.  At that time the Minister did not realise its consequences for the beef industry or its retrograde effect on winter fatteners.  His talk about efforts to stabilise the market is falling on deaf ears.  It is easy to see that we are taking the brunt of the changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> Last week's CBF bulletin indicates that Irish prices have dropped by as much as 13 per cent.  The number of changes that have occurred is frightening. It is alarming that such price decreases did not affect the other part of this island where there has been only a 0.5 per cent decrease since last year. That begs the question, what is really happening?  The total cost and a sizeable handling charge as a result of the sterling crisis is obviously being passed back to farmers and an extra 2p or 3p is being taken on top of impact of the sterling crisis.  That is damaging.</P>
    <P>A sizeable section of our market is being taken by our near neighbour.  The increase in British beef exports to EU destinations in 1995 was 440,000 tonnes, representing an 11 per cent increase. How much of that market share was taken from this country?  Are we not making full use of and getting the full benefit from what we have to sell?  We sell a premium product, but as of now we are getting anything but a premium price for it.  The cuts in export refunds are beginning to bite.</P>
    <P>The Minister can talk about the amount of prefixation taken up in November and last week and about Turkey. If he wants to talk about Turkey he should refer to the questions I tabled to him well before Christmas to inquire what he was doing to open that market when this problem was looming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan forgets that we were trying to establish where the best market prospects lay for Irish beef in view of the crisis that was looming. The best market for the Irish product appeared to be Turkey, in which we did not have a market share.  A number of exporters sought departmental intervention as early as last September and October to clear certification, but there appeared to be a go-slow in the Department. I am delighted that at last the Minister realised that market could have been tapped and would have been worth another 5p or 6p a pound to Irish farmers.  We have now lost much of our live trade to Egypt.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year our live cattle exports have fallen by 30.7 per cent to non-continental EU countries, by one-third to Northern Ireland and by 77.7 per cent to continental Europe.  Our live export trade to all destinations has decreased by between one-third and three-quarters.  That is a serious problem.  If we lose our live trade farmers will lose their competitive advantage and we will not be able to maintain a minimum price for our beef.</P>
      <P>I was surprised the Minister quoted the price of bulls in Europe when his German counterpart is looking for an increase of 14 per cent in the premiums paid on bull beef at the expense of the 22 month premium paid to our farmers. I am delighted the Minister agreed to oppose that proposal at the price fixing meeting.  That proposal would have serious consequences for the future livelihoods of Irish beef producers.</P>

    <P>The Minister talked about lobbying his counterparts.  It is important that he should start with his nearest neighbour, his British counterpart, who stated recently that there is a need for a further reduction in the prices and the support mechanism for beef and other agricultural products.  That is something <Col N="2087" /> he should bring to his British counterpart's notice prior to the price fixing meeting.</P>
    <P>Refund cuts are cited as part of our problem, but they are not the bulk of it. We have not fully promoted the product we have to sell, nor have we exploited the existing live export markets.  As the Minister said, Turkey is prepared to accept processed as well as live beef; they want to buy Irish produce.  Our standard is second to none within Europe but its image has been damaged by some recent comments not in the best interests of farmers or anyone else in the meat or livestock trade.  Some such comments reported in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on Sunday last were an absolute disgrace; it is a pity somebody does not take that paper to task, its articles are usually based on rumour as far as Irish agriculture is concerned.  Indeed, such articles did more damage to our farming in the past 12 to 18 months than was done by the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry.</P>
    <P>We are looking at a scenario in need of urgent remedial action, the most important of which being the total revision of beef export credit refunds which must be reinstated to their pre-November levels.  Indeed a headline in today's <i>Farming Independent</i> entitled &ldquo;No refunds rise, so plants warn of price drop&rdquo; is an attempt to prepare farmers for the next knock, advising them to take their profit now by selling and purchasing cheaper store cattle later.  While not realistic, that is what is being preached by some who see their main competitors fulfilling some of their contracts from mainland Europe rather than from Ireland, leading to an enormously damaging long-term effect on our beef industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister must insist on the full restoration of the beef export credit refunds.  We can talk all we like about conditions in an ideal world but present market conditions are costing winter beef producers anything between £70 and £100 per head.  Perhaps that is why some are being driven to resort to the <Col N="2088" /> type of action, about which there have been allegations, endeavouring to meet their bank manager's requirements.  It appears that some have resorted to what would not be regarded as proper farming practices, leading to an increase in the number of animals suspected of having been administered illegal growth promoters.</P>
    <P>That leads one to question what will be the Minister's attitude in current European Union discussions in regard to such hormones which were available here some years ago.  Perhaps had those illegal drugs been properly controlled we might not have the present illegal trade in such animal growth promoters which is not in anybody's interests.  We must remember that such practices do not take place in Ireland alone but throughout the European Union and that farmers in other member states flout the law to a much greater extent than is alleged to be the case here.  I say &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; because its incidence here is not nearly as prevalent as some people suggest.</P>
    <P>On the winter fattening of beef, everybody realises that while prices have decreased, the cost of inputs has risen, frightening when one bears in mind the approximately 20 per cent increase in the cost of compound feed. We may choose to blame world grain prices but, if and when prices rise on one side to the detriment of the other, one must ask what is being done to balance the books?  For example, what will the Minister say when he meets Commissioner Fischler next week?  Will Commissioner Fischler point out to the Minister that he gave a sheep deal on the understanding that the Minister would not be returning.  It is being said in certain sectors of the European agricultural community that the Minister sold beef producers for sheep producers in the knowledge that the latter would be of greater benefit to his constituents.</P>
    <P>We face much greater transportation costs of live shipments or processed beef than some of our European counterparts, still perceived as a supplier of a natural, wholesome product, a green <Col N="2089" /> product, but we are not obtaining the premia obtained in other sectors.  When one sees premia of 10 pence to 15 pence per pound paid for certain types of beef in Great Britain produced in a more friendly manner it makes one question what we must do to capture a portion of that market.  We have concentrated on the large, bulk commodity for too long. For example, intervention obtained for too long; the APS and other facilities were used and abused.  There is urgent need for a proper marketing strategy in the sale of our beef.  Since there is talk of an approximate 30 per cent reduction in the amount of beef that may be exported from the European Union post-2000, we must concentrate on infiltrating the European market.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks of making more money available for marketing purposes to An Bord Bia, he does not appear to realise that it is of no consequence. Instead there is need for a prolonged attack on the premium end of the market within Europe in an effort to maintain prices.  However, we find ourselves at the other end of the market that does not yield adequate returns. The recent award by the European Commission of £446,000 to An Bord Bia under the European quality beef promotion scheme is minimal.  If the Minister is not prepared to invest at least 1 per cent of the product in its marketing he will not reap the premia there for the taking or obtain the premium price.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously we need to infiltrate that market and reinstate export credit refunds to their former level.  The Minister can talk all he likes about the amount prefixed last week which was done in sheer panic.  I must warn him that there is panic within the beef industry, a fear that prices could worsen. Indeed, the Minister, factories and everybody else in the industry have been talking down prices in recent times while the margins for those involved in production have not decreased and will not irrespective of price levels.</P>
    <P>At the Commission meeting in Brussels the Minister must fight for full restoration of refunds on live <Col N="2090" /> exports or state he will not be in a position to accept any part of the proposed price package.  The Minister told the House he would meet some of his European counterparts but it is crucial that he first meet his nearest neighbour who is predicting that we will not get any more; in fact he wants prices reduced. The Minister might be content with the tit-bit in <i>Farm Independent</i> reporting his enjoyment of &ldquo;Green Week&rdquo;, and pointing out that the British had not been represented but I should like to remind him the British had left with an extra 11 per cent exports and had no need to attend &ldquo;Green Week&rdquo;.  They left the Minister high and dry to entertain the lads, to buy the wine and give them free steaks.</P>

      <P>It is most unsatisfactory to initiate an Adjournment debate without the Minister being present to hear the views expressed.  The absence of a Minister is a gross discourtesy to the House.  However, I will proceed in the hope that the Minister, at some stage, will come in.</P>
      <P>There should be no need for this debate but, sadly, it is necessary because of increasing frustration at local level. There is also a feeling among parents, teachers and students of being let down. I am sure the Minister is aware that Kilrush Community School is situated on three different sites.  You will appreciate, a Cheann Comhairle, the time, safety elements and the disruption of school hours involved.</P>
      <P>The various schools got together and agreed to amalgamate.  At local level there was goodwill and a willingness to get on with the job.  However, those who have taken part in this very successful amalgamation now feel ignored by the Minister, indeed, they feel they are being fobbed off.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is evident that the Minister does not have the appropriate interest in this matter.  The people at local level were willing to get on with the amalgamation and yet this view was not reciprocated by the Minister.  They want me to tell the House that the approach adopted by the Minister would not encourage further amalgamations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the school on 5 February 1996.  The refurbishments, to say the least, are disappointing and do not come up to the standards expected.  This is <Col N="2092" /> due solely to the lack of financial commitment to this project by the Department of Education.  The unsatisfactory position regarding the refurbishment of the CBS secondary school building is as follows: the floors and stairs are in a poor condition, the ceilings were never intended to be exposed in the present manner, there are numerous leaks from radiators and numerous doors have not been replaced.  As the blackboards in the rooms are over 25 years old, they should be replaced, with the old notice boards.  The overall finish on the double lecture room is also poor with gaping holes for pipes.  Many windows have not been replaced, a number of existing windows cannot now be opened properly, due to pipework blocking them, and the hall windows cannot be closed. The chemistry lab needs to be totally refurbished.  Pipes at ground level in classrooms should be covered.  The boys' and girls' toilets need to be finished and all metal protrusions, which are a danger to health and safety, should be removed.  The designated computer room, next to the typing room, lacks proper sockets, etc., and the existing hall and stage floors need sanding and varnishing.</P>
    <P>This school should have been looking forward to the refurbishments being completed and, although we were informed by the Department that they had been, it is obvious not to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the recommendations re. stage II of phase II for Kilrush community school, the details of which have already been sent to the Department by the board of management. There is a need for enlargement of the gym to serve the surrounding area of west Clare.  There is a need for a language laboratory as this facility is in most new schools.  The social studies room should be knocked down and relocated. Greater office space is needed &mdash; at least four more offices &mdash; and the reception office needs to be enlarged.  Photocopying and printing facilities, which are essential for teachers, should be located in the staff room.  The facilities for home <Col N="2093" /> economics must be addressed in detail by the Department, 12 individual units are needed and other details have been supplied by the board of management. Safety and fire regulations in regard to the assembly hall must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The parents and teachers at the three sites occupied by Kilrush community school are disillusioned as their good faith has not been reciprocated by the Minister.  I hope the Minister will respond positively and urgently to the matter of refurbishments in the CBS school to ensure the kind of finish promised by the Department and that the commitment to financing phase II is given unequivocally and gets under way without further delay.</P>
    <P>I again stress I am most disappointed, as will my constituents in the Kilrush area, that the Minister did not have the courtesy to come into the House to listen to the debate and to give her view of the matter.  This will not go down well, nor does it augur well for the plans for Kilrush community school.  It will be noted with sadness in my area.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the Minister who, unfortunately, because of another commitment, cannot be in the House.  I wish to outline for the Deputy and the information of the House the background to Kilrush community school.</P>
      <P>The second level schools in Kilrush &mdash; the Convent of Mercy, the Christian Brothers' school and the vocational school &mdash; have amalgamated to form a new community school.  The Department of Education completed the purchase in 1995 of property from the Christian Brothers in Kilrush for the purpose of providing a new community school.  The property comprised approximately a six and a half acre site and buildings of the Christian Brothers' primary and secondary schools, Kilrush, and the nine acres playing field nearby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> Phase I of the project involved refurbishment of the existing buildings.  This work was completed in September 1995 and the new school is continuing to use the existing accommodation at the school.  Phase II involves the provision of approximately 1,600 square metres of additional accommodation to cater for long-term enrolment of up to 450 pupils. The position regarding phase II of the project is that officials of the post-primary building unit are currently considering revised stage II documentation which relates to the outline sketch scheme for the project.  An official of the post-primary building unit will visit the school shortly to discuss the ongoing planning of the school.  When stage II documentation has been fully examined by the Department officials, the school will be authorised to proceed to the next stage of architectural planning.  At this stage it is not possible to indicate when the construction of the additional accommodation will commence.  Kilrush community school is one of a number of schools being considered for funding in the context of the 1996 capital programme for second-level schools.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the pressing need for the school accommodation in Kilrush and every effort will be made to ensure there are no delays in completing the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am grateful for this opportunity to raise a matter of great concern to the people of Portarlington and, in particular, to the families of approximately 200 workers whose livelihoods depend either directly or indirectly on Butler Engineering.  I know this concern is shared by Deputy Cowen and my other colleagues in the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this group of companies has seen good and lean times over the years, it has remained one of the major <Col N="2095" /> employers in the Portarlington area.  It came as a great shock to the town last Friday to learn that Mr. Ray Jackson had been appointed as receiver of Butler's. The ripples of fear and apprehension have spread throughout the community since then and I am asking the Minister on their behalf to tell us clearly that his Department, Forbairt and all the relevant State agencies are doing everything in their power to protect and preserve these jobs.</P>
    <P>The engineering sector within which Butler's operates is difficult and competitive. That the group has suffered, since the passing of the late Mr. Pat Butler, is not in doubt, neither is it any secret locally that the terms of the last State investment in the group were somewhat controversial, especially in relation to net job creation and lack of trade union representation in the newer part of the group.  Nevertheless, Butler Engineering has succeeded in competing for and winning much valuable business over the years, not only in Ireland but also abroad.  Examples of its work can be found at the TEAM Aer Lingus headquarters in Dublin Airport, the Riverside Stadium in Middlesborough and also at Hampden Park in Glasgow. Ireland needs modern technological companies such as this.</P>
    <P>The midlands region, which has dozens of engineering companies, many founded on skills built up over the years in firms like Bord na Móna and the ESB, needs major flagship firms such as Butler Engineering.  The tradition of high quality engineering skills which has grown up around this company must be protected and everything possible must be done to promote it and provide new jobs in the future.</P>
    <P>The town of Portarlington needs help from whatever quarter it can get it.  It has seen the loss of many jobs in traditional industries.  An example is the closure of the ESB power station some years ago.  Butler Engineering, along <Col N="2096" /> with another local factory, Arlington, provides the bulk of employment in the area.  People in the town are concerned but they are also fighting back.  Local students won this year's Aer Lingus Young Scientist Competition.  The local enterprise and tidy towns groups, and statutory bodies such as the county council and the County Enterprise Board, are trying to enhance the attractiveness of the town and build on its excellent road and rail links to attract new industry.  Their efforts would be dealt a body blow should the jobs at Butler's be lost.  This cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The legal situation regarding receivership or examinership has yet to be clarified.  That gives us time to act but whoever acts must ensure that the group continues to trade, that the jobs are protected and that the company is expanded.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to address this urgent issue.  I wish to acknowledge also the interest and concern shown by the Tánaiste, with whom I discussed the matter yesterday, and by the Minister for Labour Affairs, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who has agreed to my request to meet representatives of the workforce on the matter this Thursday.  Co-operation, hard work and urgent action are required to save the jobs, reassure the workers and their families and give some hope to the town of Portarlington. I hope the Minister of State can assure us that this will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gallagher for raising this important matter especially in so far as the employment of 140 people in Portarlington is at risk. Butler Engineering, based in Portarlington, County Laois, is a long established indigenous engineering company which has been engaged in structural steel fabrication for both the Irish and the UK markets.  It is by any standard a sizeable Irish company and in recent years it has <Col N="2097" /> been involved in a significant export trade to the UK market.  Employment at the Portarlington operation currently stands at 140.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, Butler Engineering has been experiencing trading difficulties for some time which, over a period, have led to substantial losses.  I fully appreciate the importance of the employment afforded and I assure Deputy Gallagher that for several years considerable efforts have been made by the relevant State agencies and financial institutions to assist in putting the plant on a more viable footing. Unfortunately, those considerable efforts have not proved successful to date.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, 16 February, a receiver was appointed to the group.  Yesterday, a petition was presented to the High Court for the appointment of an examiner and a court hearing for this appointment has been set for 26 February. Pending the hearing for this appointment, the company is under the protection of the court.  The Government fully recognises the importance of Butler Engineering both economically and socially, in particular for Portarlington, and the problems which could arise through any major job losses at the plant.  We acknowledge the important role a company of this size can play in the overall fabric of life in a town such a Portarlington.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies in the House that every effort is being made and will continue to be made to ensure a commercially viable solution can be found for the plant.  Forbairt will provide every assistance possible with a view to facilitating a restructuring or take over of the plant and the safeguarding of the optimum employment.  I am hopeful that the ongoing efforts will be successful at safeguarding the future of the plant.</P>
      <P>Butler Engineering has liabilities totalling £3.55 million to Forbairt, £2.5 million in capital grants and £1.05 million in preference shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter. I will shortly be 14 years a Member of this House and prior to that I spent 14 years working with the co-operative movement, in all facets of its industry, throughout Connacht and in County Clare.  I wish to express my support this evening for my local co-operative, the Midwest Farmers Co-Operative, in its efforts to protect the milk quota of its small suppliers throughout the west and the midlands.  I am delighted the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is in the House because last year he made a number of major pronouncements about ring fencing quotas in the west and in severely handicapped areas. I come from a county that has been classified as severely handicapped.  The Midwest Farmers Co-Operative is one of a number of small co-operatives in the west.  It has made a unique contribution to the development of our county and the entire western region over the years.</P>
      <P>Teagasc is a State organisation whose main goals are to raise the competitiveness of agriculture and the food industry, ensure the continuing viability of the maximum number of farmers on the land and stimulate development and employment in rural communities.  We have strongly supported Teagasc in the west as farmers, as a community and as a co-operative movement.  In the 1970s, Athenry co-operative mart, where I worked, co-operated with Teagasc in making available to it a herd of friesian cows interest free over a period at their research centre in Belclare, near Tuam. Teagasc subsequently decided to close down the Belclare research centre and transfer its activities to Athenry and elsewhere.  Prior to that it had closed down its operations in Creagh and Blindwell and were it not for Fianna Fáil in Government it would have extricated itself from most of its activities in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> The milk quota, originally consisting of 68,000 gallons, was created by western initiative on a farm managed and operated as a research centre by Teagasc.  Teagasc transferred its activities to Athenry Agricultural College &mdash; owned partly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Teagasc &mdash; which owns 640 acres of the best land in the west.  Prior to the amalgamation the college had a quota of 53,000 gallons and was then instructed by Teagasc to acquire extra cows to supplement the existing stock.</P>
    <P>During the past two years Teagasc has been considering what it should do with its operations in the west.  Negotiations have taken place in the past year between management and representatives of the Midwest Farmers Co-op and the managing director and some of the operational directors of Teagasc.  Agreement, satisfactory to both parties, was reached in May 1995 but Teagasc did not communicate with the Midwest Farmers Co-op until last week when its operations director indicated to the chief executive of the co-op that it now proposes to transfer 56,000 of the 68,000 gallon quota to their farm in Kilmaley, County Clare.  If this happens the suppliers to the Midwest Farmers Co-op will face an extra superlevy of 6 per cent as of 6 March, such is the volume of the quota being transferred.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister fulfil his commitment to ring fencing quotas in the west and his Government's commitment to the development of the west and ensure that Teagsc fulfils its mandate to maintain as many families as possible on farms in this severely handicapped region?  Will the Minister intervene and direct, not later than tomorrow, the chief executive of Teagasc, its board and its operations director to rescind the decision to transfer Galway milk to County Clare and to ensure the viability of the Midwest Farmers Co-op and its small suppliers are not threatened in the <Col N="2100" /> future?  If Teagasc goes ahead, it will be a crisis for the co-op and a vote of no confidence in agriculture in the west.  If the Government allows this to happen, it will be a kick in the teeth for the people in the west.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for the Minister to exert his position as the political head of agriculture and we are depending on him to do so.  I am confident he will not be found wanting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure for the transfer by a producer of his or her milk quota from one milk purchaser to another is set down in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995.  The incorporation of the transfer procedure into the regulations ensures, in my view, that the rights of both the producers and the milk purchasers are acknowledged in that the movement of quota between purchasers is ordered and the producers have a clear understanding of the requirements for exercising their right to transfer.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations a producer's quota may be transferred on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October provided the following requirements are met: notice is given, at least three months before the proposed transfer date, to both the existing and the new purchaser. This notice is to be given on the official application forms which are appended to the regulations and must be sent by registered post; the new milk purchaser submits an application to the Minister for an increase in its quota to the extent of the proposed transfer.  This application is to be made within two months of the commencement of deliveries by the producer to the new purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations also provide, however, for an exception to these general rules.  A producer may apply directly to the Minister for the transfer of his or her quota, stating the reason for that application.  Both purchasers concerned will be given an opportunity <Col N="2101" /> to state their views on any such application.</P>
    <P>An application under the regulations has not been made to me in this case.  I am, however, aware that this matter has been raised with my Department.  Documents have been made available to my Department which would indicate the producer's intention to transfer in that the first stages of the transfer procedure were put in place before the end of March 1995.  An application under the regulations by the proposed new milk purchaser in accordance with the time limits set down was not, however, received.</P>
    <P>While I have not received an application directly from the producer under the exceptional measure which I have mentioned, it is still open to the producer to do this.  Should I receive any such application, I will consider this in consultation with the various parties involved.  Any such consideration will have to include, on my part, the recognition of the producer's entitlement to produce milk to the extent of their milk quota entitlement without incurring a super levy liability.</P>
    <P>What is at issue is the application of the milk quota regulations as they stand and that is where my role and the role of my Department arises.  If a case is put to me it will be examined fairly and objectively.  In the context of producers in the west and in all other disadvantaged areas, I must remind the Deputy of the arrangements which I have put in place in order to maintain, in so far as possible, milk production and processing in these sensitive areas.  The ring fencing of milk quota within the disadvantaged areas in the case of land transfers is a significant measure which has already proved to be extremely beneficial to the west.  The provision of a subsidy for smaller scale producers towards the cost of purchasing additional quota under the restructuring scheme will also have been of immense benefit in that the majority of smaller <Col N="2102" /> scale producers are situated in the less favoured areas.  I have also given these producers priority under the temporary leasing schemes and the distribution of flexi-milk.</P>
    <P>The super levy liability for the current year will not be established until after 31 March 1996.  No one can accurately forecast at this stage the effect that a transfer from the milk purchaser in question would have on a possible super levy liability in that concern.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Deputy has said, I will ask the principal officer in the dairy division tomorrow to discuss this matter with Liam Downey, the director of Teagasc, and explain the Deputy's view on it to him.  I do not have the full facts on Teagasc's view.  After the Deputy's representations have been conveyed the situation will then be fairly assessed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you for allowing me raise this important matter on the Adjournment. Last weekend I viewed with alarm the enormous problem caused by coastal erosion in Ballycotton.  This is not a new problem as the question of action on coastal erosion has been raised for decades by the people who have been informed by Cork County Council that <Col N="2103" /> it is at the top of its priority list. However, the problem has got progressively worse and is now at a critical juncture.</P>
      <P>In the autumn of 1995 the retaining wall under the village was breached and the area council engineer and other officials witnessed the perilous situation facing Ballycotton residents.  During the Christmas period and since then, this area has been exposed to long periods of easterly gales and the retaining wall has been further breached.  There are gaps of 35 feet and 18 feet in the wall which now offers no protection to the cliff behind it.  The cliff face of clay is 15 feet behind the line of the wall and has no rock base.  The greatest concern is that the top of the cliff is less than 12 yards from the roadway and if the cliff is eroded at the same rate during the next few months, there will be no access by road to Ballycotton.  It is imperative that remedial works are carried out immediately to protect the roadway into Ballycotton and that work is done on the remainder of the retaining wall, which in places has been undermined, and in other places cracks have appeared.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, not for the first time, I visited Ring Strand, Knockadoon and Ballymacoda to view the damage caused by coastal erosion.  Since last autumn, easterly gales have caused havoc in the area. Part of a 20 foot deep cliff has been washed away.  If nothing is done to prevent erosion, the remainder of the cliff will soon be washed away and as the land between the cliff and the village is low lying the sea will then encroach on hundreds of acres of land stretching to Ballymacoda village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January last year, a coastal protection scheme was submitted to the relevant Department by Cork County Council.  It covered the coastline stretching from Ballycotton to Knockadoon. Will funding be forthcoming?  On behalf of the residents of those two areas, I beg <Col N="2104" /> the Minister of State to ensure the necessary remedial works are carried out in coming months, otherwise there will be no entrance to Ballycotton and many houses will be in danger of falling into the sea.  In Ring, farmers will lose hundreds of acres of land and the village of Ballymacoda will be threatened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The coastline is recognised as a resource of immense value in economic, environmental, ecological and socialogical terms.  In recent years it has become generally accepted that coastal erosion is a major threat to the coastal environment. The coastal resource is fragile and non-renewable and the systems operating in the coastal zone will significantly depend on the preservation of the coast.</P>
      <P>This country has a coastline that stretches for some 5,800 kilometres.  In 1992, a needs study carried out by the National Coastal Erosion Committee of the County and City Engineer's Association showed that out of the total coastline of 5,800 kilometres some 1,500 kilometres are at risk and some 490 kilometres require immediate attention at an approximate cost of £125 million.</P>
      <P>Erosion can also impact on local ecological environments.  Loss of sand dune systems, for example, can disrupt the natural habitat of a number of birds and other animals.  Erosion can, in certain instances, pose a social threat to isolated coastal communities.  Apart from the obvious economic disruption, erosion threatens the communications and transport links for these communities. Being cut off from the mainland would have serious and, potentially, catastrophic consequences for these communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the threat posed by erosion and the need for coast protection.  In 1994, the Government decided that EU Structural Funds should be made available <Col N="2105" /> for the first time to help address the serious erosion problem and allocated moneys from the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, amounting to £5.1 million, to tackle priority erosion problems over that six year period.</P>
    <P>The aim of the investment programme is the preservation of the State-owned foreshore; local authority-owned property, including county road networks; tourist amenities, including beach and dune systems; natural habitats and their ecology.  Such preservation works support rural development, tourism, environmental protection and other activities which contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal regions.</P>
    <P>The County and City Engineers' Association has estimated that some £125 million is required to tackle all the most urgent erosion problems.  Given that funding under the operational programme is limited to £5.1 million, it was obvious that priority projects for possible funding under the programme needed to be identified.  Therefore, in order to draw up a targeted programme of priority coastal locations, consultations were held with coastal local authorities and submissions detailing their top four priority proposals were sought.  Given the limited funding available and demand levels all the local authorities were advised that value for money from investments in coastal protection schemes must be achieved.  In other words, the cost of undertaking any scheme must be considered against the benefits, tangible or intangible, arising. Such benefits would include property, infrastructure, transportation, livelihoods, community concern, conservation value and commercial value. These proposals are now on hand in the Department and works to be undertaken to the end of 1999 will be chosen from among the priority proposals submitted.</P>
    <P>A number of the projects identified <Col N="2106" /> by the local authorities have been aided by the Department during the last year. In 1995, some £773,000 was invested in protection works at ten locations: the Maharees Peninsula and Waterville, County Kerry; Courtown and Duncannon, County Wexford; Inishboffin and Roundstone, County Galway; Bertra Beach, County Mayo; Killiney, County Dublin; Laytown, County Meath; and preparation work in Bray, County Wicklow.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that the funding available in any one year is limited and as a result it is only possible to undertake a small number of works in any year.</P>
    <P>To date only one protection scheme in County Cork has been awarded grant-aid.  That scheme involves the protection of the main access road to Pallas pier, Ardgroom, which has been undermined by erosion and which is used by those involved in the local aquaculture industry to transport their mussels.  The total cost of these works is some £26,000.  I understand that a further £13,000 will be spent by Cork County Council on road reinstatement works. The council has appointed a contractor for this scheme and he is due to commence work during the first week of March.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two locations referred to by the Deputy, Cork County Council has informed the Department of the Marine that rock armouring costing £100,000 is required at Ballycotton and road protection costing some £150,000 is required at Ring Strand. However, fully costed, designed and justified proposals are still awaited from the council.  I understand that these will be forwarded shortly.  When Cork County Council's proposals are received they will be fully considered over the remaining years of the programme.</P>
    <P>I will bear in mind the points the Deputy has made in respect of the area he represents.  I share his concerns and those of the other Members who have spoken to me about the damage being <Col N="2107" /> caused through coast erosion.  As the House will realise, we are talking about huge sums of money.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to contact local authorities to ascertain whether we could resort to community employment schemes, working in conjunction with local communities, to undertake some immediate works which, while perhaps not of the Rolls-Royce type, would halt further erosion pending more moneys being made available in future years to undertake a proper job.  Perhaps some immediate works can be undertaken at reasonable cost &mdash;<Col N="2108" /> resorting to community employment schemes &mdash; thus preventing the problem from worsening for the time being.  In the meantime we will continue the major works planned under the operational programme.  The projects to be aided over the lifetime of the programme will be chosen from the priority proposals submitted, on the basis of their merit, having regard to economic, environmental and ecological criteria rather than geographical location.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 1996.</P>

      <P>I understand that the <Col N="1810" /> Northern Ireland Minister for Education has indicated that his decision in relation to these awards was due to general budgetary pressure and the increasing costs of the awards.  He also indicated that the position of Northern Ireland students was anomalous as students in Great Britain do not receive awards to attend these institutions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this policy change effected by the Northern Ireland authorities for primarily budgetary reasons.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, to note that the Northern Ireland Minister for Education has stated that his decision to stop funding students attending the private colleges does not imply any criticism of their standards.</P>

      <P>As part of the 1995 post-primary programme, funding was made available for the architectural planning of ten physical education halls at schools where these were not already available.  The ten schools in question were identified as having the most pressing needs.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at Palmerstown Community School can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.

      <P>The report referred to has not yet been published.  However, I will make a number of comments about early school leaving and educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>My objective, shared I know by all the Deputies in this House, is that there should be no early school leavers. However, overcoming early school leaving is a complex problem with roots in social and economic factors outside the school.  The removal of educational disadvantage is an international problem, which is proving persistently difficult for all developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, while in no way wishing to minimise the crucial importance of developing all children's potential to the full, very significant strides have been made in retaining students in full-time second-level education up to completion of the senior cycle.  It is a fundamental objective of the White Paper, Charting our Education Future that the rate of retention in school to completion of senior cycle should increase to 90 per <Col N="1816" /> cent by the end of the decade.  Progress in the achievement of this target is being made steadily.  Rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent at present.</P>

Go bunúsach is nuachtlitir inmheánach don Roinn Oideachais í <i>Inside Education</i> agus is é mó a bhíonn inti ná ailt a chuireann daoine aonair ar fáil ar bhonn deonach maidir le dul chun cinn laistigh den Roinn.  Níl aon alt as Gaeilge san eagrán reatha toisc nár soláthraíodh ceann.

      <P>In December last year, I established a working group on third-level private commercial colleges to make recommendations to me on a code of standards for the purpose of approving colleges and courses which would be eligible for tax relief on fees.  This is in line with the policy set out in the White Paper, &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo;, and provided for in the 1995 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>The working group has received submissions from the various interested parties, and has consulted directly with the sector.</P>
      <P>The working group is due to report to me by the end of this month, and the tax relief will apply in respect of approved courses in approved colleges in the forthcoming 1996-97 academic year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised, however, that ensuring greater access to third-level by students from disadvantaged backgrounds is not solely a matter of costs at third-level.  Fuller participation in third-level depends on ensuring retention of students in full-time education up to the age of 18.  To achieve this I have taken <Col N="1821" /> a range of initiatives.  These include: targeting of resources at first and second-level on disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for first and second-level students including psychological and guidance services, career guidance and remedial teachers; the continuing development of the home-school links programme; a major restructuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt them to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle and the introduction of alternative pathways for students to progress to post-second-level education and training.</P>
    <P>I have also supported the development of links between disadvantaged schools and third-level institutions. These links are in line with the commitment in the White Paper which indicates that, &ldquo;Each third-level institution will be encouraged to develop links with designated second-level schools, building on existing practice&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to make remedial teacher posts available to primary schools, including the schools mentioned by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>During the current school year, 1995-96, 100 remedial teachers are being trained for the primary sector and 58 for the post-primary sector.</P>
      <P>During 1995, I announced the allocation of an additional 55 remedial teacher posts to primary schools.  These posts were allocated to schools with effect from September 1995 on the basis of priority of need following recommendations from my Department's primary inspectorate.  Account was also taken of data submitted by the applicant schools.  This allocation brought the total number of remedial teachers now in place in the primary sector to 1,188. Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputies were not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the question of further appointments in this area under regular review.  I can assure the Deputies that the remedial needs of pupils attending the schools in question will be taken fully into account as part of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when I took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.  I regret that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all <Col N="1823" /> pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, I do not have unlimited resources.</P>

      <P>Where accommodation is not immediately available in a centre to which a court proposes to refer a young offender, the procedure outlined below is followed.</P>
      <P>The director of the centre in question is required immediately to ascertain whether appropriate alternative accommodation is available in another centre. Where such accommodation is available, the court is so advised.  Generally, the court avails of the alternative offered.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where it is possible to predict when a place will become available in the centre originally selected, the court is advised of this.  In some cases, the court may defer a decision pending the availability of a place in the selected centre.  In these cases, the court may decide to release the child on temporary bail into the care of a parent or other responsible adult.</P>
      <P>Because the centres must deal with referrals from courts all over the country, demands for accommodation can change on an hourly basis.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to ensure that the above arrangements operate as effectively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instances have arisen where the above arrangements have not provided <Col N="1825" /> a solution and a particular centre has been unable to accommodate a child actually brought to the centre by the gardaí.  In such cases, the accompanying gardaí have a responsibility to return the offender to the court if it is still sitting. Otherwise, the offender is brought to the Garda station and given station bail.  In more rare cases, the offender may be released under the care of a parent or responsible adult.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of cases refused admission in 1995 is not readily available in my Department.  I will arrange to have the data forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the draft scheme of the new Children Bill, which was recently approved by Government, will make a major contribution to improving current arrangements in the general area of catering for children in need of special care or who have come into conflict with the law.  In particular, in order to improve co-ordination between the courts and the centres in placing young offenders, the Bill will make provision for the establishment of a single executive board responsible for the operation of all young offender centres.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 185 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broad outline of a framework for in-service education is set out in the White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting <Col N="1826" /> our Education Future&rdquo;, including specific programme priorities.  In line with the commitment in the White Paper, my Department is currently involved in the final stages of discussions with the Partners in Education with a view to producing a fully developed and detailed framework for in-service education. These discussions are taking place through the primary and post-primary in-career advisory committees, under the auspices of my Department, on which the Partners in Education are represented.</P>
    <P>A draft document, taking account of the written submissions and the discussions already made at committee meetings, will be considered by the committees at their next meetings.</P>

      <P>The School Attendance/Truancy report was published in April 1994.</P>
      <P>Early in 1995 the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Austin Currie, established a truancy task force with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>to examine the submissions received from interested parties in response to the truancy report and to consider and make recommendations as to future action required to address the problems of truancy at first and second level.</P>
      <P>The work of the truancy task force is nearing completion.  When the report is available, I will consider its recommendations and the further action which will have to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that primary schools in some areas have recently been experiencing some difficulties in securing the services of trained substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>A pilot project for a supply panel of substitute teachers was introduced in 1993 to cover short-term teacher absences on sick leave.  I propose to extend the project to include new locations as soon as resources permit.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that, since taking office, I increased substantially the number of entrants into colleges of education, to 429 in 1993, 460 in 1994 and 462 in 1995. This represents a dramatic improvement on the 1992 position, when only 275 students entered the colleges of education.  Furthermore, in January 1995 I introduced a special 18-month post-graduate course for 180 students in the colleges of education.  This will mean that a total of over 600 additional newly-qualified teachers will be available for employment in schools for the 1996-97 school year.</P>
      <P>The initiatives outlined above, together with the projected reduction in overall pupil enrolments at primary level &mdash; from over 478,000 at present to approximately 444,000 in 1998-99 &mdash; will alleviate the difficulties in 1996-97 and will give rise to a surplus of teachers in subsequent years.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present difficulties are of a temporary nature only.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the current imbalance between urban and rural areas in terms of designation as disadvantaged for educational purposes.</P>
      <P>It was precisely because of my concerns in this area that I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct the study from which the Deputy now quotes.</P>
      <P>The report presented by the Combat Poverty Agency represents one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It is also a very complex document.  For this reason, I arranged for the preparation of a summary report which I published in December 1995.</P>
      <P>I invited interested parties to make further submissions by the end of January 1996.  I am pleased to say that my invitation has attracted a significant response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also commissioned the Education Research Centre to bring forward detailed proposals on the precise criteria which should be used in future for the identification of pupils affected by educational disadvantage.  One of the <Col N="1830" /> key issues which will be addressed in this context is the question of identifying rural as well as urban disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the report from the Education Research Centre very shortly.  When this report has been received, my Department will proceed towards the development of a revised approach to the selection and support of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>At present, a total of 309 primary schools are designated as disadvantaged. Of this total, it is estimated that 56 schools are located in areas with populations below 10,000.</P>
    <P>At second-level, a total of 190 schools are designated as disadvantaged.  Of this total, it is estimated that 86 schools are located in areas with populations below 10,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>School attendance committees are responsible for the enforcement of the School Attendance Act in certain parts of Dublin, and in Cork and Waterford. In all other areas the Garda Síochána have responsibility.  Consequently, figures for rates of early leaving are not in the normal course available to my Department.  The lack of accurate data on school non-attendance was one of the difficulties identified in my Department's report on School Attendance/ Truancy published in 1994.</P>
      <P>At national level, the 1995 ESRI Annual School Leavers Survey which focuses on 1993-94 school leavers is currently being finalised.  Preliminary data from the survey indicates that there has been a substantial decline in the number of leavers with no qualifications from a base of 3,300 in 1992-93.</P>
      <P>A comparison of second level pupils who were enrolled in schools in 1995-96 with those enrolled in 1994-95 would suggest that some 3,437 pupils may have left school before the legal age, of whom 1,305 were in the greater Dublin area. This is an indicator only, and there could be other reasons, such as emigration, as to why pupils below leaving certificate year 2 level featured on record in 1994-95 but not the following year.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental objective in the White Paper: &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; that the rate of retention in school to completion of senior cycle should increase to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.  Progress in the achievement of this target is being made, and rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving.  These include the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the home/ school/community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow <Col N="1833" /> students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes, the junior certificate, the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate applied and the expansion of the leaving certificate vocational programme; improvements in the quality of teaching and certification systems; the expansion of psychological and guidance services; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils; and the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and the vocational training opportunity scheme.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to those who have dropped out of the school system are the youth encounter projects provided for young people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of doing so, and who have become alienated from the mainstream school system; and the Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers in the 15-18 year age group.  My Department has expanded the provision under the Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers from 600 places in 1989 to 2,000 places at present, and a further 450 places are now under way.  This will bring the total provision in the vocational education committee sector to 2,450 places, in addition to the provision under the programme by FÁS.</P>
    <P>In keeping with its commitment to address the problems of truancy and early drop-out, the Government has appointed Minister of State Deputy Currie with special responsibility for this area.  The Minister of State has established a task force to address the issues and has also established an interdepartmental committee, involving the Departments of Education, Health and Justice, to co-ordinate the actions of all three Departments in the areas involving children with special needs, including the issue of truancy.  The work of the truancy task force is nearing completion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current postgraduate course in the colleges of education was introduced on a &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; basis and is due to end in June 1996.  However, the White Paper on Education recognises <Col N="1835" /> the benefits to the teaching profession of entrants from a variety of backgrounds including graduates in other disciplines.  It also provides that the present arrangements for these purposes will be further developed, in consultation with the colleges of education, having regard to the projected demand for primary teachers.  I am, at present, awaiting a report from the colleges of education on their experience with the operation of the current postgraduate course.  That report will be taken into account when decisions are being made on the intake to the colleges of education for the academic year 1996-97.</P>
    <P>On a general basis, the intake to the colleges of education is closely allied to movements in the pupil-teacher ratio, the number of teachers retiring or otherwise leaving the teaching profession, and the number of teachers taking career breaks.  Projections for a number of these variables are not yet available.</P>
    <P>When these projections have been finalised, and the report referred to earlier has been received, decisions will be made on the number of students to be admitted to colleges of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recently introduced scheme of job-sharing for secretaries in primary and secondary schools.  The <Col N="1837" /> Deputy's claim that the scheme promotes inequity may be due to a misunderstanding of how this scheme operates.</P>
      <P>Usually job-sharing schemes require two persons employed by the one employer to share one job.  In the case of primary and secondary schools this is not possible because each secretary is employed separately by an individual school authority.  Conventional job-sharing arrangements could not apply and a specially tailored scheme had to be devised.</P>
      <P>I did have the option of limiting the scheme to secretaries who were able to find a job-sharing partner in a neighbouring school.  This of course would also have required the agreement of both school authorities.</P>
      <P>To do so would have made the scheme too restrictive.  In fact it may have precluded secretaries who wished to avail of job-sharing from doing so. Therefore as an exceptional measure the scheme which I introduced allows a secretary to job-share without a partner. This, of course, means that the school where the job-sharing secretary works has the services of this person only on a half-time basis.</P>
      <P>In order to enable schools to cover the partial loss of the secretary's services a grant is being provided to the schools concerned under the scheme of additional capitation grants for clerical services.  The capitation grant scheme by its nature affords the school authority discretion to cover the absences of a job-sharing secretary as it wishes.  This may give rise to an apparent inequity over payment depending on the particular local arrangement that is put in place.</P>

      <P>The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community contained over 160 separate recommendations in relation to education and training for travellers.</P>
      <P>The Government established an interdepartmental working group to consider the implementation of the report, including the cost factors involved.  I understand that this report is now being finalised and will be submitted to Government within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The task force recommended that the visiting teacher service for travellers be expanded to a level where one visiting teacher would be available to serve every one hundred traveller families. The task force estimated that such a development would require an increase in the number of visiting teachers from the current 12 to 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately the proposed appointment of an additional 20 visiting teachers for travellers was unable to proceed in 1995 due to the Government's need to curtail the growth of numbers in the public sector.  I can <Col N="1842" /> assure the House of my ongoing commitment to the educational needs of traveller children.  I am continuing to review these needs in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>The position relating to post-primary schools is that following from my reply of 7 June 1995, my Department arranged for a number of prototype sloped desks to be produced, one of which was approved after revisions.</P>
      <P>The 1995 tender competition for the provision of furniture, where this is undertaken directly by the Department, had a closing date of 12 June 1995. Accordingly, it was not possible to alter the specifications without retendering. This would have meant inordinate delays in the provision of urgently needed furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am happy to say that the 1996 tender documentation which is being finalised at present includes specifications for sloped desks.  All schools which are being supplied from the 1996 <Col N="1844" /> tender competition will be offered this option.</P>
    <P>Of 100 post-primary schools where the provision of furniture was grant-aided by the building unit of my Department in 1995, one has already availed of the option of sloped desks.  Schools which purchase furniture from their own resources are also at liberty to pursue this option.</P>
    <P>In so far as national schools are concerned, a furniture manufacturer has recently completed a prototype sloped desk.  This desk will now be tested and, if the tests prove satisfactory, the desk will be manufactured to order.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 192 and 213 together.  The issue of my Department's acquisition of the CBS property is being pursued at present, but an agreement has not yet been reached on a purchase price.  In the circumstances, I cannot give a specific date for the acquisition of the property.</P>
      <P>Following lengthy discussions with the managements of the schools in Youghal, my Department entered into an agreement whereby the Presentation and CBS schools would amalgamate from last September.  It was agreed, also, that the amalgamated school would be located in the Presentation building and that the former CBS building would be made available to house Gaelscoil Choráin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amalgamation of the two schools took place from last September. However, some classes were left in the <Col N="1846" /> CBS building and, as a result, it is not yet available to Gaelscoil Choráin.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, my Department wrote to the school authorities clarifying aspects of the original agreement, including the requirement for vacant possession of the CBS property.  Arising out of the correspondence, officials of my Department will be visiting the school within the next week or so to conclude discussions on the works programme required at the Presentation school building.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation process in Youghal has proven to be quite complex, but I am hopeful that the matter can be brought to a successful conclusion shortly.</P>

      <P>Gedun Choekyi Nyima, the six year old boy who is the Dalai Lama's choice as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, and those associated with him, have been the subject recently of representations to the Chinese authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the visit to China of the EU troika delegation on human rights from 22-24 January, the troika raised in the official talks the question of the dispute over the selection of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama between the Dali Lama and the central Government, with a view to seeing if the wishes of the Tibetan people might be respected.  The <Col N="1851" /> troika also inquired about the wellbeing of Gedun Choekyi Nyima and of his tutor, the Abbot of Tashilunpo.</P>
    <P>In their response, the Chinese blamed the Dalai Lama for allegedly sabotaging the proper procedure for the selection, which involved approval of the central Government.  They said that the boy was in very good shape physically and was leading a healthy, normal life. However they were unfortunately not able to disclose his whereabouts.  It was said that the Abbot had been taken ill last May en route from Beijing to Tibet and that he was still hospitalised.</P>
    <P>The troika also raised this issue with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Li Zhaoxing.</P>
    <P>These responses can hardly be considered satisfactory.  Ireland and its partners in the EU will continue to keep this matter under review and to study the best means of ensuring that the Chinese authorities are fully aware of our concerns on this issue.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to part-time degree programme courses. The estimated cost of allowing a tax relief at the standard rate in respect of fees for such courses is estimated to be over £2 million based on approximately £8 million paid in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> As Deputies are aware, fees for full-time undergraduate courses at public colleges are being phased out.  In addition, provision has been made for tax relief from the academic year 1996/97 in respect of fees paid to approved private colleges in respect of approved full-time undergraduate courses.</P>
    <P>A further income tax concession of the sort proposed would not only involve a substantial cost to the Exchequer but would, inevitably, be bound to generate many similar claims from other taxpayers for tax relief on a variety of personal expenditure.  The consequential loss to the Exchequer would mean that considerable revenue would have to be found elsewhere to maintain services.</P>

      <P>The VAT treatment of charities is a direct consequence of EU VAT law. The Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish law must comply, provides that most charitable activities are exempt from VAT: this means that bodies engaged in such activities do not charge VAT on the services that they provide but, as a necessary corollary, neither are they entitled to recover the tax borne on the goods and services they purchase in the course of these activities.  Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by VAT-registered businesses.</P>

    <P>1This figure is based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>2Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and figures of tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated.</P>
    <P>3This heading includes tax paid on income from trades and professions &mdash; other than farming &mdash; together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under Schedule E on employees.  This tax is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified.</P>
    <P>4This figure relates to tax repayments made to tax exempt individuals and bodies, such as charities and pension funds, in respect of tax deducted at source, such as income paid under covenants, or of tax credits attaching to company distributions in favour of either Irish or foreign residents.</P>

    <P>¹This item comprises revenues from issuing of passports to Irish citizens, visa fees in respect of non-nationals visiting Ireland and fees from foreign birth registrations (i.e. applications for citizenship under the descent rules).</P>
    <P>²This item refers to revenues in connection with the Kinsale gas field.  Under an agreement concluded in 1959, royalties are payable by Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd. (the company that operates the field) at the rate of 12½ per cent of the fair market value of such oil, gas or other petroleum substances as are produced.  A deduction for the cost of making it saleable and transporting it to the sale point, if any, is allowable in computing royalties.</P>
    <P>³The 1995 outturn on this item includes a £4.5m EU refund of VAT.  Payments to the EU are based on forecasts of GNP and the VAT base.  These are reviewed annually at mid-year and may result in refunds or extra charges in the event of emerging outturns differing from forecast figures.  The balance of the 1995 receipts consist of miscellaneous once-off receipts such as c.£900,000 received from the liquidator of a company in respect of interest on a loan repaid on behalf of the company by the Exchequer under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, some £300,000 received from the surrender of balances of the Western Development Fund, in connection with the transfer of responsibility for the administration of the Fund from the Department of Finance to the Department of Enterprise and Employment and about £100,000 received in settlement of legal proceedings which the Office of Public Works had instituted against a building contracting firm in relation to work carried out on a State building.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank earns income from the investment of its assets.  Against this income, it pays out interest to depositors (mainly government and credit institutions) and operational costs such as wages and salaries.  The balance represents the surplus income, or profits, of the Bank.  Under the Central Bank Surplus Income Regulations, 1943, the Bank may transfer up to 20 per cent of its trading profits to reserves and may also make provisions for depreciation and superannuation reserves.  The balance is paid to the Exchequer and constitutes the item &ldquo;Central Bank surplus income&rdquo; to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer receipts of Central Bank Surplus income in a given year are equal to the previous year's surplus income calculated in accordance with the aforementioned Regulations.  Thus the 1995 receipt is calculated by reference to the 1994 accounts, while the forecast increase in 1996 is based on the projected 1995 outturn.  Although the audited accounts for 1995 were not available, it was estimated for the purposes of the budget that the transfer to the Exchequer on foot of the 1995 surplus income would amount to £172.5 million.  This increase can be explained by 3 main factors, viz.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the underlying profitability of the Bank has increased;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" />&mdash;&nbsp; the Bank recorded significant gains on its trading in securities during 1995.  While such gains, or losses where appropriate, had previously not been treated as income, a new accounting policy was approved by the Board of the Bank in November, 1993.  The Board decision provided that, with effect from 1 January, 1995, realised gains, or losses, on securities are to be transferred to the profit and loss account;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the Board of the Bank has decided that it will transfer only 10 per cent of the surplus income arising on the 1995 accounts to its own reserves, whereas it transferred a higher proportion &mdash; 15 per cent &mdash; in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The exact amount to be transferred to the Exchequer will be finally determined only when the Central Bank's audited accounts become available later in the year.</P>

    <P>¹Because of the high level of debt of Bord Gáis Éireann, due mainly to borrowing requirements <Col N="1865" /><Col N="1866" /> for the Ireland/UK Natural Gas Interconnector as well as the volatility of their profit projections, an agreement was reached with the Company allowing for a nil dividend in 1996, with annual reviews thereafter taking account of ongoing borrowing levels.</P>
    <P>²As part of an overall policy arrangement with Telecom Éireann and in recognition of the need to strengthen the Company's balance sheet in the light of rapid change in the telecommunications sector, it was agreed that Telecom Éireann's dividend payments to the Exchequer would be reduced.  In this regard, they are to pay £10 million to the Exchequer in respect of their financial year ending 31 March, 1995.  Due to timing factors, this payment is to be received in 1996 resulting in a nil payment in 1995.  It is anticipated that dividend flows will resume once the Company's debt position has been brought into line with international norms for the sector.</P>
    <P>³Recent years have seen high levels of early redemptions on the outstanding Local Loans Fund portfolio.  This factor, in addition to the impact of last years securitisation of £140 million worth of the portfolio and a planned securitisation worth a further £50 million in 1996, has resulted in a significant reduction in the level of outstanding loans, with a consequential reduction in the level of interest likely to be received in 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the Attorney General to engage members of the legal profession to represent a Department of State in court proceedings against them and the costs of engagement are met from his Vote.  Accordingly, no legal fees were paid by my Department in respect of the Office of Public Works legal team which represented them in the court cases referred to.  The cost of the Office of Public Works' legal representation in respect of these court cases, attributable to the Attorney General's Vote, amounted to £47,420.00.</P>
      <P>Where costs are awarded against the State in a court case, the amount payable is usually agreed between the Attorney General (or the Chief State Solicitor's Office acting on his behalf) and the other party's legal team.  In the event of a dispute, the amount can be fixed by the Taxing Master.  In either case, the amount is paid out of the Vote of the Department/State Authority involved.  In the case of the Burren National Park project, the amount paid out of the Office of Public Works Vote was £194,765.51, which was the amount agreed between the respective parties, following negotiations.  This amount covers both the High Court and Supreme Court cases as well as the initial injuction hearing.</P>
      <P>Costs were awarded to the Office of Public Works in the High Court in respect of the last of these cases. However, the awarding of costs in that case was appealed to the Supreme Court, and this appeal is still pending. The issue of costs cannot be finalised until the appeal is heard.</P>

      <P>Additional revenue funding of £3 million has been provided for the development of new services for persons with a mental handicap in 1996.  Of this £230,000 has been allocated to the North Eastern Health Board region. This will enable additional residential/respite and day services to be provided and allow the further extension of the home support services in the region.  The health board will shortly be submitting proposals for the development of new services to my Department. Decisions about a capital allocation to support these developments will be made when the proposals are received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, £85,000 revenue has been allocated to the health board for the development of services for people with a physical handicap.  A capital allocation <Col N="1871" /> will be decided when I have received proposals from the health board.</P>
    <P>In addition to this funding, the North Eastern Health Board region has been allocated capital funding of £442,000 in 1996 for the development and improvement of vocational training centres and equipment for people with disabilities. This funding is part of the overall EU assisted funding for vocational training of people with disabilities under the Human Resources Operational Programme.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, on completion of the validation process in respect of the National Mental Handicap Database later this year, to initiate a review of the implementation of both policy documents, Needs and Abilities, and Services to Persons with Autism, with a view to preparing an overall medium-term development plan for the services. Also, following the publication later this year of the report of the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory disabilities, I will have a further look at the needs of the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>With reference to the further education centre in Navan for young people with a mental handicap leaving special schools, I understand from the North Eastern Health Board that while some initial funding and a premises for this project has been made available, the question of additional funding and support is currently being pursued from a number of sources, including the Department of Education and FAS.</P>

It was introduced to complete the creation of the Single Market in the area of non-life insurance in the European Union. the Health Insurance Act, 1994 which was enacted by reference to the general good provisions of the Directive provides for the regulation of an open and competitive private health insurance market in this country.  The regulations to be put in place pursuant to the Act will provide the detailed framework within which health insurers wishing to carry on business in this country must operate.  The stipulation of minimum cover for psychiatric in-patient treatment is one of the elements to be contained in regulations which will set out the level of cover to be provided by insurers as a minimum in any policy they sell here.  The regulations will constitute a balanced and effective basis for regulating a competitive market in private health insurance in accordance with the terms of Council Directive 92/49/EEC.</P>

      <Col N="1873" /> Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin is the main tertiary referral centre for paediatric oncology in the country and is responsible for the care of approximately 80 per cent of all children with cancer.  It is also the National Paediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Centre.</P>
    <P>The oncology unit at Crumlin has been completely refurbished in recent years at a total capital cost of £1.7 million. St. John's Ward is a 25 bed unit (including six beds in the day unit).</P>
    <P>The annual running cost of the unit which is met from my department's annual revenue expenditure allocation to the hospital is estimated at £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>In late 1995, clinicians from the unit requested a meeting with my Department to discuss issues relating to the work of the unit.  The hospital authorities undertook to provide a detailed report prior to this meeting and this report was submitted recently to my Department.  Arrangements are now being made for a meeting in the near future between officials of my department and hospital representatives to discuss the issues contained in the hospital's submission.  The issues raised in the letter referred to by the Deputies will be fully considered at that meeting.</P>

      <P>In 1992 the Council of Crosscare (formerly the Catholic Social Services Council) agreed to fund the Aftercare Support Service for a three-year period to the end of 1995 and therefore no funding was requested from the Eastern Health Board.  The Eastern Health Board has advised that an application for funding of £65,000 for this service was received by the board in late December, 1995. The application is currently under consideration by the board in the context of available funding for the development of child care services this year and in the light of other competing priorities for service development.  In this regard the board wil be in contact with Crosscare in the near future.</P>

However, the Mater Hospital is one of the six major accident and emergency hospitals in the Dublin area. For that reason it is not possible to determine the number of patients who will require accident and emergency treatment and subsequent hospital admission.  When, there is pressure on beds it can, at times, lead to the cancellation of elective admissions.  The Mater Hospital has assured me that medical need is the determing factor and that all emergency cases receive priority.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>the current cost of the methadone maintenance programme; and the study, if any, that has been undertaken to evaluate the extent to which it achieves its purpose namely stabilisation or controlled drug use.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Methadone maintenance is one element of the overall treatment services which are provided to drug misusers.  The costs of this service arise from three sources:</P>
      <P>(i)  provision of methadone maintenance at community drug centres in Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot.  The cost of methadone for these centres was £220,000 in 1995.</P>
      <P>(ii) provision of methadone maintenance at Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.  The cost of methadone in the year January 1995 &mdash; December 1995 was £68,474.</P>
      <P>(iii) dispensing of methadone, which is prescribed by general practitioners in accordance with the Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone and dispensed through pharmacies.  The cost to the General Medical Services for the prescribing of methadone was £370,276 (December 1994 &mdash; November 1995).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> It should be noted that the drug methadone is used for the treatment of disease quite apart from its use in drug misuse treatment, so some of the GMS costs relate to the treatment of persons other than drug misusers.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the costs mentioned above do not take account of staff, counselling services, urine analysis etc., which form part of a comprehensive methadone maintenance programme.</P>
    <P>While the ultimate aim of any drug treatment programme is a drug fee lifestyle, it is recognised that for some drug misusers this is not an option, at least in the short-term.  International evidence supports the view that methadone maintenance is a valid part of an integrated response to treating the problem of heroin abuse.  It allows clinicians to treat chaotic drug misusers in such a way as to stabilise their dependence and to reduce their anti-social behaviour.  In this way, following stabilisation, drug misusers are in a position to consider further options such as detoxification or rehabilitation, leading to a totally drugfree lifestyle.</P>
    <P>A pilot programme, which will implement all of the elements of the protocol on the prescribing of methadone, will evaluate the effectiveness of methadone maintenance in an overall treatment plan for drug misuse.  This pilot programme will commence in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied) in county Sligo who was informed in writing by the North Western Health Board on 10 December 1994, that a request for an outpatient orthopaedic appointment was received from her GP and her name had been placed on a following waiting list and that she would receive an appointment at a future date; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that this person, in spite of suffering great pain, has not been called for an appointment at the clinic; the reason he indicated in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 49 of 4 October 1995, that the person was seen at outpatients on 9 December 1994; whether this level of service is acceptable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The patient referred to by the Deputy was seen by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon on 26 August 1994 and again on 28 October 1994.  Surgery was not recommended at that time and the fitting of orthopaedic appliances was prescribed.  The patient subsequently sought a second opinion.</P>
      <P>Due to a misunderstanding of the information conveyed to my Department at the time by the North-Western Health Board, I regret that my reply to the Deputy's previous parliamentary question of 4 October 1995 indicated that the patient was seen at out-patients on 9 December 1994.  The patient was referred on 9 December 1994 to a second consultant for a second opinion but was not seen at out-patients on that date.  The North-Western Health Board has now informed my Department that the patient has been placed on the non-urgent waiting list and is due to be seen by the second orthopaedic surgeon on 3 May 1996.</P>
      <P>In all cases the priority accorded to individual patients is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned and is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are always given priority.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times for orthopaedic surgery continues to be one of the objectives of the waiting list initiative, on which a further £7 million will be expended this year.  Despite the considerable progress which has been made in recent years, a great deal still remains to be done to bring the service to a uniformly prompt level of response throughout the country.  I am committed <Col N="1889" /> to achieving this outcome as quickly as the availablity of resources will permit.</P>

The implementing regulations, which are entitled the European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. 252 of 1994) became effective on 1 January 1995.  My Department is the competent authority for medical devices in this country and as such is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of these regulations.

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, imposed a statutory duty on health boards to undertake assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of its social services, particularly in relation to child protection which, as the Deputy will appreciate, must take priority over all other work.</P>
      <P>I am aware that prospective adoptive parents residing in the Eastern Health Board region are experiencing some delays because of the large number of requests for assessment that that board is continuing to receive.  It currently has three social workers assigned full-time to foreign adoptions and is closely monitoring progress in reducing the waiting time for the commencement of assessments.</P>
      <P>As regards the length of time it takes to complete an assessment, I should point out that the Adoption Board in its guidelines to the adoption agencies has made it clear that it expects the standard of an assessment for a foreign adoption to be equivalent to that for a domestic adoption.</P>

I understand that Bord Fáilte formerly produced information leaflets in French giving details of huntable species and seasons but these have not been updated since 1992. The National Parks and Wildlife Service previously produced a notice setting out general rules and seasons in German, Italian and French but this practice was discontinued.  I have given instructions, however, that the leaflet be re-issued in French and Italian from next season and this will cater for the bulk of out of State hunters.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the practice of exchanging clients or other methods by which shoot operators may exceed their gunday allocation. Shooting rights are assessed for gunday carrying capacity to ensure that lands are not overshot and hunting licences are issued by reference to this assessment.  When the shotgun certificates/hunting licences are issued the appropriate number of gundays are deduced from that particular shoot operator's overall allocation.  In cases where hunters intend to shoot in two different locations gundays are deduced <i>pro rata</i> from the promoters involved.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each local <Col N="1899" /> authority to make appropriate arrangements to implement the recommendations in the guidelines on expanding bilingualism in the State sector approved by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Apart from these general guidelines, local authorities also have available to them more specific recommendations relating to the provisions which they might make for the use of Irish.  These recommendations were issued in 1986 by the Grúpa Stiúrtha which was set up by my Department to co-ordinate advice to local authorities on the use of Irish.  An updated version of these guidelines was launched last month.</P>
      <P>The Grúpa Stiúrtha meets Oifigigh Gaeilge of the local authorities on a regular basis, and are satisfied that steady progress is being made by local authorities generally towards meeting the objectives of ensuring that persons wishing to conduct business with them through Irish can do so.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has appointed a senior officer as Oifigeach Gaeilge and has drawn up a formal action programme setting out its policy in relation to the promotion of bi-lingualism.  I am informed that the objectives of the action programme were the subject of a recent progress report to the members of the City Council's Cultural Committee which was noted with satisfaction. The corporation has a range of bilingual and Irish language versions of forms available for public use.</P>
      <P>Motor tax renewal forms RF1a and RF1b are issued to the motor tax sections of local authorities by my Department and are made available in separate English and Irish language versions. I have been assured by Dublin Corporation that they endeavour to have both versions available and on display in their motor tax offices at all times.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation have applied to me for approval to the Cork Street/Coombe relief route scheme and have submitted an environmental impact statement in respect of the project pursuant to section 51 of the Roads Act, 1993.  The corporation is preparing a compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of the necessary land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation was informed by my Department in November 1995 that no funding will be available under the EU co-financed grants scheme for the project, as it does not meet the strict EU eligibility criteria on the basis of the information supplied.  If approved, therefore, it would be a matter for the corporation to fund the project from its <Col N="1904" /> own resources, supplemented by the annual discretionary grant from my Department.</P>

      <P>The study on coastal zone management in Ireland was commissioned in August 1995 by the Ministers for the Environment, Marine and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. Considerable progress has been made to date in relation to reviewing available data on the coastal zone, legislative and administrative aspects and international developments.  In addition, a comprehensive programme of consultation with Government Departments and State agencies, local authorities and other organisations, bodies and individuals with an interest in the management of the coastal zone has taken place.  The consultants are due to report at the end of March 1996.</P>

      <P>Details of the 1996 non-national road grant allocations are contained in a booklet entitled Non-National Road Grant Allocations, 1996 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Details of non-national road grant payments in the period 1986-1995 are contained in the booklet State Grant Payments to Local Authorities for National, Non-National and Non-Public Accommodation Roads and own resources expenditure by Local Authorities on National and Non-National Roads in the period 1986-1995 which is also available in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the grant payments per <Col N="1910" /> mile to each local authority for the period 1985 to 1993, together with the grant payments for 1985, are contained in the reply to Question No. 72 of 24 May 1994.</P>
    <P>The length of non-national roads in each local authority area is set out in the booklet Inventory of Public Roads in Ireland as at 31 December 1977 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The length of non-national roads in kilometres in county council areas (1995 estimates) is set out in the reply to Question No. 119 of 13 February 1996. A revised inventory which will provide up to date figures on the length of public roads is currently being prepared and will be published as soon as it is finalised.</P>

      <P>The total grant allocation for youth and sport in 1996 is £26.681 million.</P>
      <P>Records are not maintained in such a way as would enable me to provide details of grants allocated on a constituency basis but I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 357 of 23 January 1996 which included a tabular statement of the organisations in each county which were allocated grants under the sports capital programme in 1995.</P>
      <P>In relation to the youth sector specifically, it is not possible to produce meaningful statistics even on a county basis given the nature of the funding arrangements. A large proportion of overall funding is allocated to national bodies of the various voluntary organisations and local units are assisted by these bodies in a variety of ways including direct grant aid.</P>
      <P>The latest Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Appropriation Accounts (1994) include details of grants paid under the youth and sport programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202, 203, 204, 205 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that Moate community school will commence operations next September on the Mercy and vocational school sites, which adjoin.  The question of the provision of additional accommodation to enable this to take place is under examination in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>As there was no agreement locally regarding the location of the community school, officials from my Department had discussions with the trustees regarding its location and the cost of acquiring the existing properties.  In all cases my Department received excellent co-operation and very acceptable offers in terms of cost.  As the secondary schools in question are privately owned, it would be inappropriate for me to divulge the details of these offers.</P>
      <P>An assessment of the school's likely enrolment for next September is being carried out.  This will help to determine the additional facilities which will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of agreement locally with regard to a single site, the board of management of the community school requested my Department to identify the most appropriate location.  I had the various options examined bearing in mind the educational, logistical and cost <Col N="1922" /> implications in each case.  Based on this examination, I decided that, both in the short and long term, the community school should be provided on the Mercy and vocational education committee sites, using as much as possible of the existing secondary and vocational schools' accommodation.</P>
    <P>An extensive consultative process with all the local interests would have made the selection process considerably more complex and protracted.  I will arrange for officials from the planning section of my Department to meet a deputation in the matter, if such a meeting is required.</P>
    <P>Now that this important issue has been decided, I hope that all the parties to the amalgamation will continue their efforts to ensure that Moate community school commences on schedule next September.</P>

      <P>My Department does not keep a record of the number of children <Col N="1927" /> with special needs who are integrated into ordinary primary schools. However, a survey conducted in 1992 on behalf of the Special Education Review Committee indicated that there were approximately 8,000 pupils with specific disabilities in ordinary classes.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to children with special education needs.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that substantial progress has been achieved in this area. Measures which I have introduced include:</P>
      <P>the appointment of an additional 241 remedial teachers at primary level bringing the total now in place nationwide to 1,188.</P>
      <P>the appointment of an additional 29 resource teachers in ordinary primary schools bringing the total number of resource teachers to 36.</P>
      <P>Both remedial and resource teachers support pupils with special needs who have been integrated into ordinary primary schools.  Children with specific disabilities such as hearing/visual impairment or Down's Syndrome also have access to the visiting teacher service.</P>

      <P>PLC courses are designed to provide integrated education, vocational training and work experience for students.  Their objective is to provide students with the vocational and technological skills necessary for employment and progression to further education and training, and to foster innovation and adaptability in participants.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education &mdash;&ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo;&mdash; sets out a comprehensive programme for the consolidation and further development of PLC provision and delivery.  The principal policy developments include:</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1931" /> the establishment of a further education authority, with a remit to co-ordinate and regulate PLC provision, at national level</P>

    <P>the provision of comprehensive national certification for PLC courses.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Vocational Awards is making significant progress in the provision of certification.  I have also established TEASTAS &mdash; the Irish National Certification Authority &mdash; to provide a comprehensive national qualifications framework for all vocational education and training, including PLC courses.</P>
    <P>Criteria have been issued to schools in relation to courses which are properly embraced by the PLC framework and it has been indicated that courses not complying with these criteria, relatively few in number, should be phased out from 1996-97.  Also, as part of the overall strategy to ensure that full national certification for all vocational training programmes is achieved by 1999 my Department has indicated to schools that funding will in future be linked to the use of certification by the National Council for Vocational Awards, where such is available.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that under the current scheme for exempting students from study of Irish at primary level, pupils with a mental handicap, pupils with average ability and pupils with above average ability, may be exempted from the study of Irish if diagnosed with a specific learning disability; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that in contrast pupils who are slow learners, representing a significant proportion of the school population, cannot be granted exemptions irrespective of learning disabilities in acquisition of basis literary skills; the reason for this inequity; and the plans, if any, she has to enable slow learners to be on par with other categories of pupils.</Quest>

      <P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the only formal scheme of exemption from Irish in primary schools is in the case of children who have been educated outside the State up to age 11.</P>
      <P>The primary school curriculum is child centred and the approach to teaching Irish or indeed any subject must, therefore, take account of the ability and capacity of the individual child.  In practice this means that in schools catering for children with mild, moderate, severe or profound mental handicap there is, in general, little or no teaching of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the circumstances under which a total exemption from the study of Irish might be granted to individual children in primary schools.  This is with a view to issuing a circular to schools before the end of this school year which will aim to make the position at primary level consistent with the position at second level which was revised in 1994. At second level exemption from Irish <Col N="1935" /> for children with specific learning difficulties is now permitted in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to make remedial teacher posts available to primary schools, including the school mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>During 1995, I announced the allocation of an additional 55 remedial teacher posts to primary schools.  These posts were allocated to schools with effect from September 1995 on the basis of priority of need following recommendations from my Department's primary inspectorate.  Account was also taken of data submitted by the applicant schools.</P>
      <P>This allocation brought the total number of remedial teachers now in place in the primary sector to 1,188.  Unfortunately the school mentioned by the Deputy was not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the question of further appointments in this area under regular review.  I can assure the Deputy that the remedial needs of pupils attending the school in question will be taken fully into account as part of this process.</P>
      <P>At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when I took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.  I regret that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial teaching as, unfortunately, I do not have unlimited resources.</P>

      <P>The way in which standard basic resources are provided to second-level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for voluntary-secondary schools, vocational schools, community colleges and community and comprehensive schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the different sectors is difficult.  The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the vocational education committee overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school, location, levels of vandalism etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> Ultimately, all Department aid towards the recurrent expenditure of second level schools will be made by way of a block grant to the regional education boards (REBs) as is outlined in the White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;.  The allocation of resources to the REBs for both non-teacher pay and non-pay will be made on the basis of nationally determined criteria.  Approved schools will have statutorily based entitlements to current funding on the basis of these criteria.</P>
    <P>In the context of the establishment of the REBs, funding mechanisms will be developed to ensure that all second level schools will be funded on an equitable and transparent basis.  Common criteria and entitlements will apply to the funding of schools at second level.  In this connection, I intend to establish a steering group to draw up a recommended funding framework which would ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector, while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five primary schools in County Meath employ full-time caretakers <Col N="1941" /> under a scheme introduced by my Department in 1979.  The arrangements for appointment to these positions, when fillable vacancies occur, is a matter for each individual board of management. The schools concerned are: St. Mary's N.S., Trim; Scoil Mhuire, Navan; St. Oliver Plunkett's N.S., Navan; St. Declan's N.S., Ashbourne, and St. Anne's N.S., Navan (on a shared basis with St. Joseph's N.S., Navan).</P>
    <P>The following 17 primary schools are in receipt of an additional capitation grant towards the cost of caretaking services. A school authority in applying the grant is free to determine hours to be worked, rates of pay and arrangements for recruitment.  These are as follows: Rathoath N.S., Rathoath; St. Michael's B.N.S., Trim; Convent of Mercy N.S, Kells; Oldcastle N.S., Oldcastle; Scoil Bríd, Cannistown, Navan; Dunboyne B.N.S., Dunboyne; Dunboyne G.N.S., Dunboyne; St. Colmcilles N.S., Navan Road, Kells; Bohermeen N.S., Bohermeen, Navan; O Gramhna N.S., Athboy; Dunshaughlin N.S.; Scoil Pádraig, Slane; SN an Spioraid Naomh C, Laytown; SN an Spioraid Naomh B, Laytown; St. Paul's N.S., Abbeylands, Navan; Scoil Mhuire, Ashbourne, and Gaelscoil na Cille, Ashbourne.</P>

      <i>Vocational Education Committee Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>The allocation of maintenance staff i.e., caretakers, attendants and cleaners in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis.  It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit.  The Department has sanctioned 9.5 caretaking posts for County Meath vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Per a Census Return of 1 July 1995 County Meath vocational education committee had allocated the caretaking posts as follows: Navan, one full-time; <Col N="1942" /> Athboy, one full-time; Dunshaughlin, one full-time; Longwood, one full-time; Nobber, one full-time; Oldcastle, two full-time; Trim, one full-time; Dunboyne, one part-time (20 hours * 52 weeks); and Old vocational school, Kells, one full-time, this building is used for Adult Education classes only.</P>
    <P>The filling of vacancies is by advertisement and open competition.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Secondary Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the additional capitation grant scheme introduced in 1992 my Department provides financial assistance towards the provision of caretaking services in secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more recognised pupils. Grants are paid to seven schools in County Meath as follows: St. Patrick's Classical School, Navan; St. Joseph's Secondary School, Navan; Scoil Naomh Iosaif, Athboy; Eureka Secondary School, Kells; Coláiste Mhichíl na mBráithre, Trim; Convent of Mercy, Trim.</P>

      <P>My objective, shared I know by all the Deputies in this House, is that there should be no early school leavers. However, overcoming early school leaving is a complex problem with roots in social and economic factors outside the school.  The removal of educational disadvantage is an international problem, which is proving persistently difficult for all developed countries.</P>
      <P>Finally, very significant strides have been made in retaining students in full-time second-level education up to completion of the senior cycle.  It is a fundamental objective of the White Paper, &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo;, that the rate of retention in school to completion of senior cycle should increase to 90 per cent by the end of the decade. Progress in the achievement of this target is being made steadily.  Rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent at present.</P>

      <P>I have sought the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment as to whether Stay Safe should be introduced as a separate programme at second level, as at primary, or whether the content of the primary Stay Safe programme should be suitably developed for second level schools and integrated into the relationships and sexuality education programme to be introduced at second level.  In the latter context, the appropriate issues would be incorporated into the safety issues element of relationships and sexuality education and placed in the context of social, personal and health education.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting the recommendations of the council on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose take Questions Nos. 239 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>I should start by saying that regardless of local opinions or feelings about this system the Garda have a duty to uphold the law.  How this is done is a matter for the Garda authorities.  I understand that the sequence of events was as follows.</P>
      <P>Cable Management Ireland Limited (CMIL) were granted a licence by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to install the system and received the necessary approval of Donegal County Council and An Bord Pleanála.  Telecom Éireann leased space on their communications mast at Alt na gCapall to the company to accommodate the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the entrance to this site had been picketed on a daily basis from 27 November 1995 by a group who were protesting against this type of system being introduced in the area.  When the gardaí were notified that personnel from the company concerned planned to visit the site on 6 December 1995, a local Garda officer went to Alt na gCapall, on 5 December 1995, and spoke to those picketing the entrance. <Col N="1948" /> The officer was assured that the picketers would conduct a peaceful protest and would not prevent company personnel or their equipment from gaining access to the site.</P>
    <P>However, on 6 December, when three company officials were accompanied to Alt na gCapall by gardaí, they were confronted by a group of 200 to 300 people. This group blocked the public road and prevented the gardaí and company vehicles from proceeding along the roadway.  One of the protesters had chained herself to a cattle grid at the entrance to the site and two tractors were positioned on the access road.  The gardaí were unable to persuade the protesters to allow the company officials through peaceably and the attempt to gain access was abandoned.</P>
    <P>CMIL personnel and equipment did in fact enter the site in the early hours of 13 December 1995 and installed the equipment without incident.  They were accompanied by sufficient gardaí to prevent any possible breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the extra cost of this operation over and above normal operational duty costs was £3,900.</P>

      <P>There are five medical doctors assigned on a part-time/sessional basis to Mountjoy Prison (male), two assigned on a part-time sharing basis to Mountjoy Prison (female) and one on a part-time basis to St. Patrick's Institution. An additional part-time post for the proposed drug treatment facility at <Col N="1949" /> Mountjoy Prison has also recently been advertised.  In addition, six psychiatrists from the Central Mental Hospital provide services on a sessional basis.</P>
      <P>Assessment of treatment needs for any prisoner, including drug addiction, is the responsibility of medical staff within the prisons.  As I have already announced, I am setting up a detoxification unit and a drugs-free unit within the Mountjoy Prison complex to provide a structured response to the problems presented by drug addicts in prison.  It is proposed that the detoxification unit and the drugs-free unit will be ready within the next few months.</P>

      <Quest>the current policy regarding the promised early release of Republican prisoners from Portlaoise Prison, County Laois; and if he intends to include Irish Republican Socialist Party, Republican Socialist Movement prisoners in the next group of prisoners to be released.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy in relation to the release of all prisoners is to consider each case on its merits, having regard to various criteria such as the nature of the offence, the length of sentence, the period served, conduct while in custody and, most importantly, whether the release is likely to pose any threat to the community.</P>
      <P>The decision by the leadership of the Provisional IRA to call a ceasefire in September 1994 and the continued observance of that ceasefire meant that the threat to the community likely to be posed by the release of individual offenders was reduced.  The ending of the ceasefire, equally, represents a significant development in terms of making threat assessment in individual cases.</P>
      <P>I should, of course, stress that the existence or non-existence of a ceasefire is not the only factor which would be relevant to the issue of threat assessment in individual cases.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the dealings referred to are an application for first registration based on possession and a transfer of part.  I understand that, due to their complicated nature, applications for first registration must be thoroughly investigated and take some time to process.</P>
      <P>I also understand that a mapping query issued to the applicants' solicitors on 22 November 1995 and a reply to this query is awaited.  In view of the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, I have arranged to have the dealing expedited on receipt of a reply to the query.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255 and 256 together.</P>
      <P>The drug treatment facility is scheduled to commence operations in April next at the Mountjoy Health Care Unit following the completion of extensive renovations necessitated by the fire at the unit last December.  Regarding conditions generally at the prison, there is a comprehensive, ongoing programme of renovations under way.  Searches are a standard procedure in respect of all prisoners entering and leaving the prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures introduced by me last year to counter the smuggling of drugs into the prisons included an improvement in the procedures for searching with the addition of a special search room.  These measures have proved very effective with a significant overall increase in the <Col N="1961" /> number of drug seizures.  Where considered necessary, some searches involve the removal by the prisoner, in stages, of his/her clothes which are then searched for contraband and returned immediately to the prisoner.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of needle exchange programmes and condoms to prisoners was considered in detail by the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in Prisons which reported in 1993.  The committee &mdash; the majority of whose recommendations have now been implemented &mdash; concluded that such an approach would be inappropriate in a prison setting and I concur with that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual prisoners' medical files are confidential in the context of the doctor/patient relationship and the information requested in respect of the number of prisoners who may be HIV positive is, therefore, not available.</P>
      <P>All prisoners including those who may be HIV positive have daily access to the full range of medical services, including psychological and psychiatric, both within the prisons and at outside hospitals as out-patients or, when necessary, as in-patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding measures to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS within the prisons, there is in place, in all of the institutions, a comprehensive integrated education programme.  This programme is aimed at raising awareness among prisoners of the facts about HIV and AIDS.  It is based on a multi-disciplinary approach utilising the most modern educational <Col N="1962" /> aids available including the specially commissioned award winning video &ldquo;HIV and Aids &mdash; The Facts&rdquo;.  Community based groups who are active in this field also regularly visit the prisons in order to contribute to the programme and to provide back-up in terms of information and assistance.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, he has given to relaxing the qualifying conditions for a non-contributory old age pension in view of the fact that the current means test discourages pensioners from keeping money in banks and building societies and encourages attacks on their homes.</Quest>

      <P>The function of the means test in social welfare assistance payments is to direct resources towards people in greatest need.  The means test applied in determining entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments (other than family home) held by the applicant.  The purpose of this assessment is to ascribe a notional value to the capital owned and, at present, different methods of assessment apply in the various social assistance schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions are currently being reviewed in my Department with a view to devising proposals for a standard method of assessment of capital for all social assistance payments.  In view of the substantial costs involved, however, any changes in this area would have to <Col N="1966" /> be considered in the context of available resources.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that at the end of last month I set up a Task Force on Security for the Elderly, the purpose of which is to make recommendations on how the security needs of low income pensioners can be addressed.  This task force has been asked to report to me by the end of this month.</P>

      <Quest>the reason participants on the community employment scheme cannot claim family income supplement particularly in view of the fact that they will be paying PAYE and PRSI as normal employees; the benefits, if any, the A1 contribution carries for CE employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme, the community employment development scheme and teamwork were amalgamated on 11 April 1994 into what is now known as community employment (CE).  CE is aimed at providing part-time employment to assist unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to re-enter the labour market.  The purpose of the family income supplement (FIS) scheme which is not an insurance-based scheme, on the other hand, is to create an incentive for people with families to take up or remain in paid full-time employment. Its purpose is essentially different from that of CE and to extend automatic entitlement of FIS to persons on CE would involve fundamental changes in the FIS scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CE weekly rates of payment are £81.30 for a single person and £116.85 for a person with an adult dependant.  A sum of £13.20 is payable in respect of each child dependant.  CE participants receive payments which are in excess of their entitlements under the unemployment assistance scheme.  For example, a CE participant with an adult dependant <Col N="1967" /> and two child dependants receives £143.25 per week, as against an entitlement under long-term unemployment assistance of £126.40 per week.  CE participants are also free to supplement their payments through earnings from work outside of their working hours on the programme.</P>
    <P>The earnings of CE participants will be subject to the full PRSI class A rate of contribution from next April.  Class A contributions provide cover for the full range of social insurance benefits and pensions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have in mind the question of readaptation aid from the EU for former Irish Steel employees, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty.  My Department has received recently a communication from the EU Commission in Brussels confirming that the Commission has approved grant aid amounting to ECU 376,806 for the 194 workers who were made redundant in 1994-95.  A number of aspects of the Commission's decision, and the conditions attached to the decision, have to be clarified by my Department before any payment can be made by the EU Commission.  My Department is in touch with the Commission and I hope that all matters will be clarified shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in relation to the cost and availability of motor insurance cover for young drivers is that motorists in the 17 to 24 age category have a significantly higher frequency of claims than other categories of motorists.  This is borne out by the findings of a survey undertaken by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board 1993. The survey found that, in the age groups examined (17-24, 25-30 and 30+), under <Col N="1976" /> both comprehensive and non-comprehensive cover, the frequency and average cost of claim in the 17-24 age group was significantly higher than in the other age categories.  Consequently, the difficulty in obtaining insurance cover experienced by the under 25 age group and the high cost of premiums charged for cover reflects the commercial reality of insurers' underwriting experience with young drivers as a high risk category.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, I have commissioned a study of the economic impact of insurance costs in Ireland and of the key contributory factors in this regard.  The study will incorporate an economic analysis of the market for private motorist insurance, including the segmentation of the market and the issue as to whether the premiums charged to higher risk categories, such as young drivers, has any adverse economic impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants will make recommendations based on their analysis and <Col N="1977" /> conclusions.  I am awaiting finalisation of the report by the consultants.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for dealing with industrial relations issues of this nature in FÁS rests with the management there and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene in the matter.  I understand, however, that negotiations on a programme for change are at an advanced stage.  As a result of progress in these negotiations, the union concerned has now agreed to recommend to its members to return to normal working.</P>

      <P>In 1994 approximately 230 organic producers were inspected by the three private organic inspection bodies viz.  Irish Organic Farmers and Growers' Association (IOFGA), Organic Trust Ltd. and Demeter Standards Ltd.  By 1995 the number of inspections carried out by the inspection bodies had increased by 60 per cent to approximately 370.  With this level of increase I feel that the target of 600 will be met by 1999 i.e. the final year of the operational programme referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might also be aware that the Organic Farming Supplementary <Col N="1978" /> Measure to the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) offers attractive financial incentives to farmers who convert to farming organically or continue to farm organically in accordance with a five year agri-environmental plan.  This measure, together with the operational programme, will provide the organic farming sector with a significant boost.</P>

      <P>An indicative amount of £1 million has been provided for the development of the organic farming sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture.  Rural <Col N="1979" /> Development and Forestry, 1994-99. Under the Scheme of Aid for the Development of the Organic Sector aid is available under two headings viz:</P>
      <P>(i)  marketing and promotion in support of organic farming;</P>
      <P>(ii)  grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the allocation of funding under this scheme, which was launched in July 1995.  To date, 20 applications for grant aid have been received, the bulk of them since November last.  So far, one grant approval for £21,000, of which £5,250 has been paid, has been issued in respect of a marketing and promotion project.  Processing of the other applications on hand will be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the funding available under the scheme will provide the organic farming sector with a significant boost in the areas of greatest needs viz. marketing, promotion and distribution of organic produce.</P>

      <P>The European Commission approved my proposals for a number of modifications to REPS in October 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These modifications included improved incentives in designated degraded commonage areas.  As a result, farmers in these areas, who join REPS, <Col N="1980" /> now have a number of improved payment options, which are geared towards creating sustainable farming systems and under which farmers can increase income by reducing sheep numbers.  As a result of the improved incentives, the original obligation to remove all sheep from these areas from 1 November to 30 April is now optional, the destocking limit of 30 per cent has been removed and a new group incentive has been introduced.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, recently held a series of information meetings to explain the improved incentives to the farmers in these areas.  A list of the areas to which this measure applies is attached for the Deputy's information.</P>
    <P>The improved incentives under REPS will help resolve the problem of overgrazing in these environmentally sensitive areas and I would urge farmers in such areas to look closely at the new options available under REPS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 275, 276 and 277 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, as stated in my presentation to the Committee on Sustainable Development, I support and have committed myself to the principle of sustainable forestry development but Ireland is not yet at the stage of full implementation. Preparation of a national plan for sustainable forestry under the Rio Forest Principles will be undertaken once the <Col N="1982" /> Strategy for the Development of the Forestry Sector has been published.</P>
    <P>The range of environmental controls on forestry development is outlined in the following list.  Other than in relation to continuing discussions with the Department of the Environment on planning permission and environmental impact assessment thresholds for forestry, no changes have been made pending, as I indicated at the time, the outcome of both the strategy (which will encompass environmental issues) and the national sustainable forestry plan.</P>
    <P>The certification of timber coming from sustainably managed resources, both tropical and temperate, is an issue which is receiving increasing attention internationally.  A Group on Certification has been established by the EU Directorate General on the Environment, on which my Department is represented.</P>
    <P>Certification is basically a market-based instrument and is not the only way to secure sustainable forest management. It is an extremely complex issue, raising matters such as the criteria for measuring sustainable management, reliable, comparable and independent certification, limited resources in some producing countries, tracing of timber from forest to finished product and possible trade discrimination, to name but a few.  Discussions in the EU Group show that consumer demand for timber from sustainably managed forests, and in particular tropical forests, has led to certification initiatives being undertaken in some member states, while in others (including Ireland) there is as yet no appreciable demand.  I intend to keep in touch with developments on certification, as they may have implications for trade in Irish timber.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Forest Service Environmental Controls on Forestry.</P>
    <P>The current arranagements for assessment of the environmental aspects of forestry are:</P>
    <P>1.  It is a condition of EU grant <Col N="1983" /> approval of the CAP Afforestation Programme that grants are not available for areas which are protected or qualify for protection under the EU Bird Directive or Habitat Directive.  Seventy-five areas are currently listed under the Bird Directive; no areas are as yet listed under the Habitats Directive.</P>
    <P>2.  It is a general condition of grant-aid that development is compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>3.  Under the Planning and Development Acts, an Environment Impact Assessment must be undertaken and planning permission obtained for initial afforestation over 200 hectares or for the replacement of more than 10 hectares of broadleaf high forest with conifers.</P>
    <P>4.  All projects must be submitted for grant approval before work begins, so that environmental factors can be taken into account.</P>
    <P>5.  Where environmental considerations are identified, other State agencies and local authorities are consulted in relation to</P>
    <P>&mdash;Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs), listed by the Wildlife Service</P>
    <P>&mdash;areas of landscape or amenity interest, with reference to the County Development Plans and the 1977 Inventory of Outstanding Landscapes,</P>
    <P>&mdash;areas of fisheries interest, with reference to the Regional Fisheries Boards,</P>
    <P>&mdash;areas of archaeological interest, with reference to the Sites and Monuments Records (SMRs) of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>6.  Published Guidelines on the Landscape, Fisheries and Archaeology must be implemented by grant-aid forestry.</P>
    <P>7.  Grant-aid is not available for planning within at least 30 metres of an occupied dwelling house or associated building (either the applicant's or another's) or within 10 metres of a public road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> Applications for grant assistance have been refused and proposed projects adjusted where the Department has seen fit to do so on environmental grounds.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 43 on 31 January last which deals with the issue of progress towards the goal of a fully accessible public transport system.  While it is now the policy that all new railway carriages and stations, together with the proposed light rail vehicles for Dublin, will be wheelchair accessible, it is not yet possible to make a similar commitment in respect of new buses as proposed by the Centre for Independent Living.  That organisation has also drawn up proposals for the &ldquo;Vantastic&rdquo; scheme to provide a dedicated transport service to cater specifically for the needs of the mobility impaired.  I should like to point out that I have no function in relation to specialised transport services of this kind, nor are there any funds at my disposal to support such projects.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent newspaper reports (details supplied) that a team of radiation experts at Bristol University, England, have obtained evidence that high voltage power cables might cause certain types of cancer; and the research results, if any, available on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent newspaper reports in relation to a possible link between high voltage overhead transmission lines, radon and lung cancer.  The study referred to in these reports by Professor Henshaw of Bristol University was only published for the first time on 14 February 1996 in the <i>International Journal of Radiation Biology.</i> As a consequence the scientific community has not had the opportunity to review these research results.</P>
      <P>I should point out however that the UK National Radiological Protection Board, which advises on both electromagnetic fields (EMF) and radon, has described the results of this study as &ldquo;implausible and purely speculative&rdquo;. They add that no biological mechanism has been established to indicate that electromagnetic fields can influence any of the accepted stages in the development of cancer and Professor Henshaw's report does not alter the position. The NRPB recommends no change in the electricity industry's practices.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has also cast considerable doubt on the conclusions of the study in question.</P>
      <P>To date over 11,000 studies and reports have been published in relation to EMF and health.  The consensus among all authoritative international and national review panels of scientific experts who have studied this body of literature, is that there is no convincing evidence that the electric and magnetic fields generated by overhead power lines or electrical apparatus are harmful to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest study will be incorporated <Col N="1988" /> into the existing body of scientific literature and will be assessed by the scientific community in combination with all other similar relevant studies.  It will thus be subjected to the full rigours of scientific analysis such as peer review, replication and verification.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will keep itself informed of the outcome of this rigorous scientific analysis and will monitor any further significant research carried out in this area.  Liaison will be maintained with the Department of Health and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in relation to the human health aspects and the results of the study referred to will be assessed in that context.</P>

      <P>In August 1990 the then Minister for Communications approved the transfer of the licence to provide cable television service to the Celbridge area of County Kildare to Cable Management Ireland Limited.  It is not intended to issue any competing licence at this time.  A condition of the licence is that the company must operate within technical conditions set down by my Department in order to ensure the quality of the signal. If a subscriber is unhappy with the quality of reception provided by the company they should contact the company directly in the first instance.  If they are <Col N="1989" /> unable to resolve the situation subscribers have recourse to my Department who will intervene on their behalf. However, while I ensure compliance with the technical specifications, I have no statutory function with regard to the day to day operations of the cable companies.</P>
      <P>With regard to consumer protection, the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is charged with advising consumers of their rights under relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>While I understand that there is a considerable degree of interest in a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme among personnel of the Permanent Defence Force, it is difficult at this time to predict how many personnel will wish to avail of the scheme.  I am confident, however, that it will make a significant contribution to the reduction in strength of 1,300 personnel which was decided last year by the Government.  The terms of the scheme have yet to be finalised.</P>

      <P>The EU Fisheries Council agreed in October 1995 to approve an overall financial package of some £168 million to facilitate further investment by member states in the five year period 1996-2000. The Council also agreed to ring fence an element of the overall budget which would uniquely be provided to Ireland to assist with the operating costs incurred in relation to fisheries surveillance in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the overall £156 million for capital investment in fisheries surveillance, Ireland is entitled to a higher rate of aid than the 35 per cent &mdash; 50 per cent range available to other member <Col N="1994" /> states.  At this point there is no allocation of the overall capital investment budget to individual member states.</P>
    <P>An indicative programme of broad expenditure proposals for the period covered by the package has been forwarded to the Commission.  I shall be bringing specific proposals to Government very shortly with a view to getting approval to begin substantive negotiations with the Commission on the programme details.  My objective is to secure the maximum EU rates of aid for the capital and operating resources identified as necessary to further enhance our fisheries surveillance programmes.</P>

      <P>In August 1995, the Ministers for the Marine, Environment and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht commissioned a <Col N="1995" /> major study on Coastal Zone Management (CZM) in Ireland.  The study is intended to provide a key input to the formulation of national CZM policy.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in relation to reviewing available data on the coastal zone, legislative and administrative aspects and international developments.  In addition, a comprehensive programme of consultation with Government Departments and State agencies, local authorities and other organisations, bodies and individuals with an interest in the management of the coastal zone has taken place.  The consultants are due to report at the end of March 1996.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that there are no plans in place to abolish the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>A fundamental overhaul of marine policy was initiated last year with a view to tapping the full potential of the marine sector.  This includes a major review of the organisational and management structure of the Fishery Service.</P>
      <P>This review, which is being undertaken at present by consultants, involves an examination of the institutional framework for the development and regulation of the inland fisheries, sea fisheries and aquaculture sectors and will include recommendations on measures to improve the coherence and efficiency of the delivery of public policies and services to those sectors.  The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards are encompassed by this review.</P>
